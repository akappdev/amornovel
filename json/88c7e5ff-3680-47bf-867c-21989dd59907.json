Don\u2019t panic. I\u2019m in charge. I, Rebecca Brandon (n\u00e9e Bloomwood), am the adult. Not my two-year-old daughter.</p><p>Only I\u2019m not sure she realizes this.</p><p>\u2018Minnie, darling, give me the pony.\u2019 I try to sound calm and assured, like Nanny Sue off the telly.</p> <p>\u2018Poneeee.\u2019 Minnie grips the toy pony more tightly.</p><p>\u2018No pony.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mine!\u2019 she cries hysterically. \u2018Miiiine poneee!\u2019</p><p>Aargh. I\u2019m holding about a million shopping bags, my face is sweating, and I could really do without this.</p><p>It was all going so well. I\u2019ve been round the whole shopping mall and bought all the last little things on my Christmas list. Minnie and I were heading towards Santa\u2019s Grotto, and I only stopped for a moment to look at a dolls\u2019 house. Whereupon Minnie grabbed a toy pony off the display and refused to put it back. And now I\u2019m in the middle of Pony-gate.</p> <p>A mother in J Brand skinny jeans with an impeccably dressed daughter walks past, giving me the Mummy Once-over, and I flinch. Since I had Minnie, I\u2019ve learned that the Mummy Once-over is even more savage than the Manhattan Once-over. In the Mummy Once-over, they don\u2019t just assess and price your clothes to the nearest penny in one sweeping glance. Oh no. They also take in your child\u2019s clothes, pram brand, nappy bag, snack choice and whether your child is smiling, snotty or screaming.</p><p>Which I know is a lot to take in, in a one-second glance, but believe me, mothers are multi-taskers.</p><p>Minnie definitely scores top marks for her outfit. (Dress: one-off Danny Kovitz; coat: Rachel Riley; shoes: Baby Dior.) And I\u2019ve got her safely strapped into her toddler reins (Bill Amberg leather, really cool, they were in Vogue). But instead of smiling angelically like the little girl in the photoshoot, she\u2019s straining against them like a bull waiting to dash into the ring. Her eyebrows are knitted in fury, her cheeks are bright pink and she\u2019s drawing breath to shriek again.</p><p>\u2018Minnie.\u2019 I let go of the reins and put my arms round her so that she feels safe and secure, just like Nanny Sue recommends in her book, Taming Your Tricky Toddler. I bought it the other day, to have a flick through. Just out of idle interest. I mean, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m having problems with Minnie or anything. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s difficult. Or \u2018out of control and wilful\u2019, like that stupid teacher at the toddler music group said. (What does she know? She can\u2019t even play the triangle properly.)</p><p>The thing about Minnie is, she\u2019s ... spirited. She has firm opinions about things. Like jeans (she won\u2019t wear them), or carrots (she won\u2019t eat them). And right now her firm opinion is that she should have a toy pony.</p><p>\u2018Minnie darling, I love you very much,\u2019 I say in a gentle, crooning voice, \u2018and it would make me very happy if you gave me the pony. That\u2019s right, give it to Mummy ...\u2019 I\u2019ve nearly done it. My fingers are closing around the pony\u2019s head ...</p> <p>Ha. Skills. I\u2019ve got it. I can\u2019t help looking around to see if anyone\u2019s observed my expert parenting.</p><p>\u2018Miiiine!\u2019 Minnie wrenches the pony out of my arms and makes a run for it across the shop floor. Shit.</p><p>\u2018Minnie! MINNIE!\u2019 I yell.</p><p>I grab my carrier bags and leg it furiously after Minnie, who has already disappeared into the Action Man section. God, I don\u2019t know why we bother training up all these athletes for the Olympics. We should just field a team of toddlers.</p><p>As I catch up with her, I\u2019m panting. I really have to start my post-natal exercises sometime.</p><p>\u2018Give me the pony!\u2019 I try to take it, but she\u2019s gripping it like a limpet.</p><p>\u2018Mine poneee!\u2019 Her dark eyes flash at me with a resolute glint. Sometimes I look at Minnie and she\u2019s so like her father it gives me a jolt.</p><p>Speaking of which, where is Luke? We were supposed to be doing Christmas shopping together. As a family. But he disappeared an hour ago, muttering something about a call he had to make, and I haven\u2019t seen him since. He\u2019s probably sitting somewhere having a civilized cappuccino over the newspaper. Typical.</p> <p>\u2018Minnie, we\u2019re not buying it,\u2019 I say in my best firm manner. \u2018You\u2019ve got lots of toys already and you don\u2019t need a pony.\u2019</p><p>A woman with straggly dark hair, grey eyes and toddlers in a twin-buggy shoots me an approving nod. I can\u2019t help giving her the Mummy Once-over myself, and she\u2019s one of those mothers who wears Crocs over nubbly home-made socks. (Why would you do that? Why?)</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s monstrous, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 she says. \u2018Those ponies are forty pounds! My kids know better than to even ask,\u2019 she adds, shooting a glance at her two boys, who are slumped silently, thumbs in mouths. \u2018Once you give in to them, that\u2019s the beginning of the end. I\u2019ve got mine well trained.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Show off.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 I say in dignified tones. \u2018I couldn\u2019t agree more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Some parents would just buy their kid that pony for a quiet life. No discipline. It\u2019s disgusting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Terrible,\u2019 I agree, and make a surreptitious swipe for the pony, which Minnie adeptly dodges. Damn.</p> <p>\u2018The biggest mistake is giving in to them.\u2019 The woman is regarding Minnie with a pebble-like gaze. \u2018That\u2019s what starts the rot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I never give in to my daughter,\u2019 I say briskly. \u2018You\u2019re not getting the pony, Minnie, and that\u2019s final.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Poneeee!\u2019 Minnie\u2019s wails turn to heart-rending sobs. She is such a drama queen. (She gets it from my mum.)</p><p>\u2018Good luck, then.\u2019 The woman moves off. \u2018Happy Christmas.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Minnie, stop it!\u2019 I hiss furiously as soon as she\u2019s disappeared. \u2018You\u2019re embarrassing both of us! What do you want a stupid pony for, anyway?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Poneeee!\u2019 She\u2019s cuddling the pony to her as though it\u2019s her long-lost faithful pet that was sold at market five hundred miles away and has just stumbled back to the farm, footsore and whickering for her.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just a silly toy,\u2019 I say impatiently. \u2018What\u2019s so special about it, anyway?\u2019</p><p>And for the first time I look properly at the pony.</p><p>Wow. Actually ... it is pretty fab. It\u2019s made of painted white wood with little glittery stars all over, and has the sweetest hand-painted face. And it has little red trundly wheels.</p><p>\u2018You really don\u2019t need a pony, Minnie,\u2019 I say \u2013 but with slightly less conviction than before. I\u2019ve just noticed the saddle. Is that genuine leather? And it has a proper bridle with buckles and the mane is made of real horse hair. And it comes with a grooming set!</p><p>For forty quid this isn\u2019t bad value at all. I push one of the little red wheels, and it spins round perfectly. And now I think about it, Minnie doesn\u2019t actually have a toy pony. It\u2019s quite an obvious gap in her toy cupboard.</p> <p>I mean, not that I\u2019m going to give in.</p><p>\u2018It winds up, too,\u2019 comes a voice behind me, and I turn to see an elderly sales assistant approaching us. \u2018There\u2019s a key in the base. Look!\u2019</p><p>She winds the key, and both Minnie and I watch, mesmerized, as the pony starts rising and falling in a carousel motion, while tinkly music plays.</p><p>Oh my God, I love this pony.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s on special Christmas offer at forty pounds,\u2019 the assistant adds. \u2018Normally, this would retail for seventy. They\u2019re handmade in Sweden.\u2019</p><p>Nearly 50 per cent off. I knew it was good value. Didn\u2019t I say it was good value?</p><p>\u2018You like it, don\u2019t you, dear?\u2019 The assistant smiles at Minnie, who beams back, her stroppiness vanished. In fact, I don\u2019t want to boast, but she looks pretty adorable with her red coat and dark pigtails and dimpled cheeks. \u2018So, would you like to buy one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... um ...\u2019 I clear my throat.</p> <p>Come on, Becky. Say no. Be a good parent. Walk away.</p><p>My hand steals out and strokes the mane again.</p><p>But it\u2019s so gorgeous. Look at its dear little face. And a pony isn\u2019t like some stupid craze, is it? You\u2019d never get tired of a pony. It\u2019s a classic. It\u2019s, like, the Chanel jacket of toys.</p><p>And it\u2019s Christmas. And it\u2019s on special offer. And who knows, Minnie might turn out to have a gift for riding, it suddenly occurs to me. A toy pony might be just the spur she needs. I have a sudden vision of her aged twenty, wearing a red jacket, standing by a gorgeous horse at the Olympics, saying to the TV cameras, \u2018It all began one Christmas, when I received the gift that changed my life ...\u2019</p><p>My mind is going round and round like a computer processing DNA results, trying to find a match. There has to be a way in which I can simultaneously: 1. Not give in to Minnie\u2019s tantrum, 2. Be a good parent and 3. Buy the pony. I need some clever blue-sky solution like Luke is always paying business consultants scads of money to come up with ...</p><p>And then the answer comes to me. A totally genius idea which I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve never had before. I haul out my phone and text Luke:</p><p>Luke! Have just had a really good thought. I think Minnie should get pocket money.</p><p>Immediately a reply pings back: Wtf? Why?</p><p>So she can buy things, of course! I start to type \u2013 then think again. I delete the text and carefully type instead:</p><p>Children need to learn about finance from early age. Read it in article. Empowers them and gives responsibility.</p><p>A moment later Luke texts: Can\u2019t we just buy her the FT? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shut up, I type.

What\u2019s she supposed to buy with that?</p><p>And we\u2019ll never afford the pony on 10p a week.</p> <p>50p a week, I type firmly, is national average. (He\u2019ll never check.) Where r u anyway? Nearly time for Father Christmas!!</p><p>OK, whatever. I\u2019ll be there, comes the reply.</p><p>Result! As I put away my phone, I\u2019m doing a quick mental calculation. 50p a week for two years makes \u00a352. Easily enough. God, why on earth have I never thought of pocket money before? It\u2019s perfect! It\u2019s going to add a whole new dimension to our shopping trips.</p><p>I turn to Minnie, feeling rather proud of myself.</p><p>\u2018Now listen, darling,\u2019 I announce. \u2018I\u2019m not going to buy this pony for you, because I\u2019ve already said no. But as a special treat, you can buy it for yourself out of your own pocket money. Isn\u2019t that exciting?\u2019</p> <p>Minnie eyes me uncertainly. I\u2019ll take that as a yes.</p><p>\u2018As you\u2019ve never spent any of your pocket money, you\u2019ve got two years\u2019 worth, which is plenty. You see how great saving is?\u2019 I add brightly. \u2018You see how fun it is?\u2019</p><p>As we walk to the check-out I feel totally smug. Talk about responsible parenting. I\u2019m introducing my child to the principles of financial planning at an early age. I could be a guru on TV myself! Super Becky\u2019s Guide to Fiscally Responsible Parenting. I could wear different boots in each episode\u2014</p><p>\u2018Wagon.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m jolted out of my daydream to see that Minnie has dropped the pony and is now clutching a pink plastic monstrosity. Where did she get that? It\u2019s Winnie\u2019s Wagon, from that cartoon show.</p><p>\u2018Wagon?\u2019 She raises her eyes hopefully.</p> <p>What?</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re not getting the wagon, darling,\u2019 I say patiently. \u2018You wanted the pony. The lovely pony, remember?\u2019</p><p>Minnie surveys the pony with total indifference. \u2018Wagon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pony!\u2019 I grab the pony off the floor.</p><p>This is so frustrating. How can she be so fickle? She definitely gets that trait from Mum.</p><p>\u2018Wagon!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pony!\u2019 I cry, more loudly than I meant to, and brandish the pony at her. \u2018I want the poneee\u2014\u2019</p><p>Suddenly I get a prickly-neck feeling. I look round to see the woman with toddler boys, standing a few yards away, staring at me with her pebble-like eyes.</p> <p>\u2018I mean ...\u2019 I hastily lower the pony, my cheeks burning. \u2018Yes, you may buy the pony out of your pocket money. Basic financial planning,\u2019 I add briskly to the pebble-eyed woman. \u2018What we learned today is that you have to save up before you can buy things, didn\u2019t we, darling? Minnie\u2019s spent all her pocket money on the pony, and it was a very good choice ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve found the other pony!\u2019 The assistant suddenly appears again, breathless and carrying a dusty box. \u2018I knew we had one left in the stock room. They were originally a pair, you see ...\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s another pony?</p><p>I can\u2019t help gasping as she draws it out. It\u2019s midnight blue with a raven mane, speckled with stars, and with golden wheels. It\u2019s absolutely stunning. It complements the other one perfectly. Oh God, we have to have them both. We have to.</p><p>Rather annoyingly, the pebble-eyed woman is still standing there with her buggy, watching us.</p><p>\u2018Shame you\u2019ve spent all your pocket money, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 she says to Minnie with one of those tight, unfriendly smiles which proves she never has any fun or sex. You can always tell that about people, I find.</p><p>\u2018Yes, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I say politely. \u2018That\u2019s a problem. So we\u2019ll just have to think of a solution.\u2019 I think hard for a moment, then turn to Minnie.</p><p>\u2018Darling, here\u2019s your second important lesson in financial planning. Sometimes, when we see an amazing, one-off bargain, we can make an exception to the saving-up rule. It\u2019s called \u201cSeizing the Opportunity\u201d.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re just going to buy it?\u2019 says the woman in tones of disbelief.</p><p>What business is it of hers? God, I hate other mothers. They always have to butt in. The minute you have a child it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve turned into a box on an internet site, saying \u2018Please add all your rude and offensive comments here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I\u2019m not going to buy it,\u2019 I say, a little stonily. \u2018She\u2019ll have to get it out of her own pocket money. Darling,\u2019 I crouch down to get Minnie\u2019s attention, \u2018if you pay for the other pony out of your pocket money at 50p a week, it\u2019ll take about ... sixty weeks. You\u2019ll have to have an advance. Like an \u201coverdraft\u201d.\u2019 I enunciate clearly. \u2018So you\u2019ll basically have spent all your pocket money till you\u2019re three and a half. All right?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Minnie looks a bit bewildered. But then, I expect I looked a bit bewildered when I took out my first overdraft. It goes with the territory.</p><p>\u2018All sorted.\u2019 I beam at the assistant and hand over my Visa card. \u2018We\u2019ll take both ponies, thank you. You see, darling?\u2019 I add to Minnie. \u2018The lesson we\u2019ve learned today is: never give up on something you really want. However impossible things seem, there\u2019s always a way.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling proud of myself, imparting this nugget of wisdom. That\u2019s what parenting\u2019s all about. Teaching your child the ways of the world.</p><p>\u2018You know, I once found the most amazing opportunity,\u2019 I add as I punch in my PIN. \u2018It was a pair of Dolce &amp; Gabbana boots at 90 per cent off! Only my credit card was up to my limit. But did I give up? No! Of course I didn\u2019t!\u2019</p> <p>Minnie is listening as avidly as though I\u2019m recounting The Three Bears.</p><p>\u2018I went round my flat, and searched in all my pockets and bags, and I collected up all my little coins ... and guess what?\u2019 I pause for effect. \u2018I had enough money! I could get the boots! Hooray!\u2019</p><p>Minnie claps her hands, and to my delight, the toddler boys start cheering raucously.</p><p>\u2018Do you want to hear another story?\u2019 I beam at them. \u2018Do you want to hear about the sample sale in Milan? I was walking along the street one day, when I saw this mysterious sign.\u2019 I open my eyes wide. \u2018And what do you think it said?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ridiculous.\u2019 The pebble-eyed woman turns her buggy with an abrupt gesture. \u2018Come on, it\u2019s time to go home.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Story!\u2019 wails one of the boys.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re not hearing the story,\u2019 she snaps. \u2018You\u2019re insane,\u2019 she adds over her shoulder as she strides off. \u2018No wonder your child\u2019s so spoiled. What are those little shoes of hers then, Gucci?\u2019</p><p>Spoiled?</p><p>Blood zings to my face and I stare at her in speechless shock. Where did that come from? Minnie is not spoiled!</p><p>And Gucci don\u2019t even make shoes like that.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s not spoiled!\u2019 I manage at last.</p> <p>But the woman has already disappeared behind the Postman Pat display. Well, I\u2019m certainly not going to run after her and yell, \u2018At least my child doesn\u2019t just loll in her buggy sucking her thumb all day, and by the way, have you ever thought about wiping your children\u2019s noses?\u2019</p><p>Because that wouldn\u2019t be a good example to Minnie.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Minnie.\u2019 I try to compose myself. \u2018Let\u2019s go and see Father Christmas. Then we\u2019ll feel better.\u2019</p><p>TWO</p><p>There\u2019s no way on earth Minnie\u2019s spoiled. No way.</p><p>OK, so she has her little moments. Like we all do. But she\u2019s not spoiled. I would know if she was spoiled. I\u2019m her mother.</p><p>Still, all the way to Santa\u2019s Grotto I feel ruffled. How can anyone be so mean? And on Christmas Eve, too.</p><p>\u2018You just show everyone how well behaved you are, darling,\u2019 I murmur determinedly to Minnie as we walk along, hand-in-hand. \u2018You just be a little angel for Father Christmas, OK?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Jingle Bells\u2019 is playing over the tannoy and I can\u2019t help cheering up as we get near. I used to come to this exact same Santa\u2019s Grotto when I was a little girl.</p><p>\u2018Look, Minnie!\u2019 I point excitedly. \u2018Look at the reindeer! Look at all the presents!\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a sleigh and two life-size reindeer and fake snow everywhere and lots of girls dressed as elves in green costumes, which is a new touch. At the entrance I can\u2019t help blinking in surprise at the elf who greets us with a tanned cleavage. Is Father Christmas finding his elves at glamour model agencies these days? And should elves have purple acrylic nails?</p><p>\u2018Merry Christmas!\u2019 she greets us and stamps my ticket. \u2018Be sure to visit our Christmas Wishing Well and put in your Christmas Wish. Father Christmas will be reading them later on!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you hear that, Minnie? We can make a wish!\u2019 I look down at Minnie, who\u2019s gazing up at the elf in silent awe.</p><p>You see? She\u2019s behaving perfectly.</p><p>\u2018Becky! Over here!\u2019 I turn my head to see Mum already in the queue, wearing a festive twinkly scarf and holding the handles of Minnie\u2019s buggy, which is laden with bags and packages. \u2018Father Christmas just went for his tea break,\u2019 she adds as we join her. \u2018So I think we\u2019ll be another half an hour at least. Dad\u2019s gone off to look for camcorder discs and Janice is buying her Christmas cards.\u2019</p><p>Janice is Mum\u2019s next-door neighbour. She buys all her Christmas cards half-price on Christmas Eve, writes them out on January the first and keeps them in a drawer for the rest of the year. She calls it \u2018getting ahead of herself\u2019. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Now, love, will you take a look at my present for Jess?\u2019 Mum rootles in a bag and anxiously produces a wooden box. \u2018Is it all right?\u2019</p><p>Jess is my sister. My half-sister, I should say. She\u2019s coming back from Chile in a few days\u2019 time, so we\u2019re going to have a second Christmas Day for her and Tom, with turkey and presents and everything!

(Jess is going to be a godmother.) But I can see why Mum\u2019s stressed out. It\u2019s tricky buying presents for Jess. She doesn\u2019t like anything that\u2019s new or expensive or contains plastic or parabens or comes in a bag that isn\u2019t made of hemp.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve bought this.\u2019 Mum opens the lid of the box to reveal an array of posh glass bottles nestling in straw. \u2018It\u2019s shower gel,\u2019 she adds quickly. \u2018Nothing for the bath. We don\u2019t want World War Three again!\u2019</p><p>There was this slight diplomatic incident last time Jess was over. We were celebrating her birthday and Janice gave her a present of bubble bath, whereupon Jess launched into a ten-minute lecture on how much water a bath used and how people in the West were obsessed by cleanliness and everyone should just take a five-minute shower once every week like Jess and Tom did.</p><p>Janice and Martin had just had a jacuzzi installed, so this didn\u2019t go down very well.</p><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 says Mum.</p> <p>\u2018Dunno.\u2019 I peer cautiously at the label on the box. \u2018Does it have additives? Does it exploit people?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, love, I just don\u2019t know.\u2019 Mum looks gingerly at the box as though it\u2019s a nuclear armament. \u2018It says \u201call-natural\u201d,\u2019 she ventures at last. \u2018That\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think it\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 I nod. \u2018But don\u2019t tell her you bought it in a shopping mall. Tell her you bought it from a small independent cooperative.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good idea.\u2019 Mum brightens. \u2018And I\u2019ll wrap it in newspaper. What have you got her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I bought her a yoga mat hand-made by peasant women in Guatemala,\u2019 I can\u2019t help saying smugly. \u2018It funds village agricultural projects and it uses recycled plastic components from computers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky!\u2019 says Mum admiringly. \u2018How did you find that?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh ... research.\u2019 I shrug airily.</p><p>I won\u2019t admit I Googled \u2018green worthy present recycle environment lentils giftwrap\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Kiss-mas! Kiss-MAS!\u2019 Minnie is dragging at my hand so hard I think she\u2019ll pull my arm off.</p><p>\u2018Do the Wishing Well with Minnie, love,\u2019 suggests Mum. \u2018I\u2019ll keep your place.\u2019</p><p>I dump the ponies on the buggy and lead Minnie towards the Wishing Well. It\u2019s surrounded by fake silver birch trees with fairies hanging down from the branches and if it weren\u2019t for the screeching kids everywhere it would be quite magical.</p><p>The wishing cards are laid out on a fake tree stump that you can use as a table. I pick up a card, which has \u2018Christmas Wish\u2019 printed in swirly green writing at the top, and give one of the felt-tips to Minnie.</p><p>God, I remember writing letters to Father Christmas when I was little. They used to get quite long and involved, with illustrations and pictures cut out of catalogues, just in case he got confused.</p><p>A pair of pink-faced girls of about ten are posting their wishes, all giggly and whispery, and just the sight of them gives me a rush of nostalgia. It seems wrong not to join in. I might jinx it or something.</p> <p>Dear Father Christmas, I find myself writing on a card. It\u2019s Becky here again. I pause, and think for a bit, and then quickly scribble down a few things.</p><p>I mean, only about three. I\u2019m not greedy or anything.</p><p>Minnie is scribbling earnestly all over her card, and has got felt-tip on her hands and her nose.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure Father Christmas will understand what you mean,\u2019 I say gently, taking it from her. \u2018Let\u2019s post it in the well.\u2019</p><p>One by one I drop the two cards in. Tiny fake snowflakes are drifting down from above and \u2018Winter Wonderland\u2019 is being piped out of a nearby speaker and I suddenly feel so Christmassy I can\u2019t help closing my eyes, clenching Minnie\u2019s hand and wishing. You never know ...</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 A deep voice penetrates my thoughts and my eyes snap open. Luke is standing in front of me, his dark hair and navy coat dusted with fake snow, a glint of amusement in his eyes. Too late I realize I\u2019ve been fervently mouthing \u2018Please ... please ...\u2019 with my eyes squeezed shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I say, a bit flustered. \u2018Hi. I was just ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Talking to Father Christmas?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u2019 I regain my dignity. \u2018Where\u2019ve you been, anyway?\u2019</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t answer me, but starts walking away, beckoning for me to follow.</p> <p>\u2018Leave Minnie with your mother a moment,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve got something to show you.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve been married to Luke for three and a half years now, but I still don\u2019t always know the way his mind is working. As we stride along his mouth is hard, and I almost start to feel nervous. What could it be?</p><p>\u2018Here.\u2019 He comes to a halt in a deserted corner of the shopping mall, and gets out his BlackBerry.</p><p>On the screen is an email from his lawyer, Tony. It consists of a single word: \u2018Settled\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Settled?\u2019 For a split second I don\u2019t understand \u2013 then I have a sudden flash of realization.</p> <p>\u2018Not \u2013 Arcodas? They\u2019ve settled?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 And now I can see a tiny smile glimmering.</p><p>\u2018But \u2013 you never said ... I had no idea ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t want to raise your hopes. We\u2019ve been talking for three weeks. It\u2019s not the greatest deal for us ... but it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll be fine. The point is, it\u2019s done.\u2019</p><p>My legs feel a bit shaky. It\u2019s over. Just like that. The Arcodas case has been hanging over us for so long it\u2019s started to feel part of the family. (Not a good part, obviously. The malevolent old witchy aunt with the warty nose and the nasty cackle.)</p><p>It\u2019s two years since Luke went into battle with Arcodas. I say \u2018battle\u2019. It wasn\u2019t like he firebombed them or anything. He just refused to work for them, on a matter of principle: the principle being that he didn\u2019t want to represent a load of bullies who mistreated his staff. He owns a PR company, Brandon Communications, and has had most of his employees for years. When he found out the way Arcodas had been behaving to them, I\u2019ve never seen him so angry.</p> <p>So he quit, and they took him to court for breach of contract. (Which just proves how awful and overbearing they are.) Whereupon Luke took them to court for not paying for the services they\u2019d already received.</p><p>You\u2019d have thought the judge would have realized who was the good guy instantly and ruled in Luke\u2019s favour. I mean, hello, don\u2019t judges have eyes? But instead they\u2019ve had stupid hearings and adjournments and the whole thing has dragged on, and been totally stressy. I have to say, my opinion of lawyers, judges, so-called \u2018mediators\u2019 and the whole legal system is a lot lower after all this. Which I would have told them, if they\u2019d only let me speak.</p><p>I was dying for Luke to call me as a witness. I had my outfit ready and everything. (Navy pencil skirt, white shirt with ruffle, patent courts.) And I\u2019d written this brilliant speech, which I still know by heart. It begins: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to look into your hearts. And then I ask you to look at the two men before you. One honourable, upstanding hero who puts the well-being of his staff before money ...\u2019 (where I would point at Luke), \u2018... and one odious, sexist man who bullies everyone and has as much integrity as he does dress sense ...\u2019 (where I would point at Iain Wheeler from Arcodas). Everyone would have been stirred up and cheered and the judge would have had to bang his gavel and cry \u2018Order! Order!\u2019 And then I was going to cunningly assess the jury, like they do in John Grisham novels, and work out which ones were on our side.</p><p>Anyway, all my plans were spoiled when Luke said there wasn\u2019t going to be a jury, it wasn\u2019t that kind of court. And then he said it was a murky swamp full of dirty tricks and he\u2019d be damned if I got dragged into all this too and I should stay at home with Minnie. So I did, even though the frustration nearly killed me.</p><p>Now Luke exhales and pushes his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u2018Over,\u2019 he says, almost to himself. \u2018At last.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank God.\u2019</p><p>As I reach up to hug him, I can see traces of weariness in his face still. This whole thing has nearly wiped Luke out. He\u2019s been trying to run his company, and deal with the case, and keep his staff motivated, and win new business.</p> <p>\u2018So.\u2019 He puts his hands on my shoulders and surveys me. \u2018We can start to move on. In all sorts of ways.\u2019</p><p>It takes me a moment to realize what he means.</p><p>\u2018We can buy the house!\u2019 I catch my breath.</p><p>\u2018I put in the offer straight away.\u2019 He nods. \u2018They said they\u2019d give an answer by the end of the day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh my God!\u2019 I can\u2019t help giving a little jump of excitement. I can\u2019t believe this is all happening at last. The case is over! We can finally move out of Mum and Dad\u2019s and have our own family home! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019ve tried to move out before. In fact, several times. We\u2019ve got as far as drawing up contracts for four houses in all, but each one has been doomed. Either the vendor didn\u2019t really want to sell (House Three), or they suddenly demanded loads more money (House One), or the house didn\u2019t actually belong to them but to their uncle in Spain and it was all a scam (House Four), or it burned down (House Two). I\u2019d started to think we were jinxed, and then Luke said maybe we should wait till the Arcodas business was over.</p><p>\u2018Lucky Five?\u2019 I raise my eyes hopefully towards Luke, who just crosses his fingers and grins.</p><p>This house has got everything going for it. It\u2019s in a brilliant road in Maida Vale, and it has a lovely garden with a swing hanging from a tree, and is amazingly spacious inside. And it\u2019s nearly ours! I feel a sudden burst of exhilaration. I have to go and buy Livingetc, right now. And Elle Deco, and House &amp; Garden and Wallpaper* ...</p><p>\u2018Shall we get back?\u2019 I say casually. \u2018I might just pop into Smith\u2019s on the way and pick up a few magazines ...\u2019</p> <p>And I\u2019d better get Grand Designs, and World of Interiors, and 25 Beautiful Homes ...</p><p>\u2018In a minute.\u2019 Something about Luke\u2019s voice alerts me, and I look up to see he\u2019s taken a few paces away. His face is averted and his chin is stiff. Something doesn\u2019t look right about him.</p><p>\u2018Hey, are you OK?\u2019 I say cautiously. \u2018There\u2019s no bad news, is there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. But there\u2019s something I wanted to ... run past you.\u2019 He pauses, his hands cradling the back of his neck, his gaze distant, almost as though he can\u2019t bring himself to look at me. \u2018Weird thing happened a few moments ago. I was in Waterstones, waiting for the call about Arcodas. Just wandering around ...\u2019 He pauses again, for a long time. \u2018And I found myself buying a book for Annabel. The new Ruth Rendell. She\u2019d have loved it.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a moment. I don\u2019t know how to respond.</p> <p>\u2018Luke ...\u2019 I begin tentatively.</p><p>\u2018I bought a bloody Christmas present for her.\u2019 He squeezes his fists into his temples. \u2018Am I going nuts?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you\u2019re not going nuts! You\u2019re just ...\u2019 I break off helplessly, wishing I had something wise and profound to say; trying desperately to remember bits from that book on bereavement I bought.</p><p>Because that\u2019s the other awful thing that happened this year. Luke\u2019s step-mum died in May. She was only ill for a month and then she was gone and it absolutely hit Luke for six.</p><p>I know Annabel wasn\u2019t his biological mother \u2013 but she was his true mum. She brought him up, and she understood him like no one else, and the worst thing is, he hardly saw her before she died. Even when she was really ill, he couldn\u2019t drop everything and rush to Devon because he had Arcodas hearings in London and they\u2019d been adjourned so many times already it was impossible to delay again.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. I\u2019ve told him so a million times. There was nothing he could do. But even so, I know he does. And now his dad is in Australia with his sister, so Luke can\u2019t even make up by spending time with him.</p> <p>As for his real mother ... we don\u2019t even mention her.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>Luke\u2019s always had a pretty love-hate relationship with Elinor. It makes sense, since she abandoned him and his dad when Luke was tiny. But he was on fairly civil terms with her when she blew it, big time.</p><p>It was around the time of the funeral, when he\u2019d gone to see her for some family business reason. I still don\u2019t know exactly what she said to him. Something about Annabel. Something insensitive and probably downright rude, I\u2019m guessing. He\u2019s never told me exactly, or even referred to the incident again \u2013 all I know is, I\u2019ve never seen him so white; so catatonic with fury. And now we never even mention Elinor\u2019s name any more. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever reconcile with her, his whole life. Which is fine by me.</p><p>As I look up at Luke I feel a little squeeze in my heart. The strain of this year has really hit him hard. He\u2019s got two little lines between his eyes which he doesn\u2019t lose even when he smiles or laughs. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t ever look 100 per cent happy.</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019 I put my arm through his and squeeze it tight. \u2018Let\u2019s go and see Father Christmas.\u2019</p><p>As we\u2019re walking along, I casually steer Luke to the other side of the mall. No reason, really. Just because the shops are nicer to look at. Like the bespoke jewellers ... and that shop with the silk flowers ... and Enfant Cocotte, which is full of hand-made rocking horses and designer wenge cribs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My pace has slowed right down and I take a step towards the brightly lit window, full of creeping lust. Look at all these gorgeous things. Look at the tiny rompers, and the little blankets.</p><p>If we had another baby, we could get all new lovely blankets. And it would be all snuffly and cute and Minnie could help to wheel it in the pram, and we\u2019d be a real family ...</p><p>I glance up at Luke to see if perhaps he\u2019s thinking the same thing as me and will meet my eyes with a soft, loving gaze. But instead, he\u2019s frowning at something on his BlackBerry. Honestly. Why isn\u2019t he more tuned in to my thoughts? We\u2019re supposed to be married, aren\u2019t we? He should understand me. He should realize why I\u2019ve led him to a baby shop.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s sweet, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I point at a teddy-bear mobile.</p> <p>\u2018Mm-hmm.\u2019 Luke nods without even looking up.</p><p>\u2018Wow, look at that pram!\u2019 I point longingly at an amazing-looking hi-tech contraption with bouncy wheels that look like they came off a Hummer. \u2018Isn\u2019t it great?\u2019</p><p>If we had another baby we could buy another pram. I mean, we\u2019d have to. The crappy old pram Minnie had is completely bust. (Not that I want another baby just to get a cool pram, obviously. But it would be an added bonus.)</p><p>\u2018Luke.\u2019 I clear my throat. \u2018I was just thinking. About ... us. I mean ... all of us. Our family. Including Minnie. And I was wondering\u2014\u2019</p><p>He holds up his hand and lifts his BlackBerry to his ear.</p> <p>\u2018Yes. Hi.\u2019</p><p>God, I hate that silent ring-mode. It gives you no warning at all that he\u2019s getting a call.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll catch up with you,\u2019 he mouths to me, then turns back to his BlackBerry. \u2018Yup, Gary, I got your email.\u2019</p><p>OK, so this isn\u2019t a great time to discuss buying a pram for a mythical second baby.</p><p>Never mind. I\u2019ll wait till later.</p><p>As I hurry back to Santa\u2019s Grotto, it suddenly occurs to me that I might be missing Minnie\u2019s turn, and I break into a run. But as I skid round the corner, breathless, Father Christmas isn\u2019t even back on his throne yet.</p> <p>\u2018Becky!\u2019 Mum waves from the front of the queue. \u2018We\u2019re next! I\u2019ve got the camcorder all ready ... Ooh look!\u2019</p><p>An elf with a bright, vacant smile has taken the stage. She beams around and taps the microphone for attention.</p><p>\u2018Hello, boys and girls!\u2019 she calls out. \u2018Quiet now. Before Santa starts seeing all the children again, it\u2019s Christmas wish time! We\u2019re going to pull out the wish of one lucky child, and grant it! Will it be a teddy? Or a doll\u2019s house? Or a scooter?\u2019</p><p>The microphone isn\u2019t working properly and she taps it in annoyance. Even so, excitement is rippling through the crowd, and there\u2019s a surge forward. Camcorders are waving in the air and small children are swarming through people\u2019s legs to see, their faces all lit up.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 Mum is saying excitedly. \u2018What did you wish for, darling? Maybe they\u2019ll choose you!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And the winner is called ... Becky! Well done, Becky!\u2019 The elf\u2019s suddenly amplified voice makes me jump.</p><p>No. That can\u2019t be ...</p><p>It must be another Becky. There must be loads of little girls here called Becky.</p> <p>\u2018And little Becky has wished for ...\u2019 She squints at the wishing card. \u2018 \u201cA Zac Posen top in aquamarine, the one with the bow, size 10.\u201d\u2019</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u2018Is Zac Posen a new TV character?\u2019 The elf turns to a colleague, looking bemused. \u2018Is that, like, a spinning top?\u2019</p><p>Honestly, how can she work in a department store and not have heard of Zac Posen?</p><p>\u2018How old is Becky?\u2019 The elf is smiling brightly around. \u2018Becky, sweetheart, are you here? We haven\u2019t got any tops, but maybe you\u2019d like to choose a different toy from Santa\u2019s sleigh?\u2019</p><p>My head is ducked down in embarrassment. I can\u2019t bring myself to raise my hand. They didn\u2019t say they\u2019d read the bloody Christmas wishes out loud. They should have warned me.</p><p>\u2018Is Becky\u2019s mummy here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Here I am!\u2019 calls Mum, gaily waving her camcorder.</p><p>\u2018Ssh, Mum!\u2019 I hiss. \u2018Sorry,\u2019 I call out, my face boiling. \u2018It\u2019s ... um, me.

He heard his name and now he\u2019s wondering what I was wishing about him.</p> <p>Unless maybe he\u2019s just thinking about his emails.</p><p>\u2018Mummy!\u2019 A shrill, unmistakable voice cuts through my head and I forget all about Luke.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 I turn, and for one frantic moment I can\u2019t see her.</p><p>\u2018Was that Minnie?\u2019 Luke is also alert. \u2018Where is she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She was with Mum ... shit.\u2019 I grab Luke\u2019s arm and point at the stage in horror.</p><p>Minnie\u2019s sitting on top of one of Father Christmas\u2019s reindeer, holding on to its ears. How the hell did she get up there?</p><p>\u2018Excuse me ...\u2019 I barge my way between the parents and kids. \u2018Minnie, get down!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Horsey!\u2019 Minnie kicks the reindeer joyfully, leaving an ugly dent in the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9.</p> <p>\u2018Would someone remove this child, please?\u2019 an elf is saying into the microphone. \u2018Would the parents of this child please come forward at once?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I only let go of her for a minute!\u2019 says Mum defensively as Luke and I reach her. \u2018She just ran!\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK, Minnie,\u2019 says Luke firmly, striding up on to the stage. \u2018Party\u2019s over.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Slide!\u2019 She\u2019s clambered up on to the sleigh. \u2018Mine slide!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not a slide, and it\u2019s time to get down.\u2019 He takes Minnie round the waist and pulls, but she\u2019s hooked her legs through the seat and is gripping on to the sleigh with superhero strength.</p><p>\u2018Could you get her off, please?\u2019 the elf says, with barely restrained politeness.</p><p>I grab Minnie\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I mutter to Luke. \u2018You get the legs. We\u2019ll yank her off. After three. One-two-three\u2014\u2019</p><p>Oh no. Oh ... fuck.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what happened. I don\u2019t know what we did. But the whole bloody sleigh is collapsing. All the presents are falling off the sleigh on to the fake snow. Before I can blink, there\u2019s a sea of children dashing forward to grab them while their parents yell at them to come back now, Daniel, or there won\u2019t be any Christmas.</p><p>It\u2019s mayhem.</p><p>\u2018Present!\u2019 wails Minnie, stretching her arms out and kicking Luke\u2019s chest. \u2018Present!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get that bloody child out of here!\u2019 the elf erupts in toxic rage. Her eyes range meanly over me and Mum, and even Janice and Martin, who have appeared out of nowhere, both wearing festive jumpers with reindeers on and clutching Christmas Discount Shop bags. \u2018I want your whole family to leave at once.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s our turn next,\u2019 I point out humbly. \u2018I\u2019m really, really sorry about the reindeer, and we\u2019ll pay for any damage ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 Luke chimes in.</p><p>\u2018But my daughter\u2019s been longing to see Father Christmas ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m afraid we have a little rule,\u2019 the elf says sarcastically. \u2018Any child who wrecks Santa\u2019s sleigh forfeits their visit. Your daughter is hereby banned from the Grotto.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Banned?\u2019 I stare at her in dismay. \u2018You mean\u2014\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018In fact, all of you are banned.\u2019 She points at the exit with a purple-lacquered nail.</p><p>\u2018Well, that\u2019s a fine Christmas spirit!\u2019 retorts Mum. \u2018We\u2019re loyal customers and your sleigh was obviously very poorly made, and I\u2019ve a good mind to report you to Trading Standards!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just go.\u2019 The elf is still standing there, her arm extended rigidly.</p><p>In total mortification, I take the handles of the buggy. We all trudge out in miserable silence, to see Dad rushing up in his waterproof jacket, his greying hair a bit dishevelled.</p> <p>\u2018Did I miss it? Have you seen Father Christmas, Minnie darling?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I can hardly bear to admit it. \u2018We were banned from the Grotto.\u2019</p><p>Dad\u2019s face falls. \u2018Oh dear. Oh, love.\u2019 He sighs heavily. \u2018Not again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh-huh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How many is that now?\u2019 asks Janice, with a little wince.</p> <p>\u2018Four.\u2019 I look down at Minnie, who of course is now standing holding Luke\u2019s hand demurely, looking like a little angel.</p><p>\u2018What happened this time?\u2019 asks Dad. \u2018She didn\u2019t bite Santa, did she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I say defensively. \u2018Of course not!\u2019</p><p>The whole biting-Santa-at-Harrods incident was a complete misunderstanding. And that Santa was a total wimp. He did not need to go to A&amp;E.</p><p>\u2018It was me and Luke. We wrecked the sleigh, trying to get her off a reindeer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 Dad nods sagely and we all turn glumly towards the exit.</p> <p>\u2018Minnie\u2019s quite a livewire, isn\u2019t she?\u2019 ventures Janice timidly after a while.</p><p>\u2018Little rascal,\u2019 says Martin and tickles Minnie under the chin. \u2018She\u2019s quite a handful!\u2019</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m feeling oversensitive. But all this talk of \u2018handfuls\u2019 and \u2018rascals\u2019 and \u2018livewires\u2019 is suddenly pressing on my sore spot.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t think Minnie\u2019s spoiled, do you?\u2019 I say suddenly and come to an abrupt halt on the marble mall floor. \u2018Be honest.\u2019</p><p>Janice inhales sharply. \u2018Well,\u2019 she begins, glancing at Martin as though for support. \u2018I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Spoiled?\u2019 Mum cuts her off with a laugh. \u2018Nonsense! There\u2019s nothing wrong with Minnie, is there, my precious? She just knows her own mind!\u2019 She strokes Minnie\u2019s hair fondly, then looks up again. \u2018Becky, love, you were exactly the same at her age. Exactly the same.\u2019</p><p>At once I relax. Mum always says the right thing. I glance over at Luke \u2013 but to my surprise he doesn\u2019t return my relieved smile. He looks as though some new and alarming thought has transfixed him.</p><p>\u2018Thanks, Mum.\u2019 I give her a fond hug. \u2018You always make everything better. Come on, let\u2019s get home.\u2019</p> <p>By the time Minnie\u2019s in bed, I\u2019ve cheered up. In fact I\u2019m feeling really festive. This is what Christmas is all about. Mulled wine and mince pies and White Christmas on the telly. We\u2019ve hung up Minnie\u2019s stocking (gorgeous red gingham, from the Conran shop) and put out a glass of sherry for Father Christmas and now Luke and I are in our bedroom, wrapping up her presents.</p><p>Mum and Dad are really generous. They\u2019ve given us the whole top floor of the house to live in, so we have quite a lot of privacy. The only slight downside is, our wardrobe isn\u2019t that big. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because I\u2019ve taken over the guestroom wardrobe too \u2013 plus I\u2019ve arranged all my shoes on the bookshelves on the landing. (I put the books in boxes. No one ever read them, anyway.)</p><p>I\u2019ve put up a hanging rail in Dad\u2019s study, for coats and party dresses, and stacked some hat boxes in the utility room. And I keep all my make-up on the dining table, which is the ideal size, in fact it could have been designed for make-up. My mascaras fit in the knife drawer, my straightening irons go perfectly on the hostess trolley and I\u2019ve put all my magazines in piles on the chairs.</p><p>I\u2019ve also stored just a few teeny things in the garage, like all my old boots, and this amazing set of vintage trunks I bought at an antique shop, and a Power Plate machine (which I bought off eBay and must start using). It\u2019s getting a bit crowded in there now, I suppose \u2013 but it\u2019s not like Dad ever uses the garage for the car, is it?</p><p>Luke finishes wrapping a jigsaw puzzle, reaches for a Magic Drawing Easel, then looks around the room and frowns.</p><p>\u2018How many presents is Minnie getting?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just the usual number,\u2019 I say defensively.</p><p>Although to be honest, I was a bit taken aback myself. I\u2019d forgotten how many I\u2019d bought from catalogues and craft fairs and stashed away, throughout the year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018This one\u2019s educational.\u2019 I hastily whip the price tag off the Magic Drawing Easel. \u2018And it was really cheap. Have some more mulled wine!\u2019 I pour him another glass, then reach for a hat with two red sparkly pom-poms. It\u2019s the cutest thing, and they had them in baby sizes, too.</p><p>If we had another baby, it could wear a pom-pom hat to match Minnie\u2019s. People would call them The Children in the Pom-Pom Hats.</p><p>I have a sudden alluring image of myself walking down the street with Minnie. She\u2019d be pushing her toy pram with a dolly in it and I\u2019d be pushing a pram with a real baby in it. She\u2019d have a friend for life. It would all be so perfect ...</p><p>\u2018Becky? Sellotape? Becky?\u2019</p> <p>Suddenly I realize Luke\u2019s said my name about four times. \u2018Oh! Sorry! Here you are. Isn\u2019t this lovely?\u2019 I jiggle the red pompoms at Luke. \u2018They had them for babies, too.\u2019</p><p>I leave a significant pause, letting the word \u2018babies\u2019 hang in the air and using all my powers of marital telepathy.</p><p>\u2018This Sellotape is crap. It\u2019s all shredded.\u2019 He discards it impatiently.</p><p>Huh. So much for marital telepathy. Maybe I should introduce the subject by stealth. Suze once persuaded her husband Tarkie to go on a package holiday to Disneyland so stealthily that he didn\u2019t even realize where they were going till they were on the plane. Mind you, Tarkie is Tarkie (sweet, unsuspicious, usually thinking about Wagner or sheep). And Luke is Luke (totally on the case and always thinking I\u2019m up to something. Which I am NOT.)</p><p>\u2018So that\u2019s fantastic news about Arcodas,\u2019 I say casually. \u2018And the house.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it great?\u2019 Luke\u2019s face cracks briefly into a smile.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s like all the pieces of the jigsaw are falling into place. At least, nearly all the pieces.\u2019 I leave another meaningful pause, but Luke doesn\u2019t even notice.</p><p>What\u2019s the point of peppering your conversation with meaningful pauses if no one notices? I\u2019ve had enough of being stealthy, it\u2019s totally overrated.</p><p>\u2018Luke, let\u2019s have another baby!\u2019 I say in a rush. \u2018Tonight!\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence. For an instant I wonder whether Luke even heard. Then he raises his head, looking totally astonished.</p><p>\u2018Are you nuts?\u2019</p> <p>I stare back at him, affronted.</p><p>\u2018Of course I\u2019m not nuts! I think we should have a little brother or sister for Minnie. Don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My petal.\u2019 Luke sits back on his heels. \u2018We can\u2019t control one child. How on earth would we control two? You saw the way she behaved today.\u2019</p><p>Not him, too.</p><p>\u2018What are you saying?\u2019 I can\u2019t help sounding hurt. \u2018Do you think Minnie\u2019s spoiled?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not saying that,\u2019 Luke says carefully. \u2018But you have to admit, she\u2019s out of control.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No she\u2019s not!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look at the facts. She\u2019s been banned from four Santa\u2019s Grottos.\u2019 He ticks off on his fingers. \u2018And St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Not to mention the incident at Harvey Nichols and the fiasco at my office.\u2019</p> <p>Is he going to hold that against her for ever? They shouldn\u2019t have expensive artwork on the walls, is what I say. They\u2019re supposed to be working, not walking around looking at art all day.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s just spirited,\u2019 I say defensively. \u2018Maybe a baby would be good for her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And drive us insane.\u2019 Luke shakes his head. \u2018Becky, let\u2019s hold our horses on this one, OK?\u2019</p><p>I feel crushed. I don\u2019t want to hold my horses. I want to have two children in matching pom-pom hats.</p><p>\u2018Luke, I\u2019ve really thought about this carefully. I want Minnie to have a lifelong friend and not grow up an only child. And I want our children to be close in age, not years apart. And I\u2019ve got a hundred quid\u2019s worth of vouchers for Baby World which I never spent!\u2019 I add, suddenly remembering. \u2018They\u2019ll expire soon!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 Luke rolls his eyes. \u2018We\u2019re not having another baby just because we\u2019ve got some vouchers for Baby World.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not why we\u2019d have the baby!\u2019 I say, indignantly. \u2018That was just an extra reason.\u2019</p><p>Trust him to pick on that. He\u2019s just avoiding the issue.</p><p>\u2018So what do you mean? That you never want another baby?\u2019</p><p>A guarded look flashes over Luke\u2019s face. For a moment he doesn\u2019t answer, but finishes wrapping the present, straightening every corner perfectly and smoothing the Sellotape down with his thumbnail. He looks exactly like someone putting off talking about something which is a sore point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch in growing dismay. Since when was having a second baby a sore point?</p><p>\u2018Maybe I would like to have more than one child,\u2019 he says at last. \u2018In theory. One day.\u2019</p><p>Well, he couldn\u2019t sound less enthusiastic.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I gulp. \u2018I see.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Becky, don\u2019t get me wrong. Having Minnie has been ... amazing. I couldn\u2019t possibly love her any more, you know that.\u2019</p><p>He meets my eyes directly and I\u2019m too honest to do anything except nod silently.</p><p>\u2018But we\u2019re not ready to have another one. Face it, Becky, it\u2019s been a hell of a year, we don\u2019t even have our own house yet, Minnie\u2019s a handful, we\u2019ve got enough on our plate as it is ... Let\u2019s just forget about it for now. Enjoy Christmas, enjoy being the three of us. Talk about it again in a year\u2019s time, maybe.\u2019</p><p>A year\u2019s time?</p><p>\u2018But that\u2019s ages away.\u2019 To my horror my voice shakes slightly. \u2018I was hoping we might have another baby by next Christmas! I\u2019d even got perfect names planned for if we conceived it tonight. Wenceslas or Snowflake.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, Becky.\u2019 Luke takes hold of both my hands and sighs. \u2018If we could get through just one day without a major incident, maybe I\u2019d feel differently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We can easily get through a day. She\u2019s not that bad!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Has there been a single day in which Minnie has not created havoc of some sort?\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I say a bit defiantly. \u2018You wait. I\u2019m going to start a Minnie Incident Book and I bet we don\u2019t have any entries. I bet Minnie will be an angel tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>Silently I resume wrapping presents, breaking off the Sellotape with extra snap, just to show how hurt I feel. He probably never wanted any children at all. He probably resents me and Minnie. He probably wishes he was still a bachelor, zooming around in his sports car all day long. I knew it.</p><p>\u2018So, is that all the presents?\u2019 I say eventually, plonking a big spotted bow on the final package.</p> <p>\u2018Actually ... I\u2019ve got one more thing.\u2019 Luke looks sheepish. \u2018I couldn\u2019t resist.\u2019</p><p>He heads to the wardrobe and rifles at the back, behind his shoes. As he turns, he\u2019s holding a scruffy cardboard box. He puts it down on the carpet and gently pulls out an old toy theatre. It\u2019s made of wood, with faded paint and real little red velvet curtains and even tiny footlights.</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I breathe. \u2018That\u2019s amazing. Where did you find that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tracked it down on eBay. I had one when I was a child, exactly like this. Same sets, characters, everything.\u2019</p><p>I watch, agog, as he pulls the tiny ropes and the curtains swish creakily back. The stage is dressed with sets for A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, painted in incredible detail. One\u2019s an interior scene with pillars, another is a woodland copse with a little brook and mossy bank, another is a big forest with distant spires of a castle on the background. There are tiny wooden characters in costumes, and even one with a donkey\u2019s head, who must be ... Puck.</p><p>No, not Puck. The other one. Oberon?</p><p>OK, I\u2019ll quickly Google A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream while Luke\u2019s downstairs.</p><p>\u2018I used to play with this with Annabel.\u2019 Luke is staring at it as though entranced. \u2018I must have been about ... six? It was like going into a different world. Look, all the sets are on runners. It\u2019s superb craftsmanship.\u2019</p> <p>As I watch him pushing the characters back and forth, I feel a sudden little pang for him. I\u2019ve never known Luke display any nostalgia for anything, ever.</p><p>\u2018Well, don\u2019t let Minnie break it,\u2019 I say gently.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 He smiles. \u2018We\u2019ll put on a father-daughter Christmas performance tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>Now I feel a bit guilty. I take it back. Maybe Luke doesn\u2019t resent me and Minnie. He\u2019s had a hard year, that\u2019s all.</p><p>What I need to do is have a little Mummy \u2013 Minnie chat. Explain the situation to her. And she\u2019ll reform her ways and Luke will reconsider, and everything will be perfect.</p><p>THREE</p><p>OK, Christmas doesn\u2019t count. Everyone knows that.</p><p>You can\u2019t expect a toddler to behave perfectly when it\u2019s all so exciting and there are sweets and decorations everywhere. And it\u2019s no wonder Minnie woke up at 3 a.m. and started yelling for everyone. She just wanted us all to see her stocking. Anyone else would have done the same.</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019ve already torn out the first page of the Incident Book and shredded it. Everyone\u2019s allowed to have a false start.</p><p>I take a sip of coffee and happily reach for a Quality Street. God, I love Christmas. The whole house smells of roasting turkey, carols are playing over the sound-system and Dad\u2019s cracking nuts by the fire. I can\u2019t help feeling a glow as I look around the sitting room: at the tree twinkling with lights and the nativity scene we\u2019ve had since I was little (we lost Baby Jesus years ago but we use a clothes peg instead). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Little Minnie\u2019s eyes when she saw her stocking this morning were like saucers.

Can\u2019t he get into the spirit of it?</p><p>\u2018Yes it is.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018In Bloomwood-world, maybe. Everywhere else, it\u2019s December 28th and people are getting on with their lives.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s so literal.</p><p>\u2018OK, maybe it\u2019s not exactly Christmas Day,\u2019 I say crossly. \u2018But it\u2019s our second Christmas. It\u2019s our special Christmas for Jess and Tom and it\u2019s just as important and you could try to be a bit festive!\u2019</p><p>This whole two Christmases thing is fab. In fact I think we should do it every year. It could be a family tradition.</p><p>\u2018My love.\u2019 Luke pauses, halfway up the stairs, and starts counting off on his fingers. \u2018One, it is not just as important. Two, I need to finalize this agreement today. Three, Tom and Jess aren\u2019t even here yet.\u2019</p><p>A text arrived from Jess and Tom overnight to say that their plane from Chile had been delayed. Since then, Janice has come across to our house approximately every twenty minutes to ask if we\u2019ve heard anything, and could we possibly look online again, and has there been any news of accidents or hijacks?</p> <p>She\u2019s even more hyper than usual and we all know why: she\u2019s desperately hoping that Tom and Jess have got engaged. Apparently Tom said in his last email that he had \u2018something to tell her\u2019. I heard her and Mum talking the other day and Janice is obviously gagging to hold another wedding. She\u2019s got all sorts of new ideas for floral arrangements and the photos could be in front of the magnolia tree and it would \u2018excise the memory of that ungrateful little harlot\u2019. (Lucy. Tom\u2019s first wife. Total cow, take it from me.)</p><p>\u2018On the same subject, why on earth did Minnie get another stocking this morning?\u2019 adds Luke, lowering his voice. \u2018Whose idea was that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was ... Father Christmas\u2019s idea,\u2019 I say, a bit defiantly. \u2018By the way, have you seen how good she\u2019s being today?\u2019</p><p>Minnie\u2019s been helping Mum in the kitchen all morning and she\u2019s been absolutely perfect, apart from a tiny moment with the electric mixer, which I won\u2019t mention to Luke.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure she is,\u2018 Luke begins, as the doorbell rings. \u2018That can\u2019t be them.\u2019 He consults his watch, looking puzzled. \u2018They\u2019re still in the air.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is that Jess?\u2019 calls Mum excitedly from the kitchen. \u2018Has anyone texted Janice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It can\u2019t be Jess yet!\u2019 I call back. \u2018It must be Suze, arrived early.\u2019 I hurry to the front door and swing it open \u2013 and sure enough, there\u2019s the whole Cleath-Stuart family, looking like a photo spread from the Toast catalogue.</p><p>Suze is stunning in a black shearling coat, her long blonde hair streaming down, Tarquin is the same as ever in an ancient old Barbour, and the three children are all gangly legs and huge eyes and Fair Isle jumpers.</p> <p>\u2018Suze!\u2019 I fling my arms round her.</p><p>\u2018Bex! Happy Christmas!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Happy Christmas!\u2019 calls out Clemmie, sucking her thumb and holding on to Suze\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u2018And a happy you near!\u2019 chimes in Ernest, who is my godson and already has that bony, upper-class beanpole look going on. (\u2018Happy you near\u2019 is an old Cleath-Stuart family saying. Like \u2018Happy bad day\u2019 instead of \u2018Happy birthday\u2019. There are so many of them, they should issue a crib sheet.) He shoots an uncertain look up at Suze, who nods encouragingly \u2013 then extends a formal hand to me as though we\u2019re meeting for the first time at an ambassador\u2019s reception. I solemnly shake it, then scoop him up in a bear-hug till he giggles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Suzie, dear! Merry Christmas!\u2019 Mum hurries into the hall and gives her a warm hug. \u2018And Tark\u2014\u2019 She stops in her tracks. \u2018Lord ...\u2019 She glances anxiously at me. \u2018Your Lordship ... ness ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ahm ... please, Mrs Bloomwood.\u2019 Tarkie has turned a bit pink. \u2018Tarquin is fine.\u2019</p><p>Tarkie\u2019s grandfather died of pneumonia a couple of months ago. Which was really tragic and everything, but there again, he was ninety-six. Anyway, the point is, Tarkie\u2019s dad inherited the title of Earl \u2013 and Tarkie gets to be a lord! He\u2019s Lord Tarquin Cleath-Stuart, which makes Suze \u2018Lady\u2019. It\u2019s all so grown-up and posh I can hardly get my head round it. Plus, they now have even more squillions of money and land and stuff than they had before. Their new house is in Hampshire, only about half an hour away from here. It\u2019s called Letherby Hall and it looks just like Brideshead Revisited, and they don\u2019t even live in it full time, they\u2019ve got a place in Chelsea too.</p><p>You\u2019d think Tarkie could stump up for a new scarf. He\u2019s unwinding the most threadbare, ratty old thing from around his neck that looks like it was knitted by his old nanny twenty years ago. Well, it probably was.</p> <p>\u2018Did you get any nice Christmas presents, Tarkie?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>I\u2019ve bought him this really cool aromatherapy diffuser thing, which I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love. Well, Suze will love.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely.\u2019 He nods fervently. \u2018Suze bought me a rather wonderful Merino tup. Such a surprise.\u2019</p><p>Tup? Does he mean tux?</p><p>\u2018That sounds fab!\u2019 I exclaim. \u2018Merino is so in right now. You should see the new John Smedley collection, you\u2019d love it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018John Smedley?\u2019 Tarkie seems a little baffled. \u2018I don\u2019t know the name. Is he a breeder?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The knitwear designer! You know, you could put a turtle-neck under your tux,\u2019 I say in sudden inspiration. \u2018That\u2019s a really cool look. Is it single-breasted?\u2019</p><p>Tarkie looks totally at sea, and Suze gives a gurgle of laughter.</p><p>\u2018Bex, I didn\u2019t give him a tux. I gave him a tup. An uncastrated sheep.\u2019</p><p>An uncastrated sheep? What kind of Christmas present is that?</p><p>\u2018Oh, I see.\u2019 I try my hardest to summon some enthusiasm. \u2018Of course. An uncastrated sheep! Er ... lovely.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, I gave him a jacket, too,\u2019 adds Suze, grinning at me.</p><p>\u2018For when I\u2019m out on my bike,\u2019 Tarkie chimes in. \u2018It\u2019s absolutely super, darling.\u2019</p><p>I already know better than to say \u2018Oh cool, a Belstaff?\u2019 Tarkie doesn\u2019t mean \u2018bike\u2019 like most people mean \u2018bike\u2019. Sure enough, Suze is scrolling through pictures on her phone, and turns it to show me a photo of Tarkie in a tweed jacket, perched on a vintage penny-farthing. He\u2019s got loads of antique bikes \u2013 in fact sometimes he even lends them to TV companies as props and advises on the way they were ridden in the olden days. (The only thing is, they don\u2019t always listen. And then Tarkie sees the show on TV and they\u2019re doing it wrong and he gets all depressed.)</p><p>\u2018Why don\u2019t all the children come into the kitchen for some squash and biscuits?\u2019 Mum is rounding up Ernest, Clementine and Wilfrid like a mother hen. \u2018Where\u2019s Minnie? Minnie darling, come and see your friends!\u2019</p><p>Like a fireball, Minnie rockets into the hall from the kitchen, dressed in her scarlet Christmas dress, the sparkly red pompom hat and a pair of pink fairy wings which she\u2019s refused to take off since finding them in her stocking.</p><p>\u2018Ketchup!\u2019 she cries triumphantly, and aims the bottle at Suze\u2019s gorgeous coat.</p><p>My heart freezes.</p><p>Oh no. Oh no, oh no. How did she get hold of that? We always put it on the top shelf now, ever since ...</p> <p>\u2018Minnie, no. No.\u2019 I make a swipe for the ketchup, but she dodges me. \u2018Minnie, give it to me, don\u2019t you dare\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ketchup!\u2019 The stream of red is streaking through the air before I can even react.</p><p>\u2018Nooo!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Suze!\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s like Apocalypse Now. I see the whole thing as if in slow motion: Suze gasping and shrinking back, and Tarquin diving in front of her, and the ketchup landing in a massive blob on his Barbour.</p><p>I don\u2019t dare look at Luke.</p><p>\u2018Give that to me!\u2019 I grab the ketchup out of Minnie\u2019s hand. \u2018Naughty girl! Suze, Tarkie, I\u2019m so sorry ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do apologize for our daughter\u2019s terrible behaviour,\u2019 chimes in Luke, a meaningful edge to his voice.</p><p>\u2018Oh, no problem,\u2019 says Suze. \u2018I\u2019m sure she did it by accident, didn\u2019t you, darling?\u2019 She ruffles Minnie\u2019s head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 chimes in Tarkie. \u2018No harm done. If I could just ...\u2019 He gestures awkwardly at the tomato ketchup, which is dripping down the front of his Barbour.</p><p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 I hastily take his Barbour from him. \u2018Well dived, Tarkie,\u2019 I can\u2019t help adding admiringly. \u2018You were really quick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, it was nothing.\u2019 He looks abashed. \u2018Any decent chap would have done it.\u2019</p><p>It just goes to show how devoted Tarquin is to Suze. He dived in front of her without a moment\u2019s hesitation. It\u2019s quite romantic, actually.</p> <p>I wonder if Luke would take a hit of tomato ketchup for me. I might ask him later. Just casually.</p><p>\u2018Luke,\u2019 says Tarquin a little diffidently as they shake hands. \u2018Wondered if I could pick your brains about something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem.\u2019 Luke looks a little surprised. \u2018Shall we go in the sitting room?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take the children into the kitchen and sort out this Barbour ...\u2019 Mum takes it from me.</p><p>\u2018And Bex, you can show me all the stuff you got at the sales!\u2019 says Suze excitedly. \u2018I mean ... er ... talk about the children,\u2019 she amends hastily as I give her a surreptitious kick.</p> <p>As we sprawl on my bed and I start unpacking all the stuff I bought on Boxing Day it feels just like old times, when Suze and I used to share a flat in Fulham.</p><p>\u2018This is what I\u2019m wearing at the christening.\u2019 I shake out my brand-new Russian-style dress.</p><p>\u2018Fantastic!\u2019 says Suze, as she tries on my new leather jacket. \u2018Even better than the picture.\u2019</p><p>I texted Suze a few photos from the sales, and she gave me her opinion. And in return she sent me some photos of her and Tarkie grouse-beating, or pigeon-shooting, or whatever they were doing. Suze is so sweet and loyal, just like the Queen, she never once complains. But honestly, where would you rather be? On some freezing-cold moor, or in Selfridges with 70 per cent off?</p><p>\u2018And ... ta-daah!\u2019</p><p>I pull out my prize purchase. My Ally Smith limited-edition cardigan with the famous signature button.</p> <p>\u2018Oh my God!\u2019 squeaks Suze. \u2018Where did you get that? Was it on sale?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sixty per cent off! Only a hundred and ten pounds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look at the button.\u2019 Suze reaches out and strokes it lustfully.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it great?\u2019 I beam back happily. \u2018I\u2019m going to wear it so much, it\u2019ll easily pay for itself ...\u2019</p><p>The door opens and Luke comes in.</p><p>\u2018Oh, hi.\u2019 Instinctively, before I quite realize I\u2019m doing it, I push one of my sale bags under the bed.</p><p>It\u2019s not that he disapproves, exactly. I mean, it\u2019s my money, I earned it, I can do what I like with it. It\u2019s just that when Mum and I were up at 7 a.m. on Boxing Day, ready to hit the sales, Luke just looked at us in bafflement, then looked at all the presents still under the tree, and then said, \u2018Didn\u2019t you get enough stuff yesterday?\u2019</p><p>Which just shows how little he understands about anything. Christmas presents and the sales are totally different. They\u2019re like ... different food groups.</p> <p>\u2018Bex got the most amazing bargains at the sales,\u2019 says Suze supportively. \u2018Don\u2019t you love her new cardigan?\u2019</p><p>Luke looks at the cardigan. He turns and studies me for a moment \u2013 then the cardigan again. Then he frowns as though something is puzzling him.</p><p>\u2018How much was it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A hundred and ten,\u2019 I say defensively. \u2018Sixty per cent off. It\u2019s designer, limited edition.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So ... you\u2019ve just spent a hundred and ten pounds on a cardigan which is exactly the same as the one you\u2019re wearing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I glance down at myself in bemusement. \u2018Of course I haven\u2019t. It\u2019s nothing like.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s identical!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No it isn\u2019t! How can you say that?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a short pause. We\u2019re both staring at each other as though to say \u2018Have I married a lunatic?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re both pale cream.\u2019 Luke ticks off on his fingers. \u2018They both have one large button. They\u2019re both cardigans. Identical.\u2019</p><p>Is he blind?</p><p>\u2018But the button\u2019s in a different place,\u2019 I explain. \u2018It changes the whole shape. And this one has flared sleeves. They\u2019re nothing like each other, are they, Suze?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Completely different.\u2019 Suze nods fervently.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious from his expression that Luke doesn\u2019t get it. Sometimes I wonder how someone so unobservant can be so successful in life.</p><p>\u2018And this button\u2019s red,\u2019 adds Suze helpfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Exactly!\u2019 I point to the oversize button with trademark Ally Smith crystals. \u2018That\u2019s the whole point of the piece, this amazing button. It\u2019s like ... a signature.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you spent a hundred quid on a button.\u2019</p><p>God, he\u2019s annoying sometimes.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s an investment,\u2019 I inform him frostily. \u2018I was just saying to Suze, I\u2019ll wear it so many times, it\u2019ll totally pay for itself.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018How many would that be? Twice?\u2019</p><p>I stare at him with utter indignation.</p><p>\u2018Of course not twice. I\u2019ll probably wear it ...\u2019 I think a moment, trying to be absolutely realistic. \u2018A hundred times. So each time will cost \u00a31.10. I think I can afford \u00a31.10 for a designer classic of its time, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>Luke makes a kind of snorting noise. \u2018Becky, have you ever worn anything a hundred times? I\u2019ll count it a success if you wear it once.\u2019</p><p>Oh, ha-di-ha.</p> <p>\u2018I bet you I\u2019ll wear it a hundred times. At least.\u2019 Determinedly, I shrug off my cardigan and start pulling on the Ally Smith one. \u2018You see? I\u2019ve already worn it once.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ll show him. I\u2019ll wear it a thousand times.</p><p>\u2018I must go, Tarquin\u2019s waiting for me.\u2019 Luke shoots Suze a quizzical look. \u2018Quite a business you\u2019ve inherited.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I know,\u2019 says Suze. \u2018Poor Tarkie was getting in a state about it so I said, \u201cAsk Luke, he\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m glad you did.\u2019 Luke has been rifling in his cabinet for some papers. He bangs it shut and heads out again. \u2018See you later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What was that about?\u2019 I say, puzzled. \u2018What business?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, it\u2019s this Shetland Shortbread thing,\u2019 says Suze vaguely. \u2018It\u2019s quite a big deal, and now it belongs to us ...\u2019</p><p>Hang on a minute. Rewind.</p><p>\u2018You own Shetland Shortbread?\u2019 I stare at her in amazement. \u2018Those red tins you can buy in Waitrose?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly!\u2019 says Suze brightly. \u2018It\u2019s really scrummy. They make it on one of the farms.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m flabbergasted. What else does Suze suddenly now own? Chocolate HobNobs? KitKats?</p><p>Ooh, that would be cool. I wonder how many free ones she\u2019d get. Maybe ... a box a year?</p><p>No, that\u2019s ridiculous. It would be at least ten boxes a year, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>After I\u2019ve shown Suze all my clothes I pop downstairs and make some coffee and check the children are OK. I come back up to find Suze wandering around the cluttered room and picking over my stuff, like she always does. She looks up, holding a pile of old photos which I\u2019ve been meaning to put in albums. \u2018Bex, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re moving out of here at last. It seems like you\u2019ve been here for ever.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It has been for ever. Two whole years!\u2019</p><p>\u2018What did your mum and dad say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t told them yet.\u2019 I glance at the door and lower my voice. \u2018I think they\u2019ll really miss us when we\u2019re gone. In fact ... I\u2019m a bit worried how they\u2019ll take it.\u2019</p><p>The truth is, Mum and Dad have got used to having us around. Especially Minnie. Every time one of our house purchases fell through, they were secretly really glad, Mum once told me.</p><p>\u2018God, of course.\u2019 Suze\u2019s face crumples anxiously. \u2018They\u2019ll be devastated. Your poor mum will need loads of support. Maybe you can fix up some counselling!\u2019 she adds in sudden inspiration. \u2018I bet they have Empty Nest Workshops or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do feel guilty.\u2019 I sigh. \u2018But we can\u2019t stay here for ever, can we? I mean, we need our own space.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you do,\u2019 says Suze supportively. \u2018Don\u2019t worry, your parents will come to terms with it. So come on, show me the house! What\u2019s it like? What does it need doing to it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t really need anything done to it,\u2019 I confess as I hand her the details. \u2018It\u2019s been decorated by a developer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eight bedrooms!\u2019 Suze raises her eyebrows. \u2018Wow!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know. It\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s so much bigger inside than it looks. And it\u2019s all been freshly painted and everything. But still, we should put our stamp on it, shouldn\u2019t we?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh definitely.\u2019 Suze nods wisely.</p><p>Suze is so much more with it than Luke, who, by the way, hasn\u2019t even been inside the place. I told him we needed to put our stamp on it and he said, \u2018Why can\u2019t we be happy with someone else\u2019s stamp?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve already made loads of plans,\u2019 I tell her enthusiastically. \u2018Like, in the hall I thought we could have a really cool hat stand with a single studded Alexander Wang bag hanging from it. It would make such a statement.\u2019 I scrabble under the bed for the sketch I\u2019ve done and show it to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 breathes Suze. \u2018That looks amazing. Have you got an Alexander Wang bag?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d have to buy one,\u2019 I explain. \u2018And next to it, maybe a console table accessorized with some Lara Bohinc jewellery?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love Lara Bohinc!\u2019 says Suze enthusiastically. \u2018Have you got some of her stuff? You never showed me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, well, I\u2019d have to buy some of that too. But I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be for me, would it?\u2019 I add hurriedly at her expression. \u2018It would be for the house.\u2019</p> <p>For a moment Suze just looks at me. It\u2019s the same look she gave me when I wanted us to set ourselves up as telephone fortune-tellers. (Which I still think was a good idea.)</p><p>\u2018You want to buy a bag and jewellery for your house?\u2019 she says at last.</p><p>\u2018Yes! Why not?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bex, no one buys a bag and jewellery for their house.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, maybe they should! Maybe their houses would look better if they did! And anyway, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to buy a sofa too.\u2019 I chuck a load of interiors magazines at her. \u2018Go on, find me a nice one.\u2019</p> <p>Half an hour later the bed is littered with interiors magazines and we\u2019re both lying in silence, wallowing in pictures of amazing oversized orange velvet sofas and staircases with built-in lights and kitchens with polished granite mixed with reclaimed wood doors. The trouble is, I want my house to look like all of them. All at once.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got a massive basement!\u2019 Suze is looking at the house details again. \u2018What\u2019s that going to be?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good question!\u2019 I look up. \u2018I think it should be a gym. But Luke wants to store his boring old wine there and do wine-tastings.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wine-tastings?\u2019 Suze pulls a face. \u2018Oh, have a gym. We could do Pilates together!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly! It would be so cool! But Luke\u2019s got all this valuable old wine in storage, and he\u2019s really excited about getting it out again.\u2019</p><p>That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ll never understand about Luke. His love of zillion-pound wine, when you could buy a really nice Pinot Grigio for a tenner and spend the rest on a skirt.</p> <p>\u2018So, there\u2019s one bedroom for you and Luke ...\u2019 Suze is still perusing the details. \u2018One for Minnie ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018One for clothes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018One for shoes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Definitely. And one for make-up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ooh!\u2019 Suze looks up with interest. \u2018A make-up room! Did Luke agree to that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to call it the library,\u2019 I explain.</p><p>\u2018But that still leaves three bedrooms.\u2019 Suze lifts her eyebrows significantly at me. \u2018Any plans to ... fill them up?\u2019</p><p>You see? This is why I should have married Suze. She understands me.</p> <p>\u2018I wish.\u2019 I heave a sigh. \u2018But guess what? Luke doesn\u2019t want another baby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Suze looks taken aback. \u2018How come?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He says Minnie\u2019s too wild and we can\u2019t cope with two and we should just enjoy what we\u2019ve got. He won\u2019t budge.\u2019 I hunch my shoulders gloomily and flick through an article on antique baths.</p><p>\u2018Could you just ... jump him?\u2019 Suze says after a while. \u2018And forget to take your Pill accidentally-on-purpose and pretend it was a mistake? He\u2019ll love the baby when it arrives.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t pretend this idea hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. Secretly. But I just couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I shake my head. \u2018I don\u2019t want to trap him. I want him to want another baby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe he\u2019ll change his mind at the christening.\u2019 Suze\u2019s eyes brighten. \u2018You know, it was at Ernie\u2019s christening that we decided to have another one. Ernie looked so adorable, and we thought how lovely it would be to give him a brother or sister, so we decided to go for it. Of course we ended up with two more,\u2019 she adds as an afterthought. \u2018But that won\u2019t happen to you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019 I\u2019m silent a moment, gearing myself up for the big question. I don\u2019t want to ask it. But I have to be brave. \u2018Suze ... can you be honest with me about something? Really, truly honest?\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 she says a bit apprehensively. \u2018But not if it\u2019s about how many times a week we have sex.\u2019</p><p>What? Where did that come from? OK, now I instantly want to know how many times she has sex. It must be never. Or maybe all the time. God, I bet it\u2019s all the time. I bet she and Tarkie\u2014</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not sex.\u2019 I force myself to return to the topic. \u2018It\u2019s ... do you think Minnie\u2019s spoiled?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can already feel myself wincing with trepidation. What if she says yes? What if my best friend thinks Minnie\u2019s a monster? I\u2019ll be totally mortified.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 says Suze at once. \u2018Of course Minnie\u2019s not spoiled! She\u2019s lovely. She\u2019s just a bit ... feisty. But that\u2019s good! No children are perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yours are,\u2019 I say morosely. \u2018Nothing ever goes wrong with them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh my God! Are you kidding?\u2019 Suze sits upright and discards the house details altogether. \u2018We\u2019re having such problems with Ernie. His teacher keeps calling us in. He\u2019s hopeless at everything except German, and they don\u2019t even teach German.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, Suze,\u2019 I say sympathetically.</p><p>I don\u2019t need to ask why Ernie speaks German so well. Tarquin thinks Wagner is the only music worth listening to and he plays it to all his children, every night. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Ernie is my godson and I love him to bits. But last time I visited he told me the whole story of something called the Something-singers and it went on for hours and I nearly seized up with boredom.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got to go and see the headmistress,\u2019 Suze continues, looking upset. \u2018What am I going to do if she asks him to leave?\u2019</p><p>Forgetting all about my own problems, I put an arm round her shoulders and squeeze, feeling incensed. How dare anyone upset Suze? And who are these morons, anyway? I\u2019ve seen Ernie\u2019s school when I\u2019ve gone with Suze to pick him up. It\u2019s very snooty with lilac blazers and costs a million pounds a term or something, and they don\u2019t even include lunches. They\u2019re probably too busy counting the fees to appreciate real talent.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine,\u2019 I say robustly. \u2018And if they don\u2019t want Ernie, then it\u2019s obviously a rubbish school.\u2019</p> <p>If I ever see that headmistress, I\u2019ll give her my opinion, very pointedly. I\u2019m Ernie\u2019s godmother, after all. In fact, maybe I should come along to the meeting at the school and express my views. I\u2019m about to suggest this to Suze when she slaps her hand on the bed.</p><p>\u2018I know, Bex! I\u2019ve got it. You should get a nanny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A nanny?\u2019 I stare at her.</p><p>\u2018Who looks after Minnie when you\u2019re at work? Still your mum?\u2019</p><p>I nod. Since my maternity leave ended I\u2019ve worked two and a half days a week at The Look, where I\u2019m a personal shopper. While I\u2019m there Mum looks after Minnie, which is brilliant because I can just leave her in the kitchen, having her breakfast, and she hardly even notices when I go.</p><p>\u2018Does your mum take her to playgroup?\u2019</p> <p>I make a face. \u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>Mum\u2019s not into playgroups. She went to Tick Tock once and had a disagreement with a fellow grandmother about who\u2019s the best Miss Marple on TV, and never went back.</p><p>\u2018So what do they do?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, it varies ...\u2019 I say vaguely. \u2018They do lots of educational stuff ...\u2019</p><p>This is a slight fib. As far as I can tell the programme never varies. They go shopping and have tea at the Debenhams caf\u00e9 and then come home and watch Disney videos.</p><p>God, maybe Suze is right. Maybe Minnie needs more routine. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u2018A nanny will knock her into shape,\u2019 says Suze confidently. \u2018Plus she\u2019ll organize her meals and washing and everything, and Luke will see how smooth everything can be. And he\u2019ll change his mind instantly. Trust me.\u2019</p><p>I knew Suze would have the answer. This is the solution. A nanny!</p> <p>I have an image of a cross between Mary Poppins and Mrs Doubtfire, all cosy with an apron and a spoonful of sugar and lots of wise, homespun words. The whole place will be calm and smell of baking bread. Minnie will become an angel child who sits quietly making constructive Play-Doh in a pinafore, and Luke will instantly drag me off to bed and ravish me.</p><p>I mean, it would be worth it just for the ravishing.</p><p>\u2018Everyone\u2019s using Ultimate Nannies at the moment. They\u2019re the latest thing.\u2019 Suze has already opened up my laptop and found the website. \u2018Have a look. I\u2019ll pop down and check on the children.\u2019</p><p>I take the laptop from her and find myself looking at a website called Ultimate Nannies: raising well-balanced, accomplished children who will be the successes of tomorrow.</p><p>My jaw sags slightly as I scroll down. Bloody hell. These nannies don\u2019t look anything like Mrs Doubtfire. They look like Elle McPherson. They\u2019ve all got perfect teeth and perfect abs and intelligent-looking smiles.</p><p>Our modern, trained nannies are loving, trustworthy and educated. They will take full control of your child\u2019s routine and cook a balanced menu. They will stimulate your child\u2019s development, physically, emotionally and intellectually. Ultimate Nannies are highly qualified in child nutrition, safety, cultural enrichment and creative play. Many are fluent in French/Mandarin and/or offer instruction in music, Kumon maths, martial arts or ballet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel totally inadequate as I scroll through pictures of smiley girls with long shiny hair cooking vegetable risottos, bouncing balls in the garden, or dressed up in judo kit. No wonder Minnie has tantrums. It\u2019s because no one\u2019s doing martial arts or making sushi with her. All this time, I\u2019ve totally deprived her. Suddenly making jam tarts in the kitchen with Mum seems totally lame. We don\u2019t even make the pastry ourselves, we get it out of a packet. We have to hire an Ultimate Nanny, as soon as possible.</p><p>The only thing is \u2013 tiny point \u2013 do I want some shiny-haired girl dancing around the place in her tight jeans and sushi-making apron? What if she and Luke really hit it off? What if he wants \u2018martial arts\u2019 lessons too?</p><p>I hesitate for a moment, my hand hovering over the mouse-pad. Come on. I have to be mature here. I have to think of the benefits to Minnie. I have to remember that I have a loving, faithful husband, and that last time I thought he was playing away with a shiny-red-haired girl whose name I won\u2019t even deign to remember (you see, Venetia? That\u2019s how little you mean to me), I\u2019d got it all wrong.</p><p>Plus, if the nanny is really sexy and swishy-haired, I can arrange her hours so Luke never sees her.</p> <p>Seized by determination, I fill in the form and press \u2018Send\u2019. This is the answer! Bring in the experts. The only person I\u2019ll have to talk round is Mum. She\u2019s not keen on nannies. Or day-care. Or even babysitters. But that\u2019s only because she watches too many Real Life Dramas about evil nutcase nannies. I mean, not every nanny can be a stalker impersonating a dead woman with the FBI on her tail, surely?</p><p>And doesn\u2019t she want her grandchild to be accomplished and well balanced? Doesn\u2019t she want Minnie to be a success of tomorrow?</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>I head downstairs and find Suze with Luke and Tarquin in the sitting room. There\u2019s an empty coffee pot and a massive mound of paperwork on the table. They\u2019ve obviously been hard at it.</p><p>\u2018You have to think of Shetland Shortbread as a brand,\u2019 Luke is saying. \u2018You\u2019re sitting on something that could be a huge global success, but you need to raise its profile. Find a story, a personality, a USP, an angle. Establish your brand values.\u2019 He looks all fired up and enthusiastic, the way he always does when he can see potential in a new project.</p> <p>Tarquin, on the other hand, looks like a rabbit caught in the headlights.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 he says nervously. \u2018Brand values. Ahm ... Suze, darling, Luke\u2019s been terribly helpful. We can\u2019t thank you enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really, it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 Luke claps him on the shoulder. \u2018But you need to sort yourself out, Tarquin. Build an effective business team, strategize, and go from there.\u2019</p><p>I stifle a giggle. Even I know that Tarquin isn\u2019t the strategizing sort.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll read those contracts for you and give you my take on them.\u2019 Luke picks up his BlackBerry. \u2018I know your people have approved them, but as I said, I think you can do better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really, Luke,\u2019 protests Tarquin feebly. \u2018You\u2019ve given me far too much time and expertise already ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u2019 Luke shoots him a brief smile and switches his BlackBerry back on.</p><p>Tarquin\u2019s bony face is growing flushed. He shoots an agonized glance at Suze, twists his hands and clears his throat.</p><p>\u2018Luke, I know you have your own company,\u2019 he suddenly blurts out. \u2018But I\u2019d be delighted to offer you a job. Business manager of the entire estate, all my concerns. Any salary. Any terms.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A job?\u2019 Luke looks taken aback.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yes!\u2019 Suze claps her hands with enthusiasm. \u2018Brilliant idea! That would be amazing. We could provide accommodation, too, couldn\u2019t we?\u2019 she adds to Tarkie. \u2018The little castle in Perthshire would be perfect! I mean, not nearly as nice as your house in Maida Vale,\u2019 she adds loyally. \u2018But as a second home?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Any terms?\u2019 says Luke slowly.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 replies Tarquin after only a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u2018Yes, of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do it for 60 per cent of all gross revenues,\u2019 Luke shoots back.</p> <p>There\u2019s a stunned silence. I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. Is Luke seriously considering giving up Brandon Communications to run the Cleath-Stuart estate?</p><p>Would we live in a castle?</p><p>Oh my God. We\u2019d be a clan. We could have our own tartan! Hot pink with silver and black. It would be the \u2018McBloomwood of Brandon\u2019 tartan, and we\u2019d do Scottish dancing and Luke would wear a sporran ...</p><p>\u2018I ... ahm ...\u2019 Tarquin glances wildly at Suze. \u2018Ahm. That seems ... reasonable ...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Tarquin!\u2019 Luke practically explodes. \u2018Of course 60 per cent is not bloody reasonable!

I\u2019d already mentally moved into a Scottish castle and called our second baby Morag.</p><p>\u2018Well, you must please let me buy you a titchy,\u2019 Tarquin is saying to Luke in those posh, stilted tones of his. \u2018Or lunch? Or could I offer you a weekend\u2019s shooting? Or ... or ... a summer in our house in France? Or ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Jesus Christ,\u2019 Luke suddenly says in a low voice. He seems stunned by whatever he\u2019s reading on the BlackBerry.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I say, alert. \u2018What is it?\u2019</p><p>Luke looks up and for the first time seems to realize that we\u2019re all watching him.</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 He puts on the smooth smile which means he\u2019s not about to discuss it. \u2018Becky, I must go. I\u2019ll be late tonight, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t go!\u2019 I say in dismay. \u2018What about our second Christmas? What about Jess and Tom?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Give them my love.\u2019 He\u2019s already out of the room.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 I call after him. \u2018What\u2019s the crisis?\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t answer, and a moment later I hear the front door bang.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s that at the door?\u2019 Mum\u2019s voice travels down the hall. \u2018Is somebody there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s only Luke,\u2019 I call back. \u2018He\u2019s got to go into work, there\u2019s been an emergency\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No it\u2019s not!\u2019 I can hear the front door opening and Dad\u2019s voice raised. \u2018Jess! Tom! Welcome!\u2019</p><p>Jess is here? Oh my God!</p> <p>I hurry into the hall, followed by Suze, and there she is. As tall and thin and toned as ever, with a deep tan and cropped hair bleached by the sun, in a grey hoody over faded black jeans.</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 She hugs me, dropping her mammoth rucksack. \u2018Good to see you. We just saw Luke rushing off. Hi, Suze.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Welcome back! Hi, Tom!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Has anyone texted Janice?\u2019 Mum hurries out of the kitchen. \u2018Does Janice know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call over the fence,\u2019 says Dad. \u2018Much quicker than sending a text.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quicker than a text?\u2019 retorts Mum. \u2018Nonsense! Texts are instant, Graham. It\u2019s called modern technology.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think you could send a text more quickly than I could call over the fence?\u2019 replies Dad, scoffingly. \u2018I\u2019d like to see you try. By the time you get your phone out\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018By the time you\u2019ve walked across, I\u2019ll have sent the text!\u2019 Mum\u2019s already whipped her phone out.</p> <p>\u2018Janice!\u2019 Dad yells as he hurries across the drive. \u2018Janice, Tom is here! You see?\u2019 he calls back triumphantly to Mum. \u2018Good, old-fashioned, instant communication. The human voice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d forgotten what your parents are like,\u2019 says Tom in an amused undertone to me, and I grin back. He\u2019s looking good. Edgier than before, unshaven and leaner round the cheeks. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s finally grown into his face. Plus he\u2019s chewing gum, so the breath isn\u2019t an issue. \u2018Jane,\u2019 he adds, \u2018I\u2019m heading home anyway, so you really don\u2019t need to text my mum\u2014\u2019</p><p>Mum ignores him. \u2018You think texts are quicker, don\u2019t you, Becky love?\u2019 she says firmly as she taps at her phone. \u2018You tell your father to stop living in the Dark Ages.\u2019</p><p>But I don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m too transfixed by Jess\u2019s left hand as she undoes her hoody zip. She\u2019s wearing a ring! On her fourth finger! OK, it\u2019s not exactly a Cartier solitaire. It\u2019s made of bone or wood or something, with what looks like a tiny grey pebble set in it.</p><p>Still, it\u2019s a ring! On her engagement finger!</p><p>I catch Suze\u2019s eye, and she\u2019s obviously noticed it too. This is so cool. Another family wedding! Minnie can be a bridesmaid!</p><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019 Mum looks alertly from Suze to me. \u2018What are you \u2013 Oh!\u2019 She suddenly clocks the ring too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tom has disappeared and Jess is bending over her rucksack, oblivious of us. Mum starts mouthing something long and elaborate above her head. She repeats it several times, looking frustrated that we can\u2019t understand. Then she starts gesturing, and I get a fit of the giggles.</p><p>\u2018Come into the sitting room!\u2019 I manage to say to Jess. \u2018Sit down. You must be exhausted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll make some tea,\u2019 Mum nods.</p><p>Trust Jess to get engaged all discreetly and not say a word. If it were me I\u2019d have run straight in saying \u2018Guess what? Look at my pebble ring!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Jess!\u2019 Janice\u2019s high-pitched voice greets us as she arrives at the front door. Her hair is freshly dyed a virulent auburn, and she\u2019s wearing mauve eyeshadow which matches her shoes and her bracelet. \u2018Love! Welcome back!\u2019</p><p>Her gaze falls instantly on Jess\u2019s ring. Instantly. Her chin jerks up, and she inhales sharply, then catches Mum\u2019s eye.</p><p>I\u2019m going to erupt with laughter if I don\u2019t get away. I follow Mum into the kitchen, where the children are all sitting in front of The Little Mermaid. We make the tea and cut the children some ham sandwiches, all the time whispering about the ring and when Jess and Tom are going to tell everyone.</p><p>\u2018We must all act naturally,\u2019 Mum says, putting two bottles of champagne in the freezer to cool down quickly. \u2018Pretend we haven\u2019t noticed. Let them tell us in their own time.\u2019</p><p>Yeah right. As we enter the sitting room, Jess is on the sofa, apparently unaware of Janice, Martin, Dad and Suze sitting in a semi-circle opposite, all staring at her left hand as though it\u2019s glowing radioactive. As I sit down I glance out of the window and see Tarquin with Ernie in the garden. Tarkie\u2019s making weird lunging gestures with his arms, which Ernie is copying beside him. I nudge Suze and say in an undertone, \u2018I didn\u2019t know Tarkie did t\u2019ai chi! He\u2019s really good!\u2019</p> <p>Suze swivels round and peers out of the window. \u2018That\u2019s not t\u2019ai chi! They\u2019re practising fly-fishing.\u2019</p><p>Both Tarkie and Ernie look totally absorbed \u2013 in fact, they make a really sweet sight, like a father bear teaching its baby cub to hunt on a TV nature documentary. (Except for the tiny fact that they\u2019re trying to catch imaginary fish. With nonexistent rods.)</p><p>\u2018You know, Ernie\u2019s already caught a trout in our river!\u2019 says Suze proudly. \u2018With only a teeny bit of help.\u2019</p><p>You see. I knew he was talented. He\u2019s obviously at the wrong school. He should be at fish-catching school.</p><p>\u2018So!\u2019 says Mum brightly. \u2018Tea, Jess?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, thanks.\u2019 Jess nods. We pour out tea and there\u2019s a little pause. A little \u2018Does anyone have any announcements to make?\u2019 kind of pause. But Tom and Jess say nothing.</p> <p>Janice puts her cup to her lips, then puts it down again, then breathes out shakily as though she can\u2019t bear the tension. Then her face lights up.</p><p>\u2018Your present! Jess, I made you a little something ...\u2019 She practically gallops to the tree, picks up a parcel, and starts ripping off the wrapping paper herself. \u2018Home-made honey hand cream,\u2019 she says breathlessly. \u2018I told you I\u2019ve started making cosmetics, all natural ingredients ... Put some on!\u2019</p><p>Janice thrusts the hand cream at Jess. We all watch, mesmerized, as Jess takes the ring off, applies hand cream, then puts the ring back on, without saying a word.</p><p>Nice try, Janice, I feel like saying. Good effort.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s great.\u2019 Jess sniffs her hand. \u2018Thanks, Janice. Good for you, making your own.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve all got you eco things, love,\u2019 says Mum fondly. \u2018We know how you are, with your chlorine dyes and your natural fibres. It\u2019s been quite an education for us, hasn\u2019t it, Becky?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m glad.\u2019 Jess takes a sip of tea. \u2018It\u2019s amazing how Western consumers are still so misguided.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I shake my head pityingly. \u2018They have no idea.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018They\u2019ll fall for anything with the word \u201cgreen\u201d in it.\u2019 Jess shakes her head. \u2018There\u2019s apparently some vile, irresponsible company that sells yoga mats made of toxic computer parts. Trying to peddle them as \u201crecycled\u201d. Guatemalan kids are getting asthma, making them.\u2019 She bangs the sofa with her hand. \u2018How can anyone be stupid enough to think that\u2019s a good idea?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, yes.\u2019 I swallow hard, my face hot, not daring to look at Mum. \u2018What total utter morons they must be. Actually, I\u2019ll just tidy up the presents a bit ...\u2019</p><p>Trying to look casual, I head towards the Christmas tree and shove the Guatemalan yoga mat behind the curtains with my foot. That\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll believe that so-called bloody \u2018green\u2019 catalogue. They said they were helping people, not giving them asthma! And what am I going to give Jess now? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018My present for you hasn\u2019t arrived yet,\u2019 I say to Jess as I resume my seat. \u2018But it\u2019s ... er ... potatoes. A great big sack. I know how much you like them. And you can use the sack afterwards as organic recycled luggage.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Jess looks a bit taken aback. \u2018Thanks, Becky.\u2019 She takes a sip of tea. \u2018So, how are preparations going for the christening?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brilliantly, thanks.\u2019 I seize on the change of subject with relief. \u2018The theme is Russian. We\u2019re going to have blinis with caviar and vodka shots, and I\u2019ve got the most gorgeous dress for Minnie to wear\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have you decided about middle names yet?\u2019 Mum chimes in. \u2018Because Reverend Parker was on the phone yesterday, asking. You really have to come to a decision, love.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I will!\u2019 I say defensively. \u2018It\u2019s just really hard!\u2019</p><p>We couldn\u2019t quite choose Minnie\u2019s middle names when we went to register her birth. (OK, the truth is, we had a slight argument. Luke was totally unreasonable about Dior. And Temperley. And no way was I agreeing to Gertrude, even if it is from Shakespeare.) So we just put her down as Minnie Brandon and decided we\u2019d finalize the other names at the christening. The trouble is, the more time goes by the harder it gets. And Luke just laughs whenever he reads my choices and says, \u2018Why does she need any middle names, anyway?\u2019 which is really unhelpful.</p><p>\u2018So, do you have any news, Tom?\u2019 Janice blurts out in sudden desperation. \u2018Has anything happened? Anything to tell? Big, small ... anything? Anything at all?\u2019 She\u2019s leaning forward on her chair like a seal ready to catch a fish.</p><p>\u2018Well, yes.\u2019 Tom gives the tiniest of grins. \u2018As it happens, we do.\u2019 And for the first time, he and Jess exchange one of those \u2018Shall we tell them?\u2019 looks.</p><p>Oh my God.</p> <p>They really are! They\u2019re engaged!</p><p>Mum and Janice have both stiffened on the sofa; in fact, Janice looks like she\u2019s about to implode. Suze winks at me and I grin back happily. We\u2019ll have such fun! We can start buying Brides and I\u2019ll help Jess choose her wedding dress, and she\u2019s not wearing some dreary old recycled hemp thing, even if it is greener\u2014</p><p>\u2018Jess and I would like to announce ...\u2019 Tom looks happily around the room. \u2018We\u2019re married.\u2019</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Everyone\u2019s still in a state of shock. I mean, obviously it\u2019s great that Tom and Jess are married. It\u2019s fab. It\u2019s just we all feel like we\u2019ve missed a step.</p><p>Did they have to do it in Chile in some tiny registry office with only two witnesses and not even let us watch on Skype? We could have had a party. We could have toasted them. Jess says they didn\u2019t even have any champagne. They drank some local beer, apparently.</p> <p>Beer.</p><p>There are some things I don\u2019t understand about Jess and never will. No wedding dress. No flowers. No photo album. No champagne. The only single thing she got out of her wedding was a husband.</p><p>(I mean, obviously the husband is the main point when you get married. Absolutely. That goes without saying. But still, not even a new pair of shoes?)</p><p>And poor old Janice! As they announced the news, her face rose and fell like a rollercoaster. You could tell she was trying desperately to look happy and supportive, as if a distant wedding in Chile that she wasn\u2019t even invited to was exactly what she\u2019d hoped for all along. Except that a tiny tear in the corner of her eye gave her away. Especially after Jess said they didn\u2019t want a reception at the golf club, or a wedding list at John Lewis, and refused point-blank to dress up in a hired wedding dress and pose for photos with Janice and Martin in the garden.</p><p>Janice looked so miserable, I nearly volunteered to instead. It sounded quite fun, actually, and I saw some amazing wedding dresses in the window of Liberty the other day ...</p><p>Anyway, I suppose that wouldn\u2019t exactly have been the point.</p><p>I finish doing my lipgloss and stand back to survey my reflection. I just hope Janice is more cheerful today. It\u2019s supposed to be a celebration, after all.</p><p>I smooth my outfit down and do a little twirl in front of the mirror. I\u2019m wearing this amazing deep-blue dress with a fake-fur hem, long button boots and a fake-fur muff. Plus I\u2019ve got a long coat edged with braid, and a huge fake-fur hat.</p> <p>Minnie\u2019s sitting on my bed trying on all my hats, which is her favourite occupation. She\u2019s in a little fur-trimmed dress, too, and white boots that make her look like a skater. I am so into this Russian theme \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m toying with getting Reverend Parker to christen her Minska.</p><p>Minska Katinka Karenina Brodsky Brandon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Come on, Minska!\u2019 I say experimentally. \u2018Time to go and get christened! Take off that hat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mine.\u2019 She clings on to my red Phillip Treacy with the big feather. \u2018Mine hat.\u2019</p><p>She looks so cute, I can\u2019t bring myself to drag it off her. Plus I might rip the feather. And does it really matter if she wears a hat?</p><p>\u2018OK, darling.\u2019 I relent. \u2018You can wear the hat. Now, let\u2019s go.\u2019 I hold out my hand.</p> <p>\u2018Mine.\u2019 She instantly clings on to the Balenciaga bag which was lying on the bed. \u2018Mine. Miiiine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Minnie, that\u2019s Mummy\u2019s bag,\u2019 I point out reasonably. \u2018You\u2019ve got your own little bag. Shall we find it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miiiiine! Miiiiine bag!\u2019 she cries furiously and backs away from me. She\u2019s holding on to the Balenciaga bag like it\u2019s the last lifebelt in the ocean and she\u2019s not about to relinquish it to anybody.</p><p>\u2018Minnie ...\u2019 I sigh.</p><p>To be fair, she does have a point. The Balenciaga bag is way nicer than her own little toy bag. Put it this way, if I were being christened, I\u2019d want a Balenciaga bag too.</p> <p>\u2018Well, OK. You have it and I\u2019ll take the Miu Miu. But just for today. Now give me those sunglasses ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miiiine! Miiiine!\u2019</p><p>She clings on to the vintage Seventies shades which she swiped from my dressing table earlier. They\u2019re pink hearts and keep slipping down her nose.</p><p>\u2018Minnie, you can\u2019t go to your christening in sunglasses. Don\u2019t be so silly!\u2019 I try to sound severe.</p><p>Although actually, she\u2019s rocking quite a good look, what with the hat, the pink shades and the Balenciaga bag.</p><p>\u2018Well ... fine,\u2019 I say at last. \u2018Just don\u2019t break them.\u2019</p> <p>As we stand in front of the mirror in our Russian dresses, I can\u2019t help feeling a swell of pride. Minnie looks so gorgeous. Maybe Suze is right. Maybe today will change Luke\u2019s mind. He\u2019ll see her looking adorable and instantly soften and decide he wants a whole brood of ten.</p><p>(Actually, he\u2019d better not. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing the birth thing ten times. Even twice is asking a lot and the only way I\u2019ll get through it another time is by focusing on the matching pom-pom hats.)</p><p>Speaking of Luke, where is he? He popped into the office this morning, but he swore he\u2019d be back by eleven. It\u2019s quarter to, already.</p><p>How are u doing? I text him quickly. On way back I hope? Then I pop my phone into my bag and take Minnie\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 I beam at her. \u2018Time for your special day.\u2019</p><p>As we head downstairs I can hear the bustle of the caterers, and Dad humming to himself as he does his tie. There are flower arrangements in the hall, and glasses being arranged on the hall table.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call you from the church ...\u2019 Mum is saying to someone as she comes out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Oh, hi, Mum.\u2019 I look at her in surprise. She\u2019s wearing the Japanese kimono that Janice brought her back from Tokyo, her hair is scraped back into a bun and her feet are in little silk slippers. \u2018What are you doing in that outfit? Shouldn\u2019t you be changed by now?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018This is what I\u2019m wearing, love.\u2019 She pats it self-consciously. \u2018Janice gave it to me, remember? Pure silk. Such good quality.\u2019</p><p>Have I missed a step here?</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s lovely. But it\u2019s Japanese. The theme\u2019s Russian, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Mum looks vaguely around as though distracted by something. \u2018Well, I don\u2019t suppose it really matters ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes it does!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, love.\u2019 Mum makes a face. \u2018You know fur irritates my skin. I\u2019ve been longing to wear this. And Janice has the most exquisite Japanese wedding coat, you\u2019ll love it\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018What, you mean Janice is coming in a Japanese outfit as well?\u2019 I cut her off in indignation.</p><p>I should have known this would happen. Mum\u2019s been pushing a Japanese theme ever since Janice came back from her holiday to Tokyo and started holding sushi-and-bridge evenings. But the point is, I\u2019m in charge, and I said the theme was Russian.</p><p>\u2018Sorry to interrupt!\u2019 A cheerful woman from the caterers comes past with a covered silver tray. \u2018Where shall I put the Asian platters, Jane?\u2019</p><p>What?</p><p>\u2018Excuse me.\u2019 I whip round to the caterer. \u2018I ordered Russian food! Caviar, smoked salmon, little Russian cakes, vodka ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Plus Asian platters, sushi and sashimi.\u2019 The woman looks alarmed. \u2018Isn\u2019t that right? And sake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quite right,\u2019 says Mum hastily. \u2018Take them into the kitchen. Thanks, Noreen.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fold my arms and glare at Mum. \u2018Who ordered sushi?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I may have added a few items to the menu,\u2019 says Mum, looking a bit evasive. \u2018Just for variety.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s a Russian theme!\u2019</p><p>I feel like stamping my foot. What is the point of having a theme if people ignore it and set up their own totally different theme, without even telling you?</p> <p>\u2018We can have two themes, love!\u2019 suggests Mum brightly.</p><p>\u2018No we can\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It can be Japanese-Russian fusion.\u2019 She nods triumphantly. \u2018All the celebrities do fusion these days.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But\u2014\u2019 I halt, mid-stream.</p><p>Japanese-Russian fusion. Actually, that\u2019s quite cool. In fact, I wish I\u2019d thought of it.</p> <p>\u2018You can put some chopsticks in your hair. You\u2019ll look lovely!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, OK,\u2019 I say at last, a bit grudgingly. \u2018I suppose we could do that.\u2019 I get out my phone and quickly text Suze and Danny:</p><p>Hey. New theme for today is Russian-Japanese fusion. C u later! xxx</p><p>Immediately I get a ping back from Suze:</p><p>Japanese?? How do I do that??? Sx</p><p>Chopsticks in hair? I reply.</p> <p>Mum has already produced some black lacquer chopsticks and is trying to stick them into my hair. \u2018We need a kirby grip,\u2019 she says, tutting. \u2018Now, what about Luke?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He won\u2019t wear chopsticks in his hair.\u2019 I shake my head. \u2018Whatever the theme is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, silly!\u2019 Mum clicks her tongue. \u2018I meant, is he nearly here?\u2019</p><p>We both instinctively glance at our watches. Luke has sworn he won\u2019t be late for the christening about sixty-five times.</p><p>I mean, he won\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>God knows what this mammoth, mega work crisis is. He won\u2019t say anything about it, or even which client it is. But something must have gone fairly pear-shaped, because he\u2019s barely even been home in the last couple of days, and when he\u2019s called he\u2019s only spoken for about three seconds before ringing off again. I take out my phone again and text him:</p><p>R u nearly back?? Where r u????</p><p>A moment later a reply pings back:</p> <p>Doing best. L</p><p>Doing best? What\u2019s that supposed to mean? Is he in the car or not? Don\u2019t say he hasn\u2019t even left the office. I feel a sudden pain under my ribs. He can\u2019t be late for his own daughter\u2019s christening. He can\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018Where\u2019s Luke?\u2019 Dad comes past. \u2018Any sign of him yet?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cutting it a little fine, isn\u2019t he?\u2019 Dad raises his eyebrows.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll be here!\u2019 I muster a confident smile. \u2018There\u2019s still plenty of time.\u2019</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t arrive and he doesn\u2019t arrive. The caterers have finished setting up. Everything\u2019s ready. By twenty to twelve I\u2019m standing with Minnie in the hall, staring out at the drive. I was texting him every five minutes but I\u2019ve given up now. I feel a bit dreamlike. Where is he? How can he not be here?</p><p>\u2018Love, we need to go.\u2019 Mum has come up softly behind me. \u2018Everyone will be arriving at the church.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But ...\u2019 I turn to see her face all creased up anxiously. She\u2019s right. We can\u2019t let everyone down. \u2018OK. Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>As we leave the house I get out my phone and start to text yet again, my vision a little blurred.</p><p>Dear Luke, we are going to church. You are missing christening.</p><p>I buckle Minnie into her little seat in Dad\u2019s car and slide in beside her. I can tell that Mum and Dad are almost killing themselves with restraint, not laying into Luke.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a good reason,\u2019 says Dad at last, as he pulls out of the drive. There\u2019s silence, as obviously none of us can think of what that reason might be.</p><p>\u2018What was it again, love?\u2019 ventures Mum. \u2018Some crisis?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Apparently.\u2019 I\u2019m staring rigidly out of the window. \u2018Something huge. But it might not happen. That\u2019s all I know.\u2019 My phone suddenly pings.</p><p>Becky, so sorry. Can\u2019t explain. Still here. Will take helicopter asap. Wait for me. L</p><p>I stare at my phone in slight disbelief. Helicopter? He\u2019s coming by helicopter?</p><p>All of a sudden I feel a bit cheered up. In fact, I almost forgive him for disappearing off and being so mysterious. I\u2019m about to tell Mum and Dad (very casually) about the helicopter, when the phone bleeps again.</p><p>May be a little while yet. Shit about to hit fan. What shit? I text back, feeling prickles of frustration. What fan?</p><p>But there\u2019s no reply. Aargh, he\u2019s so annoying. He always has to be so mysterious. It\u2019s probably just some boring old investment fund that made slightly fewer zillions of pounds than it was supposed to.

(I am so having it out with Mum later.) I hear myself saying about fifty times, \u2018Actually, it\u2019s a Japanese-Russian fusion theme\u2019 and \u2018Luke\u2019s just on his way by helicopter,\u2019 then Mum leads Minnie off by the hand and I can hear everyone cooing over her.</p><p>\u2018Bex!\u2019 I turn to see Suze, looking amazing in a purple embroidered coat, fur-trimmed boots and her hair pinned up with a couple of wooden coffee stirrers from Starbucks.</p><p>\u2018This was the best I could do,\u2019 she says, gesturing at them crossly. \u2018You said Russian! How did Japanese suddenly enter the picture?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was Mum\u2019s fault!\u2019 I\u2019m about to launch into the whole story when the Reverend Parker approaches, all smart in his swishy white robes.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, hi there!\u2019 I beam. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p><p>Reverend Parker is fab. He isn\u2019t one of those super-holy, make-you-feel-bad-about-everything vicars. He\u2019s more of a Do-have-a-gin-and-tonic-before-lunch vicar. His wife works in the City and he\u2019s always got a tan and drives a Jaguar.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m very well.\u2019 He shakes my hand warmly. \u2018Lovely to see you, Rebecca. And may I say, it\u2019s charming, your Japanese theme. I\u2019m quite a sushi fan myself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Japanese-Russian fusion, actually,\u2019 I correct him firmly. \u2018We\u2019re having blinis, too, and vodka shots.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah, indeed.\u2019 He beams. \u2018Now, I gather that Luke\u2019s been held up?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He\u2019ll be here very soon.\u2019 I cross my fingers behind my back. \u2018Any minute now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. Because I am a little pressed for time. And presumably you\u2019ve decided on your daughter\u2019s middle names? Could you possibly write them down for me?\u2019</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u2018Nearly.\u2019 I pull an agonized face. \u2018I\u2019m so nearly there ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rebecca, really,\u2019 says Reverend Parker a tad impatiently. \u2018I can\u2019t baptize your daughter if I don\u2019t know her names.\u2019</p><p>Honestly, talk about pressure. I thought vicars were supposed to be understanding.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m planning to finalize them once and for all during the prayers,\u2019 I explain. \u2018While I\u2019m praying, obviously,\u2019 I add hastily at his frozen expression. \u2018You know. I might get inspiration from the Good Book.\u2019 I pick up a nearby Bible, hoping to get a few Brownie points. \u2018Very inspirational. Maybe I\u2019ll go for Eve. Or Mary.\u2019</p><p>The trouble with Reverend Parker is, he\u2019s known me for too long. He just raises his eyebrows sceptically and says, \u2018And are the godparents here? Suitable types, I hope?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course! Here\u2019s one.\u2019 I shove Suze forward, who shakes his hand and immediately starts talking about the church ceiling, and whether it\u2019s late nineteenth century?</p><p>Suze is so great. She always knows what to say to everyone. Now she\u2019s talking about the stained glass. Where does she get this stuff? She must have learned it at finishing school, after meringue lessons. I\u2019m not very interested in stained glass, to be honest, so I flick aimlessly through the Bible.</p><p>Ooh. Delilah. Now that\u2019s a cool name.</p><p>\u2018Jesus H. Christ, Becky!\u2019 A familiar American accent hits my ears. Behind me I can hear a bit of a mild kerfuffle amongst Mum\u2019s friends and someone exclaiming, \u2018Who in God\u2019s name is that?\u2019</p><p>This can only mean one thing.</p><p>\u2018Danny!\u2019 I whirl round in joy. \u2018You\u2019re here!\u2019</p> <p>It is so long since I\u2019ve seen Danny. He\u2019s looking skinnier than ever and is wearing a Cossack-style swirly coat in leather, with tight black vinyl trousers and Army boots. Plus he has a tiny white dog on a lead that I\u2019ve never seen before. I make to hug him, but he lifts up a hand as though he has some momentous announcement to make.</p><p>\u2018This theme?\u2019 he says incredulously. \u2018Japanese-slash-Russian-fucking-fusion? How much more fucking inspired can you get? My new dog is only a fucking shih-tzu!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No way!\u2019 Suddenly I remember Reverend Parker, standing a foot away. \u2018Er ... Reverend Parker ... this is Danny Kovitz. Another of the godparents.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh Jeez.\u2019 Danny claps a hand over his mouth. \u2018I apologize, Reverend. Loving the church,\u2019 he adds generously, gesturing around. \u2018Loving your d\u00e9cor. Did someone help you with these colours?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re very kind.\u2019 Reverend Parker gives him a stiff smile. \u2018But if you could keep down the fruity language during the service?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Danny\u2019s a famous fashion designer,\u2019 I throw in hastily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Puh-lease.\u2019 Danny gives a modest laugh. \u2018Not famous. More ... renowned. Notorious. Where\u2019s Luke?\u2019 he adds to me in a lower voice. \u2018I need him. Jarek\u2019s been calling me every day. He\u2019s threatening to, like, come round.\u2019 Danny\u2019s voice rises in alarm. \u2018You know I don\u2019t do confrontation.\u2019</p><p>Jarek is Danny\u2019s former business manager. We met him last year and soon realized he was taking a massive cut of Danny\u2019s money for basically doing nothing except wearing Danny\u2019s clothes for free and having lots of lunches on expenses. Luke was the one who arranged his termination and lectured Danny about not giving people jobs just because you like their haircut.</p><p>\u2018I thought you changed all your numbers?\u2019 I say, puzzled. \u2018I thought you weren\u2019t going to take any more of Jarek\u2019s calls.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t,\u2019 he says defensively. \u2018At first. But he had great tickets for this festival in Bali, so we went to that, and that meant he had my new cell number, so ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Danny! You went to a festival with him? After you\u2019d fired him?\u2019</p><p>Danny looks caught out.</p><p>\u2018OK. I fucked up. Where\u2019s Luke?\u2019 He peers plaintively around the church. \u2018Can Luke talk to him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know where Luke is,\u2019 I say, more snappily than I meant to. \u2018He\u2019s on his way in a helicopter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A helicopter?\u2019 Danny raises his eyebrows. \u2018Quite the action man. Is he going to drop down on a wire like the SAS?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No.\u2019 I roll my eyes. \u2018Don\u2019t be silly.\u2019</p><p>Although come to think of it, maybe he will. I mean, where else are they going to find a place to land a helicopter?</p><p>I get out my phone and text Luke:</p><p>R u in helicopter yet? Where r u going to land? On roof?</p><p>\u2018Oh my God. Have you seen his lordship?\u2019 Danny\u2019s been distracted by the sight of Tarquin. \u2018Be still my beating crotch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Danny!\u2019 I hit his arm and glance at Reverend Parker, who thankfully has moved away. \u2018We\u2019re in church, remember?\u2019</p> <p>Danny has always had a bit of a thing about Tarquin. And to be fair, Tarquin looks pretty extraordinary today. He\u2019s wearing a white billowy shirt with black breeches and a heavy, military-style coat on top. His dark hair is all ruffled from the wind, which is a great improvement on his normal non-style, and his bony, stoaty face looks almost chiselled in the gloom of the church.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s my next collection, right in front of me.\u2019 Danny\u2019s sketching Tarquin on some old book or other. \u2018English lord meets Russian prince.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s Scottish,\u2019 I point out.</p><p>\u2018Even better. I\u2019ll throw in a kilt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Danny!\u2019 I giggle as I catch a glimpse of the sketch. \u2018You can\u2019t draw that in church!\u2019</p><p>That picture of Tarquin is not accurate. In fact, it\u2019s obscene. Although actually, I did hear once from Suze\u2019s mum that all the Cleath-Stuart men were very well endowed. Maybe it\u2019s more accurate than I realize.</p><p>\u2018So where\u2019s my god-daughter?\u2019 Danny rips off the page, folds it up and begins another drawing.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s with Mum somewhere ...\u2019 I look around for Minnie and suddenly spy her about ten yards away, standing with a group of Mum\u2019s friends. Oh God, what\u2019s she been doing now? She has about five handbags looped over her arms, and is now tugging hard at an elderly lady\u2019s shoulder bag, yelling, \u2018Miiine!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018So sweet!\u2019 I hear the lady tinkle with laughter. \u2018Here you are, Minnie, dear.\u2019 She drapes the shoulder strap around Minnie\u2019s neck, and Minnie staggers off, determinedly clutching all the bags.</p><p>\u2018Nice Balenciaga,\u2019 comments Danny. \u2018The perfect accessory when one\u2019s being christened.\u2019</p><p>I nod. \u2018That\u2019s why I let her borrow it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you settled for the Miu Miu, which I know for a fact you\u2019ve had for a year, whereas the Balenciaga is new ...\u2019 Danny gives a melodramatic sigh. \u2018I can\u2019t think of a more beautiful example of motherly love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up!\u2019 I give him a push. \u2018Keep drawing.\u2019</p><p>As I watch him sketching, a sudden thought occurs to me. If Danny really does base his next collection on Tarkie, then maybe they could join forces somehow. Maybe they could do a tie-in promotion with Shetland Shortbread! I am such a business brain. Luke will be so impressed. I\u2019m about to tell Suze my great idea, when Reverend Parker\u2019s voice booms out.</p><p>\u2018Perhaps everyone could take their seats?\u2019 He starts ushering us towards the pews. \u2018And then we can start.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Start? Already?</p><p>I tug anxiously at his white robe as he swooshes past. \u2018Um, Luke isn\u2019t here yet. So if we could just delay a little longer ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dear, we\u2019ve delayed twenty minutes already.\u2019 Reverend Parker\u2019s smile is a little chilly. \u2018If your husband isn\u2019t going to make it ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course he\u2019s going to make it!\u2019 I feel a bit stung. \u2018He\u2019s on his way. He\u2019ll be here\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Miiiiiiiiine!\u2019 A high-pitched, gleeful shriek fills the air and my whole body stiffens in alarm. My head whips round towards the front of the church and my stomach seems to drop.</p><p>Minnie has climbed over the altar rail and is standing right by the altar, turning each handbag upside-down and shaking out the contents. Behind me I can hear the dismayed little shrieks of Mum\u2019s friends as they see all their things tumbling out and rolling along the floor.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 I yell, pegging it up the aisle. \u2018STOP THAT!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miiiine!\u2019 She\u2019s joyfully shaking a Burberry shoulder bag, and coins are cascading out of it. The whole altar is a mess of purses and money and make-up compacts and lipsticks and hair brushes.</p><p>\u2018This is supposed to be your christening,\u2019 I say furiously in Minnie\u2019s ear. \u2018You\u2019re supposed to be on your best behaviour. Or you\u2019ll never get a brother or sister!\u2019</p> <p>Minnie looks totally unrepentant, even as all Mum\u2019s friends arrive and start exclaiming and tutting and scrabbling for the bags and money.</p><p>On the plus side, at least the kerfuffle delays proceedings. But even so, Reverend Parker is soon herding everyone into the pews.</p><p>\u2018If everyone could please sit down? We really need to get on ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about Luke?\u2019 whispers Mum anxiously as she takes her seat.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll make it,\u2019 I say, trying to sound confident.</p><p>I\u2019ll just have to spin things out till he arrives. There\u2019ll be loads of prayers and talking, surely. It\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>OK. I\u2019m writing to the Archbishop of Canterbury. In my opinion, christenings are far, far too short.</p><p>We\u2019re all sitting in the front few rows of the church. We\u2019ve had about two prayers and a few little bits to say about renouncing evil. We\u2019ve all sung a hymn and Minnie has spent the time shredding two hymn books. (It was the only way to keep her quiet. I\u2019ll give the church some money.) And now suddenly Reverend Parker has asked us all to gather around the font and I\u2019m panicking.</p><p>We can\u2019t be up to the splashy water bit yet. I\u2019m not letting Luke miss the big moment.</p><p>There\u2019s been no sign of him. He isn\u2019t replying to any of my texts. I\u2019m hoping against hope that he\u2019s switched off his phone because it would interfere with the helicopter controls. My neck is craned, trying to listen for a judder outside.</p><p>\u2018Minnie?\u2019 Reverend Parker smiles at her. \u2018Are you ready?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I say desperately as people start getting to their feet. \u2018Before the actual christening ... er ... Minnie\u2019s godmother Susan Cleath-Stuart wishes to recite a poem for the occasion. Don\u2019t you, Suze?\u2019</p><p>Suze instantly turns in her seat and whispers \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, Suze!\u2019 I hiss back. \u2018I need to buy some time, or Luke\u2019ll miss it!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t know any poems!\u2019 she mutters as she gets up.</p><p>\u2018Just read something out of the hymn book! Something long!\u2019</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Suze picks up a hymn book and heads to the front, then smiles around the audience.</p><p>\u2018I would like to recite ...\u2019 She opens the book and riffles through. \u2018\u201cWe Three Kings\u201d.\u2019 She clears her throat. \u2018We three kings of Orient are. Bearing gifts we traverse afar ...\u2019</p><p>Suze is such a star. She reads it at a snail\u2019s pace and does all the choruses twice through.</p><p>\u2018Very nice.\u2019 Reverend Parker stifles a yawn. \u2018And now, if you could gather round the font ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I swivel on my seat. \u2018Um, Minnie\u2019s godfather Danny Kovitz will now ...\u2019 I gaze imploringly at him. \u2018He will also ... say a poem?\u2019 Please, I mouth silently, and Danny winks back.</p><p>\u2018In honour of my god-daughter\u2019s christening I will now perform \u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d by Eminem,\u2019 he says confidently.</p><p>Yikes. I hope Reverend Parker doesn\u2019t listen too closely.</p><p>Danny isn\u2019t the best rapper in the world, but by the time he\u2019s finished, everyone\u2019s clapping and whooping, even all Mum\u2019s bridge friends. So then Danny does an encore of \u2018Stan\u2019 with Suze doing the Dido bits. Then Tom and Jess pitch in with a South American prayer for children, which is actually really moving. And then Dad takes to the floor and sings \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 with everyone joining in with the chorus and Martin conducting them with one of Janice\u2019s chopsticks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reverend Parker is starting to look seriously pissed off by now.</p><p>\u2018Thank you, everyone, for your interesting contributions,\u2019 he says tightly. \u2018And now, if you could gather round the font ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I interrupt him. \u2018As Minnie\u2019s mother, I would just like to make a short speech.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rebecca!\u2019 snaps Reverend Parker. \u2018We really do have to proceed.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Just a quick one!\u2019</p><p>I hurry to the front of the church, almost tripping up in my haste. I\u2019ll just keep talking till Luke arrives. It\u2019s the only way.</p><p>\u2018Welcome, friends and family.\u2019 I gaze around, avoiding Reverend Parker\u2019s stony eye. \u2018What a special day this is. A special, special day. Minnie is being christened.\u2019</p><p>I pause as though to let this thought sink in and quickly check my phone. Nothing.</p><p>\u2018But what do we mean by that?\u2019 I lift a finger, just like Reverend Parker does in his sermons. \u2018Or are we all just here for the ride?\u2019</p> <p>There\u2019s an interested ripple in the audience and a couple of people nudge each other and whisper. I\u2019m quite flattered, actually. I hadn\u2019t thought my speech would cause such a stir.</p><p>\u2018Because it\u2019s easy to go through life without ever looking around at the flowers.\u2019 I give a significant nod, and there are more whispers and nudges.</p><p>This reaction I\u2019m getting is amazing! Maybe I could get into preaching! I\u2019ve obviously got a natural gift for it and I do have quite a lot of profound ideas.</p><p>\u2018It makes you think, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019 I continue. \u2018But what do we mean by think?\u2019</p><p>Everyone\u2019s whispering now. People are passing iPhones along the pews and pointing at something. What\u2019s going on?</p><p>\u2018I mean, why are we all here?\u2019 My voice is drowned out by the growing hubbub.</p> <p>\u2018What\u2019s happening!\u2019 I exclaim. \u2018What are you all looking at?\u2019 Even Mum and Dad are fixated by something on Mum\u2019s BlackBerry.</p><p>\u2018Becky, you\u2019d better look at this,\u2019 says Dad in a strange voice. He gets up and passes me the BlackBerry, and I find myself looking at a TV newsreader on the BBC website.</p><p>\u2018... latest on our breaking news that the Bank of London has agreed emergency funding from the Bank of England. This comes after days of secret talks, in which bosses battled to save the situation ...\u2019</p><p>The newsreader continues talking, but I don\u2019t hear what he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m gripped by the picture. It\u2019s of several men in suits leaving the Bank of England, looking grim. One of them is Luke. Luke was at the Bank of England?</p><p>Oh God. Is he at the Bank of England now?</p><p>The picture on the screen has changed to a group of commentators sitting round a table, looking grave, with that girl TV presenter in the glasses who always interrupts people.</p><p>\u2018So, essentially, the Bank of London is bust, is that right?\u2019 she says in that forceful way she has.</p><p>\u2018\u201cBust\u201d is a very strong word ...\u2019 one of the commentators begins \u2013 but I can\u2019t hear what else he says because of the havoc breaking out in the church.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s bust!\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Bank of London\u2019s gone bust!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But that\u2019s where all our money is!\u2019 Mum looks a bit hysterical. \u2018Graham, do something! Get it out! Get the money!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Our holiday fund!\u2019 Janice moans.</p><p>\u2018My pension!\u2019 An elderly man is struggling to his feet.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure we shouldn\u2019t overreact,\u2019 Jess is saying above the hubbub. \u2018I\u2019m sure no one will lose anything, banks are guaranteed ...\u2019 But no one\u2019s listening to her.</p><p>\u2018My portfolio!\u2019 Reverend Parker rips off his robes and heads for the door of the church.</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t just leave!\u2019 I call after him incredulously. \u2018You haven\u2019t christened Minnie yet!\u2019 But he totally ignores me \u2013 and to my amazement, Mum is hotfooting it after him.</p><p>\u2018Mum! Come back!\u2019</p><p>I grab Minnie\u2019s hand before she legs it too. Everyone\u2019s leaving. Within moments the church is empty, except for me and Minnie, Suze, Tarkie, Jess, Tom and Danny. We all glance at each other \u2013 then in silent accord, hurry to the back of the church. We burst out of the big wooden door \u2013 and then all just stand there in the porch in shock.</p><p>\u2018Sweet Jesus,\u2019 breathes Danny.</p><p>The high street is full of people. There must be two hundred, three hundred, maybe. All streaming the same way along the pavement to the tiny branch of Bank of London, outside which a queue has already formed. I can see Mum anxiously jostling for a place, and Reverend Parker blatantly queue-barging in front of an old lady, while a young, panic-stricken guy in bank-teller\u2019s uniform tries to keep order. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I\u2019m gaping at the scene, something attracts my attention. Just along from the Bank of London, directly opposite the church, I glimpse a figure in the throng. Dark helmet-like hair, pale skin, Jackie O-type sunglasses, houndstooth suit ...</p><p>I peer harder in disbelief. Is that ...</p><p>That can\u2019t be ...</p><p>Elinor?</p> <p>But as I\u2019m trying to focus, she \u2013 or whoever it was \u2013 disappears into the crowd.

I must have imagined it.</p><p>\u2018Look at the cop,\u2019 says Danny in delight. \u2018He\u2019s about to lose it. He\u2019s going to start tasering people in a minute.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh my God!\u2019 Suze suddenly points upwards with a gasp.</p><p>This is unreal. Now there are people climbing on the roof of the bank. I exchange flabbergasted looks with Suze. It\u2019s like aliens have invaded, or war has broken out, or something. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, my whole entire life.</p> <p>FIVE</p><p>Well, at least it all makes sense now. At least I can forgive Luke. This is about the first time he\u2019s had a so-called \u2018major crisis\u2019 at work and it really is a proper, genuine crisis. No one can talk about anything else. Every news channel is covering it.</p><p>I\u2019ve spoken to Luke on the phone and he\u2019s going to make it home when he can. But there was no way he could have left any earlier. He was at the Bank of England seeing all sorts of top people. And now he\u2019s trying to \u2018manage the situation\u2019 and \u2018limit the damage\u2019. Every single branch of the Bank of London has been besieged. Apparently the Prime Minister himself is going to make a statement and ask everyone to calm down. (Which if you ask me is a big mistake. Mum\u2019s already convinced the whole thing is a government conspiracy.)</p><p>\u2018Tea?\u2019 Dad comes into the snug, where Danny, Suze, Tarquin, Jess, Tom and I are all sitting, still in a bit of a numb daze. The TV is on Sky News and they keep playing the same clip, the one with a stern-faced Luke with all his equally stern-faced banker clients.</p><p>\u2018So.\u2019 Dad puts the tray down. \u2018What a to-do! Are you going to rearrange the christening?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll have to, I suppose.\u2019 I nod, and look around the room. \u2018When\u2019s everyone free?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The rest of January\u2019s not great.\u2019 Danny takes out his BlackBerry and squints at it. \u2018Although January next year is totally clear,\u2019 he adds brightly.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve got so many shooting parties ...\u2019 Suze fishes for her tiny Smythson diary.</p><p>\u2018And remember our trip to the Lake District,\u2019 Dad chimes in.</p><p>God, everyone\u2019s so busy. In the end I get everyone to write down when they\u2019re available in the next few months. Jess draws a grid and crosses off all the days and works it all out.</p><p>\u2018There are three possibles,\u2019 she says at last. \u2018The eighteenth of February, the eleventh of March or the seventh of April, which is a Friday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The seventh of April?\u2019 I look up. \u2018That\u2019s Luke\u2019s birthday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never knew that,\u2019 says Suze curiously. \u2018I\u2019ve never even known Luke to have a birthday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not really into birthdays,\u2019 I explain. \u2018Every time I organize any celebration for him, he cancels it because of some work thing.\u2019</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the things about Luke I least understand. He doesn\u2019t get over-excited about his presents; he doesn\u2019t drop little hints about what kind of treat he\u2019d like; he doesn\u2019t do a countdown on the wall calendar. One year he\u2019d actually forgotten it was his birthday when I clattered in with a breakfast tray. How can you forget your own birthday?</p><p>I glance at the TV screen again. There he is, stepping out of the Bank of England again, his forehead furrowed even more deeply than usual. I feel a rush of fondness for him. He\u2019s had such a shitty year, he deserves a treat. I should throw him a party. Even if he doesn\u2019t want it. Even if he\u2019ll try and cancel it.</p><p>And all at once the idea hits me.</p><p>\u2018Hey! What about if I throw Luke a surprise party?\u2019 I look around in excitement. \u2018He\u2019ll think we\u2019re just having Minnie\u2019s christening, reorganized ... but actually, it\u2019s his birthday party too!\u2019</p><p>I have a sudden vision of Luke walking into a darkened room and a whole crowd yelling \u2018Happy birthday!\u2019 And Luke\u2019s jaw dropping, and him being absolutely speechless with surprise ...</p><p>Oh God. I have to do this. I have to.</p><p>\u2018Good one, Bex!\u2019 Suze\u2019s eyes light up.</p><p>\u2018Awesome idea.\u2019 Danny looks up from his texting. \u2018What theme?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I dunno.

I mean, it\u2019s just like a normal party except you keep it secret. Easy.</p><p>\u2018Becky, are you sure it\u2019s a good time to be throwing a party?\u2019 says Jess with a frown. \u2018I mean, what if what they say is true?\u2019 She gestures at the TV, which is still on the Bank of London story. \u2018What if we\u2019re at the beginning of a financial catastrophe?\u2019</p><p>Trust Jess. Trust her to bring \u2018financial catastrophe\u2019 into a nice talk about a party.</p> <p>\u2018Well, then everyone will need cheering up, won\u2019t they?\u2019 I say defiantly. \u2018All the better.\u2019</p><p>Jess doesn\u2019t flicker. \u2018All I\u2019m saying is, you have to be prudent, especially at a time like this. Do you have the money to hold a party?\u2019</p><p>Honestly. What is this, \u2018Who Wants To Be A Nosy Elder Sister?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe I do.\u2019 I shrug carelessly. \u2018Maybe I\u2019ve been saving up a special fund for just such an event.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the room, apart from a little snort from Danny. Tom is smirking, and I glower back at him. Have I ever smirked at any of his projects? Did I smirk when he built his ridiculous two-storey summerhouse in Janice\u2019s garden? (Well, actually, maybe I did. But that\u2019s not the point. Summerhouses and parties are completely different.)</p> <p>Worst of all, even Suze is looking a bit pained, as if she doesn\u2019t want to laugh, but won\u2019t be able to help it. She sees me looking at her and flushes guiltily.</p><p>\u2018The thing is, it doesn\u2019t have to be an expensive party, does it?\u2019 she says hurriedly. \u2018You could throw a restrained party, Bex. A thrifty party!\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s true.\u2019 Jess nods. \u2018Tom can make home-made peach wine. It\u2019s not bad at all. And I\u2019m happy to cook.\u2019</p><p>Home-made \u2013peach wine?</p><p>\u2018And you could have music off an iPod ...\u2019 suggests Tom.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m in charge of the iPod,\u2019 chips in Danny.</p> <p>\u2018We could make paper chains ...\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m staring at them all in horror. One tiny little bank goes bust and suddenly we\u2019re having to act like it\u2019s the war and make Spam fritters and stain our legs because we can\u2019t afford stockings?</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to throw Luke some crappy party with homemade peach wine and an iPod!\u2019 I exclaim. \u2018I want a fabulous party! I want a marquee and a band, and caterers, and amazing lights everywhere ... and entertainment! Jugglers and fire-eaters and stuff.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you can throw a nice party without fire-eaters\u2014\u2019 begins Suze.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want something \u201cnice\u201d,\u2019 I say disparagingly. \u2018If I throw Luke a surprise party, I want it to blow him away. I want to knock his socks off. I want him to walk in and be utterly speechless for ... a whole minute. At least.\u2019</p><p>All my friends are exchanging looks.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I\u2019m looking from face to face. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on, Becky. It would cost a fortune,\u2019 says Jess bluntly. \u2018Where would you get the money?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I ... don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say defiantly. \u2018Work extra hard, maybe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll never keep it secret from Luke,\u2019 chips in Tom. \u2018Not in a million years.\u2019</p><p>I feel a surge of indignation at him; in fact, at all of them, even Suze. Why do they have to pour cold water on everything?</p><p>\u2018Yes I will!\u2019 I retort furiously. \u2018You watch. I\u2019ll organize a fabulous party and I\u2019ll totally keep it a secret from Luke\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Keep what a secret from Luke?\u2019 His deep voice resounds from the hall and I nearly jump a mile. Bloody hell, how did that happen? I\u2019ve only been planning this party for two minutes and already I\u2019ve nearly given it away. I just have time to shoot an anguished look at Suze before Luke appears through the door. He\u2019s holding Minnie and looks surprisingly cheerful.</p><p>\u2018How come you\u2019re back?\u2019 I ask, as he kisses me. \u2018Is it all over?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just grabbing some clean clothes, I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 he says wryly. \u2018This isn\u2019t going to be over any time soon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um, Luke, that comment you just heard me say about keeping something secret from Luke?\u2019 I clear my throat. \u2018You\u2019re probably wondering what I meant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It did cross my mind.\u2019 Luke raises his eyebrows quizzically.</p><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s just that ... um ... I didn\u2019t want to tell you how crazy it was earlier. At the Bank of London. It was mayhem. I thought it might stress you out. So I was just telling everyone to keep quiet about it.

He wants to see you. Shall I send him in here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, right,\u2019 I say in surprise. \u2018Of course!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Reverend Parker look sheepish before. As he comes into the snug, his dazzling smile is missing and he can\u2019t quite look either of us in the eyes.</p> <p>\u2018Rebecca and Luke, I do apologize,\u2019 he says. \u2018Never before have I abandoned a service mid-flow. I can\u2019t think what came over me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 I say magnanimously. \u2018We\u2019ve got over it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I assume you would still like your daughter baptized?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course we would!\u2019 I say eagerly. \u2018In fact, we were just talking about it. We\u2019ve got it all planned.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so glad.\u2019 He looks around the room. \u2018Well, you\u2019re all present and correct, so ...\u2019 Before I know what\u2019s going on, he produces a little bottle, unscrews it, and sprinkles some kind of water on Minnie\u2019s forehead. \u2018Minnie, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I say feebly, but he doesn\u2019t listen. Now he\u2019s making the sign of the cross on her forehead in oil.</p> <p>\u2018Welcome to the church, my child. The Lord bless you and keep you.\u2019 He feels in his pocket and produces a candle, which he gives to me. \u2018Congratulations, Rebecca.\u2019 Then he turns to Mum. \u2018Did you say there was sushi?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t speak for shock.</p><p>Minnie? Just Minnie?</p><p>\u2018You mean she\u2019s christened now?\u2019 I find my voice. \u2018She\u2019s done?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Indeed,\u2019 Reverend Parker says smugly. \u2018Having started a job, I do like to finish it. Again, I do apologize for the slight hiatus. Good afternoon, everyone.\u2019</p><p>He sweeps out before I can even draw breath, and I stare after him, outraged.

It\u2019s irrelevant.\u2019</p><p>I feel a pang of resentment. Everyone\u2019s just assuming I\u2019ll give up on the idea, aren\u2019t they? Everyone\u2019s assuming I can\u2019t do it. These are supposed to be my friends. They\u2019re supposed to believe in me.</p><p>Well, I\u2019ll show them.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not irrelevant. And it is going to happen.\u2019 I look around the room, feeling my resolve grow. \u2018I\u2019m not going to let that stupid vicar ruin my plans. I\u2019m still going to throw Luke a surprise birthday party. And I\u2019ll do it on a budget, and I\u2019ll keep it totally secret from Luke and I\u2019ll blow his socks off.\u2019</p><p>I just about manage to stop myself adding, So there.</p><p>\u2018Bex ...\u2019 Suze glances around at the others. \u2018It\u2019s not that we think you can\u2019t do it\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes it is!\u2019 I say indignantly. \u2018That\u2019s exactly what you said!

I\u2019ve bought a special notebook which I\u2019ve disguised by writing \u2018High-heeled boots \u2013 possible options\u2019 on the front. And already I have an extensive to-do list, which goes as follows:</p><p>Party \u2013 To-Do List</p><p>Marquee \u2013 where get? Where put? How big?</p><p>Fire-eaters \u2013 where get??</p><p>Jugglers \u2013 where get???</p><p>Theme \u2013 what?</p> <p>Food \u2013 what? how? (Chocolate fountain?)</p><p>Drink \u2013 NOT peach wine</p><p>Dancing \u2013 need dance-floor. Shiny? Black and white, lights up like in Saturday Night Fever?</p><p>Guests \u2013 who? Track down old friends? (NOT Venetia Carter or Sacha de Bonneville)</p><p>Outfit \u2013 Balmain black sequinned dress with Zanotti crystal sandals and Philippe Audibert cuff? Roland Mouret turquoise dress with strappy Prada shoes? Azzaro red minidress and black Louboutins?</p><p>OK, so a few issues are a bit unresolved as yet. But the most urgent thing is to make sure Luke stays free on 7 April and doesn\u2019t book a business trip or anything. Which means I\u2019m going to have to rope in an accomplice.</p><p>I wait until I have a moment alone in the kitchen, then dial his office number.</p><p>\u2018Luke Brandon\u2019s office, how may I help?\u2019 come the perfectly modulated tones down the phone.</p> <p>Luke\u2019s personal assistant is called Bonnie, and she\u2019s been with him for a year. She\u2019s in her forties and has mid-blonde hair which she always arranges in the same classic chignon. And she always wears understated tweed dresses and court shoes and speaks in the same soft voice. At Brandon Communications parties she\u2019s always the one on the fringes, cradling a glass of water, looking happy just to watch. I\u2019ve tried to chat to her a couple of times, but she seems quite reserved.</p><p>Anyway, apparently she\u2019s a total star. Luke had had a couple of disasters before he hired Bonnie and I\u2019ve never known anyone enthuse as much as he did when Bonnie first started. Apparently she\u2019s incredibly efficient and discreet, and almost telepathic at knowing what he\u2019s going to need. I\u2019d almost be worried, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that I can\u2019t actually imagine Bonnie having sex.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Bonnie?\u2019 I say. \u2018It\u2019s Becky here. Luke\u2019s wife.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky! How are you?\u2019</p><p>That\u2019s the other thing. She always sounds pleased to hear from me, even though she must be thinking, \u2018Oh bloody hell, it\u2019s the wife again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m good, thanks. And you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m very well. Can I put you through to Luke?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually, Bonnie, it was you I wanted to speak to. I\u2019m throwing Luke a ...\u2019 I pause and glance around in sudden paranoia, just in case Luke\u2019s come back early from work to surprise me and is even now silently creeping up behind me on tiptoes, arms outstretched. But he\u2019s not.</p><p>Huh. Why doesn\u2019t he ever do that?</p><p>Just to be doubly sure, I go and shut the kitchen door and pull a chair across it. This is all so cloak and dagger. I feel like those French Resistance girls in \u2018Allo \u2018Allo!</p><p>\u2018Becky, are you still there?\u2019 Bonnie\u2019s saying. \u2018Becky? Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Listen very carefully, I will say this only once.\u2019 I whisper into the phone in sepulchral tones. \u2018I\u2019m throwing a surprise party for Luke\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s top secret and you\u2019re only the seventh person in the world to know about it.\u2019</p><p>I almost want to add, \u2018And now I\u2019ll have to shoot you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Becky ...\u2019 Bonnie sounds confused. \u2018I can\u2019t hear you. Could you speak up?\u2019</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u2018A party!\u2019 I say more loudly. \u2018I\u2019m throwing Luke a party on the seventh of April. And I want it to be a surprise, so could you block off the date in his diary and make something up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The seventh of April.\u2019 Bonnie sounds unruffled. \u2018That should be simple enough.\u2019</p><p>You see? This is why she\u2019s a brilliant PA. She behaves as though she\u2019s done this kind of thing a million times.</p><p>\u2018And I want to invite all his friends from work, so could they all block off their diaries too? But don\u2019t make it look suspicious or anything. And don\u2019t tell anyone what it\u2019s about yet. Maybe you could say it\u2019s a big fire practice? And you should have a decoy birthday card going around the office,\u2019 I add as the thought suddenly crosses my mind. \u2018You know, nearer the time. And if Luke ever mentions his birthday, which he won\u2019t, but if he does, you should just say\u2014\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Bonnie cuts me off kindly. \u2018Should we perhaps meet to discuss all this?\u2019</p><p>Result!

But we\u2019d never be able to keep it secret from Luke.</p><p>\u2018Have you heard the latest?\u2019 Mum comes hurrying into</p> <p>the kitchen, followed by Minnie. Her face is pink and she\u2019s breathing fast. \u2018It\u2019s not just Bank of London! All the banks are like Swiss cheese! Full of holes! Have you heard, Graham?\u2019 she adds agitatedly to Dad, who is just coming in. \u2018The entire banking structure is going to collapse!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a bad business.\u2019 Dad nods, flicking on the kettle.</p><p>I\u2019ve stopped watching the news because it\u2019s too depressing, but the Bank of London crisis is still going on like some kind of soap opera. Now they\u2019ve stopped the cashpoints working and a few people have thrown stones at the windows. The Prime Minister appeared on the TV last night and told everyone to please stop taking their money out. But all that did was make everyone freak out even more. (I knew it would. Didn\u2019t I say? They really should make me an adviser at Number 10.)</p><p>\u2018Luke says we won\u2019t all lose our money,\u2019 I venture.</p><p>\u2018Oh Luke does, does he?\u2019 Mum bristles. \u2018And would Luke like to tell us if any other financial institutions are about to fold? Or would that be too much trouble?\u2019</p> <p>She\u2019s never going to forgive him, is she?</p><p>\u2018Mum,\u2019 I say for the millionth time, \u2018Luke couldn\u2019t have told us. It was confidential and sensitive. And you would have told the whole of Oxshott!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would not have told the whole of Oxshott!\u2019 she says sharply. \u2018I would have warned Janice and Martin and a few other dear friends and that is all. And now we\u2019ll probably lose everything. Everything.\u2019 She shoots me a resentful look as though it\u2019s all my fault.</p><p>\u2018Mum, I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t lose everything.\u2019 I try to sound confident and reassuring.</p><p>\u2018I heard a commentator on the radio this morning predicting anarchy! Civilization will collapse! It\u2019s war!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now, now, Jane.\u2019 Dad pats her on the shoulder. \u2018Let\u2019s not overreact. We simply might have to tighten our belts a little. Pull in our horns. All of us, Becky.\u2019 He gives me a significant look.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help feeling a bit offended. What was that look for?</p><p>Excuse me, I\u2019m an adult. I\u2019m a mother. You move back in with your mum and dad and they immediately start treating you like a teenager who\u2019s spent her travelcard money on a pair of legwarmers.</p><p>Which I only did once.</p><p>\u2018Poor Janice has taken to her bed with the strain, you know.\u2019 Mum lowers her voice discreetly, as though Janice might hear us from inside her house. \u2018It was bad enough for her hearing Jess and Tom\u2019s news.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Poor Janice,\u2019 Dad and I say, in automatic unison.</p><p>\u2018She had her heart set on that wedding. I mean, I know the younger generation like to do things differently, but really, is it so hard to walk down an aisle in a veil? Janice had already planned the table decorations and the wedding favours. What\u2019s she going to do with all that silver fabric?\u2019</p><p>Mum keeps on talking, but I\u2019ve been gripped by a sudden idea.</p><p>Janice\u2019s garden. Of course! We could put up a marquee there and Luke would never suspect a thing! He\u2019d just think Martin and Janice were having their own bash!</p> <p>\u2018... and not a single wedding picture for the mantelpiece ...\u2019 Mum is still in full indignant flow.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Mum,\u2019 I interrupt. \u2018Listen. Don\u2019t tell Luke, but I\u2019m going to hold a surprise birthday party for him. And I was just thinking \u2013 do you reckon Janice would let me do it in her garden?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Both Dad and Mum are eyeing me weirdly.</p><p>\u2018A party, love?\u2019 Mum sounds tense. \u2018You mean, a few friends over?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! A big party! With a marquee and everything.\u2019</p><p>Now Mum and Dad are exchanging looks.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I say, rankled.</p><p>\u2018It sounds rather ... big.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It will be big,\u2019 I say defiantly. \u2018And brilliant. I\u2019m going to have a dance-floor that lights up, and fire-eaters, and Luke will be completely blown away.\u2019</p><p>I think about this every night; in fact I always conjure up the same image in my head: Luke staring in shock at the most amazing party in the world, and being literally unable to speak. I can\u2019t wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Fire-eaters?\u2019 echoes Mum, looking perturbed. \u2018Becky, love ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be George Michael all over again,\u2019 Dad mutters darkly to Mum, and I give a sharp intake of breath. That is against our family code. No one was supposed to mention George Michael ever again. We even turn off \u2018Careless Whisper\u2019 whenever it comes on.</p><p>\u2018I heard that, thank you, Dad.\u2019 I give him a furious stare. \u2018And it won\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>The George Michael incident was so painful, I can barely bring myself to remember the details. So I won\u2019t. Except that I was turning thirteen, and my whole class thought George Michael was entertaining at my birthday party. Because I\u2019d said he was. And they all came with their autograph books and cameras ...</p> <p>I feel a bit queasy, just thinking about it.</p><p>Thirteen-year-old girls are mean.</p><p>And I had not made it up, like everyone said. I had not. I phoned the fan club and the man said he was sure George would have loved to be there and I kind of ... misunderstood.</p><p>\u2018And do you remember the fairies, Graham?\u2019 Mum suddenly claps a hand to her head. \u2018All those sobbing, hysterical little girls.\u2019</p><p>Why do parents have to remind you of things all the time? OK, so maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told my schoolfriends that I had real fairies in my garden and they were coming to my fifth birthday party and everyone would get a wish. And then I shouldn\u2019t have said the fairies had changed their minds because no one had given me a nice enough present.</p> <p>But I was five. You do things when you\u2019re five. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to do them when you\u2019re twenty-nine.</p><p>\u2018Anything else you want to bring up from my past?\u2019 I can\u2019t help sounding hurt.</p><p>\u2018Love.\u2019 Mum puts a hand on my shoulder. \u2018I\u2019m just saying ... birthday parties haven\u2019t been your strong point. Have they, now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, this one will be,\u2019 I retort, but Mum still looks anxious.</p><p>\u2018Just don\u2019t make too many promises, darling.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why don\u2019t you take Luke out to dinner instead?\u2019 suggests Dad. \u2018The King\u2019s Arms does a lovely set meal.\u2019</p> <p>OK, I officially give up on all my friends and family. The King\u2019s Arms?</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want a dreary old set meal in a pub! I want to throw Luke a party. And I\u2019m going to, even if you think it\u2019ll be a disaster!\u2019</p><p>\u2018We don\u2019t!\u2019 says Mum hastily, shooting a glance at Dad. \u2018That\u2019s not what we were saying, and I\u2019m sure we can all help\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to,\u2019 I say haughtily. \u2018I have all the help I need, thank you.\u2019</p><p>And I sweep out of the kitchen before either of them can reply. Which I know is really immature and teenagery of me. But honestly. Parents are so ... annoying.</p><p>And anyway, they\u2019re all wrong, because hosting a surprise party is a doddle. Why don\u2019t I do it more often? By that evening, I\u2019ve got it all sorted. We\u2019re having a marquee in Janice\u2019s garden on 7 April. Janice and Martin are totally on board and sworn to utter secrecy. (So is the plumber who was fixing their tap and listening in to the whole conversation. He\u2019s absolutely promised not to say a word.)</p><p>On the less good side, Mum\u2019s even more hysterical than before. She\u2019s heard some scare story on the radio about how Britain\u2019s national debt is a big black hole and pensions are all going to collapse, and basically money won\u2019t exist any more. Or something. So we\u2019re having a family conference. Minnie\u2019s in bed and a bottle of wine is open and we\u2019re sitting round the table in the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 Dad begins, \u2018clearly the world is in a bit of a ... state.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve just looked in the cellar.\u2019 Mum sounds a bit tremulous. \u2018We\u2019ve still got all that bottled water we bought for the Millennium bug. And eight boxes of canned food, and all the candles. We\u2019d be all right for three months, I think, although what we\u2019d do about little Minnie ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jane, we\u2019re not under siege,\u2019 says Dad a little testily. \u2018Waitrose is still open, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You never know! We need to be prepared! It said in the Daily World\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018But there may be financial worries ahead,\u2019 Dad interrupts, looking grave. \u2018For all of us. So I suggest that we all look at ways that we can CB.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a gloomy silence round the table. None of us is very keen on CB. It\u2019s Dad\u2019s shorthand for Cut Back and it\u2019s never any fun.</p><p>\u2018I know where all the money\u2019s going,\u2019 says Mum adamantly. \u2018It\u2019s on those luxury roasted nuts from Marks &amp; Spencer you insist on buying, Graham. Do you know how much they cost? And you sit there in front of the TV, eating handfuls at a time ...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 says Dad heatedly. \u2018You know where our money goes? It\u2019s on jam. How many pots of jam do we need? Who needs ...\u2019 He reaches into a cupboard and grabs a pot at random. \u2018Gooseberry and elderflower?\u2019</p><p>I bought that, actually, at a craft fair.</p><p>\u2018What do you expect me to do?\u2019 exclaims Mum indignantly. \u2018Survive on one miserable jar of cut-price goo made out of food-colouring and turnips?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe! Maybe we should be shopping at some of those lower-priced stores. We\u2019re pensioners, Jane. We can\u2019t afford to live the high life any more.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s coffee,\u2019 says Mum. \u2018Those whatsit capsules of Becky\u2019s. Nexpresso.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 Dad suddenly wakes up. \u2018I utterly agree. Overpriced waste of money. How much is each one?\u2019</p><p>They both turn and stare accusingly at me.</p><p>\u2018I need good coffee!\u2019 I say in horror. \u2018It\u2019s my only luxury!\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t live with my parents and drink bad coffee. It\u2019s not humanly possible.</p> <p>\u2018If you ask me, it\u2019s the TV,\u2019 I throw back at them. \u2018You have it on too loud. It\u2019s wasting energy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u2019 retorts Mum tartly.</p><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s not coffee!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think we could cut out all jam, starting tomorrow,\u2019 Dad is saying. \u2018All jam, all spreads\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, if we\u2019re going to do that, I\u2019ll cut out food, shall I?\u2019 retorts Mum shrilly. \u2018I\u2019ll just cut out all food, Graham, because that\u2019s obviously a waste of money too\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Anyway, Nespresso is a million times cheaper than going to a coffee shop,\u2019 I\u2019m trying to point out. \u2018And you don\u2019t even pay for it, I buy it myself on the internet! So\u2014\u2019</p> <p>We\u2019re all so busy arguing, it\u2019s a while before I realize that Luke is in the doorway, watching, his mouth twitching at the edges in amusement.</p><p>\u2018Oh hi!\u2019 I leap up, relieved to escape. \u2018How\u2019s it going? Are you OK?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 He nods. \u2018I just popped up to say goodnight to Minnie. She was asleep.\u2019 He smiles ruefully and I feel a twinge of sympathy for him. He hardly ever sees Minnie these days.</p><p>\u2018She took all her toys to bed again,\u2019 I tell him. \u2018Including her dolls\u2019 house.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Again?\u2019 He laughs.</p><p>Minnie\u2019s latest trick is to get out of bed after I\u2019ve said goodnight, gather all her toys and take them back to bed with her, so there\u2019s barely any room for her. I went up earlier this evening and found her fast asleep, clasping her wooden pony, with about twenty soft toys and her dolls\u2019 house all on top of the duvet, crowding her out of bed.</p><p>\u2018Luke!\u2019 Mum finally notices him and stops mid-flow through a tirade about how Dad never even has toast for breakfast so what does he know? \u2018We were just discussing the situation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Situation?\u2019 He raises his eyebrows at me in query.</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019re all trying to think of ways to save money,\u2019 I explain, hoping Luke might say, \u2018What a ludicrous idea, everything\u2019s on the up, let\u2019s crack open some champagne.\u2019</p><p>But he just nods thoughtfully. \u2018That\u2019s not a bad idea, the way things are going.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But how are things going?\u2019 Mum demands shrilly. \u2018Luke, you know. Is the Daily World right or wrong? Because I heard a chap on the radio and he said there would be a domino effect. And we\u2019re the dominoes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, we\u2019re not.\u2019 Dad raises his eyes to heaven. \u2018The banks are the dominoes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what are we, then?\u2019 Mum glares at him. \u2018The dice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jane,\u2019 Luke interrupts tactfully. \u2018You don\u2019t want to believe everything you hear in the media. There are some extreme views out there. The truth is, it\u2019s still too early to call. What I can say is, confidence has plummeted and there\u2019s a lot of panic. Not just in banking, in every sector. Whether it\u2019s justified ... that\u2019s the question.\u2019</p><p>I can tell Mum\u2019s not satisfied.</p><p>\u2018But what do the experts say?\u2019 she persists.</p><p>\u2018Luke is an expert!\u2019 I chime in, indignantly.</p><p>\u2018Economic gurus aren\u2019t fortune-tellers, unfortunately.\u2019 Luke shrugs. \u2018And they don\u2019t always agree. What I would say is, it\u2019s never a bad idea to be prudent.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Absolutely.\u2019 Dad nods approvingly. \u2018That\u2019s what I was saying. Our spending has got quite out of hand, Jane, crisis or no crisis. Four pounds, this cost!\u2019 He waves the jar of gooseberry jam. \u2018Four pounds!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Very well.\u2019 Mum glares at Dad. \u2018From now on, I\u2019ll only shop at the pound shop. Will that make you happy, Graham?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me too!\u2019 I say supportively</p><p>I\u2019ve never actually been to a pound shop, but they\u2019ve got to be good. I mean, everything only costs a quid, for a start.</p><p>\u2018My darling, we\u2019re not quite that penurious.\u2019 Luke kisses me on the forehead. \u2018The easiest way we could save money, if you ask me, would be if you wore some of your clothes more than once.\u2019</p> <p>Not this again.</p><p>\u2018I do wear them more than once,\u2019 I say crossly. \u2018You always exaggerate\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018How often have you worn that cardigan with the red button?\u2019 he asks innocently.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s ... I\u2019ve ...\u2019 I stop, a bit stymied.</p><p>Damn. Why haven\u2019t I worn it? I don\u2019t even know where it is. Did I leave it somewhere?</p> <p>\u2018A hundred times, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 Luke looks as though he\u2019s enjoying this. \u2018Isn\u2019t that what you said?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m intending to wear it a hundred times,\u2019 I say stonily. \u2018I didn\u2019t specify exactly when.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How many clothes have you got, anyway, stashed away in your cupboards?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... er ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you have any idea?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too many,\u2019 snorts Dad. \u2018Are we going to count the boots cluttering up my garage?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Any idea at all?\u2019 persists Luke.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t ... It\u2019s not ...\u2019 I trail off in confusion.</p><p>What kind of question is that, anyway, \u2018How many clothes have you got?\u2019 It\u2019s totally unreasonable.</p><p>\u2018How many clothes have you got?\u2019 I retort, and Luke thinks for about one micro-second.</p><p>\u2018Nine suits, some too old to wear now. Around thirty shirts. Fifty or so ties. I should cull some. Evening wear. I don\u2019t need to shop for another year, except for socks.\u2019 He shrugs again. \u2018And I won\u2019t. Not in the current climate. I don\u2019t think it would send the right signals to turn up to work in a new bespoke suit.\u2019</p><p>Trust Luke to have an answer.</p><p>\u2018Well, you\u2019re a man. It\u2019s different. I work in fashion, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 he says mildly. \u2018My only point is that if you wore each of your clothes, say, three times, before buying anything new, your clothes bill might go down.\u2019 He shrugs. \u2018You said you wanted ideas to save money.\u2019</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want those kind of ideas. I wanted ideas involving things I\u2019m not interested in, like petrol or insurance. But now I\u2019m a bit stuffed.</p><p>\u2018Fine!\u2019 I fold my arms. \u2018I\u2019ll wear every single item in my wardrobe three times before I even think of going shopping again. Satisfied?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 He flashes me a smile. \u2018And I\u2019m giving up my car plans. Just for now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I say. It\u2019s not the moment.\u2019</p><p>Now I feel a bit humbled. Luke was planning to get a new car as a celebration as soon as the Arcodas case was over. It was, like, the prize. We\u2019d gone for a test drive in one, and everything.</p><p>Well, I suppose if he can do that, I can wear my clothes three times before I go shopping again. It\u2019s not such a hardship.</p><p>Anyway, I probably haven\u2019t got that many. I try to visualize my wardrobe. I mean, it\u2019s just a few tops and jeans and dresses, isn\u2019t it? And a few things crammed in at the back. I\u2019ll get through them all in a couple of weeks.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll still be able to buy clothes for Minnie, won\u2019t we?\u2019 I look up in sudden alarm. \u2018And she can still have her pocket money?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve got quite used to Minnie having pocket money when we\u2019re out and about. She spent another six months\u2019 advance in the Bambino sale and got the most gorgeous half-price sparkly wellingtons. Plus it\u2019s teaching her financial planning, because I\u2019ve got it all written down in a book.</p><p>\u2018Of course Minnie can have her pocket money!\u2019 Luke laughs. \u2018And if she needs new clothes, she needs them. She\u2019s a growing girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 I say, trying not to feel envious.</p><p>It\u2019s all right for children. I wish I grew out of all my stuff every three months and had to replace it all.</p><p>\u2018Anyway, Becky, I thought the Bloomwood style was Make More Money.\u2019 Luke breaks into my thoughts. He pulls out a chair and pours himself a glass of wine. \u2018Maybe you could go back to work full-time, now we\u2019re getting a nanny.\u2019</p><p>Aargh! No! It\u2019s as though he\u2019s fired a shot into the air with no warning; in fact I feel myself physically recoil. Why did he have to mention the word \u2018nanny\u2019, just like that with no preamble? I was going to soften Mum up first, maybe via general chit-chat about au pairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Nanny?\u2019 Mum\u2019s voice is instantly sharp. \u2018What nanny?

She\u2019ll sink into depression and probably spiral into some kind of breakdown.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Mum looks beadily from face to face. \u2018Bearing in mind you\u2019ll be what?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Nothing!\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018Um, shall we go and watch telly?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 I can see Mum\u2019s face working with alarm. \u2018What is it? What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u2019</p><p>Oh God, now I\u2019m torn. If we don\u2019t tell her the truth she\u2019ll think something really awful\u2019s happened. And after all, it is a family conference. Maybe this is the right time to break the news.</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 I take a deep slurp of wine for courage. \u2018Here\u2019s the thing, Mum. Luke and I have found a lovely family house in Maida Vale. And we\u2019ve had an offer accepted. And this one looks like it\u2019s really going ahead. Which means we\u2019ll be ...\u2019 I take a deep breath, hardly able to say it. \u2018Mum, we\u2019re moving out.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned, disbelieving silence in the room. No one seems able to speak.</p><p>I shoot an agonized look at Luke. This is awful. I knew it would be bad, but I never thought it would be this bad.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re ... going?\u2019 Mum says at last, her voice cracking slightly. \u2018You\u2019re actually leaving us?\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s devastated. It\u2019s obvious. I can already feel the tears rising inside.</p> <p>\u2018Yes, we\u2019re going. In about four weeks\u2019 time, probably.\u2019 I swallow, my throat tight. \u2018We have to have our own space. You must understand that, Mum. But we\u2019ll come and visit loads, and you\u2019ll still see Minnie, I promise, and\u2014\u2019</p><p>Mum doesn\u2019t seem to be listening.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re going! They\u2019re going!\u2019 She grabs Dad\u2019s arm. \u2018Did you hear that, Graham?\u2019</p><p>Hang on. She doesn\u2019t sound that devastated. In fact, she sounds ... delighted.</p><p>\u2018Is this true?\u2019 Dad narrows his eyes.</p><p>\u2018Looks like it.\u2019 Luke nods.</p><p>\u2018We can start having dinner parties again,\u2019 says Mum breathlessly. \u2018We can use the table! We can have guests to stay!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can use my workshop,\u2019 Dad chimes in faintly. \u2018At last.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get my wardrobe back! And the utility room!\u2019 Mum seems almost giddy with excitement. \u2018Oh, Graham!\u2019 To my astonishment she plants a kiss on Dad\u2019s cheek. \u2018I have to call Janice and tell her the good news!\u2019</p><p>Good news? What about the empty-nest syndrome? What about spiralling into depression?</p><p>\u2018But you said you didn\u2019t want us to go!\u2019 I say indignantly. \u2018You said you were relieved those other houses fell through because you would have missed us so much!\u2019</p><p>\u2018We were lying, love!\u2019 says Mum merrily. \u2018We didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. Hello, it\u2019s me, Janice!\u2019 She turns to her mobile. \u2018They\u2019re going! Yes! Four weeks! Tell the others!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK.

Your father\u2019s principles of \u2018C.B.\u2019 and \u2018M.M.M.\u2019 seem sound, as does the advice to \u2018look around and sell some things you don\u2019t need\u2019.</p><p>Thank you also for the kind gift of Controlling Your Cash by David E. Barton \u2013 a book I was unfamiliar with. I am unaware of whether the Chancellor owns a copy, but will certainly pass it on to the Treasury along with the advice to \u2018write everything down that he spends\u2019.</p><p>With thanks again for your interest</p><p>Yours sincerely</p><p>Edwin Tredwell</p><p>Director of Policy Research</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Why have I got so many clothes? Why? Why?</p><p>I\u2019ve finally collected them up from around the house and counted them all. And it\u2019s a total disaster. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to get through them all in two weeks. Two years, more like.</p><p>How can I have so many pairs of jeans? And T-shirts? And old cardigans that I\u2019d forgotten about?</p><p>On the plus side, I found a Whistles coat I\u2019d totally forgotten about which will look fab with a belt. And some True Religion skinny jeans which were still in their plastic bag, stuffed under a pile of Lanc\u00f4me gift sets.</p><p>But on the downside, there are about eighteen grey T-shirts, all scraggy and shapeless. I don\u2019t remember buying any of them. And some really mortifying sales buys. And the worst thing is, Luke told Jess I was doing an audit of my clothes and she decided to come over and help me. So I couldn\u2019t do what I was planning, which was to hide all the clothes I hate in a plastic bag and secrete them out of the house.</p><p>Jess was relentless. She made me write a list of every item and wouldn\u2019t let me discount anything. Not the disastrous hot pants, not the revolting maroon leather waistcoat (what was I thinking?), not even all those old promotional T-shirts and shoes I\u2019ve got free off magazines. And that\u2019s before we get to the weird Indian clothes I bought on our honeymoon.</p><p>If I have to wear that maroon leather waistcoat in public three times I\u2019ll die.</p><p>Morosely I look down at myself. I\u2019m in one of my zillion unworn white shirts, with a pair of black trousers and a waistcoat layered over a long cardigan. This is the only way I\u2019m going to survive \u2013 by layering as many pieces as possible every day and getting through them that way. Even so, according to Jess\u2019s calculations, I won\u2019t need to go shopping until 23 October. And it\u2019s still only January. I want to cry. Stupid, stupid banks.</p><p>I was secretly hoping this whole financial crisis thing would be one of those very quick affairs that come and go and everyone says, \u2018Ha, ha, silly us, what a fuss we made about nothing!\u2019 Like that time when there was a report of an escaped tiger on the loose in Oxshott and everyone got hysterical, and then it turned out to be someone\u2019s cat.</p><p>But no one\u2019s saying \u2018Ha, ha, silly us.\u2019 It\u2019s all still in the papers and everyone\u2019s still looking worried. This morning Mum very ostentatiously ate her toast without jam, shooting little resentful looks at Dad the whole time. I was sunk in gloom, trying not to look at the Christian Dior ad on the back of Dad\u2019s newspaper, and even Minnie was subdued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And when I get to work, things are even more depressing. I run the personal-shopping department at The Look, which is a department store on Oxford Street. It didn\u2019t start off too well, but recently it\u2019s been on a roll. We\u2019ve had loads of events, and great coverage in the media, and profits have been up. In fact we all got bonuses!</p><p>But today the place is desolate. The women\u2019s fashion floor is totally silent, and nearly all our appointments in the personal-shopping department have been called off. It\u2019s a pretty depressing sight, a whole row of bookings with \u2018Cancelled\u2019 beside them.</p><p>\u2018Everyone said they\u2019d got a cold,\u2019 reports Jasmine, my colleague, as I\u2019m leafing through the appointment book in dismay. \u2018You\u2019d think they could make up something more original.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019</p> <p>Jasmine taps her pale-green nails, which totally clash with her violet leopard-print eyes. (Coloured lenses are her new fashion habit. Her own eyes are one blue, one green, so she says she\u2019s already used to people staring at them and wondering if they\u2019re real.)</p><p>\u2018Like they have to go to rehab,\u2019 she says at last. \u2018Or their coke-addict husband beat them up and they\u2019ve had to go to a secret women\u2019s refuge. That\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u2019</p><p>God, Jasmine is warped. We couldn\u2019t be more different, the two of us. Jasmine behaves as though she doesn\u2019t care about anything, including her own clients. She tells people they look shit, they\u2019ve got no style, their clothes should go in the bin ... then she\u2019ll toss some garment to them with a shrug and they\u2019ll put it on and look so spectacular, they can\u2019t not buy it. Sometimes they\u2019ll get all gushy, or try to give her a hug and she\u2019ll just roll her eyes and say \u2018Jeez\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Or they could be honest.\u2019 Jasmine throws back her long, bleached-blonde hair. \u2018They could say, \u201cI haven\u2019t got any money, the bastard bank lost it all.\u201d You do realize this place\u2019ll close down?\u2019 she adds almost cheerily, gesturing around. \u2018In fact, this whole country\u2019s over. It\u2019s a fucking mess. I\u2019ll probably move to Morocco.\u2019 She eyes my shirt suspiciously. \u2018Isn\u2019t that Chlo\u00e9, two seasons ago?\u2019</p><p>Trust Jasmine to notice. I\u2019m debating whether to say, \u2018No, it\u2019s a tiny label you don\u2019t know about,\u2019 or \u2018Yes, it\u2019s vintage,\u2019 when a voice says timidly, \u2018Becky?\u2019 As I hear my name I turn round and peer in surprise. It\u2019s Davina, one of my regular clients, hovering at the entrance. I barely recognized her, what with her mac, headscarf and sunglasses.</p> <p>\u2018Davina! You came! Great to see you!\u2019</p><p>Davina is in her thirties and a doctor at Guy\u2019s Hospital. She\u2019s a world expert on eye disease and pretty much a world expert on Prada shoes, too \u2013 she\u2019s been collecting them since she was eighteen. Today she had an appointment to find a new evening dress \u2013 but according to the appointment book, she\u2019d called it off.</p><p>\u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019 She looks around warily. \u2018I told my husband I\u2019d cancelled. He\u2019s ... worried about things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everyone is,\u2019 I say understandingly. \u2018Do you want to take your coat off?\u2019</p><p>Davina doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she says at last, sounding tortured. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here. We had a row about it. He said, what did I need a new dress for? And that it wasn\u2019t the time to be splashing the cash. But I\u2019ve won a Taylor Research Fellowship. My department\u2019s throwing me a reception to celebrate.\u2019 Her voice suddenly throbs with emotion. \u2018This is huge, this fellowship. It\u2019s an incredible honour. I worked for it, and I\u2019ll never get one again, and I\u2019ve got the money for a dress. I\u2019ve saved it up and it\u2019s all secure. We don\u2019t even bank with Bank of London!\u2019</p> <p>She sounds so upset, I feel like giving her a hug. The thing about Davina is, she doesn\u2019t do things lightly. She thinks about every piece she buys and goes for really classic well-made things. She\u2019s probably been looking forward to getting this dress for ages and ages.</p><p>What a meanie her husband is. He should be proud of his wife, getting a prize.</p><p>\u2018Do you want to come in?\u2019 I try again. \u2018Have a cup of coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she says again, her voice tiny. \u2018It\u2019s so difficult. I shouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you are here,\u2019 I point out gently. \u2018When\u2019s the reception?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Friday night.\u2019 She takes off her sunglasses to massage her brow and suddenly focuses past me, on the rail in my fitting room. It\u2019s holding all the dresses I looked out for her last week. I told Jasmine to have them ready this morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There are some gorgeous pieces on that rail. Davina would look amazing in any one of them. I can see the lust growing in her eyes.</p><p>\u2018Are those ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just a few options.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 She shakes her head desperately. \u2018I can\u2019t turn up in something new.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But would your husband know it was new?\u2019 I can\u2019t resist saying. I see this thought register in her head.</p><p>\u2018Maybe not,\u2019 she says at last. Her brow is clearing a little ... then it wrinkles anxiously again. \u2018But I can\u2019t possibly come back home with any shopping bags. Or have anything delivered. Or have anything delivered to work. All the junior staff will chatter and want to see, and it\u2019ll get back to my husband. That\u2019s the downside of both working in the same hospital.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So how can you buy a dress?\u2019 says Jasmine bluntly. \u2018If you can\u2019t take anything home or have it delivered?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Davina looks a bit crestfallen. \u2018Oh, this is hopeless. I shouldn\u2019t have come.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you should!\u2019 I say firmly. \u2018We\u2019re not in the business of giving up. Come in and have a cup of coffee and look at the dresses. And I\u2019ll think of something.\u2019</p> <p>The minute Davina puts on the Philosophy by Alberta Ferretti, we both know. She has to have it. It\u2019s a black and bitter-chocolate sheath with a trailing wisp of chiffon and it\u2019s five hundred pounds and worth every single penny.</p><p>So now it\u2019s up to me to work out how we do it. And by the time she\u2019s dressed again and has eaten the sandwiches which I ordered for her, I have the answer. We are hereby introducing a new, specialist personal-shopping service at The Look called SIP (Shop in Private). By lunchtime I\u2019ve made all the arrangements for Davina, plus I\u2019ve come up with several extra innovations. I\u2019ve even typed up a quick email about it, which begins: \u2018Do you feel guilty about shopping in these troubled days? Do you need a new level of discretion?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t want to boast, but I\u2019m quite proud of all my ideas. Customers can come to the personal-shopping department, select their new clothes, and then, in order to remain discreet, choose from a number of delivery options:</p><p>1. Have clothes on standby, ready to be biked over to client\u2019s house at a suitable specified time (i.e. when no one else is in).</p><p>2. Have clothes delivered in a cardboard box labelled \u2018Computer Paper\u2019 or \u2018Sanitary Products\u2019.</p><p>3. Have a member of staff (i.e. me or Jasmine) pose as a friend, visit home and offer clothes as \u2018unwanted cast-offs\u2019.</p> <p>4. Have a member of staff (i.e. me or Jasmine) pose as a cleaning lady, visit home and secrete clothes in hiding place to be previously arranged.</p><p>5. For a more substantial fee, members of staff from The Look (me and Jasmine) will set up a \u2018charity stall\u2019 at a location to be arranged,* where the client may \u2018purchase\u2019 clothes for a nominal price in front of spouse or partner.</p><p>*This option may work better for groups of shoppers.</p><p>Davina\u2019s going for the \u2018Computer Paper\u2019 option. By the time she left, her eyes were sparkling with excitement and she gave me a massive hug, saying she\u2019d send me pictures of the reception and I\u2019d absolutely made her day. Well, she deserves it. She looks amazing in that dress and she\u2019ll remember the occasion all her life. As I set off for lunch with Bonnie I feel pretty chuffed with myself.</p><p>The only teeny doubt which occasionally shoots through my head is that I haven\u2019t run the \u2018Shop in Private\u2019 scheme past any of my bosses. Like the MD or head of marketing or director of operations. Strictly speaking, I should have got a new initiative like this approved before I launched it to the public. But the thing is, they\u2019re men. They\u2019d never understand. They\u2019d probably just make lots of stupid objections and time would tick away and we\u2019d lose all our customers.</p><p>So I\u2019m doing the right thing. Yes. I\u2019m sure I am.</p><p>I\u2019m meeting Bonnie at a restaurant near the Brandon Communications offices and as I arrive she\u2019s sitting at a table, looking as understated as ever in a beige tweed dress and flat patent pumps.</p><p>Every time I\u2019ve met Bonnie, she\u2019s always seemed remote and spotless; almost not-human. But I know there\u2019s a hidden side to her \u2013 because I\u2019ve seen it. At the last Brandon C Christmas party, I happened to notice her when the rest of us were on the dance-floor singing madly to \u2018Dancing Queen\u2019. Bonnie was sitting alone at a table, and as I watched, she surreptitiously helped herself to one of the left-over hazelnut chocolates left on the plates. Then another one. She went around the whole table, discreetly hoovering the hazelnut chocolates, and even folded the wrappers neatly and put them in her evening bag. I never told anyone about it, even Luke \u2013 because something told me she would have been mortified to have been seen. Let alone teased about it.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Becky,\u2019 she greets me in her low, well-modulated voice. \u2018How lovely to see you. I\u2019ve ordered some sparkling water ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fab!\u2019 I beam at her. \u2018And thanks so much for helping out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, it\u2019s no trouble. Now, let me show you what I\u2019ve done so far.\u2019</p><p>She pulls out a plastic folder and starts fanning printed papers across the table. \u2018Guests ... contacts ... dietary requirements ...\u2019</p> <p>I goggle at the pages in amazement. Luke\u2019s right, Bonnie\u2019s awesome. She\u2019s compiled a full list of guests from Luke\u2019s business and personal address books, complete with addresses, phone numbers and a little paragraph on who each person is.</p><p>\u2018Everyone in the company has blocked off the evening of 7 April,\u2019 she continues. \u2018I\u2019ve taken Gary into my confidence, and we\u2019ve invented a full company training session. Here you are ...\u2019</p><p>Speechlessly, I look at the sheet of paper she proffers. It\u2019s a schedule for a \u2018Brandon Communications Training Session\u2019, beginning at 5 p.m. and lasting into the evening with \u2018drinks\u2019 and \u2018group activities\u2019 and \u2018discussion circles\u2019. It looks so genuine! There\u2019s even the name of some \u2018facilitating company\u2019 printed at the bottom.</p><p>\u2018This is brilliant,\u2019 I say at last. \u2018Absolutely fantastic. Bonnie, thank you so, so much\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, it means you don\u2019t have to tell anyone at the company the truth just yet.\u2019 She gives a little smile. \u2018These things are better kept under wraps for as long as possible.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 I agree fervently. \u2018The fewer people who are in on the secret, the better. I\u2019ve got a list of exactly who knows and it\u2019s tightly controlled.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You seem to have things very well in hand.\u2019 She smiles encouragingly. \u2018And how are the party arrangements themselves going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really well,\u2019 I say at once. \u2018I mean ... I haven\u2019t quite finalized everything ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have you thought about employing a party planner?\u2019 enquires Bonnie mildly. \u2018Or one of the concierge services? There\u2019s one in particular that several of my employers have used, called The Service. Very efficient, I can recommend them.\u2019</p><p>She takes out a notepad and scribbles down a number. \u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019d help with organizing, sourcing, providing staff, whatever you need. But it\u2019s just a suggestion.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks!\u2019 I take the paper and put it in my purse. That might not be a bad idea, actually. I mean, not that I need any help. But just to tie up any loose ends.</p> <p>The waiter arrives, and we both order salads, and he refreshes our water. As Bonnie sips meticulously, I can\u2019t help eyeing her with curiosity. If you think about it, this is the Other Woman in Luke\u2019s life. (Not in a Camilla Parker-Bowles kind of way. Definitely not. I\u2019m not falling into that trap again of thinking Luke\u2019s having an affair and hiring private detectives and getting myself all stressed out over nothing.)</p><p>\u2018Did you want some wine, Becky?\u2019 says Bonnie suddenly. \u2018I have to remain professional, I\u2019m afraid ...\u2019 She gives a regretful smile.</p><p>\u2018Me too,\u2019 I nod, still fixated by Bonnie.</p><p>She spends more time with Luke than I do. She knows all about huge areas of his life that he never bothers telling me about. She probably has all sorts of interesting insights on him.</p><p>\u2018So ... what\u2019s Luke like as a boss?\u2019 I can\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s admirable.\u2019 She smiles and takes a piece of bread from the basket.</p><p>Admirable. That\u2019s so typical. Discreet, bland, tells me nothing.</p><p>\u2018How is he admirable, exactly?\u2019</p> <p>Bonnie gives me a strange look, and I suddenly realize I sound as if I\u2019m fishing for compliments.</p><p>\u2018Anyway, he can\u2019t be Mr Perfect,\u2019 I add hurriedly. \u2018There must be things he does that annoy you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that.\u2019 She gives another closed smile and sips her water.</p><p>Is she going to bat away every question like that? I suddenly feel an urge to get underneath her professional veneer. Maybe I could bribe her with a hazelnut chocolate.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Bonnie!\u2019 I persist. \u2018There must be something that annoys you about Luke. Like, I get annoyed when he answers the BlackBerry all the time in the middle of conversations.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019 Bonnie gives a guarded laugh. \u2018I couldn\u2019t say.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you could!\u2019 I lean across the table. \u2018Bonnie, I know you\u2019re a professional, and I respect that. And so am I. But this is off the record. We can be honest with each other. I\u2019m not leaving this restaurant till you tell me something that annoys you about him.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bonnie has turned pink and keeps glancing towards the door as though for escape.</p><p>\u2018Look,\u2019 I say, trying to get her attention. \u2018Here we are together, the two women who spend the most time with Luke. We know him better than anyone else. Shouldn\u2019t we be able to share our experiences and learn from each other? I won\u2019t tell him or anything!\u2019 I add, suddenly realizing I might not have made this clear enough. \u2018This is strictly between you and me. I swear.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. I think I might be getting through to her.</p><p>\u2018Just one thing,\u2019 I cajole. \u2018One teeny, tiny little thing ...\u2019</p> <p>Bonnie takes a gulp of water as though stiffening her nerves.</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 she says at last. \u2018I suppose the birthday-card situation is a little frustrating.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Birthday-card situation?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The staff birthday cards, you know.\u2019 She blinks at me. \u2018I have a stack of them for him to sign for the whole year, but he won\u2019t get round to it. Which is understandable, he\u2019s very busy ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get him to do them,\u2019 I say firmly. \u2018Leave it to me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 Bonnie blanches. \u2018Please don\u2019t, that\u2019s not what I meant ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 I say reassuringly. \u2018I\u2019ll be really subtle.\u2019</p><p>Bonnie still looks troubled. \u2018I don\u2019t like you to be involved.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I am involved! I\u2019m his wife! And I think it\u2019s monstrous that he can\u2019t be bothered to sign his own staff\u2019s birthday cards. You know why it is?\u2019 I add knowledgeably. \u2018It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t care about his own birthday, so he thinks no one else does too. It wouldn\u2019t even occur to him that anyone cared.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 Bonnie nods slowly. \u2018Yes. That makes sense.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So, when\u2019s the next company birthday? Who\u2019s next on the list?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, actually ...\u2019 Bonnie turns a little pink. \u2018It\u2019s my own birthday in two weeks\u2019 time ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Perfect! Well, I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s signed the cards by then.\u2019 A new thought strikes me. \u2018And what\u2019s he going to get you as a present? What did he get you for Christmas? Something really nice, I hope.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course! He got me a lovely gift!\u2019 Bonnie\u2019s bright voice is a little forced. \u2018This beautiful bracelet.\u2019</p><p>She shakes her arm and a gold link bracelet falls down from under her sleeve. I stare at it, speechless. Luke bought her this?</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s not a bad bracelet. But it\u2019s so not Bonnie\u2019s colouring or style, or anything. No wonder she\u2019s hidden it up her sleeve. And she probably feels she has to wear it to work every day, poor thing.</p><p>Where did he get it anyway \u2013 totallyblandpresentsforyoursecretary.com? Why didn\u2019t he ask me?</p><p>Things are becoming clearer to me. We need to coordinate, Bonnie and me. We need to work as a team.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie,\u2019 I say thoughtfully. \u2018Would you like to have a proper drink?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, no ...\u2019 she begins.</p><p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 I say coaxingly. \u2018Just one tiny glass of wine at lunchtime doesn\u2019t make anyone unprofessional. And I promise I won\u2019t mention it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 Bonnie relents, \u2018perhaps I will have a small vermouth on the rocks.\u2019</p><p>Yay! Go Bonnie!</p><p>By the time we\u2019ve finished our salads and are sipping coffees, we\u2019re both a million times more relaxed. I\u2019ve made Bonnie laugh with stories of Luke doing yoga on honeymoon, and she\u2019s told me about some previous boss trying the lotus position and having to go to Casualty. (She was too discreet to mention who it was. I\u2019ll have to Google.) And most importantly, I\u2019ve hatched my plan.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie,\u2019 I begin as the waiter presents us with the bill and I swipe it before she can protest. \u2018I just want to say again, I\u2019m so grateful to you for helping me with the party.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really, it\u2019s no trouble at all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And it\u2019s made me realize something. We can help each other!\u2019 My voice rises in enthusiasm. \u2018We can pool our resources. Think what we can achieve if we work in partnership! Luke doesn\u2019t need to know. It can be our own private arrangement.\u2019</p><p>As soon as I say \u2018private arrangement\u2019, Bonnie looks a little uncomfortable.</p><p>\u2018Becky, it\u2019s been very pleasant spending time with you,\u2019 she begins. \u2018And I do appreciate your wishing to help. However\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018So let\u2019s keep in touch, OK?\u2019 I interrupt. \u2018Keep my number on speed-dial. And anything you want me to nudge Luke about, just let me know. Big or small. I\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s opening her mouth to protest. She can\u2019t backtrack now.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie, please. I really care about Brandon Communications,\u2019 I say with sudden warmth. \u2018And it might just be that I can make a difference to things. But I\u2019ll only know that if you keep me in the loop! Otherwise I\u2019m powerless! Luke tries to protect me, but he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s shutting me out. Please let me help.\u2019</p><p>Bonnie looks taken aback by my little speech, but it\u2019s kind of true \u2013 I have felt shut out by Luke, ever since he wouldn\u2019t let me go to the trial. (OK, not trial. Hearing. Whatever it was called.)</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 she says at last, \u2018I didn\u2019t see it quite like that. Of course, I\u2019d be glad to let you know if I ever think there\u2019s anything you could ... contribute.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Fab!\u2019 I beam. \u2018And in return, maybe you could do the odd little favour for me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 Bonnie looks as though she can\u2019t quite keep up. \u2018I\u2019d be glad to. Did you have anything specific in mind?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, yes, actually, I did have one small request.\u2019 I take a sip of cappuccino. \u2018It would really, really help me out if you could do it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018To do with the party?\u2019 Bonnie is already getting out her notebook.</p><p>\u2018No, this isn\u2019t to do with the party. It\u2019s more general.\u2019 I lean across the table. \u2018Could you tell Luke that a gym is better than a wine cellar?\u2019</p> <p>Bonnie stares back at me, flummoxed.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry?\u2019 she says at last.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re buying this house,\u2019 I explain, \u2018and Luke wants a wine cellar in the basement, but I want a gym. So could you persuade him that a gym is a better choice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky,\u2019 Bonnie looks perturbed, \u2018I really don\u2019t think this is appropriate ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please!\u2019 I wheedle. \u2018Bonnie, do you realize how much Luke respects your opinion? He listens to you all the time. You can influence him!\u2019</p><p>Bonnie seems almost at a loss for words. \u2018But ... but how on earth would I even bring up the subject?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Easy!\u2019 I say confidently. \u2018You could pretend to be reading an article about it and you could casually say how you\u2019d never buy a house that converted the whole basement into a wine cellar and you\u2019d much prefer a gym. And you could say you think wine tastings are really overrated and boring,\u2019 I add.</p><p>\u2018But Becky\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018And then we\u2019d really be helping each other out. Girl power.\u2019 I smile at her as winningly as I can. \u2018The sisterhood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... I\u2019ll do my best to bring it up in conversation,\u2019 says Bonnie at last. \u2018I can\u2019t promise anything, but\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a star! And anything else you want me to do or say to Luke, just text. Anything at all.\u2019 I offer her the plate of chocolate mints. \u2018Here\u2019s to us! The Becky and Bonnie team!\u2019</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>As I walk down the street after lunch, I feel exhilarated. Bonnie\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s the best assistant Luke\u2019s ever had, by a million miles, and we\u2019re going to make a fabulous duo. Plus I\u2019ve already phoned that concierge company she recommended and been put through to their party division. Everything\u2019s going so easily!</p><p>Why on earth have I never used a concierge service before? They all seem really pleasant and it\u2019s as though nothing\u2019s too much trouble. We have to become members. According to the disembodied voice that talks while you\u2019re waiting, they can do anything, from getting sold-out theatre tickets, to chartering a plane, to getting someone to bring you a cup of tea in the middle of the Navajo desert.</p> <p>You know. If you wanted one.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 A cheery-sounding guy comes on to the line. \u2018My name\u2019s Rupert. Harry explained the brief. You\u2019re looking for the ultimate surprise party for your husband.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes! With fire-eaters and jugglers and a marquee and a disco.\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK, let\u2019s see.\u2019 He pauses and I can hear the flipping of pages. \u2018We recently organized a birthday party for three hundred in a series of Bedouin tents. We had jugglers, fire-eaters, three international buffets, dancing on a star-lit floor, the birthday girl arrived on an elephant, award-winning cameramen to capture the event ...\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m breathless, just listening to the list.</p><p>\u2018I want that one,\u2019 I say. \u2018That exact one. It sounds fab.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great.\u2019 He laughs. \u2018Well, maybe we could meet up, finesse the details, you could look at the rest of our event portfolio ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d love to!\u2019 I say joyfully. \u2018My name is Becky, I\u2019ll give you my number.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Just one small detail,\u2019 adds Rupert pleasantly after I\u2019ve dictated my mobile-phone number. \u2018You\u2019ll have to join The Service. I mean, obviously we can fast-track your membership ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d love to,\u2019 I say firmly. \u2018I was thinking of doing it anyway.\u2019</p><p>This is so cool. We\u2019re going to have a private concierge service! We\u2019ll be able to get into concerts and all the best hotels and secret clubs. I should have done this years ago\u2014</p><p>\u2018So, I\u2019ll email those forms to you this afternoon ...\u2019 Rupert\u2019s saying.</p> <p>\u2018Fab! How much does it cost?\u2019 I add as an afterthought.</p><p>\u2018The annual fee is all-inclusive,\u2019 replies Rupert smoothly. \u2018We don\u2019t sting you for any extra charges, unlike some of our competitors! And for you and your husband, it would come in at six.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh right,\u2019 I say uncertainly. \u2018Six ... hundred pounds, you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thousand.\u2019 He gives a relaxed laugh. \u2018I\u2019m afraid.\u2019</p><p>Six thousand pounds? Just for the annual fee? Yikes.</p> <p>I mean, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s worth it, but ...</p><p>\u2018And ...\u2019 I swallow, hardly daring to ask. \u2018That party we were talking about. With the tents and the jugglers and everything. About how much would that cost?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That came in under budget, you\u2019ll be pleased to hear.\u2019 Rupert gives a little laugh. \u2018The total was two hundred and thirty.\u2019</p><p>I feel a bit wobbly. Two hundred and thirty thousand pounds?</p><p>\u2018Becky? Are you still there? Obviously we can work with budgets a lot smaller than that!\u2019 He sounds cheery and light-hearted. \u2018A hundred grand would normally be our starting point ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right!\u2019 My voice is a bit shrill. \u2018Great! Well ... you know what, actually ... thinking about it ... I\u2019m still at a very early planning stage. So maybe I\u2019ll call you back and we can have a meeting at a ... later date. Thanks so much. Bye.\u2019</p> <p>I switch off my phone before my cheeks can turn any redder. Two hundred and thirty thousand pounds? For a party? I mean, I really love Luke and everything, but two hundred and thirty thousand\u2014</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019</p><p>I look up and jump a mile. It\u2019s Luke. What\u2019s Luke doing here? He\u2019s standing about three yards away, staring at me in astonishment. To my sudden horror I realize I\u2019m holding the transparent folder full of guest lists, conference details and everything else. I\u2019m about to give the whole bloody thing away.</p><p>\u2018What a surprise!\u2019 He comes forward to kiss me and I feel a spurt of panic. I hastily try to stuff the folder away, but in my confusion drop it on the pavement.</p><p>\u2018Let me.\u2019 He bends down.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I yelp. \u2018It\u2019s private! I mean, it\u2019s confidential. Personal-shopping details of a member of the Saudi Royal Family. Highly sensitive.\u2019 I hastily scrabble for it, folding it up as best I can and shoving the whole lot in my bag. \u2018There!\u2019 I bob up again and smile fixedly. \u2018So ... how are you?\u2019</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t answer. He\u2019s giving me one of those looks. One of those \u2018something\u2019s going on\u2019 looks.</p><p>\u2018Becky, what\u2019s up? Were you coming to see me?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No!\u2019 I retort sharply. \u2018Of course not!\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what are you doing in this area?\u2019</p><p>Immediately I realize my crucial mistake. I should have said I was coming to see him.</p><p>\u2018I ... um ...\u2019 I try to think quickly of a good reason for being in EC2 at lunchtime. \u2018I\u2019m trying to get to know the city better. I\u2019m doing it postcode by postcode. You should see SE24, it\u2019s fab!\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 Luke runs both hands through his thick dark hair. \u2018Be honest with me. Are you in some kind of ... financial trouble? Have you been seeing someone?\u2019</p><p>What?</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I exclaim, offended. \u2018Of course not! At least ... no more than normal,\u2019 I add, feeling the need to be honest. \u2018That is so typical of you, Luke. You bump into me on the street and immediately assume I\u2019m in debt!\u2019</p><p>I mean, I am in debt. But that\u2019s hardly the point.</p><p>\u2018Well, what am I supposed to think?\u2019 he replies heatedly. \u2018You act shiftily, you\u2019re hiding paperwork from me, obviously something\u2019s going on ...\u2019</p><p>Oh God, oh God, I have to deflect him.</p><p>\u2018OK!\u2019 I say. \u2018You got me. I was ... I was ...\u2019 My mind gropes frantically. \u2018Having Botox.\u2019</p><p>Luke\u2019s face drops and I take the opportunity to zip my bag shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Botox?\u2019 he says in disbelieving tones.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say defiantly. \u2018Botox.

Perfect.</p><p>\u2018Botox,\u2019 he says again. \u2018You had Botox.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes!\u2019</p><p>I suddenly realize I\u2019m speaking with too much animation.

And here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But ...\u2019 Luke looks puzzled. \u2018Aren\u2019t the lines supposed to disappear?\u2019</p> <p>What? He\u2019s got a nerve. I don\u2019t have any lines! Like maybe the teeniest odd little line, which you can hardly see.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s very subtle,\u2019 I say pointedly. \u2018It\u2019s the new technique. Less is more.\u2019</p><p>Luke sighs. \u2018Becky, how much did you pay for this? Where did you have it done? Because there are girls at work who\u2019ve had Botox, and I have to say\u2014\u2019</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019d better get him off the subject of Botox quickly, or he\u2019ll be saying, \u2018Let\u2019s go to the clinic right now and get our money back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I only had a tiny bit of Botox,\u2019 I say hurriedly. \u2018I was really there about ... another procedure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Something else?\u2019 Luke stares at me. \u2018What, for God\u2019s sake?\u2019</p> <p>My mind is utterly blank. Procedure. Procedure. What do people have done?</p><p>\u2018Boobs,\u2019 I hear myself saying. \u2018A boob job.\u2019</p><p>From his aghast expression, that possibly wasn\u2019t the right way to go.</p><p>\u2018A boob job?\u2019 he manages at last. \u2018You had a\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! I was just ... thinking about having one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus Christ.\u2019 Luke rubs his brow. \u2018Becky, we need to talk about this. Let\u2019s get off the street.\u2019 He takes my arm and leads me towards a nearby bar. As soon as we\u2019re inside the door he turns and takes me by the shoulders so hard, I gasp in surprise.</p><p>\u2018Becky, I love you. However you look. Whatever shape you are. And the thought that you felt you had to go off secretly ... it kills me. Please, please, please, don\u2019t ever do that again.\u2019</p><p>I never expected him to react like that. In fact, he looks so upset, I feel suddenly terrible. Why did I have to make up something so stupid? Why couldn\u2019t I have said I was meeting a client at her office? A million good excuses are coming to mind now, none of which involve clinics or boob jobs.</p> <p>\u2018Luke, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I falter. \u2018I should never have thought about it. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re perfect,\u2019 he says almost fiercely. \u2018You don\u2019t need to change one hair. One freckle. One little toe. And if it\u2019s me that\u2019s made you feel you should do this ... then there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u2019</p><p>I think this is the most romantic thing Luke has ever said to me, ever. I can feel tears rising.</p><p>\u2018It was nothing to do with you,\u2019 I gulp. \u2018It was ... you know. The pressures of society and everything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you even know this place is safe?\u2019 He reaches for the bag. \u2018Let me have a look. A lot of these so-called surgeons are irresponsible cowboys. I\u2019m going to get on to our company doctor\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I instinctively pull my bag close to my chest. \u2018It\u2019s OK, Luke. I know it\u2019s safe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you don\u2019t!\u2019 he almost shouts in frustration. \u2018It\u2019s major fucking surgery, Becky! Do you realize that? And the idea that you would go off like this in secret, risking your life, without even thinking of me or Minnie\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wouldn\u2019t risk my life!\u2019 I say desperately. \u2018I\u2019d never have surgery without telling you! It\u2019s one of those lunchtime keyhole ones, where they just give you an injection.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think that makes it OK?\u2019 He doesn\u2019t let up an iota. \u2018That sounds even more dodgy to me. What exactly does it involve?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve read something about lunchtime boob jobs in Marie Claire, only I can\u2019t quite remember the details now.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s very minimal. Very safe.\u2019 I rub my nose, playing for time. \u2018They mark the area and inject a kind of special foam into the ... um, capillaries. And it ... er ... expands.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean ... they inflate?\u2019 He stares at me.</p><p>\u2018Kind of.\u2019 I try to sound confident. \u2018Just a bit. You know. A size or two.\u2019 I make what I hope is a realistic gesture at my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Over what sort of time period?\u2019</p><p>I scrabble around for something convincing.</p><p>\u2018About ... a week.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your breasts inflate over the course of a week?\u2019 He seems staggered at this idea. Shit. I should have said an hour.</p> <p>\u2018It depends on your body type,\u2019 I add hastily, \u2018and your ... personal breast metabolism. Sometimes it only takes five minutes. Everyone\u2019s different. Anyway, I won\u2019t be doing it. You\u2019re right, I should never have gone off in secret.\u2019 I gaze up at him with my most heartfelt expression. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Luke. I owe it to you and Minnie not to put myself at risk and I\u2019ve learned my lesson now.\u2019</p><p>I was hoping Luke might give me a kiss and tell me how perfect I am again. But his face has kind of changed. He doesn\u2019t seem quite so upset and tortured as he did before. In fact, he\u2019s eyeing me with a familiar kind of expression.</p><p>Something quite near suspicion.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the name of the clinic?\u2019 he says lightly.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t remember now.\u2019 I cough. \u2018Anyway, let\u2019s not talk about it any more. I feel so bad, Luke\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You could look at the paperwork.\u2019 He gestures at my bag.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll look later.\u2019 I nod. \u2018Later. When I\u2019m less upset at the worry I caused you.\u2019</p><p>Luke\u2019s still just giving me that look of his.</p><p>Oh God. He\u2019s twigged, hasn\u2019t he? At least, he\u2019s twigged I wasn\u2019t at a boob-job clinic.</p><p>\u2018Do you want a drink?\u2019 he says abruptly.</p><p>\u2018Er ... OK,\u2019 I say, my heart pounding. \u2018Do you have time?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I can sneak fifteen minutes.\u2019 He glances at his watch. \u2018Don\u2019t tell my assistant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course not.\u2019 I give a slightly unnatural laugh. \u2018Not that I even know her!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do know her.\u2019 Luke gives me a puzzled look as he heads to the bar. \u2018Bonnie. You\u2019ve met.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh right. Of course.\u2019</p><p>I subside into a chair and unfurl my clenched fingers from round my bag. This whole secret-party lark is totally stressy, and I\u2019ve only just started.</p><p>\u2018Cheers.\u2019 Luke has returned to the table with two glasses of wine and we clink glasses.</p><p>For a while there\u2019s a silence as we sip. Luke keeps eyeing me over the top of his glass. Then, as though coming to a decision, he puts it down.</p><p>\u2018So, some good news. We\u2019ve got a couple of new clients. Not financial.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Ooh!\u2019 I look up with interest. \u2018Who?\u2019</p><p>Let it be Gucci, let it be Gucci ...</p><p>\u2018The first is a climate technology company. They\u2019re lobbying for investment in a new carbon-absorption project and want us to come on board. Could be interesting.\u2019</p><p>Carbon absorption. Hmph.</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 I say warmly. \u2018Well done! What about the other one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The other one is quite a coup ...\u2019 he begins, his eyes sparkling. Then he hesitates, glances at me and sips his wine. \u2018Actually, that\u2019s not quite firmed up yet. I\u2019ll let you know when it is. Don\u2019t want to jinx it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, congratulations anyway.\u2019 I lift my glass. \u2018I guess you need a bit of good news at the moment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not great out there.\u2019 He raises his eyebrows wryly. \u2018How about your shopping department? I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s done great the last few days, either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, actually ...\u2019 I\u2019m about to tell him about my fab new system where people can hide their shopping from their husbands.</p><p>Then I stop. On second thoughts, maybe I won\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re holding up,\u2019 I say instead. \u2018You know.\u2019</p><p>Luke nods and takes another sip of wine, leaning back in his chair. \u2018It\u2019s nice to have a few moments, just the two of us. You should come this way more often. Although maybe not to the plastic-surgery clinic.\u2019 Again he shoots me that sceptical look.</p><p>Is he going to push it, or not? I just can\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u2018So, did you see the email about the nannies?\u2019 I change the subject quickly. \u2018Aren\u2019t they fab?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 He nods. \u2018I was impressed.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019ve already had loads of CVs sent through from Ultimate Nannies, and each one looks better than the last! One speaks five languages, one has sailed across the Atlantic and one has two degrees in history of art. If one of them can\u2019t make Minnie well balanced and accomplished I don\u2019t know who can.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d better go.\u2019 Luke gets to his feet and I grab my bag. We head to the street, and Luke pauses to kiss me. \u2018See you later, Becky.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018See you.\u2019 I nod.</p><p>I\u2019m off the hook. He\u2019s just going to leave it. Even though there\u2019s no way in a million years he believes the boob-job story.</p><p>Thanks for trusting me, I want to message silently back into his head. I wasn\u2019t doing anything bad, \u2013promise.</p><p>I hold my breath and watch him walk away till he rounds the corner. Then I collapse on a nearby bench, pull out a compact mirror and start studying my face in detail.</p> <p>OK, Luke knows nothing about anything. I could easily have had Botox. Look at that totally smooth bit, right by my hair. He must be blind.</p><p>I get back to The Look to find Jasmine on the phone.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, two o\u2019clock, no problem,\u2019 she\u2019s saying. \u2018See you then.\u2019 She puts the receiver down and gives me a look of triumphant joy. (That\u2019s to say, one corner of her mouth raises reluctantly in a smile. I\u2019ve learned to read Jasmine pretty well.) \u2018Well, your plan\u2019s working. Three clients have uncancelled their appointments.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fantastic!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And there\u2019s a customer waiting right now,\u2019 Jasmine adds. \u2018No appointment. Says she wants to see you, no one else. She\u2019s lurking around the floor till you get back.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I say in surprise. \u2018Well, just give me a minute.\u2019</p><p>I hurry to my dressing room, put my bag away and freshen up my lipgloss, wondering who it might be. People do quite often drop in without an appointment, so it could be anybody. God, I hope it\u2019s not that girl who wants to look like Jennifer Aniston, because the truth is, she\u2019s never going to in a million years, however many halter tops she buys\u2014</p><p>\u2018Rebecca.\u2019</p><p>A familiar, haughty voice interrupts my thoughts. For an instant I can\u2019t react. I think I might be dreaming. The back of my neck is prickling as I finally turn round ... and there she is. Immaculate as ever in a pistachio-coloured suit, rigid hair, equally immobile face and her crocodile Birkin dangling from one skinny arm.</p><p>It WAS her, shoots through my mind. It WAS her outside the church.</p><p>\u2018Elinor!\u2019 I manage. \u2018What a surprise.\u2019</p> <p>This would be the understatement of the year.</p><p>\u2018Hello, Rebecca.\u2019 She looks around the dressing room disdainfully as though to say \u2018I expected no better,\u2019 which is a nerve, as it\u2019s just been redecorated.</p><p>\u2018Er ... what can I do for you?\u2019 I say at last.</p><p>\u2018I wish to ...\u2019 She stops and there\u2019s a long, frozen silence. I feel as though we\u2019re in a play and we\u2019ve both forgotten our lines. What the hell are you doing here? is what I really want to say. Or, frankly, just Hhhnnnnhh?</p><p>This silence is getting ridiculous. We can\u2019t stand here for ever like two mannequins. Elinor told Jasmine she was a customer. Well, fine. I\u2019ll treat her like a customer.</p><p>\u2018So, are you after anything in particular?\u2019 I take out my notepad, just as if she were any other client. \u2018Day wear, perhaps? We have some new Chanel pieces in, which I believe might be your style.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very well,\u2019 says Elinor after a lengthy pause.</p><p>What?</p> <p>She\u2019s going to try on clothes? Here? Seriously?</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I say, feeling a bit surreal. \u2018Fine. I\u2019ll select some pieces that I think would ... er ... suit you.\u2019</p><p>I go to collect the clothes myself, return to the dressing room and hand them to Elinor.</p><p>\u2018Feel free to try on as many or as few as you like,\u2019 I say politely. \u2018I\u2019ll be just outside if you need any advice or help.\u2019</p><p>I close the door quietly, and give a silent scream. Elinor. Here. What the fuck is going on? Am I going to tell Luke about this? The whole thing is too freaky. I suddenly wish I\u2019d pressed Luke more on what exactly happened between them, and what heinous thing she said. Should I be telling Elinor dramatically to get out now and never darken the door of The Look again?</p><p>But if I did that I\u2019d probably get fired.</p><p>After about a minute the door opens again and Elinor appears, holding the whole armful of clothes. She can\u2019t have tried them on, she hasn\u2019t had nearly enough time.</p><p>\u2018Shall I take those for you?\u2019 I force myself to stay polite.</p><p>\u2018Yes. They were satisfactory.\u2019 She nods.</p><p>For a moment I think I can\u2019t have understood.</p><p>\u2018You mean ... you want to take them?\u2019 I say disbelievingly. \u2018You\u2019re going to buy them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very well. Yes.\u2019 She frowns impatiently as though this conversation is already irritating her.</p><p>Eight grand\u2019s worth of clothes? Just like that? My bonus is going to be fantastic.</p><p>\u2018OK! Well, that\u2019s great!\u2019 I\u2019m trying to suppress my glee. \u2018Any alterations needed or anything?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elinor shakes her head with the barest of movements. This is officially the most bizarre appointment I\u2019ve ever known. Most people, if they were going to spend eight grand on clothes, would at least come out and do a twirl and say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p><p>Jasmine passes by with a rack of clothes and I see her eyeing Elinor incredulously. She is quite a sight, Elinor, with her pale, tight, over-made-up face, and veiny hands laden with rocks, and her steely, imperious gaze. She\u2019s looking older too, I abruptly realize. Her skin is looking thin and papery, and I can see a couple of grey wisps at her temple which the hairdresser obviously missed. (I expect he\u2019ll be shot at dawn.)</p><p>\u2018So, is there anything else I can help you with? Evening wear? Accessories?\u2019</p><p>Elinor opens her mouth. Then she closes it, then opens it again. She looks as though she\u2019s really struggling to utter something, and I watch in apprehension. Is she going to mention Luke? Does she have some piece of bad news? There has to be a reason she\u2019s come here.</p> <p>\u2018Evening wear,\u2019 she murmurs at last.</p><p>Yeah, right. That\u2019s really what you were about to say.</p><p>I fetch her six evening dresses and she chooses three. And then two bags. And a stole. The whole thing is becoming farcical. She\u2019s spent about twenty grand and she still won\u2019t look me in the eye and she still won\u2019t say whatever she\u2019s come here to say.</p><p>\u2018Would you like any ... refreshments?\u2019 I say at last, trying to sound normal and pleasant. \u2018Can I get you a cappuccino? A cup of tea? A glass of champagne?\u2019</p><p>We\u2019ve run out of categories of clothes. She can\u2019t buy anything else. She can\u2019t stave it off any longer. Whatever it is.</p> <p>Elinor\u2019s just standing there, her head bowed slightly, her hands clutched around the handle of her bag. I\u2019ve never known her this subdued. It\u2019s almost scary. And she hasn\u2019t insulted me once, I realize in sudden astonishment. She hasn\u2019t said my shoes are shoddy or my nail polish is vulgar. What\u2019s up with her? Is she ill?</p><p>At last, as though with a huge effort, she raises her head.</p><p>\u2018Rebecca.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019 I say nervously. \u2018What is it?\u2019</p><p>When she speaks again, it\u2019s so quietly I can barely hear her.</p><p>\u2018I wish to see my grandchild.\u2019</p> <p>Oh God, oh God, oh God. What do I do?</p><p>All the way home my head is spinning. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. I didn\u2019t think Elinor was even interested in Minnie.</p><p>When Minnie was first born she didn\u2019t bother visiting us for about three months. Then she just pitched up one day with her driver waiting outside, glanced into the crib, said \u2018Is she normal?\u2019 and when we\u2019d said yes, left. And whereas most people give you gorgeous things like teddies or cute booties, Elinor sent the most hideous antique doll with ringlets and scary eyes like in a horror film. It was so creepy, Mum wouldn\u2019t have it in the house, and in the end I sold it on eBay. (So Elinor had better not ask to see it or anything.)</p><p>And all this was before the big row between her and Luke, since when we\u2019ve barely mentioned her name. About two months before Christmas I tried to ask if we\u2019d be giving her a present, and Luke nearly bit my head off. I haven\u2019t dared mention her since.</p><p>Of course there\u2019s one easy option ahead of me. I could just throw her card in the bin and pretend I never saw her. Blank the whole thing from my mind. I mean, what could she do about it?</p><p>But somehow ... I can\u2019t bring myself to. I\u2019ve never seen Elinor look vulnerable before; not like she did today. During those tense moments when she was waiting for me to answer, I couldn\u2019t see Elinor the ice-queen, I just saw Elinor the lonely old woman with papery hands.</p><p>Then, as soon as I said \u2018OK, I\u2019ll ask Luke,\u2019 she immediately reverted to her normal sub-zero manner and started telling me how inferior The Look was to shops in Manhattan and how the English didn\u2019t understand service culture and how there were specks on the carpet in the dressing room.</p><p>But somehow she\u2019d got under my skin. I can\u2019t ignore her. I can\u2019t throw her card away. She may be a total bitch ice-queen but she is Minnie\u2019s grandmother. They are flesh and blood. You know. If Elinor had any of either.</p> <p>And after all, it\u2019s possible Luke might have mellowed. What I need to do is raise the subject very carefully. Very, very gently, like waving an olive branch in the air. And I\u2019ll see what happens.</p><p>So that night I wait up till Luke gets back, has kissed Minnie goodnight, had a whisky and is getting undressed, before I broach anything.</p><p>\u2018Luke ... about your mother,\u2019 I begin tentatively.</p><p>\u2018I was thinking about Annabel today too.\u2019 Luke turns, his face softened. \u2018Dad emailed me some old pictures of her today. I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, great start, Becky.

She totally gets being a drama queen from Mum, and she has your eyes ... in fact, she probably takes after everyone in the family a little bit, even ...\u2019 I hesitate, my heart thumping. \u2018Even your biological mother.

I was always Annabel\u2019s son, never that woman\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>Yikes. That woman. Things are even worse than I thought.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I say feebly.</p><p>I can\u2019t pipe up with \u2018So how about we take Minnie to visit Elinor?\u2019 Not now. I\u2019ll have to leave it for the moment.</p> <p>\u2018So, did you have a good rest of the day?\u2019 I change topic.</p><p>\u2018Not bad.\u2019 He nods. \u2018And you? Get back all right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, fine,\u2019 I say innocently. \u2018I got a cab. Thanks for asking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Strange area to have a cosmetic-surgery clinic, I was thinking,\u2019 he adds casually. \u2018Not what you would expect in the financial district.\u2019</p><p>I make the mistake of meeting his eye \u2013 and there\u2019s a tell-tale glint in it. I knew he was on to me.</p><p>The only way forward is to brazen it out.</p> <p>\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 I retort. \u2018It makes total sense. Look at all those haggard City workers walking around. You know, a recent magazine survey showed that City workers are more prematurely aged than any other sector, by 20 per cent.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve made this up, but Luke doesn\u2019t know that, does he? And I bet it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u2018You know what?\u2019 I add, having a sudden bright thought. \u2018The same survey said that if people feel cherished by their bosses they age less quickly. And they work better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure.\u2019 Luke is checking his BlackBerry.</p><p>\u2018And it said that one way is for bosses to give their employees personalized, signed birthday cards,\u2019 I persist. \u2018Isn\u2019t that interesting? Do you give people personalized cards at Brandon Communications?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh-huh.\u2019 Luke barely nods.</p><p>What a nerve. I feel like saying, \u2018No you don\u2019t! They\u2019re all just in a pile in your office, unsigned!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, good.\u2019 I force myself to sound casual. \u2018Because apparently people feel really happy to know their boss has signed the card themselves and it hasn\u2019t just been done by an assistant or anything. It raises their endorphins by 15 per cent.\u2019</p> <p>Luke pauses in his tapping. Yes! I\u2019ve got through to him.</p><p>\u2018Becky ... you do read a lot of crap.\u2019</p><p>Crap?</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s called research, actually,\u2019 I say with dignity. \u2018I thought you might be interested in how a tiny little thing like a signed birthday card could make all the difference. Because a lot of bosses would just forget. But obviously not you.\u2019</p><p>Ha. Take that, Mr Too-busy-to-sign.</p><p>For a moment Luke is silenced.</p><p>\u2018Fascinating,\u2019 he says at last. But then he reaches for a pencil and makes a note on the to-do list he carries around in his pocket. I pretend not to notice, but inside I smile a little satisfied smile.</p><p>OK, now I feel we\u2019re done with this conversation. And I really don\u2019t want to reprise the one about Botox. So with an elaborate yawn, I settle down to go to sleep.</p><p>But as I close my eyes, a vision of Elinor is still lingering in my head. I actually feel guilty about her, which is very weird, and a brand-new experience for me. But I can\u2019t work out what to do about it now.</p><p>Oh well. I\u2019ll think about it tomorrow.</p><p>From: Bonnie Seabright</p><p>Subject: Cards</p><p>Date: 23 January 2006</p><p>To: Becky Brandon</p><p>Luke has signed all the birthday cards! Many thanks!

The truth is, I\u2019ve barely given her a thought, I\u2019ve been so busy. We\u2019ve been deluged by customers wanting to use our secret-shopping service! It\u2019s amazing! The TV news headlines might be all dismal about how the high street is dead and no one\u2019s shopping ... but they should come to our department, it\u2019s buzzing!</p><p>And I\u2019m even more preoccupied than usual today, because our new Ultimate Nanny is starting.</p><p>She\u2019s called Kyla and she\u2019s fab. She has a degree from Harvard and a Masters in childcare, and she\u2019s a qualified teacher in Mandarin and tennis and the flute and the guitar and singing and ... something else which I\u2019ve forgotten. The harp, maybe. She originally came over to Britain with an American family, but they relocated back to Boston and she decided to stay because she\u2019s doing a part-time dissertation at Goldsmiths and has family over here. So she only wants to work three days a week, which is perfect for us.</p><p>And she\u2019s got these real buck teeth.</p> <p>I mean, huge. Like a moose.</p><p>Not that her looks are relevant, either way. Obviously. I\u2019m not some sort of prejudiced, lookist person. I still would have hired her even if she\u2019d had a million-dollar supermodel\u2019s smile.</p><p>But still. Her teeth warmed me to her for some reason. Plus her hair isn\u2019t remotely swishy.</p><p>Which, by the way, was not on my \u2018interview points\u2019 list. When I wrote No Swishy Hair I was referring to something else completely, and Luke did not have to start teasing me. I just happened to notice Kyla\u2019s hair \u2013 just out of interest \u2013 and it\u2019s a very dull bob with a few greys.</p><p>So basically she\u2019s perfect!</p><p>\u2018Julie Andrews is going to be here soon, is she?\u2019 Mum comes into the kitchen, where Minnie is doing Play-Doh and I\u2019m idly browsing eBay. She catches sight of the page and draws breath sharply. \u2018Are you shopping, Becky?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I say defensively.</p><p>Just because I\u2019m on eBay, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to buy anything, does it? Obviously I don\u2019t need a pair of turquoise patent Chlo\u00e9 shoes, worn once, PayPal only. I\u2019m just keeping up to date with what\u2019s out there. Like you keep up with current events.</p> <p>\u2018I hope you\u2019ve got Minnie\u2019s lederhosen ready?\u2019 Mum adds. \u2018And your whistle?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ha ha,\u2019 I say politely.</p><p>Mum\u2019s still really prickly about us hiring a nanny. She got even more offended when Luke and I wouldn\u2019t let her do the interviews with us. She hovered outside the door, tutting and clicking her tongue and looking each candidate up and down disparagingly. Then, when she read Kyla\u2019s CV, with all the stuff about the guitar and singing, well, that was it. She instantly christened Kyla Julie Andrews and has been making little oh-so-funny jokes ever since. Even Janice is in on it and has started calling Luke Captain von Trapp, which is really annoying, because that makes me either the dead wife or the Baroness.</p><p>\u2018If she wants to make clothes out of the curtains, can you tell her to use the ones in the blue room?\u2019 Mum adds.</p><p>I\u2019ll just pretend I didn\u2019t hear that. And anyway, my phone is ringing. It\u2019s Luke\u2019s ID on the screen \u2013 he must want to know how it\u2019s going.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I say as I answer. \u2018She\u2019s not here yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 He sounds crackly, as though he\u2019s in a car. \u2018I just wanted to say something to you before she arrives. Becky, you must be honest with her.\u2019</p><p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m always honest!\u2019 I say, a tad indignantly.</p><p>\u2018This nanny needs to know the extent of the problem,\u2019 he continues as though I haven\u2019t even spoken. \u2018We\u2019ve hired her for a reason. There\u2019s no point pretending Minnie\u2019s a saint. We need to give her the history, explain the trouble we\u2019ve had\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK, Luke!\u2019 I say, a bit crossly. \u2018I don\u2019t need the lecture. I\u2019ll tell her everything.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just because I wasn\u2019t totally forthcoming I\u2019m about Minnie at the interview. I mean, what am I supposed to do, slag off my own daughter? So I slightly fibbed and said Minnie had won Best Behaviour prize at toddler group for six weeks running. And Luke said that was defeating the entire object of the exercise and we had a slight ... heated discussion.</p><p>\u2018Anyway, she\u2019s here,\u2019 I say as the doorbell goes. \u2018I\u2019d better run. See you later.\u2019</p><p>As I open the door, Kyla\u2019s standing there, holding a guitar, and I have to stifle a giggle. She does look just like Julie Andrews, except in jeans. I wonder if she danced up the road singing \u2018I Have Confidence In Me\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Mrs Brandon.\u2019 Her buck teeth are already exposed in a friendly grin.</p> <p>\u2018Please call me Becky!\u2019 I usher her in. \u2018Minnie can\u2019t wait to see you! She\u2019s doing Play-Doh,\u2019 I add a little smugly as I lead her to the kitchen. \u2018I like to start her off with something constructive in the morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wonderful.\u2019 Kyla nods vigorously. \u2018I did a lot of Play-Doh work with Eloise, my former charge, when she was a toddler. She was so talented at it. In fact, she won a prize in a local art competition for one of her creations.\u2019 She smiles reminiscently \u2018We were all so proud.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 I smile back. \u2018So here we are ...\u2019 I open the door with a flourish.</p><p>Shit. Minnie isn\u2019t doing Play-Doh any more. She\u2019s abandoned all the pots and is banging merrily at my laptop.</p><p>\u2018Minnie! What are you doing?\u2019 I give a shrill laugh. \u2018That\u2019s Mummy\u2019s!\u2019</p> <p>I hurry over and grab the laptop from her \u2013 and as my eyes focus on the screen my blood runs cold. She\u2019s about to bid \u00a32,673,333,333 for the Chlo\u00e9 shoes.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 I grab the laptop away from her.</p><p>\u2018Miiiine!\u2019 yells Minnie furiously. \u2018Miiiine shoooooes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is Minnie doing some computer art?\u2019 Kyle heads over towards me with a pleasant smile and I hastily whip the laptop away.</p><p>\u2018She was just working with ... numbers,\u2019 I say a bit shrilly. \u2018Would you like some coffee? Minnie, do you remember Kyla?\u2019</p><p>Minnie gives Kyla a snooty look and starts banging the Play-Doh pots together.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll be making my own Play-Doh from now on if that\u2019s OK, Mrs Brandon,\u2019 Kyla says. \u2018I prefer to use organic flour.\u2019</p><p>Wow. Organic home-made Play-Doh. You see, this is why you have an Ultimate Nanny. I can\u2019t wait to boast about her at work.</p><p>\u2018And when do you think you\u2019ll start teaching her Mandarin?\u2019 I ask, because I know Luke will ask.</p><p>Luke is really into Minnie learning Mandarin. He keeps telling me how useful it will be for her in later life. And I think it\u2019ll be cool too \u2013 except I\u2019m also a bit apprehensive. What if Minnie gets fluent in Mandarin and I don\u2019t understand her? Do I need to learn it too? I keep picturing a teenage Minnie cursing me in Mandarin, while I stand there frantically flicking through a phrasebook.</p><p>\u2018It depends on her aptitude,\u2019 replies Kyla. \u2018I started Eloise at eighteen months, but she was an exceptional child. Very bright and receptive. And so willing to please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She sounds great,\u2019 I say politely.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Eloise is a wonderful child.\u2019 Kyla nods fervently. \u2018She still Skypes me every day from Boston for calculus and Mandarin practice. Before her athletic training, of course. She\u2019s a gymnast now, too.\u2019</p><p>OK, I\u2019m already a bit sick of this Eloise. Calculus, Mandarin and gymnastics? That\u2019s just showing off.</p> <p>\u2018Well, Minnie\u2019s very bright and receptive too. In fact, she wrote her first poem the other day,\u2019 I can\u2019t resist adding.</p><p>\u2018She wrote a poem?\u2019 For the first time, Kyla sounds impressed. Ha. Suck on that, Eloise. \u2018She\u2019s writing already?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She said it to me and I wrote it down for her,\u2019 I explain after a slight pause. \u2018It was a poem in the oral tradition.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell me your poem, Minnie!\u2019 Kyla exclaims brightly to Minnie. \u2018How did it go?\u2019</p><p>Minnie glowers at her and stuffs Play-Doh up her nose.</p><p>\u2018She probably doesn\u2019t remember any more,\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018But it was very simple and lovely. It went ...\u2019 I clear my throat for effect. \u2018 \u201cWhy do the raindrops have to fall?\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 Kyla seems bowled over. \u2018That\u2019s beautiful. So many levels in there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I nod earnestly. \u2018We\u2019re going to put it on our Christmas cards.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good idea!\u2019 enthuses Kyla. \u2018You know, Eloise produced so many wonderful hand-crafted Christmas cards, she sold them for charity. She won the Philanthropy prize at her school. You know St Cuthbert\u2019s, Chelsea?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>St Cuthbert\u2019s, Chelsea is the school where Ernie goes. God, no wonder he\u2019s miserable there if it\u2019s full of Eloises.</p><p>\u2018Fantastic! Is there anything Eloise can\u2019t do?\u2019 There\u2019s the tiniest edge to my voice, but I\u2019m not sure Kyla notices.</p><p>\u2018So I guess today Minnie and I will just hang out together, get to know each other ...\u2019 Kyla chucks Minnie under the chin. \u2018She\u2019s obviously super-intelligent, but is there anything else I should know about her? Any foibles? Little problems?\u2019</p><p>I smile fixedly back for a few moments. I know what Luke said. But there\u2019s no way on earth I\u2019m saying, \u2018Yes, actually she was banned from four Santas\u2019 Grottos and everyone thinks she\u2019s wild and my husband won\u2019t have another child as a result.\u2019 Not after hearing all about Saint Eloise.</p> <p>And anyway, why should I prejudice Minnie\u2019s case? If this nanny is any good, she\u2019ll work Minnie\u2019s little quirks out and solve them herself. I mean, that\u2019s her job, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I say at last. \u2018No problems. Minnie\u2019s a lovely, caring child and we\u2019re very proud to be her parents.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 Kyla exposes her buck teeth in a wide smile. \u2018And does she eat everything? Vegetables? Peas, carrots, broccoli? Eloise used to love to help me make risotto with vegetables from the garden.\u2019</p><p>Of course she did. I expect she\u2019s got a bloody Michelin star, too.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 I reply without a flicker. \u2018Minnie adores vegetables. Don\u2019t you, darling?\u2019</p> <p>Minnie has never eaten a carrot in her life. When I once tried to hide them in a shepherd\u2019s pie, she sucked off all the shepherd\u2019s pie and spat the carrots one by one across the room.</p><p>But I\u2019m not admitting that to Miss Perfect Pants. If she\u2019s such a hotshot nanny then she\u2019ll be able to make Minnie eat carrots, won\u2019t she?</p><p>\u2018So maybe you\u2019d like to pop out for a while, while Minnie and I get to know each other!\u2019 Kyla addresses Minnie brightly. \u2018Want to show me your Play-Doh, Minnie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK!\u2019 I say. \u2018See you later.\u2019</p><p>I back out of the kitchen with my cup of coffee, almost straight into Mum, who\u2019s skulking in the hall.</p><p>\u2018Mum!\u2019 I exclaim. \u2018Were you spying on us?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Does she know \u201cEdelweiss\u201d yet?\u2019 she says with a sniff. \u2018Or are we still on \u201cDoe, a Deer\u201d?\u2019</p><p>Poor old Mum. I really should try to cheer her up.</p><p>\u2018Look, why don\u2019t we go out shopping or something?\u2019 I suggest on impulse. \u2018Kyla wants to get to know Minnie, and Dad\u2019ll be here in the house in case she has any problems ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t go shopping!\u2019 retorts Mum touchily. \u2018We\u2019re impoverished, remember? I\u2019ve already had to cancel all our Ocado orders, you know. Your father was adamant. No more luxury quiches, no more smoked salmon ... We\u2019re on strict rations.\u2019 Mum\u2019s voice trembles slightly. \u2018If I go anywhere, it\u2019ll have to be the pound shop!\u2019</p><p>I feel a sudden pang of sympathy for her. I\u2019m not surprised Mum\u2019s so miserable these days.</p><p>\u2018Well then, let\u2019s go to the pound shop!\u2019 I try to jolly her along. \u2018Come on, it\u2019ll be fun!\u2019</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve put my coat on, Mum has phoned Janice and she\u2019s decided to come along to the pound shop too. And when we get outside, I find Jess waiting with her, dressed in an ancient ski jacket and jeans.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Jess!\u2019 I exclaim as we start walking along. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p> <p>I haven\u2019t seen Jess for ages. She and Tom went to spend some time in Cumbria last week, and I didn\u2019t even know she was back.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going nuts,\u2019 she says in a savage undertone. \u2018I can\u2019t stand it. Have you ever tried living with Janice and Martin?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Er ... no.\u2019 I can\u2019t imagine Janice and Jess would get on too well. \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018First she wouldn\u2019t stop trying to make us have another wedding. Now she\u2019s given up on that, she wants us to have a baby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Already?\u2019 I want to giggle. \u2018But you\u2019ve only been married five minutes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly! But Janice won\u2019t stop dropping hints. She sits there every evening, knitting something yellow and fluffy, but she won\u2019t say what it is.\u2019 Jess lowers her voice darkly. \u2018It\u2019s a baby blanket, I know it is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well. Here we are.\u2019 Mum breaks into our conversation as we arrive at the corner of the high street.</p><p>There\u2019s a pound shop to our right and a 99p shop opposite. For a moment we survey both in doubtful silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Which one shall we go to?\u2019 ventures Janice at last. \u2018The 99p shop is slightly cheaper, obviously ...\u2019 She peters out.</p><p>Mum\u2019s eyes keep being dawn across the road to Emma Jane Gifts, this gorgeous boutique full of cashmere knitwear and hand-made ceramics, which we both love pottering around. I can even see a couple of Mum\u2019s friends from bridge in there, giving us little waves. But then Mum pulls herself up firmly as though going into battle, and swivels towards the pound shop.</p><p>\u2018I have certain standards, Janice,\u2019 she says with quiet dignity, like a general saying he\u2019ll dress for dinner even though bombs are dropping all around him. \u2018I don\u2019t think we need to sink to the 99p shop quite yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 whispers Janice nervously.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not ashamed to be seen here,\u2019 adds Mum. \u2018Why should I be ashamed? This is our new way of life, and we\u2019re all just going to have to get used to it. If your father says we have to exist on turnip jam, then so be it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mum, he didn\u2019t say we had to have turnip jam\u2014\u2019 I begin, but Mum is already sweeping in, her head proudly high. I exchange glances with Jess and follow.</p><p>Wow. This place is bigger than I thought. And there\u2019s such a lot of stuff! Mum has already taken a basket and is putting tins of some dodgy-looking meat into it with jerky, resentful little movements.</p><p>\u2018Your father will just have to adjust his taste buds to suit his wallet!\u2019 she says, clattering another one in. \u2018Maybe nutrition is something we can\u2019t afford any more! Maybe vitamins are only for the super-rich!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ooh, chocolate bourbons!\u2019 I say, spotting some. \u2018Get some of those, Mum. And Toblerones!\u2019</p> <p>Hey. There\u2019s a rack of cotton-wool balls over there. It would be crazy not to stock up on them. I mean, it wouldn\u2019t make economic sense. And there are make-up applicators and even eyelash curlers! For a pound! I grab a basket and start filling it.</p><p>\u2018Jane!\u2019 A breathless voice greets us and I see Janice, clutching a load of packets labelled \u2018solar garden lights\u2019. \u2018Have you seen these? They can\u2019t cost a pound, surely.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think everything\u2019s a pound\u2014\u2019 I begin, but she\u2019s already tapping the shoulder of a salesgirl.</p><p>\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 she says politely. \u2018How much is this item?\u2019</p><p>The sales girl shoots her a look of ineffable contempt. \u2018Pahnd.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And this?\u2019 She gestures at a garden hose.</p> <p>\u2018Pahnd. Everyfink\u2019s a pahnd. Pahnd shop, innit?\u2019</p><p>\u2018But ... but ...\u2019 Janice seems about to expire with excitement. \u2018This is incredible! Do you realize how much these would cost in John Lewis?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a gasp from the next aisle along and I look up to see Mum brandishing a load of plastic storage boxes. Her martyred air has vanished and her eyes are bright. \u2018Janice! Tupperware!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m about to follow them when I notice a rack of glittery snakeskin belts. This is unbelievable. I mean, a belt for a pound! It would be criminal not to. And there\u2019s a whole load of hair extensions and wigs ... God, this place is brilliant. Why have I never come here before?</p><p>I put five belts and a selection of wigs into my basket, and throw in a few bits of \u2018famous brands\u2019 make-up (even though I haven\u2019t heard of any of the brands), then wander down to find myself in front of a rack labelled \u2018Second-hand supplies \u2013catering returns, sold as seen\u2019.</p><p>Wow. Look at this. There are loads of place cards and table confetti and stuff. Perfect for a party.</p><p>I stare at them silently for a few moments, my mind circling round and round. Obviously I can\u2019t buy the stuff for Luke\u2019s party at the pound shop. It would be really cheapskate and stingy.</p><p>But they only cost a pound. And they\u2019re proper catering supplies. And would he mind?</p> <p>Put it this way: the less I spend on place cards and party poppers, the more I can spend on champagne. And everything\u2019s a pound. A pound!</p><p>Oh God, I can\u2019t pass this up. It\u2019s too good an opportunity. Hastily I start shoving packets of place cards, party poppers, table confetti and napkin holders into my basket. I won\u2019t tell anyone I got them at the pound shop. I\u2019ll say I got them bespoke from a specialist entertainment company.</p><p>\u2018Do you need another basket?\u2019 Jess appears by my side.</p><p>\u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 I take it and add some pop-up candelabra decorations, which I\u2019ve just noticed. They look a bit manky, but no one\u2019ll notice if the lights are dim enough.</p><p>\u2018Is this for Luke\u2019s party?\u2019 She nods at my basket with interest. \u2018How are the preparations going?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh bloody hell. I can\u2019t have Jess telling everyone the decorations came from the pound shop.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018Of course this isn\u2019t for Luke! I\u2019m just ... getting inspiration. Aren\u2019t you buying anything?\u2019 I add, noticing she doesn\u2019t have a basket. \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to stock up on Jiffy bags or something?\u2019</p><p>I would have thought this place would be right up Jess\u2019s street. She\u2019s the one always giving me lectures about spending too much and why don\u2019t I buy in bulk and live off potato peelings?</p><p>\u2018No, I don\u2019t buy things any more,\u2019 says Jess matter-of-factly.</p> <p>Did I mishear that?</p><p>\u2018What do you mean, you don\u2019t buy things?\u2019 I say, still loading up my basket. \u2018You must buy things. Everyone buys things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not me.\u2019 She shakes her head. \u2018Since living in Chile, Tom and I have taken the decision to be zero-consumers, or as near as possible. We barter instead.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You barter?\u2019 I turn and stare at her. \u2018What, with beads and stuff?\u2019</p><p>Jess gives a snort of laughter. \u2018No, Becky. Everything. Food, clothing, heating. If I can\u2019t barter for it, I don\u2019t do it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But ... who with?\u2019 I say incredulously. \u2018No one barters any more. That\u2019s, like, the Middle Ages.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d be surprised. There\u2019s a lot of like-minded people out there. There are networks, websites ...\u2019 She shrugs. \u2018Last week I bartered six hours of gardening for a British Rail voucher. That got me up to Scully. It cost me nothing.\u2019</p><p>I stare at her, gobsmacked. In fact, to be honest I feel a teeny bit affronted. Here we all are, feeling really virtuous because we\u2019re shopping in the pound shop. And Jess has to trump everyone by not shopping at all, ever. That\u2019s so typical of her. Next she\u2019ll probably invent some form of anti-shopping. Like anti-matter, or anti-gravity.</p><p>\u2018So ... could I barter?\u2019 I say, as a sudden thought hits me.</p><p>\u2018Of course you could,\u2019 says Jess. \u2018In fact, you should. You can get anything and everything. Clothes, food, toys ... I\u2019ll send you links to the websites I use most.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks!\u2019</p> <p>Yes! I resume filling my basket, full of exhilaration. This is the answer. I\u2019ll barter for everything I need for Luke\u2019s party. It\u2019ll be easy. And those posh, zillion-pound party organizers can sod off. Who needs them when you have a pound shop and a bartering website?</p><p>Ooh. Star Wars fairy lights, two strings for a pound! And some Yoda shot glasses.</p><p>I pause thoughtfully. Maybe the party could have a Star Wars theme. I mean, I\u2019m not sure Luke\u2019s exactly into Star Wars ... but I could get him into it, couldn\u2019t I? I could rent out the DVDs and suggest we join the fan club and I expect he\u2019d be a total enthusiast by 7 April.</p><p>Except there are also some really fab disco-ball garlands. And some jewelled pewter-effect platters reading \u2018King Arthur\u2019s Court\u2019, with matching goblets. Oh God, now I\u2019m torn.</p><p>Maybe it could be a Seventies-disco-Star-Wars-King-Arthur fusion themed party?</p><p>\u2018You could barter for those, too,\u2019 Jess says, watching me disapprovingly as I pick up a disco-ball garland. \u2018Or even better, make decorations with recycled materials. It\u2019s far more environmentally friendly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I say patiently. \u2018I should have dreary old paper-chains made of newspaper.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not talking about paperchains made out of newspaper!\u2019 She looks offended. \u2018There are lots of creative decorating ideas on the web. You can re-use silver foil, decorate plastic bottles ...\u2019</p> <p>Silver foil? Plastic bottles? What am I, six years old?</p><p>\u2018Look, Jess!\u2019 Janice\u2019s bright voice interrupts us and I look up to see her rounding the corner, clutching a small packet. \u2018I\u2019ve found some vitamins! Folic acid! That\u2019s supposed to be good for you young girls, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>I exchange looks with Jess.</p><p>\u2018Only if they\u2019re planning to become pregnant,\u2019 says Jess icily.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019ll just pop it in my basket, anyway.\u2019 Janice\u2019s casual air is fooling no one. \u2018And look at this! It\u2019s a baby-name book! A thousand names for only a pound! Girls and boys.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t believe this,\u2019 mutters Jess, hunching her arms around herself defensively.</p><p>\u2018What do you need a baby-name book for, Janice?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Well!\u2019 Janice\u2019s cheeks grow pinker and she looks from me to Jess. \u2018You never know ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do know!\u2019 Jess suddenly erupts. \u2018Listen, Janice. I\u2019m not pregnant. And I\u2019m not going to be pregnant. Tom and I have decided that when we have a family, we\u2019ll be adopting a disadvantaged child from South America. And it won\u2019t be a baby, and it\u2019ll have a South American name. So you can keep your bloody folic acid and your baby-names book!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stalks off, out of the shop, leaving me and Janice both absolutely gobsmacked.</p><p>A South American child!

Yellow and white, for a girl or a boy, and little Christmas outfits up to age six!\u2019</p><p>OK, Janice is officially insane.</p><p>\u2018Well, no one asked you to, did they?\u2019 I point out. \u2018Maybe you could give them all to charity.\u2019</p><p>I think I\u2019m turning into Jess. I\u2019ve even got her hardness in my voice. But honestly! Why on earth was Janice knitting baby clothes before Jess and Tom were even engaged?</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll talk to Tom.\u2019 Janice seems to come to a sudden decision. \u2018He\u2019s only going along with this silly plan to please Jess. He\u2019ll want a child of his own, I know he will. He\u2019ll want to carry on our gene pool. Martin\u2019s family dates back to Cromwell, you know. He\u2019s had a family tree done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Janice,\u2019 I begin, \u2018I really wouldn\u2019t get involved\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look!\u2019 Her gaze suddenly focuses on the shelf in front of her. \u2018A pair of gardening gloves! Padded! For a pound!\u2019</p><p>As we head back from our outing, everyone\u2019s in an upbeat mood. We had to splash out on a taxi home because we had too many shopping bags to carry \u2013 but we\u2019ve saved so much money, what\u2019s a taxi fare?</p><p>Janice hasn\u2019t mentioned babies or gene pools again, but keeps pulling items out of her bags and showing them to us.</p><p>\u2018A full dental kit with mirror! For a pound!\u2019 She looks around the taxi to make sure everyone is as incredulous as her. \u2018A miniature table-top snooker set! For a pound!\u2019</p> <p>Mum seems to have bought the entire stock of Tupperware, loads of kitchen utensils and big casseroles, several bottles of L\u2019Or\u00e9al shampoo with Polish writing, some artificial flowers, a big box of birthday cards and a really cool mop with a pink stripy handle which Minnie will love.</p><p>And right at the end, I found a whole load of posh wooden hangers. Three for a pound, which is a total bargain. They\u2019d cost at least two quid each, anywhere else. So I bought a hundred.</p><p>With the help of the taxi driver we stagger into the house with our bags and drop them in the hall.</p><p>\u2018Well!\u2019 Mum says. \u2018I\u2019m exhausted after all that hard work! Do you want a cup of tea, love? And one of those bourbon biscuits ...\u2019 She starts rooting around in one of the pound-shop bags, just as Dad comes out of his study. For a moment he stares at us, his jaw slack.</p><p>I suppose seventeen carrier bags does look like quite a lot. You know, if you\u2019re not expecting them.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 he says at last. \u2018What\u2019s all this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve been to the pound shop,\u2019 I say brightly. \u2018We did really well!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jane ...\u2019 Dad is looking incredulously from bag to bag. \u2018We\u2019re supposed to be saving money, if you remember.\u2019</p> <p>Mum raises her head from the bag full of food, her cheeks red. \u2018I have been saving money. Didn\u2019t you hear? I\u2019ve been shopping at the pound shop!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you buy the whole bloody place?\u2019 Dad\u2019s looking at the sea of plastic bags. \u2018Is there anything left?\u2019</p><p>Uh-oh. Mum\u2019s inhaling with one of her I\u2019ve-never-been-so-insulted-in-all-my-life breaths.</p><p>\u2018If you want to know, Graham, I\u2019ve been buying us tinned shepherd\u2019s pie and bargain biscuits, since we can\u2019t afford Ocado any more!\u2019 She brandishes the bourbons at him. \u2018Do you know how much these cost? Five packets for a pound! Is that wasting money?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jane, I never said we couldn\u2019t afford Ocado,\u2019 begins Dad testily. \u2018I merely said\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018But next time I\u2019ll go to the 99p shop, shall I?\u2019 Her voice rises shrilly. \u2018Or the ten-pence shop! Will that satisfy you, Graham? Or maybe you\u2019d like to do the household shopping. Maybe you\u2019d like to struggle on a budget to keep this family fed and clothed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fed and clothed?\u2019 retorts Dad scoffingly \u2018And how is this keeping them fed and clothed?\u2019 He reaches for the pink stripy mop.</p><p>\u2018So now we can\u2019t afford basic hygiene, is that it?\u2019 Mum is pink with outrage. \u2018Now we can\u2019t afford to mop our floors?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018We can mop them with the cupboardful of mops we\u2019ve already got!\u2019 Dad erupts. \u2018If I see one more useless cleaning gadget in this house ...\u2019</p><p>Oookay. I think I might just quietly edge away before I get drawn into this and they each start saying, \u2018Becky agrees with me, don\u2019t you, Becky?\u2019</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019m dying to see how Kyla and Minnie are getting on.</p><p>They\u2019ve been together for two solid hours. Kyla\u2019s bound to have had a positive effect on Minnie already. Maybe she\u2019s started her on Mandarin or French. Or embroidery!</p> <p>I tiptoe up to the kitchen door, hoping to hear the sound of Minnie singing a madrigal or saying \u2018Un, deux, trois\u2019 in a perfect accent, or maybe doing a bit of quick Pythagoras. But instead, all I can hear is Kyla saying, \u2018Minnie, come on. Come on, now!\u2019</p><p>She sounds a bit weary, which is weird. I had her down as one of those endless-energy, broccoli-juice type people.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I call out and push the door open. \u2018I\u2019m back!\u2019</p><p>Blimey. What\u2019s up? Kyla\u2019s completely lost her sparkle. Her hair is dishevelled, her cheeks are flushed and there\u2019s a smear of mashed potato on her shirt.</p><p>Minnie, on the other hand, is sitting in her high chair with a plate of food in front of her, looking like she\u2019s having a whale of a time.</p> <p>\u2018So!\u2019 I say brightly. \u2018Did you have a good morning?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 Kyla smiles \u2013 but it\u2019s one of those automatic smiles that doesn\u2019t reach her eyes. In fact, if truth be told, her eyes are saying, \u2018Get me out of here, now.\u2019</p><p>I think I\u2019ll just ignore them. I\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t understand Eye. Or Clenched Hands Round the Chairback.</p><p>\u2018So, have you started on any languages yet?\u2019 I say encouragingly.</p><p>\u2018Not yet.\u2019 Kyla flashes her teeth again. \u2018In fact, I\u2019d like to have a little chat if that\u2019s OK?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to say, \u2018No, get going on the Mandarin,\u2019 close the door and run. But that wouldn\u2019t be the act of a responsible mother, would it?</p> <p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 I turn with a winning smile. \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mrs Brandon.\u2019 Kyla lowers her voice as she comes towards me. \u2018Minnie\u2019s a sweet, charming, intelligent child. But we had a few ... issues today.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Issues?\u2019 I repeat innocently, after only the tiniest of pauses. \u2018What kind of issues?\u2019</p><p>\u2018There were moments when Minnie was a little stubborn. Is that normal for her?\u2019</p><p>I rub my nose, playing for time. If I admit that Minnie\u2019s the stubbornest person I\u2019ve ever come across then that just lets Kyla off the hook. She\u2019s supposed to cure Minnie\u2019s stubbornness. In fact, why hasn\u2019t she done it already?</p><p>And anyway, everyone knows you shouldn\u2019t label children, it gives them a complex.</p><p>\u2018Stubborn?\u2019 I wrinkle my brow as though baffled. \u2018No, that doesn\u2019t sound like Minnie to me. She\u2019s never stubborn with me,\u2019 I add for good measure. \u2018She\u2019s always a little angel, aren\u2019t you, darling?\u2019 I beam at Minnie.</p><p>\u2018I see.\u2019 Kyla\u2019s cheeks are flushed and she looks a bit beleaguered. \u2018Well, I guess it\u2019s early days for us, isn\u2019t it, Minnie? The other thing ...\u2019 She lowers her voice. \u2018She won\u2019t eat any carrots for me. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just playing up. You said she eats carrots, right?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 I say after another tiny pause. \u2018Always. Come on, Minnie, eat your carrots!\u2019</p><p>I head over to the high chair and look at Minnie\u2019s food. Most of the chicken and potatoes have gone, but there\u2019s a stack of beautifully cooked carrots, which Minnie\u2019s eyeing as though they\u2019re the Black Death.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand where I\u2019m going wrong.\u2019 Kyla sounds quite hassled. \u2018I never had this kind of problem with Eloise ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Could you possibly get down a mug for me, Kyla?\u2019 I say casually. As Kyla reaches up to the cupboard I whip a carrot off the plate, stuff it in my mouth and swallow it in one gulp.</p><p>\u2018She just ate one,\u2019 I say to Kyla, trying not to sound too smug.</p><p>\u2018She ate one?\u2019 Kyla whips round. \u2018But ... but I\u2019ve been trying for fifteen minutes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll get the knack,\u2019 I say kindly. \u2018Um, could you possibly get a jug down as well?\u2019 As she turns away I stuff another carrot in my mouth. To give credit to Kyla, they are pretty yummy.</p><p>\u2018Did she just eat another one?\u2019 I can see Kyla avidly counting the carrots on the plate. It\u2019s a good job I\u2019m a fast chewer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I clear my throat. \u2018Good girl, Minnie!

Lovely carrots. You ate two already, so let\u2019s see how fast you can eat the rest of them!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Noooooo!\u2019 Minnie yells at her, and I turn to see her batting the fork away. \u2018Nooooo ca-rrot!\u2019</p> <p>Oh God. She\u2019s going to start hurling all the carrots across the room in a minute.</p><p>\u2018Actually, Kyla,\u2019 I say quickly, \u2018could you be a real star and take some shopping upstairs for me? All the bags in the hall. And I\u2019ll supervise Minnie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 Kyla wipes her brow. \u2018No problem.\u2019</p><p>The minute she\u2019s gone, I hurry to Minnie\u2019s high chair and start cramming all the carrots into my mouth. For God\u2019s sake, why did she have to cook so many of the bloody things? I can barely get my mouth closed around them, let alone chew them\u2014</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 I freeze in dismay as I hear Kyla\u2019s voice behind me. \u2018Your mom said to bring these bags into the kitchen, is that OK?\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what to do. My cheeks are bulging with carrots.</p><p>OK, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m facing away. She can\u2019t see my mouth.</p><p>\u2018Mm-hmm,\u2019 I manage, indistinctly.</p><p>\u2018Oh my gosh! Did she eat all the carrots?\u2019 Kyla drops the shopping bags. \u2018But that\u2019s so quick! What happened? Did she just start wolfing them down?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mm-hmm.\u2019 Keeping my head averted, I give what I hope is an expressive shrug.</p><p>Now Kyla\u2019s coming over to the high chair. Hastily I back away till I\u2019m at the window, facing away. God, this is hideous. My jaw is starting to ache from holding in all the carrots, and my face is growing hot with the effort. I risk a quick chew, then another\u2014</p> <p>\u2018No way.\u2019 Kyla\u2019s voice comes out of nowhere. Shit! She\u2019s about two feet away, staring at my face. How did she creep round there without me noticing? I sneak a quick glance at my reflection in the stainless-steel fridge.</p><p>Oh God. The end of a carrot is poking out of my mouth.</p><p>For a moment Kyla and I just stare at each other. I don\u2019t quite dare push it back into my mouth.</p><p>\u2018Minnie didn\u2019t eat any carrots, did she?\u2019 says Kyla, politely but with an edge.</p><p>I stare back desperately.

However, I am not sure how practical it would be for the Chancellor to barter \u2018some old stuff in museums that we don\u2019t need\u2019 for \u2018loads of French cheeses that we could all share out\u2019. I also fear it would be unfeasible to barter \u2018a minor member of the Royal Family\u2019 with the USA, in return for \u2018enough J Crew clothes for everyone\u2019.</p><p>Nevertheless I thank you for your continuing interest in our economy.</p><p>Yours sincerely</p><p>Edwin Tredwell</p><p>Director of Policy Research</p><p>TEN</p><p>Huh. Some nanny agency that is. I\u2019m thinking of complaining to the Nanny Ombudsman. Nanny agencies should be confidential. They should be discreet. Apparently the story of the mother and the carrots has been forwarded to every single nanny agency in town. Suze rang up apologetically and said everyone at St Cuthbert\u2019s was talking about it and it\u2019s the new urban legend, except the way the story goes now, it ends up with me and Kyla throwing carrots at each other.</p><p>Luke wasn\u2019t impressed, no matter how many times I explained that Kyla was totally unsuitable for us anyway. And apparently, the agency might find it \u2018difficult\u2019 to find a replacement Ultimate Nanny. So I\u2019ve had to ask Mum to step in and she got all huffy and said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m good enough for you now, am I?\u2019</p><p>And to make things worse, last night I finally looked properly at my bargain party supplies from the pound shop. I opened the place cards first of all \u2013 and they were personalized with \u2018Happy Birthday Mike\u2019. Two hundred of them.</p><p>For a while I considered introducing \u2018Mike\u2019 as a nickname for Luke. I mean, why shouldn\u2019t he have a little nickname? And why shouldn\u2019t it be Mike? I reckoned if I started sending him little emails calling him \u2018Mikey\u2019 and got Mum and Dad to call him \u2018Mike\u2019, and maybe even gasped \u2018Oh Mike, Mike!\u2019 a couple of times during sex, I could probably get him used to it before the party.</p><p>But then the napkin holders had \u2018Congratulations Lorraine\u2019 all over them, so I gave up on that plan.</p><p>At least there are some positives at the moment. My bartering venture is already a triumph \u2013 in fact, Jess is right, it\u2019s amazing! Why on earth do people ever buy things when they could barter? I\u2019ve had loads of responses to my ads and I\u2019ve got several appointments this evening. At this rate I\u2019ll have the whole party sorted out in no time, for no money!</p><p>Jess sent me links to some eco-decorating websites as well, and although most of the ideas are rubbish, I did find one that was quite cool. You cut old plastic bags into strips and make pom-poms \u2013 and they look really good. And they\u2019re free! So I\u2019ve started making those, whenever Luke isn\u2019t around. Luckily, I have quite a large supply of plastic bags already. The Selfridges pom-poms look amazing, all bright and yellow, and the green Harrods ones are really smart, too. Now I just need a few white ones. (I might have to go and stock up at Harvey Nichols Food Hall. I mean, it\u2019s quite expensive there, but then that\u2019s the price of being green.)</p><p>And the other big plus is our new house, which is all still going forward. I\u2019ve come here in my lunch-hour to show it to Suze \u2013 and it looks even better than it did before.</p><p>\u2018Bex, I love it!\u2019 Suze comes clattering down the stairs, her face bright. \u2018It\u2019s so light! And the upstairs is massive! All those bedrooms! They seem to come out of nowhere!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s incredible, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I beam proudly.</p><p>\u2018It just shows what architects can do.\u2019 She shakes her head wonderingly. \u2018And no glitches? No problems?\u2019</p><p>Poor Suze has heard the saga of every other house we\u2019ve tried to buy.</p><p>\u2018Nothing! We\u2019re exchanging next week and completing two weeks after that. We\u2019ve booked the van and everything.\u2019 I beam at Suze. \u2018This one is meant to be.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You must be so relieved.\u2019 Suze gives me a hug. \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve finally got a house!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I tug at her arm. \u2018Come and see the garden!\u2019</p><p>We head outside and across the lawn to the back, where there\u2019s a huge spreading oak tree and a swing and a load of climbing equipment on bark chippings.</p><p>\u2018All your kids will be able to come and play here,\u2019 I say proudly.</p> <p>\u2018They\u2019ll love it!\u2019 Suze gets on the swing and starts pushing herself back and forth.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s Ernie?\u2019 I suddenly remember. \u2018How was the meeting at school?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We haven\u2019t had it yet.\u2019 Suze\u2019s face falls. \u2018I\u2019m dreading it. I\u2019ve got to go to school for an event next week, and I know the headmistress will collar me ...\u2019 She suddenly breaks off. \u2018Hey, Bex, will you come too? You could be my buffer. She can\u2019t be mean to me if you\u2019re standing there, can she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I\u2019ll come!\u2019 I can\u2019t wait to have a go at this headmistress, to be honest.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s an art exhibition. All the kids have done paintings and we go and have a cup of coffee and look at them,\u2019 says Suze. \u2018And then we have to make a donation to the school.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I thought you paid fees,\u2019 I say, puzzled. \u2018Why do you need to make a donation?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The fees are only the beginning,\u2019 says Suze, as though I understand nothing. \u2018Then there\u2019s the fund-raising and the school charity and the collections for the teachers. I spend my whole life writing out cheques.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And then, on top of that, they\u2019re mean to you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 Suze suddenly looks a bit miserable. \u2018But it is a very good school.\u2019</p><p>God, this whole school malarkey sounds a nightmare. Maybe I\u2019ll find an alternative. Maybe I\u2019ll educate Minnie at home. Or at least, not at home. That would be boring. We could do our lessons in ... Harvey Nicks! God, yes. Perfect. I can just see myself now, sitting at a little table, sipping a latte and reading Minnie interesting bits of culture from the paper. We could do sums with the sugar cubes and geography in the International Designer Room. People would call me The Girl Who Teaches Her Child in Harvey Nicks and I could start a whole international trend of in-shop schooling\u2014</p><p>\u2018Hey, Bex.\u2019 Suze has stopped swinging and is squinting suspiciously at my velvet top. \u2018Is that my top? Is that the one I lent you when we first moved in together?\u2019 She\u2019s getting off the swing. \u2018And I asked you for it back and you said it got burnt accidentally in a bonfire?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Er ...\u2019 I automatically take a step backwards.</p><p>That story\u2019s ringing a bell. Why did I say I burnt it? I can\u2019t remember now, it\u2019s so long ago.</p><p>\u2018It is!\u2019 She\u2019s examining it closely. \u2018It\u2019s that Monsoon top! Fenny lent it to me and I lent it to you and you said you couldn\u2019t find it and then you said it had got burnt! Do you know what a hard time Fenny gave me about that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can have it back,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018Sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want it back now.\u2019 She peers at me incredulously. \u2018Why are you wearing it, anyway?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because it was in my wardrobe,\u2019 I say morosely. \u2018And I\u2019ve agreed to wear everything in my wardrobe three times before I go shopping for clothes again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Suze sounds staggered. \u2018But ... why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was after the bank went bust. We made a deal. Luke\u2019s not buying a car and I\u2019m not buying any new clothes. Not till October.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But Bex.\u2019 Suze looks really concerned. \u2018Isn\u2019t that bad for your health? I mean, isn\u2019t it dangerous to go cold turkey? I saw this TV show once. People go shaky and have blackouts. Have you felt shaky at all?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I stare at her, riveted. \u2018I felt really shaky when I walked past the Fenwick sale the other day!\u2019</p><p>Oh my God. It never occurred to me that by giving up shopping I could be jeopardizing my health. Should I see a doctor?</p><p>\u2018And what about Luke\u2019s party?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sssh!\u2019 I say fiercely, looking around the empty garden in paranoia. \u2018Don\u2019t tell everyone! What about it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you going to get a new dress?\u2019 mouths Suze silently.</p><p>\u2018Of course I am\u2014\u2019 I stop dead.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t even occurred to me. I can\u2019t get a new dress for Luke\u2019s party, can I? Not while our deal is still on.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I say at last. \u2018I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll have to wear something out of my wardrobe. I promised him.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly I feel a bit flat. I mean, not that I was holding the party just so I could have a new dress. But still.</p><p>\u2018So ... how is the party going?\u2019 asks Suze after a pause.</p><p>\u2018Really great!\u2019 I say at once, in a brushing-off way. \u2018All fine. I\u2019ll send you an invitation when they\u2019re ready.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good! And you don\u2019t need any help or anything?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Help?\u2019 I say a bit sharply. \u2018Why would I need help? It\u2019s all totally under control.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ll show her. Wait till she sees my shopping-bag pom-poms.</p><p>\u2018Excellent! Well, I look forward to it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be brilliant.\u2019 She starts swinging again, not meeting my eye.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t believe me, does she? I know she doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m about to challenge her when a shout draws my attention.</p><p>\u2018There they are! There are the devils!\u2019 A middle-aged man with a red face is coming out of the house next-door to this one, gesticulating at me.</p> <p>\u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 murmurs Suze.</p><p>\u2018Dunno,\u2019 I say in an undertone. \u2018We\u2019ve never met the neighbours. The estate agents said an old man lived there. They said he was ill and never left the house ... Can I help you?\u2019 I raise my voice.</p><p>\u2018Help me?\u2019 He glares at me. \u2018You could help by explaining what you\u2019ve done to my house! I\u2019m calling the police!\u2019</p><p>Suze and I exchange wary glances. Am I moving in next to a nutter?</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t done anything to your house!\u2019 I call back.</p><p>\u2018Well, who\u2019s stolen my bedrooms then?\u2019</p> <p>What?</p><p>Before I can answer, our estate agent bustles out into the garden. He\u2019s called Magnus and wears chalk-striped suits and has a very low, discreet voice.</p><p>\u2018Mrs Brandon, I\u2019ll deal with this. Is there a problem?\u2019 he says, \u2018Mr ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Evans.\u2019 The man approaches Magnus and they have a conversation over the garden fence, which I can only hear tiny snippets of. But since those snippets include the words sue, outrageous and daylight robbery, I\u2019m agog.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t think anything\u2019s wrong, do you?\u2019 I say anxiously to Suze.</p><p>\u2018Of course not!\u2019 she says at once in reassuring tones. \u2018It\u2019s probably just some little neighbourly misunderstanding. One of those things you can clear up over a cup of tea. Maybe it\u2019s about ... the hedge!\u2019 she adds hurriedly, as Mr Evans starts shaking his fist at Magnus.</p><p>\u2018Do you get that upset about a hedge?\u2019 I say uncertainly.</p><p>The conversation is getting louder and the snippets are bigger.</p> <p>\u2018...take a sledgehammer myself ... evil devils need punishing ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very well.\u2019 Magnus looks deathly as he comes hurrying over the grass to us. \u2018Mrs Brandon, a small matter has arisen, involving the bedrooms of your property. According to this neighbour, several of them have been ... appropriated from his property.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I stare at him blankly.</p><p>\u2018He believes that someone has knocked through the adjoining wall and ... stolen his bedrooms. Three of them, to be precise.\u2019</p><p>Suze gasps. \u2018I thought it looked too big!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you told us it had eight bedrooms! It was on the house details!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Indeed.\u2019 Magnus is looking more and more uncomfortable. \u2018We were informed by the developer that this was an eight-bedroomed house and we had no reason to dispute this\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018So he just bulldozed into next door\u2019s upstairs and stole all the rooms and no one even checked?\u2019 I stare at him incredulously.</p><p>Magnus looks even more worried.</p><p>\u2018I believe the developer obtained the proper permissions from the Council ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019 Mr Evans looms up, clearly bored of waiting. \u2018By forging documents and greasing palms, that\u2019s how! I come back from the States and go upstairs for a kip and what do I find? Half my top floor missing! Blocked up! Someone\u2019s come in and stolen my property!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t someone notice?\u2019 says Suze robustly. \u2018Wasn\u2019t it a bit careless of you to let them do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My father\u2019s deaf and nearly blind!\u2019 Mr Evans looks even more incensed. \u2018His carers pop in and out, but what do they know? Preying on the vulnerable, that\u2019s what it is.\u2019 His face is almost purple and his yellowing eyes are so menacing I quail.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not my fault! I didn\u2019t do anything! I didn\u2019t even know! And you can have your bedrooms back,\u2019 I add rashly. \u2018Or ... we could buy them off you, maybe? It\u2019s just, we\u2019re pretty desperate.

I could call myself Rainbow and Luke could be Wolf and Minnie could be Runs-On-Grass-In-Mary-Janes.</p><p>\u2018So what are you going to do?\u2019 Suze breaks me out of a fantasy where we\u2019re sitting by a campfire and Luke is chopping wood in old leather trousers with \u2018Wolf\u2019 tattooed on his knuckles.</p><p>\u2018Dunno,\u2019 I say despairingly. \u2018I\u2019ll just have to think of something.\u2019</p><p>As I get back home that day, I find Mum and Minnie in the kitchen, both in aprons, icing cupcakes. (Mum got the icing set at the pound shop. And the cakes.) They\u2019re so engrossed and happy that for a moment they don\u2019t see me \u2013 and with no warning, I have the weirdest flashback to Elinor, standing in that dressing room, looking old and sad and lonely and asking if she could see her grandchild.</p><p>She hasn\u2019t even seen Minnie since she was in her cradle. She\u2019s missed so much of Minnie\u2019s life already. Which I know is her own fault, and I know she\u2019s a bitch. But even so ...</p><p>Oh God. I feel so torn. Should I let Minnie get to know her? Not that I could see Elinor icing cupcakes exactly. But they could do something together. Look through the Chanel catalogue, maybe.</p> <p>Minnie\u2019s concentrating so hard on putting multi-coloured sprinkles on to her cakes, I don\u2019t want to disturb her. Her face is pink with effort and her little nose is screwed up and there are sprinkles stuck to her cheek with butter icing. As I watch her, my heart feels all crunchy. I could stand here watching her for ever, carefully shaking her little pot. Then suddenly she sees me and her face lights up.</p><p>\u2018Mummy! Spinkles!\u2019 She holds out the pot of sprinkles proudly.</p><p>\u2018Well done, Minnie! Look at all your lovely cupcakes!\u2019 I swoop down and give her a kiss. Her face is dusted in icing sugar \u2013 in fact, there seems to be a thin layer of icing sugar over pretty much everything in the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Eat.\u2019 Now Minnie is hopefully offering me a cupcake. \u2018Eat spinkles.\u2019 She starts cramming it into my mouth.</p><p>\u2018Yum!\u2019 I can\u2019t help laughing as crumbs fall down my chin. \u2018Mmm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So, Becky!\u2019 Mum looks up from her piping bag. \u2018How was the house?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I come to. \u2018Great.\u2019</p><p>Which is kind of true. It was great, apart from the fact that half of it is stolen.</p><p>\u2018And you\u2019re still all set to move in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well.\u2019 I rub my nose, and sprinkles fall on the floor. \u2018There might be a tiny delay ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Delay?\u2019 Mum sounds immediately tense. \u2018What kind of delay?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure yet.\u2019 I backtrack hastily. \u2018It may be nothing.\u2019</p><p>I watch Mum warily. Her shoulders have stiffened. That\u2019s not a good sign.</p><p>\u2018Well, of course, if there was a delay,\u2019 she says at last, \u2018you\u2019d stay on here. We wouldn\u2019t dream of anything else.\u2019</p><p>Oh God. She sounds so noble and self-sacrificing. I can\u2019t bear it.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t come to that!\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018Although if it did ... we could always ... rent?\u2019 I hardly dare say the word \u2013and sure enough, she snaps on it like a shark scenting blood.</p><p>\u2018Rent? You\u2019re not renting, Becky. It\u2019s just throwing money away!\u2019</p><p>Mum\u2019s pathologically opposed to renting. Every time I\u2019ve tried to suggest that Luke and I rent, she\u2019s behaved as though we\u2019re deliberately paying money to a landlord to spite her. And when I say, \u2018Loads of people in Europe rent,\u2019 she just sniffs and says, \u2018Europe!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, is there a problem?\u2019 Mum stops icing and looks at me properly. \u2018Are you moving out or not?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t tell her the truth. We\u2019re just going to have to move out. Somehow.</p> <p>\u2018Of course we\u2019re moving out!\u2019 I say brightly. \u2018Of course we are! I just said there might be a delay. But there probably won\u2019t. We\u2019ll be gone in three weeks.\u2019 And I hurry out of the kitchen before she can ask anything else.</p><p>OK. So I have three weeks to sort out the house situation. Or find another solution. Or buy a yurt.</p><p>God, yurts are expensive. I\u2019ve just looked them up online. Thousands of pounds, just for a bit of tarpaulin. So I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be doing that. I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019ll be doing.</p><p>But I won\u2019t think about it right now, because I\u2019m about to do my first bit of bartering. Mum and Dad are out, and Luke\u2019s got a business dinner, and Minnie\u2019s in bed, so the way is clear. I\u2019m quite excited! Here begins a whole new way of life. Zero-consumption, green, ethical bartering in the local community. The way life should be. I\u2019ll probably never go shopping again. People will call me The Girl Who Never Goes Shopping.</p><p>My first barterer, called Nicole Taylor, is coming round at seven o\u2019clock with a marquee, and I\u2019m giving her two Marc Jacobs bags in return, which I think is a fair swap, especially as I never use them any more. I\u2019ve wrapped them up in tissue paper and put them in the original packaging, and even thrown in a Marc Jacobs keyring to be generous. The only hitch I can foresee is that it might be hard getting the marquee into the garage if it\u2019s really massive. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll manage somehow.</p><p>Then I\u2019ve got a fire-eater called Daryl, who\u2019s swapping his services for a Luella clutch (which seems a bit weird, but maybe he wants it for his girlfriend or something). And a juggler, who\u2019s getting a pair of Gina sandals. And some woman who cooks canap\u00e9s who\u2019s going to swap them for a Missoni coat. (I\u2019ll be quite sorry to see that go, but the Banana Republic one I put up originally didn\u2019t get a single offer.)</p> <p>The one I\u2019m most excited about is the fire-eater. He said he\u2019d do a demonstration and everything. I wonder if he\u2019s going to come along in a spangly costume! The doorbell rings and I feel a flurry of excitement as I hurry to the front door. This must be the marquee!</p><p>\u2018Hello!\u2019 I fling the door open, half-expecting to see a great big wedding-style marquee, fully erected on the front lawn and all lit up.</p><p>\u2018Hiya.\u2019 A thin girl looks at me sidelong from the front step. She\u2019s only about sixteen, with lank hair hanging either side of a pale face, and she doesn\u2019t seem to have a marquee with her, unless it\u2019s folded up very small.</p><p>\u2018Are you Nicole?\u2019 I say uncertainly.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 She nods and I get a waft of spearmint gum.</p><p>\u2018Have you come to barter a marquee for two Marc Jacobs bags?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, as though she\u2019s mulling this over.</p><p>\u2018Can I see the bags?\u2019 she says.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t going quite as I expected.</p><p>\u2018Well, can I see the marquee?\u2019 I counter. \u2018How big is it? Could I get two hundred people in it? Is it stripy?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s another long pause.</p><p>\u2018My dad owns a marquee company,\u2019 she says at last. \u2018I can get you one, I swear.\u2019</p><p>She can get me one? What kind of rubbishy bartering is this?</p><p>\u2018You were supposed to be bringing it with you!\u2019 I say indignantly.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, well, I couldn\u2019t, could I?\u2019 she says sulkily. \u2018But I\u2019ll get you one. When d\u2019you need it? Are those the bags?\u2019 Her eyes have fallen greedily on the Marc Jacobs carriers by my feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say reluctantly.</p><p>\u2018Can I have a look?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I suppose so.\u2019</p><p>She unwraps the first \u2013 a grey tote \u2013 and gasps, her whole face lighting up. I can\u2019t help feeling a pang of empathy. I can tell she\u2019s a fellow handbag-lover.</p><p>\u2018God, I love this. I have to have it.\u2019 She\u2019s already got it on her shoulder and is twisting it this way and that. \u2018Where\u2019s the other one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look, you can only have them if you get me a marquee\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey, Daryl.\u2019 Nicole lifts a hand at another lank teenager who\u2019s coming into the drive. This one\u2019s a boy in skinny jeans with dyed black hair and a rucksack on his back.</p><p>Is this the fire-eater?</p><p>\u2018Do you know him?\u2019 I say a bit disbelievingly.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re at sixth-form college together, doing fashion studies.\u2019 Nicole chews her gum. \u2018\u2019Swhere we saw your ads online.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 Daryl shuffles up and raises a limp hand in a kind of greeting. \u2018I\u2019m Daryl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re really a fire-eater?\u2019 I look at him dubiously. I was picturing someone more macho, with a permatan and gleaming teeth and a sequinned jockstrap. But then, I shouldn\u2019t judge. Maybe this Daryl grew up in the circus or something.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 He nods several times, his eyes twitching.</p><p>\u2018And you want my Luella clutch in exchange?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I collect Luella pieces.\u2019 He nods fervently. \u2018Love Luella.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Daryl designs bags,\u2019 puts in Nicole. \u2018He\u2019s, like, really talented. Where did you buy this?\u2019 She\u2019s still entranced by the Marc Jacobs bag.</p><p>\u2018Barneys in New York.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Barneys?\u2019 she gasps. \u2018Have you been there? What\u2019s it like?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually, I used to work there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No way.\u2019 Now Daryl is goggling at me in awe. \u2018I\u2019m saving up to go to New York.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We both are.\u2019 Nicole nods vigorously. \u2018I got up to a hundred and sixty pounds before Christmas. Only then it was the sales. And I went into Vivienne Westwood.\u2019 She winces.</p><p>\u2018I went into Paul Smith.\u2019 Daryl sighs. \u2018Now I\u2019m down to thirty quid.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m down to minus eighty,\u2019 says Nicole gloomily. \u2018I owe my dad. He was like, \u201cWhat do you need another jacket for?\u201d and I was like, \u201cDad! It\u2019s Vivienne Westwood.\u201d And he just looked at me, like, \u201cHuh?\u201d \u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know exactly how you feel,\u2019 I can\u2019t help chiming in sympathetically. \u2018They just don\u2019t understand. Which jacket was it? Not that fabulous red one with the lining?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah!\u2019 Her face lights up. \u2018It was! And these amazing shoes ... I\u2019ve got a photo somewhere ...\u2019 She starts scrolling through her phone.</p><p>She\u2019s just like me! I have photos of all my favourite clothes.</p><p>\u2018Can I hold the Luella?\u2019 ventures Daryl as I admire Nicole\u2019s Westwood shoes.</p><p>\u2018Of course! Here it is.\u2019 I hand him the Luella clutch and Daryl gazes at it reverently for a moment. \u2018So ... maybe we should get down to business. Could you demonstrate your fire-eating? It\u2019s for a party. I want a really cool display.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a tiny pause, then Daryl says, \u2018Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll show you.\u2019</p><p>He puts his rucksack on the ground, rifles in it for a moment, then produces a long wooden stick, which he sets alight with a Zippo.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t look anything like a normal fire-eater\u2019s stick. It looks like a bamboo cane out of the garden.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Daryl.\u2019 Nicole is watching him with concentration. \u2018You can do it.\u2019</p><p>Daryl throws back his head, exposing a skinny neck, and lifts up the stick. With a trembling hand, he brings the flame within a few inches of his mouth, then flinches and jerks it away.</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he mumbles. \u2018Bit hot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can do it!\u2019 encourages Nicole again. \u2018Come on. Just think, Luella.\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 His eyes are closed and he seems to be psyching himself up. \u2018I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m doing it.\u2019</p><p>The stick is half on fire by now. OK, there\u2019s no way this guy is a proper fire-eater.</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I exclaim as he lifts the flaming stick up again. \u2018Have you ever done this before?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Learned it off YouTube,\u2019 says Daryl, his face sweating. \u2018I\u2019ll do it.\u2019</p><p>YouTube?</p><p>\u2018Exhale, Daryl,\u2019 chimes in Nicole, looking anxious. \u2018Remember, exhale.\u2019</p><p>He lifts the stick up again, his hand shaking. Orange flames are billowing up like an inferno. In a minute he\u2019s going to set us all alight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018C\u2019mon,\u2019 he\u2019s muttering to himself. \u2018C\u2019mon, Daryl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it!\u2019 I shout in horror. \u2018You\u2019ll hurt yourself! Look, you can have the Luella clutch, OK? You can have it! Just don\u2019t burn your face!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Daryl lowers the stick, looking a bit white and trembly, then suddenly jumps as the flame licks his hand. \u2018Ow! Fuck!\u2019 He drops it to the ground, shaking his hand, and we watch it slowly burn itself out.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not a fire-eater at all, are you?\u2019 I say at last.</p> <p>\u2018Nah.\u2019 He scuffs his foot. \u2018Just wanted the clutch. Can I really still have it?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t blame him. To be honest, if I saw an ad offering a designer bag in return for fire-eating skills, I\u2019d probably pretend I could fire-eat, too. But still, I can\u2019t help feeling deflated. What am I going to do about Luke\u2019s party now?</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 I sigh. \u2018You can have it.\u2019</p><p>I look at Nicole, her face all hopeful, her arm still wrapped round the grey Marc Jacobs bag. The truth is, I never use either of those bags any more. And something tells me I\u2019m never going to get a marquee for them.</p><p>\u2018And Nicole, you can keep the Marc Jacobs bags if you like.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Legend!\u2019 She nearly explodes with joy. \u2018For real? Do you want me to ... wash your car or anything?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No thanks!\u2019 I can\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>Nicole\u2019s face is glowing. \u2018This is awesome. Oh look, there\u2019s Julie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me,\u2019 I say. \u2018Another friend of yours.\u2019</p><p>A blonde teenage girl is coming up the drive, holding three coloured balls.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 She smiles hesitantly. \u2018I\u2019m the juggler? For the Gina sandals?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Can you juggle?\u2019 I say bluntly.</p><p>\u2018Well ...\u2019 She looks anxiously at Nicole, who grimaces back and shakes her head. \u2018Um ... I\u2019m a quick learner?\u2019</p><p>As Daryl, Nicole and Julie head back down the drive, I sink on to the front step and stare out, hugging my knees. I can\u2019t help feeling gloomy. Some bartering that was. I mean, it\u2019s not that I begrudge giving away stuff. In fact, it was a pleasure to see my things going to good homes. And all three of them were really grateful.</p><p>But still, it wasn\u2019t exactly a successful transaction, was it? If you ask me, bartering\u2019s crap and I don\u2019t know why I ever believed Jess. I\u2019m down three designer bags and a pair of sandals and I haven\u2019t got anything to show for it. The party isn\u2019t any further forward ... and we haven\u2019t got a house ... and we\u2019ve got to move out ... My head is sinking further and further forward, and it\u2019s a few moments before I hear a gentle voice saying, \u2018Rebecca?\u2019</p><p>I look up to see a woman in a neat jacket and skirt holding out a tray of food.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Erica,\u2019 she says. \u2018From Oxshottmarketplace.com? With the canap\u00e9s for the Missoni coat? I thought I\u2019d bring a selection and you could make your choice.\u2019</p><p>I struggle to my feet and stare at her suspiciously for a moment. \u2018Can you actually cook?\u2019</p><p>Erica laughs. \u2018Take a bite,\u2019 she gestures at the tray, \u2018and you tell me.\u2019</p> <p>Silently I reach forward, take a canap\u00e9 and bite into it. It\u2019s prawn and chilli on shortcrust pastry and it\u2019s delicious. And so is the avocado and mozzarella roll.</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve finished them all, I feel a million times better. It turns out Erica\u2019s a proper caterer! She\u2019s going to do a whole selection and serve them herself. And the Missoni coat looks fabulous on her, especially when I throw in a patent belt and some knee-high shiny Prada boots (which always cut into my shins and I never wore anyway) and re-do her hair.</p><p>And she said if I want to expand to catering the whole party, she\u2019s willing to barter some more!</p><p>I\u2019m glowing all over with pride. It worked! Here I am, bartering in my local community, being totally green and worthy, using the world\u2019s resources the way we were meant to. Without money, without credit cards, without waste. Wait till I tell Jess!</p><p>Happily I drift inside and check on Minnie. Then I turn on my laptop, and just out of interest, summon up Erica\u2019s catering website. Wow. It\u2019s really impressive. There she is, looking all smart and professional in her apron. And there\u2019s a page of testimonials ... and here\u2019s a list of party menus ... and ...</p><p>What?</p><p>I stare at the web-page in shock. I don\u2019t believe this.</p><p>The Missoni coat, Prada boots and belt that I bartered were worth a total of sixteen hundred quid at least \u2013 and it says here I could get exactly the same lot of canap\u00e9s for twelve hundred in her \u2018Special Nibbles Deal\u2019. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve spent four hundred quid too much.

As I ran my eye down it, I suddenly felt a bit nervous. I\u2019d forgotten how well connected Luke is. Some really important, grown-up people have been invited, like the chairman of Foreland Investments and the whole board of the Bank of London. There\u2019s even someone called the Right Reverend St John Gardner-Stone, who sounds petrifying and I can\u2019t believe he was ever a friend of Luke\u2019s. (I quickly Googled him \u2013 and when I saw his massive bushy beard, I believed it even less.)</p><p>Two hundred important people coming for a party. And I don\u2019t have a marquee yet. No one else responded to my barter ad, and there\u2019s no way I can afford one from a posh hire company. My stomach clenches with anxiety every time I think about it. But I have to stay positive. I\u2019ll get one somehow. I just have to. And I\u2019ve got the canap\u00e9s and the pound-shop table confetti and I\u2019ve made forty pom-poms already ...</p><p>Could I make a marquee? Out of shopping bags?</p><p>I have a sudden vision of a perfect patchwork marquee, with hundreds of designer names shining all over it ...</p><p>No. Let\u2019s be realistic. Pom-poms is my limit.</p><p>On the plus side, my latest fab plan is to get the party sponsored. I\u2019ve written loads of letters to the marketing directors of companies like Dom Perignon and Bacardi, telling them what a great opportunity it will be for them to become involved with such a glitzy, high-profile event. If just a few of them send us some free stuff, we\u2019ll be sorted. (And obviously I\u2019ve sworn them to secrecy. If any of them blab, they\u2019re dead.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance nervously down at myself, and brush a speck off Minnie\u2019s little pink tweed coat. We\u2019re walking along Piccadilly, and I\u2019ve never felt so apprehensive in all my life. Two hundred yards away is the Ritz, and in the Ritz is Elinor, waiting in a suite, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.</p><p>I still can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019ve done this. I\u2019ve set up a secret meeting. I\u2019ve said absolutely nothing to Luke. It feels like the most massive betrayal. But at the same time ... it feels like something I\u2019ve just got to do. I\u2019ve got to give Elinor a chance to know her grandchild. Just one.</p><p>And if it\u2019s a disaster or if Elinor says anything appalling, I\u2019ll just whisk Minnie away and pretend it never happened.</p><p>The Ritz is as grand and beautiful as ever, and I have a sudden flashback to coming here with Luke for a date, before we were even going out together. Imagine if I\u2019d known then that we\u2019d end up getting married and having a daughter. Imagine if I\u2019d known I\u2019d end up betraying him with a secret meeting with his mother\u2014</p> <p>No. Stop it. Don\u2019t think about it.</p><p>As we walk into the Ritz, a dark-haired bride is standing a few feet away, wearing the most amazing sheath dress with a long sparkly veil and tiara, and I feel a sudden pang of lust. God, I\u2019d love to get married again.</p><p>I mean, to Luke, obviously.</p><p>\u2018Pin-cess.\u2019 Minnie is pointing at the bride with her chubby finger, her eyes like saucers. \u2018Pin-cess!\u2019</p><p>The bride turns and smiles charmingly down at Minnie. She takes a little pink rosebud out of her bouquet, rustles over to us and hands it to Minnie, who beams back, then reaches for the biggest, most succulent rose.</p> <p>\u2018No, Minnie!\u2019 I grab her hand just in time. \u2018Thanks so much!\u2019 I add to the bride. \u2018You look lovely. My daughter thinks you\u2019re a princess.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pince?\u2019 Minnie is looking all around. \u2018Pince?\u2019</p><p>The bride meets my eye and laughs. \u2018There\u2019s my prince, sweetheart.\u2019 She points to a man in morning dress who\u2019s approaching over the patterned carpet.</p><p>Yikes. He\u2019s short, squat, balding and in his fifties. He looks more like a frog. I can tell from Minnie\u2019s puzzled frown that she\u2019s not convinced.</p><p>\u2018Pince?\u2019 she says again to the bride. \u2018Where pince?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Congratulations and have a lovely day!\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018We\u2019d better go.\u2019 And I hurriedly lead Minnie away, her little voice still piping up, \u2018Where pince?\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m half-hoping the man at the reception desk might say, \u2018Sorry, Elinor Sherman\u2019s gone out for the afternoon,\u2019 and we can forget all about it and go to Hamleys instead. But she\u2019s clearly primed the staff, because he immediately leaps to attention and says, \u2018Ah yes, Mrs Sherman\u2019s visitors,\u2019 and escorts me up in the lift himself. And so, before I know it, I\u2019m standing in an elegant carpeted corridor, knocking on the door, my hand suddenly trembling.</p><p>Maybe this was a terrible idea. Oh God. It was, wasn\u2019t it? It was a terrible, terrible, bad idea\u2014</p><p>\u2018Rebecca.\u2019 She opens the door so suddenly, I squeak in fright.</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 I clutch Minnie\u2019s hand tighter and for a moment we all just stare at each other. Elinor\u2019s dressed in white boucl\u00e9, with giant pearls round her neck. She seems to have got even thinner, and her eyes are weirdly wide as she looks from me to Minnie.</p><p>She\u2019s scared, I suddenly realize.</p><p>Everything\u2019s turned on its head. I used to be petrified of her.</p><p>\u2018Come in.\u2019 She stands aside and I gently lead Minnie in. The room\u2019s beautiful, with grand furniture and a view over Green Park, and there\u2019s a table laid with a teapot and a posh tiered cake stand full of little \u00e9clairs and things. I guide Minnie to a stiff sofa and lift her on to it. Elinor sits down too, and there\u2019s a silent moment so twitchy and uncomfortable I almost feel like screaming.</p><p>At last Elinor draws breath. \u2018Would you like a cup of tea?\u2019 she says to Minnie.</p> <p>Minnie just gazes back with huge eyes. She seems a bit cowed by Elinor.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Earl Grey,\u2019 Elinor adds to Minnie. \u2018I will order a different variety if you would prefer.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s asking a two-year-old what kind of tea she likes? Has she ever had any dealings with a two-year-old before?</p><p>Well. Actually, probably not.</p><p>\u2018Elinor ...\u2019 I put in gently. \u2018She doesn\u2019t drink tea. She doesn\u2019t really know what tea is. Hot!\u2019 I add sharply as Minnie makes a lunge for the teapot. \u2018No, Minnie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Elinor seems put out.</p><p>\u2018She can have a biscuit, though,\u2019 I add quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I quite like the look of those biscuits myself. And the cakes.</p><p>With the very tips of her fingers, Elinor places a biscuit on a gold-embossed plate and hands it to Minnie. Is she crazy? A priceless porcelain plate from the Ritz ... and a toddler? I almost want to cover my eyes as I imagine Minnie dropping the plate, hurling the plate, crushing the biscuit to crumbs, basically causing chaos ...</p><p>But to my amazement, Minnie\u2019s sitting bolt upright, her plate on her lap, the biscuit untouched, her gaze still fixed on Elinor. She seems mesmerized by her. And Elinor seems a bit mesmerized by Minnie, too.</p><p>\u2018I am your grandmother, Minnie,\u2019 she says rigidly. \u2018You may call me ... Grandmother.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Gran-muff,\u2019 says Minnie hesitantly.</p><p>I feel a sudden bolt of panic in my heart. I can\u2019t have Minnie going around saying \u2018Gran-muff\u2019. Luke will want to know what or who \u2018Gran-muff\u2019 is.</p><p>I can\u2019t even pretend she\u2019s talking about Mum, because Minnie calls her \u2018Grana\u2019, which is totally different.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I say hurriedly. \u2018She can\u2019t call you Grandmother or Gran-muff or anything like that. She\u2019ll only say it at home and Luke will find out. He doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here.\u2019 I feel the tension creep into my voice. \u2018And he can\u2019t know. OK?\u2019</p><p>Elinor is silent. She\u2019s waiting for me to continue, I realize. I really am calling all the shots here.</p> <p>\u2018She can call you ...\u2019 I search in my mind for something innocuous and impersonal. \u2018Lady. Minnie, this is Lady. Can you say \u201cLady\u201d?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lady.\u2019 Minnie gazes at Elinor uncertainly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Lady,\u2019 says Elinor after a pause, and I feel a sudden twinge of pity for her, which is ridiculous, because this is all her own fault for being such an ice-queen bitch. Still, it\u2019s a bit tragic to be sitting in a hotel suite, being introduced to your own grandchild as \u2018Lady\u2019.</p><p>\u2018I bought an amusement.\u2019 Elinor gets up abruptly and heads into the bedroom. I take the opportunity to brush down Minnie\u2019s skirt and cram an \u00e9clair into my mouth. God, that\u2019s delicious.</p><p>\u2018Here you are.\u2019 Elinor stiffly proffers a box.</p><p>It\u2019s a jigsaw of an Impressionist painting. Two hundred pieces.</p> <p>For God\u2019s sake. There is no way on earth Minnie can do a puzzle like this. She\u2019s more likely to eat it.</p><p>\u2018Lovely!\u2019 I say. \u2018Maybe we could do it together!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fond of jigsaws,\u2019 says Elinor, and my jaw nearly drops open. This is a first. I\u2019ve never heard Elinor say she\u2019s fond of anything before.</p><p>\u2018Well ... er ... let me open it ...\u2019</p><p>I open the box and shake the pieces on to the table, fully expecting Minnie to snatch them and post them into the teapot or something.</p><p>\u2018The only way to do a jigsaw is to be methodical,\u2019 says Elinor to Minnie. \u2018First we turn the pieces over.\u2019</p><p>As she begins doing so, Minnie grabs a handful.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 says Elinor, and shoots Minnie one of those chilly glances which used to make me want to shrivel. \u2018Not like that.\u2019</p> <p>For a moment, Minnie is motionless, the pieces still clutched in her tiny hand, as though working out just how serious Elinor is. Their eyes are fixed on each other and they both look deadly determined. In fact ...</p><p>Oh my God, they look like each other.</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to hyperventilate or pass out or something. I\u2019ve never seen it before \u2013 but Minnie has the same eyes and tilt of her chin and the same imperious stare.</p><p>My worst fear has come true. I\u2019ve given birth to a mini-Elinor. I grab a tiny meringue and munch it. I need the sugar, for the shock.</p><p>\u2018Give the pieces to me,\u2019 says Elinor to Minnie \u2013 and after a pause, Minnie hands them over.</p><p>How come Minnie\u2019s behaving so well? What is up?</p><p>Elinor has already begun arranging the pieces on the table, her gaze focused. Blimey. She\u2019s serious about liking jigsaw puzzles, isn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u2018How is Luke?\u2019 she says, without looking up, and I stiffen.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s ... he\u2019s ... fine.\u2019 I take a sip of tea, suddenly wishing it was laced with brandy. Just the mention of Luke has made me jumpy. I shouldn\u2019t be here; Minnie shouldn\u2019t be here; if Luke ever found out ... \u2018We\u2019ll have to go soon,\u2019 I say abruptly. \u2018Minnie, five more minutes.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m acting with such confidence. In the past it was always Elinor sweeping in and out on her own terms, and the rest of us dancing attendance around her.</p><p>\u2018Luke and I had a ... disagreement.\u2019 Elinor\u2019s head is resolutely bowed over the pieces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m a bit thrown. Elinor doesn\u2019t usually bring up tricksy family subjects.</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I say shortly.</p><p>\u2018There are elements of Luke\u2019s character I find ...\u2019 She pauses again. \u2018Hard to comprehend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elinor, I really can\u2019t get into this,\u2019 I say uncomfortably. \u2018I can\u2019t talk about it. It was between you and Luke. I don\u2019t even know what happened, except that you said something about Annabel\u2014\u2019</p> <p>Is it my imagination, or does Elinor twitch slightly? Her hands are still shuffling jigsaw pieces but her eyes are distant. \u2018Luke was devoted to ... that woman,\u2019 she says.</p><p>That woman again. Yes, and that\u2019s exactly what he calls you, I feel like saying.</p><p>But of course I don\u2019t. I just sip my tea, watching her with more and more curiosity. Who knows what\u2019s going on underneath that lacquered hair. Has she been thinking about her row with Luke all this time? Has she finally realized how she\u2019s wrong-footed herself? Has she finally realized what she\u2019s been missing out on?</p><p>I\u2019ve never known such a mystery as Elinor. I\u2019d so love to climb inside her head, just once, and see what makes her tick.</p><p>\u2018I only met her once.\u2019 Elinor raises her head with a questioning expression. \u2018She did not seem particularly refined. Or elegant.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Is that what you said to Luke?\u2019 I can\u2019t help exclaiming furiously. \u2018That Annabel wasn\u2019t refined or elegant? No wonder he walked out on you. She\u2019s died, Elinor! He\u2019s devastated.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 says Elinor, and now there\u2019s a definite little spasm under her eye. It must be the only square millimetre which isn\u2019t Botoxed. \u2018That is not what I said. I am merely trying to understand his overreaction.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke never overreacts!\u2019 I retort angrily.</p><p>OK, this isn\u2019t quite true. I have to admit Luke has been known to overreact to things on occasion. But honestly. I feel like hitting Elinor over the head with her silver teapot.</p><p>\u2018He loved her,\u2019 she says now \u2013 and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a statement or a question.</p><p>\u2018Yes! He loved her!\u2019 I glare at Elinor. \u2018Of course he did!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>I stare at her suspiciously, wondering if she\u2019s trying to score some kind of point \u2013 but then I realize she\u2019s serious. She\u2019s actually asking me why.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean, why?\u2019 I snap in frustration. \u2018How can you ask why? She was his mother!\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a sharp silence. My words seem to be sitting in the still air. I can feel a prickly, awkward feeling creeping over me.</p><p>Because, of course, Annabel wasn\u2019t Luke\u2019s mother. Strictly speaking, Elinor\u2019s his mother. The difference is, Annabel knew how to be a mother.</p><p>Elinor has no idea what being a mother is about. If she did, she wouldn\u2019t have abandoned Luke and his father in the first place, when Luke was still tiny. If she did, she wouldn\u2019t have turned away that day he came to New York aged fourteen. I\u2019ll never forget him telling me about the way he waited outside her apartment building, desperate to meet the mythical, glamorous mother he never saw. The way she came out at last, immaculate and beautiful like a queen. He told me that she saw him across the street, that she must have known exactly who he was ... but pretended she didn\u2019t. She just got in a taxi and disappeared. And they never saw each other again till he was an adult.</p><p>So of course he got a bit obsessed with Elinor. And of course she let him down, again and again. Annabel totally understood it and was endlessly patient and supportive \u2013 even when Luke grew up and became in thrall to Elinor. She knew he was dazzled by his natural mother; she knew he\u2019d get hurt by her. All she wanted to do was protect him as much as she could, just like any mother would.</p><p>Whereas Elinor ... about anything.</p> <p>Half of me wants to say, \u2018You know what, Elinor? Forget it, you\u2019ll never understand.\u2019 But the other half wants to rise to the challenge. I want to try and make her understand, even if it turns out to be impossible. I take a deep breath, trying to organize my thoughts. I feel like I\u2019m about to explain a foreign language to her.</p><p>\u2018Annabel loved Luke,\u2019 I say at last, folding my napkin into pleats. \u2018Unconditionally. She loved him for all his good points and all his flaws. And she didn\u2019t want anything in return.\u2019</p><p>In all the time I\u2019ve known Luke, Elinor has only been interested in him when he could do something for her or raise money for her stupid charity, or cast her some reflected glory. Even the wedding she put on for us in the Plaza was all about her and her position in society. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Annabel would have done anything for Luke.\u2019 I\u2019m staring determinedly down at my napkin. \u2018And she would never have expected any reward or result. She was proud of his success, of course she was, but she would have loved him whatever he\u2019d done. Whatever he\u2019d achieved. He was just her boy and she loved him. And she never switched that love off. I don\u2019t think she could.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m feeling a bit tight around the throat. Even though we hardly ever saw her, Annabel\u2019s death hit me, too. Sometimes I can\u2019t quite believe she isn\u2019t here any more.</p><p>\u2018And by the way, just so you know, she was elegant and refined,\u2019 I can\u2019t help adding, a little savagely. \u2018Because when Luke started spending more time in New York, and getting to know you, she never said anything but positive things about you. She loved Luke so much, she\u2019d rather do that and have him happy than ever let him know she was hurt. That\u2019s a pretty elegant and refined way to behave, if you ask me.\u2019</p><p>To my horror my eyes are damp. I shouldn\u2019t have got into this. I wipe them furiously and take Minnie\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019ve got to go, Min. Thanks for the tea, Elinor.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m scrabbling for my bag. I have to get out of here. I don\u2019t bother putting Minnie\u2019s coat on but just grab it, and we\u2019re nearly at the door when Elinor\u2019s voice hits the back of my head.</p><p>\u2018I would like to see Minnie again.\u2019</p><p>In spite of myself, I turn to look at her. She\u2019s sitting bolt upright in the chair, her face as pale and expressionless as ever. I can\u2019t tell if she even heard anything I just said, let alone whether it went in.</p><p>\u2018I would ...\u2019 She seems to be speaking with a struggle. \u2018I would appreciate your kindness if you were to arrange another meeting between me and Minnie.\u2019</p> <p>She would \u2018appreciate my kindness\u2019. God, how the tables have turned.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say after a pause. \u2018Maybe.\u2019</p><p>Thoughts are jumbling round my head. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be the beginning of some regular arrangement. It was supposed to be a one-off. I already feel like I\u2019ve betrayed Luke. And Annabel. And everyone. What am I even doing here?</p><p>But at the same time I can\u2019t rid myself of that image: Minnie and Elinor staring silently at each other with the same mesmerized gaze.</p><p>If I don\u2019t ever let them see each other, am I just repeating what happened with Luke? Will Minnie get a complex and blame me for not ever letting her see her grandmother?</p><p>Oh God, it\u2019s all too complicated. I can\u2019t cope. I want a normal, straightforward family where grannies are kindly creatures who sit by the fire and do knitting.</p> <p>\u2018I just don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say again. \u2018We have to go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Goodbye, Minnie.\u2019 Elinor stiffly lifts a hand like the Queen.</p><p>\u2018Bye-bye, Lady,\u2019 says Minnie brightly.</p><p>The little pocket of Minnie\u2019s dress is stuffed with jigsaw pieces, I suddenly notice. I should take them out and give them back to Elinor, because otherwise she might spend ages trying to do a jigsaw that\u2019s incomplete. And that would be really annoying and frustrating for her, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>So as a mature, adult person, I really should give them back.</p><p>\u2018Bye, then,\u2019 I say, then head out of the door and pull it shut.</p><p>All the way home I\u2019m swamped with guilt and paranoia. I cannot tell a soul where I was today. No one would understand and Luke would be devastated. Or furious. Or both.</p><p>As I head into the kitchen, I\u2019m braced for an instant quiz on where Minnie and I have been all afternoon, but Mum just looks up from her seat at the table and says, \u2018Hello, love.\u2019 There\u2019s something about her high-pitched, edgy tone which makes me give her a second glance. Her cheeks are a suspect pink colour, too.</p> <p>\u2018Hi, Mum. Everything OK?\u2019 My eyes drop to the navy-blue sock in her hand. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well!\u2019 Clearly she\u2019s just been waiting for me to ask. \u2018I would have thought it was obvious! I\u2019m darning your father\u2019s socks, since we\u2019re too impecunious to afford any new clothes ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t say that!\u2019 Dad strides into the kitchen behind me.</p><p>\u2018... but now he says they\u2019re unwearable!\u2019 Mum finishes. \u2018Does that look unwearable to you, Becky?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Er ...\u2019</p><p>I examine the sock she thrusts at me. Not to be rude about Mum\u2019s darning, but it does look a bit lumpy, with great big stitches in bright-blue wool. I wouldn\u2019t fancy putting it on.</p><p>\u2018Couldn\u2019t you get some new socks at the pound shop?\u2019 I suggest.</p><p>\u2018New socks? And who\u2019s supposed to pay for those, may I ask?\u2019 demands Mum shrilly, as though I\u2019ve suggested Dad gets the finest bespoke monogrammed socks from Jermyn Street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Well ... er ... they only cost a pound ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve ordered some from John Lewis,\u2019 says Dad with an air of finality.</p><p>\u2018John Lewis!\u2019 Mum\u2019s voice shrills even higher. \u2018We can afford John Lewis now, can we?

There he is, coming down the stairs. What\u2019s he doing home this early? Does he know about Elinor? What does he suspect?</p><p>Stop it. Stay calm, Becky. He doesn\u2019t suspect anything. He had a meeting with a client in Brighton, that\u2019s all.</p><p>\u2018Oh, hi there!\u2019 I say brightly. \u2018Minnie and I were just ... out.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That would make sense.\u2019 Luke gives me a quizzical glance. \u2018How\u2019s my girl?\u2019 He reaches the bottom of the stairs and swings Minnie up into his arms.</p><p>\u2018Lady,\u2019 says Minnie seriously.</p><p>\u2018Lady?\u2019 Luke tickles her chin. \u2018Which lady, poppet?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lady.\u2019 Her eyes are huge and reverent. \u2018Puzz-le.\u2019</p><p>Aargh! Since when did Minnie know how to say \u2018puzzle\u2019? Why does she have to expand her vocabulary now? What other words will she suddenly come out with? \u2018Elinor\u2019? \u2018Ritz Hotel\u2019? \u2018Guess what, Daddy, I went to see my other grandmother today\u2019?</p><p>\u2018Puzz-le.\u2019 She suddenly plucks the puzzle pieces out of her pocket and presents them to Luke. \u2018Lady.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018How funny!\u2019 I laugh quickly. \u2018We were looking at puzzles in a toy shop and there was one of the Mona Lisa. That must be why she\u2019s saying \u201cpuzzle\u201d and \u201clady\u201d.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tea,\u2019 adds Minnie.</p><p>\u2018And we had tea,\u2019 I chime in desperately. \u2018Just us. Just the two of us.\u2019</p><p>Don\u2019t say \u2018Grand-muff\u2019, for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t say \u2018Grand-muff\u2019 ...</p><p>\u2018Sounds good.\u2019 Luke drops Minnie to the floor. \u2018By the way, I just had a phone message from Michael\u2019s assistant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Michael!\u2019 I say absently. \u2018That\u2019s great. How is he?\u2019</p><p>Michael is one of our oldest friends and lives in the States. He was Luke\u2019s business partner for ages, but now he\u2019s more or less retired.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. It was a bit strange.\u2019 Luke takes out a Post-it and gives it a puzzled glance. \u2018It was a bad line, but I think the assistant said something about 7 April? About not being able to make a party?\u2019</p> <p>Party?</p><p>Party?</p><p>The world seems to freeze. I\u2019m pinioned, staring at Luke in horror. My heart seems to be thumping loudly inside my head.</p><p>What was Michael\u2019s assistant doing phoning? She was supposed to email. It\u2019s supposed to be a secret. Did I not write that big enough? Did I not make it clear?</p><p>\u2018Has he invited us to something?\u2019 Luke looks perplexed. \u2018I don\u2019t remember getting an invitation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me neither,\u2019 I manage, after what seems like six hours. \u2018Sounds like the message got garbled.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We couldn\u2019t make it out to the States anyway.\u2019 Luke is frowning at the message. \u2018It\u2019s just not feasible. And I think I\u2019ve got something on that day. A training conference or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019 I\u2019m nodding frantically. \u2018Right. Well, why don\u2019t I get back to Michael about it?\u2019 I take the Post-it from Luke, trying very hard not to snatch it. \u2018Just leave it to me. I want to ask after his daughter, anyway. She sometimes comes to The Look, when she\u2019s in town.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course she does. Where else would she go?\u2019 Luke gives me a disarming smile, but I can\u2019t return it.</p><p>\u2018So ... would you mind giving Minnie her bath?\u2019 I try to speak calmly. \u2018I\u2019ve just got a quick call I need to make.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 Luke heads for the stairs. \u2018C\u2019mon, Min, bath time.\u2019</p><p>I wait until they\u2019ve reached the landing, then leg it outside to the drive, speed-dialling Bonnie\u2019s number.</p><p>\u2018Disaster! Catastrophe!\u2019 I barely even wait for her to say hello. \u2018One of the guests\u2019 assistants rang up about the party! She left a message with Luke! I mean, I managed to save the situation ... but what if I hadn\u2019t?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh, goodness.\u2019 Bonnie sounds shocked. \u2018How unfortunate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wrote on the invitation, \u201cDon\u2019t call\u201d!\u2019 I\u2019m gabbling almost hysterically. \u2018How much clearer could I have been? What if other people start calling? What do I do?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, don\u2019t panic,\u2019 says Bonnie. \u2018I\u2019ll have a think about this. How about we have breakfast tomorrow to formulate a plan? I\u2019ll tell Luke I\u2019m coming in late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK. Thanks so much, Bonnie. See you tomorrow.\u2019</p> <p>Slowly my pulse-rate starts subsiding. Honestly, organizing a surprise party is like doing sudden hundred-metre sprints with no warning the whole time. They should offer it instead of personal training.</p><p>Ooh, maybe I\u2019ll end up super-fit with no effort. That would be cool.</p><p>I put my phone away and am heading back into the house when I become aware of the grinding sound of an engine. A big white van is pulling into the drive, which is weird.</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 I approach hesitantly. \u2018Can I help you?\u2019</p><p>A guy in a T-shirt leans out of the cab of the van. He\u2019s in his late forties, with dark stubble and a massive tattooed forearm.</p> <p>\u2018You the bartering girl? Becky?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I peer at him in surprise. What\u2019s going on? I haven\u2019t even put any ads in recently. Unless he\u2019s got those latest Prada shades and wants to swap them for a blue Missoni scarf.</p><p>Which somehow I doubt.</p><p>\u2018My daughter promised you a marquee? Nicole Taylor? Sixteen-year-old?\u2019</p><p>This is Nicole\u2019s dad? I suddenly notice a nasty frown between his eyes. Shit. He looks quite scary. Is he going to tell me off for bartering with someone under-age?</p><p>\u2018Well yes, but\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Whole story came out last night. My wife wanted to know where she got them bags you gave her. Nicole should never have done it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t realize she was so young,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think a marquee costs the same as a couple of handbags?\u2019 he says menacingly.</p><p>Oh God. Does he think I was trying to pull some kind of scam?</p><p>\u2018No! I mean ... I don\u2019t know!\u2019 My voice jumps with nerves. \u2018I was just hoping someone might just have a spare marquee they didn\u2019t want, you know, lying around the place\u2014\u2019</p><p>I break off as I suddenly realize my voice might be carrying up to the bathroom window. Shit.</p><p>\u2018Can we whisper, please?\u2019 I edge nearer the cab. \u2018It\u2019s all supposed to be a secret. And if my husband comes out ... I\u2019m buying fruit off you, OK?\u2019</p><p>Nicole\u2019s dad shoots me an incredulous look, then says, \u2018How much are them bags worth, anyway?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018They cost about a thousand pounds new. I mean, it depends how much you like Marc Jacobs, I suppose ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thousand quid.\u2019 He shakes his head in disbelief. \u2018She\u2019s a bloody little lunatic.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t dare chime in, either to agree or disagree. In fact, now I think about it, he might be talking about me.</p><p>Abruptly Nicole\u2019s dad focuses on me again. \u2018All right,\u2019 he says heavily. \u2018If my daughter promised you a marquee, I\u2019ll supply a marquee. I can\u2019t lay on the full monty, you\u2019ll have to put it up yourself. But we\u2019re quiet at the moment. I\u2019ll sort you something.\u2019</p><p>For an instant I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve just heard.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll get me a marquee?\u2019 I clap a hand over my mouth. \u2018Oh my God. Do you know that you have just saved my life?\u2019</p><p>Nicole\u2019s dad gives a short laugh and hands me a card. \u2018One of the lads\u2019ll be in touch. Tell him the date, say Cliff knows about it, we\u2019ll sort you out.\u2019 He grinds the van into gear and starts reversing out of the drive.</p><p>\u2018Thanks, Cliff!\u2019 I call after him. \u2018Tell Nicole I hope she\u2019s enjoying the bags!\u2019</p><p>I want to dance around. I want to whoop. I\u2019ve got a marquee! And it didn\u2019t cost thousands, and it\u2019s all sorted.

As I arrive I can see Bonnie, already at a corner table, looking immaculate in a coral-coloured suit and the seed-pearl earrings which I made Luke buy her as a birthday present. She looks perfectly comfortable sitting there on her own, her head erect, calmly sipping a cup of tea. Like she\u2019s sat on her own in restaurants a million times before.</p><p>\u2018The earrings look great!\u2019 I say, sliding into the seat opposite.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re exquisite!\u2019 says Bonnie, touching one. \u2018I do hope you got my thank-you message, Becky. How on earth did you do it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was really subtle,\u2019 I say proudly. \u2018I found them online and told Luke I wanted them for myself. Then I said, \u201cActually, no! They\u2019d suit someone with different colouring. Someone like your assistant Bonnie, maybe!\u201d\u2019</p><p>I won\u2019t mention that I had to say it about five times, louder and louder, before Luke even looked up from his laptop.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re very adept.\u2019 Bonnie sighs. \u2018I haven\u2019t had quite so much luck with your basement gym, I\u2019m afraid. I have tried to mention it\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry about that any more. The house is off for the moment, anyway.\u2019 I pick up the menu, then put it down distractedly. \u2018I\u2019m more bothered about the party. Can you believe what happened last night?\u2019</p><p>\u2018People are so lax when it comes to invitations.\u2019 Bonnie tuts with disapproval. \u2018They never read instructions properly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what am I going to do?\u2019 I\u2019m hoping Bonnie will have thought of some clever solution already \u2013 and sure enough, she nods calmly.</p><p>\u2018I have a suggestion. We contact each invitee personally, reiterate the top-secret nature of the party, and head off any further mishaps.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say slowly. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll take the list to work tomorrow.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018May I suggest, Becky, that I do the telephoning?\u2019 says Bonnie gently. \u2018If you do, you will give the impression that you are the point of contact. But you should not be the point of contact. We need to separate you from the guests as much as possible, to prevent any further slip-ups.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But that would be too much work! You can\u2019t do that!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t mind at all. Really, I\u2019d be glad to.\u2019 She hesitates. \u2018It\u2019s rather fun!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... thanks!\u2019</p><p>A waiter is hovering and I order a double-shot cappuccino. I need the caffeine. This party is harder work than I thought. My hand muscles are aching from cutting out plastic bags for pompoms (I\u2019ve done seventy-two) and I\u2019m constantly paranoid Luke\u2019s going to stumble across my folder of notes. Last night I dreamed that he came back home just as I was making his birthday cake in a giant mixing bowl and I had to pretend it was breakfast and he kept saying, \u2018But I don\u2019t want cake for breakfast.\u2019</p><p>Which is a stupid dream, because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m making a birthday cake for two hundred people.</p><p>Oh God. I need to add that to the list. Order birthday cake.</p><p>\u2018Becky, dear, relax,\u2019 says Bonnie as though reading my mind. \u2018Minor scares will always happen. But it seems to me you have this party remarkably well contained. You know, Luke has a very loyal staff,\u2019 she adds quietly. \u2018They\u2019ll be delighted to have this chance to show their appreciation of him.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I feel a tiny glow. \u2018Well ... that\u2019s good, anyway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never had a boss who stuck up for his staff with such resolve. If ever there\u2019s a difficult client or a complaint, Luke insists on taking the meeting himself. He says it\u2019s his name above the door and he should take the flak. Of course, this can also be a weakness,\u2019 she adds thoughtfully, sipping her tea. \u2018I think he should probably delegate more.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help looking at Bonnie anew. How much does she observe, sitting quietly in the corner, watching everyone?</p><p>\u2018This new carbon-thingy client sounds cool,\u2019 I say, hoping to prod her into saying more.</p><p>\u2018Oh yes. Luke was thrilled with the result. Of course he\u2019d tried to downplay his hopes ... but I always know if a meeting is important to him,\u2019 Bonnie suddenly gives a little smile, \u2018because he reties his tie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I exclaim in delighted recognition. \u2018He does that at home, too!\u2019</p><p>We smile at each other, and I take a sip of my cappuccino. In some ways it feels weird, talking about Luke behind his back. But in other ways it\u2019s really nice, having someone to share with. No one else knows Luke\u2019s everyday little quirks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Have you always made friends with the wives of your bosses?\u2019 I can\u2019t help asking. \u2018Or husbands?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not really.\u2019 She looks almost amused. \u2018They wouldn\u2019t have seen me as ... friend material, I don\u2019t think.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve seen pictures of Lady Zara Forrest, the wife of Bonnie\u2019s previous employer. She runs a spa in Notting Hill and is always doing interviews. I can\u2019t really see her hanging out and chatting with Bonnie.</p><p>\u2018Well, I suppose it\u2019s more natural for you to be friends with other people in the company,\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018It seems to have a really good atmosphere ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 says Bonnie. \u2018Although of course, as Luke\u2019s personal assistant, I\u2019m in a tricky position. I have to be guarded on some matters. So it\u2019s natural that there\u2019s a little distance between me and the others.\u2019 She smiles. \u2018It\u2019s always been that way.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s lonely.</p><p>It hits me with a thud. Of course, she might have a massive social life outside work \u2013 but somehow I don\u2019t think so. Luke once told me how available she is over the weekend, how she always replies to emails within the hour and how helpful it is to him. Maybe it is great for him. But what about her?</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m really glad we\u2019ve got to know each other better,\u2019 I say warmly. \u2018I told you we\u2019d be a good team. I\u2019m working on the air-conditioning situation, by the way.\u2019</p><p>Luke keeps his office far too cold. I\u2019m not surprised Bonnie\u2019s shivering.</p> <p>\u2018Thank you!\u2019 She dimples. \u2018And is there anything else I can do for you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018There must be something ...\u2019 I take a few sips of coffee, mulling it over. \u2018Oh yes! You know that new shower gel Luke\u2019s using? Doesn\u2019t it smell awful?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shower gel?\u2019 Bonnie seems thrown. \u2018Well, I couldn\u2019t comment ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018You must have smelt it. The rosemary and ginseng one? I hate it, but he says it wakes him up. Well, if you said you hated it too, he might stop using it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, dear.\u2019 Bonnie peers at me. \u2018I couldn\u2019t possibly mention something as personal as shower gel.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you could! Of course you could! Believe me, Luke respects your views on everything. He wouldn\u2019t get offended. And that blue tie of his with the cars on it. Can you tell him that\u2019s hideous, too?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Becky, really ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019 I smile winsomely at her, wife-to-PA. \u2018You must hate that tie, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ...\u2019 Bonnie looks uncomfortable. Of course she does.</p><p>I unwrap my little biscuit and crunch it, pondering. A new, radical thought has come to me. There\u2019s another major way I could get her to influence Luke for me. Possibly.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie ... are you an only child?\u2019 I say at last.</p><p>\u2018No, I have a brother.\u2019</p><p>Perfect!</p><p>\u2018Well, if you get the chance ... could you possibly mention your brother to Luke and say how having a sibling has been really important to you? And maybe ask him if he wants any more children after Minnie and say how lovely it would be if he did? And how he should get a move on?\u2019</p> <p>Bonnie looks thunderstruck.</p><p>\u2018Becky! This really isn\u2019t my business ... I really couldn\u2019t ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you could!\u2019 I say encouragingly. \u2018I so want another baby, and I know he does too, deep down, and he\u2019d totally listen to you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just if you get the chance,\u2019 I say reassuringly. \u2018If it comes up in conversation. Shall we get the bill?\u2019</p><p>As we leave the restaurant, I give Bonnie an impulsive hug.</p><p>\u2018Thanks so much for everything, Bon. You\u2019re the best!\u2019</p><p>I should have hooked up with Bonnie ages ago. Next I\u2019ll get her to tell Luke we need to go to Mauritius.</p><p>\u2018Not at all.\u2019 She still looks a bit flustered, but smiles at me. \u2018And please don\u2019t worry about the party. I\u2019m sure Luke doesn\u2019t suspect anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not so sure.\u2019 I glance up and down the street in sudden paranoia. \u2018Did I tell you he bumped into me after our lunch? I told him I\u2019d gone for Botox but he didn\u2019t believe me, and now he keeps giving me these little looks, as though he knows I\u2019m up to something\u2014\u2019 I stop at Bonnie\u2019s expression. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now it makes sense!\u2019 she exclaims. She draws me aside, out of the flow of people on the pavement. \u2018Becky, that day we met, Luke came back to the office and asked me if any designer-clothes shops had opened in the area. I assumed it was some kind of retail research. But now I wonder if he thought you were secretly ...\u2019 Bonnie trails off tactfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Shopping?\u2019 I say incredulously. \u2018He thought I was shopping?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s possible, don\u2019t you think?\u2019 She twinkles. \u2018It could be rather a good cover.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But ... but you don\u2019t understand! I\u2019ve promised not to shop! We\u2019ve had this agreement, ever since that bank went bust! And I\u2019m totally keeping to it!\u2019</p><p>My mind is whirling with indignation. Did Luke think I was breaking my promise and covering up with a story about Botox? Is that why he kept looking so suspiciously at my bag?</p> <p>I feel like marching into his office, throwing down my purse like a gauntlet and declaiming, \u2018Rebecca Brandon n\u00e9e Bloomwood keeps her word, sir!\u2019 And challenging him to a duel, maybe.</p><p>\u2018Oh dear.\u2019 Bonnie looks troubled. \u2018Becky, this is only surmise ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. He thinks I was shopping. Well, fine. Let him.\u2019 I lift my chin firmly. \u2018I\u2019ll use it as a decoy.\u2019</p><p>After all, the more Luke suspects I\u2019m secretly shopping, the less he\u2019ll suspect I\u2019m secretly organizing a party. As I head off down the street, I\u2019m full of resolve. If shopping is what Luke thinks I\u2019m up to ... then shopping is what he\u2019ll get. Big time.</p><p>As I hear Luke\u2019s key in the lock that evening, I\u2019m ready for him. I\u2019m wearing a vivid lime-green jumper that I\u2019ve never worn before (total mistake, what was I thinking?) and that still has the shop tag hanging from the label. On top of that, I\u2019ve got the leather jacket that I bought in the sales, with its Whistles label carefully reattached and poking out, plus a scarf, a necklace and a bright-orange belt, none of which I\u2019ve ever worn.</p> <p>I mean, I was planning to wear them. You know. When the right moment came.</p><p>I\u2019ve dragged down some posh carrier bags from the top of the wardrobe and put them under the kitchen table, just peeking out. I\u2019ve stuffed some Prada-logoed tissue paper into the kitchen bin, and half-hidden some old receipts behind the microwave. Minnie is following me around in her pyjamas and dressing gown, eating a honey sandwich and watching in wonderment. As I hear Luke heading towards the kitchen I say \u2018Sshh!\u2019 to her, just in case.</p><p>\u2018Sshh!\u2019 she instantly replies, putting her finger to her lips. \u2018Sshh, Mummy!\u2019 She looks so serious, I can\u2019t help laughing. Then I set up position in the kitchen, checking out my reflection in the fridge door with my best fashionista pose. When Luke comes in, I give quite a convincing jump.</p><p>\u2018You startled me, Luke!\u2019 I say, and hastily rip off my jacket, making sure the pink Whistles tag bobs into view. \u2018I was just ... um ... This is nothing. Nothing at all!\u2019 I squash the jacket into a ball and whip it behind my back, as Luke gives me a puzzled look. He heads to the fridge and gets out a beer.</p><p>Ooh. Maybe I should have put the receipts in the fridge.</p><p>No. Too obvious.</p> <p>\u2018Sshh, Daddy!\u2019 says Minnie importantly to Luke, her finger still on her lips. \u2018Hide-seek.\u2019</p><p>That\u2019s what she thinks I was doing. (Hide and seek is Minnie\u2019s favourite game. Except it isn\u2019t like normal hide and seek. You only count to three and you have to tell her where you\u2019re going to hide. And when it\u2019s her turn she always hides in the same place, which is the middle of the room.)</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll play in a minute, poppet. Interesting jumper,\u2019 he says to me, raising his eyebrows. As well he might, since I look like a lime-green jelly bean.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s ancient!\u2019 I say at once. \u2018I bought it ages ago. You can ask Suze. Ring her up now if you don\u2019t believe me! Go on!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke gives a little laugh. \u2018I never said I don\u2019t believe you. Why are you so paranoid?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because ... no reason!\u2019 I edge over to the table and kick the carrier bags underneath in a surreptitious yet obvious manner. I can see Luke\u2019s eyes zip down and clock them.</p><p>Ha! Result!</p><p>\u2018So, what were you up to today?\u2019 he says easily, reaching for the bottle-opener.</p> <p>\u2018Nothing! I didn\u2019t go anywhere! God, you\u2019re always quizzing me, Luke.\u2019 I stuff the necklace inside my jumper as though to hide it.</p><p>Luke opens his mouth to speak \u2013 then seems to decide against it and instead uncaps his beer.</p><p>Take the cap to the bin ... I silently will him. Go on, take it to the bin.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>I really should be a choreographer. Just as Luke\u2019s about to pull out the bin, I leap across the kitchen with spot-on timing and plant a hand on the handle to stop him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do that,\u2019 I say super-casually. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019m just putting it in recycling.\u2019 Luke seems puzzled.

Look at me! Prada!\u2019</p><p>For a moment neither of us speaks.</p> <p>\u2018Gosh, what\u2019s that doing there?\u2019 I say in a high-pitched, unnatural voice, and start stuffing it down again. \u2018That\u2019s old. Really, really old. I mean, I can\u2019t even remember the last time I went into a Prada. Or bought anything Prada. Or anything!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stumbling over my words and I\u2019ve never sounded so guilty in my life.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m beginning to feel guilty. I feel like I\u2019ve just maxed out my credit card and all the stuff is hidden under the bed.</p><p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke passes a hand over his brow. \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 He gives me a sceptical look.</p><p>\u2018Nothing at all.\u2019 I try to sound firm and confident. Although I\u2019m now wondering if I\u2019ve overdone it.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s not fooled by my act for a moment. Maybe he\u2019s thinking, \u2018Well, she obviously hasn\u2019t been shopping so what else could she be trying to hide, aha, I know, a party.\u2019</p><p>For a few moments we just look at each other. I\u2019m breathing hard and my hand is still clenched round the handle of the bin drawer.</p><p>\u2018Found?\u2019 Minnie\u2019s voice breaks the spell. She\u2019s standing in the middle of the room with her hands clasped tightly over her eyes, which is how she hides.</p><p>\u2018Becky!\u2019 Dad appears at the door. \u2018Darling, you\u2019d better come. You\u2019ve got a delivery.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, right,\u2019 I say, taken aback. I wasn\u2019t expecting a delivery. What can this be?</p><p>\u2018Found?\u2019 Minnie\u2019s voice rises to a wail. \u2018Found?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Found you!\u2019 Luke and I hastily say in unison. \u2018Well done, Minnie!\u2019 I add as she opens her eyes and beams proudly at us. \u2018Very good hiding! Who\u2019s this delivery from?\u2019 I turn to Dad again.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a van from fashionpack.co.uk,\u2019 says Dad as we follow him out to the hall. \u2018Quite a lot of stuff, apparently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I wrinkle my brow. \u2018That can\u2019t be right. I haven\u2019t been shopping on fashionpack.co.uk. I mean, not recently.\u2019</p><p>I can see Luke eyeing me quizzically, and flush. \u2018I haven\u2019t, OK? It must be a mistake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Delivery for Rebecca Brandon,\u2019 the delivery guy says as I reach the front door. \u2018If you could sign here ...\u2019 He holds out an electronic device and a stylus.</p><p>\u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 I hold up my hands. \u2018I\u2019m not signing anything. I didn\u2019t order anything from you! I mean, I don\u2019t remember ordering anything\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah, you did.\u2019 He sounds bored, as though he\u2019s heard this before. \u2018Sixteen items.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sixteen?\u2019 My jaw drops.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll show you the receipt if you like.\u2019 He rolls his eyes and heads back to the van.</p><p>Sixteen items?</p><p>OK, this makes no sense. How can I have ordered sixteen items from fashionpack.co.uk and not even remember? Am I getting Alzheimer\u2019s?</p><p>A minute ago I was pretending to be guilty about shopping, and now it\u2019s all coming true, like some kind of bad dream. How can this be happening? Did I somehow make it happen?</p><p>I suddenly notice Luke and Dad exchanging looks above my head.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t do it!\u2019 I say, rattled. \u2018I didn\u2019t order anything! It must have been some kind of weird computer glitch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, not the computer-glitch excuse again,\u2019 says Luke wearily.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not an excuse, it\u2019s true! I didn\u2019t order this stuff.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well someone clearly did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe my identity\u2019s been stolen. Or maybe I was sleep-shopping!\u2019 I say in sudden inspiration.</p><p>Oh my God. Now, that makes total sense. It explains everything. I\u2019m a secret sleep-shopper. I can see myself rising silently from my bed, coming downstairs with a glassy stare, logging on to the computer, tapping in my credit-card details ...</p><p>But then, why didn\u2019t I buy that fab bag from Net-A-Porter that I\u2019ve been lusting after? Does my sleep-shopping self have no taste?</p><p>Could I write a note to my sleep-shopping self?</p><p>\u2018Sleep-shopping?\u2019 Luke raises an eyebrow. \u2018That\u2019s a new one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No it\u2019s not,\u2019 I retort. \u2018Sleepwalking\u2019s a very common ailment, I think you\u2019ll find, Luke.

She can use a mouse easily. And that website has got a one-click button. If she just bashed at the keyboard enough times and clicked enough times ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You mean to say, Minnie ordered these?\u2019 Dad looks equally flabbergasted.</p><p>\u2018Well, if I didn\u2019t, and Luke didn\u2019t ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where shall I put them?\u2019 The delivery guy interrupts us. \u2018Inside the front door?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! I don\u2019t want them! You\u2019ll have to take them back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can\u2019t do that.\u2019 He shakes his head. \u2018If you want to return \u2018em, you\u2019ll have to take delivery, use the return form and send \u2018em back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But what\u2019s the point of taking delivery?\u2019 I say in frustration. \u2018I don\u2019t want them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, next time you don\u2019t want something, can I suggest you don\u2019t order it?\u2019 says the delivery guy, and gives a hoarse chuckle at his own wit.

Actually, it\u2019s not as bad as I thought.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s one.\u2019 The guy corrects me. \u2018Come individually packaged on a hanging rail, they do.\u2019 Already he\u2019s hefting down another one.

It was just one of those things, all children do it\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in denial! Becky, she\u2019s getting wilder every day. I think we need to take extreme action. Don\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>Extreme action? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 I feel a little chilly around my spine. \u2018I don\u2019t think she needs \u201cextreme action\u201d, whatever that is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I do.\u2019 He\u2019s looking grave and not quite meeting my eye. \u2018I\u2019m going to make some calls.\u2019</p><p>What calls?</p><p>\u2018Luke, Minnie isn\u2019t some kind of problem,\u2019 I say, my voice suddenly a little shaky. \u2018And who are you calling, anyway? You shouldn\u2019t call anyone without telling me first!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d tell me not to!\u2019 He sounds exasperated. \u2018Becky, one of us has to do something. I\u2019m going to sound out a couple of child experts.\u2019 He pulls out his BlackBerry and checks it, and something inside me flips.</p><p>\u2018What experts? What do you mean?\u2019 I grab his BlackBerry. \u2018Tell me!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Give that back!\u2019 His voice rises harshly and he pulls the BlackBerry out of my grasp.</p><p>I stare at him in shock, blood pulsing through my cheeks. He really meant that. He really didn\u2019t want me to see. Is this about Minnie? Or ... something else?</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the secret?\u2019 I say at last. \u2018Luke, what are you hiding?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 he says defensively. \u2018There\u2019s work-in-progress on there. Rough stuff. Sensitive stuff. I don\u2019t like anyone seeing it.\u2019</p> <p>Yeah, right. His eyes keep flicking to his BlackBerry. He\u2019s lying. I know it.</p><p>\u2018Luke, you\u2019re keeping something from me.\u2019 I swallow hard. \u2018I know you are. We\u2019re a couple! We shouldn\u2019t have secrets from each other!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can talk!\u2019 He throws back his head and laughs. \u2018My darling, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s shopping, or some massive debt, or you really are having Botox ... but there\u2019s something going on that you don\u2019t want me to know about. Isn\u2019t there?\u2019</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u2018No there is not!\u2019 I say hotly. \u2018Absolutely not!\u2019</p> <p>Please let him think it\u2019s shopping, please let him think it\u2019s shopping ...</p><p>There\u2019s an odd, tingly pause, then Luke shrugs.</p><p>\u2018Fine. Well then ... neither of us is hiding anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 I lift my chin. \u2018Agreed.\u2019</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>As soon as I get up the next morning I call Bonnie\u2019s line and leave an urgent message for her to call back. She\u2019ll tell me what\u2019s going on. Downstairs at breakfast there\u2019s a prickly atmosphere, and Luke keeps glancing warily at me as though he\u2019s not sure how to proceed.</p> <p>\u2018So!\u2019 he suddenly says in fake, cheerful tones. \u2018Big day today. I\u2019m trying to arrange a meeting with Sir Bernard Cross\u2019s right-hand man, Christian Scott-Hughes. We feel Sir Bernard might be sympathetic to the climate-technology cause.\u2019</p><p>God, he\u2019s transparent. He\u2019s not going to tell me about whatever-it-is on the BlackBerry ... so instead he\u2019s offering me some boring old piece of information about climate technology and he thinks that\u2019ll fool me.</p><p>\u2018Fab,\u2019 I say politely.</p><p>Actually, I am quite impressed. Sir Bernard Cross is massive. (In both senses: he\u2019s always in the news because of being a billionaire philanthropist with lots of extreme views, and he weighs about twenty-five stone.)</p><p>\u2018Christian Scott-Hughes is Sir Bernard\u2019s executive director and hugely influential,\u2019 Luke is saying. \u2018If we can win him round, then we\u2019re a long way down the road.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why don\u2019t you go and meet Bernard Cross himself?\u2019 I say, and Luke gives a little laugh.</p><p>\u2018Sir Bernard doesn\u2019t just meet people,\u2019 he says. \u2018That\u2019s like saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just meet the Queen herself?\u201d You don\u2019t do that. You go through layers. You work the system.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t get that at all. If I wanted to see the Queen, I\u2019d aim to see the Queen. But there\u2019s no point saying that to Luke, because he\u2019ll just give me some lecture about how I don\u2019t understand the complexities of his business, like that time when I suggested matchmaking all his single clients.</p> <p>And anyway, I don\u2019t really care one way or the other about Sir Bernard Big-belly</p><p>\u2018How about you?\u2019 He drains his coffee. \u2018Work OK?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Booming, actually,\u2019 I say smugly. \u2018Our appointment book is fuller than it\u2019s ever been and the managing director just sent me an email telling me how brilliant I am.\u2019</p><p>Luke gives an incredulous laugh. \u2018I don\u2019t know how you do it. Every other sector is dead, but you\u2019re still managing to sell expensive designer clothes ...\u2019 His face suddenly blanches. \u2018Becky, please tell me you\u2019re not just selling them all to yourself.\u2019</p><p>I gasp with affront. Number one, I made a promise, which I am keeping. Number two, if I was doing that, then why would I be standing here in a skirt which I bought five years ago from Barneys?</p><p>\u2018If you really want to know,\u2019 I say haughtily, \u2018we at The Look have a unique approach to fashion selling which is seeing us through the difficult times.\u2019</p><p>I won\u2019t explain that \u2018unique\u2019 means \u2018we hide the clothes in computer-paper boxes\u2019. Luke doesn\u2019t need to hear every tedious little detail of my job, does he?</p><p>\u2018Well, all power to you then.\u2019 Luke gives me a disarming smile. \u2018I have to go. Give my love to Suze.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m meeting Suze before work to see Ernie\u2019s art exhibition at his school and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 bump into his headmistress. (I\u2019ve prepared all sorts of cutting remarks. She\u2019ll be quaking in her boots by the time I\u2019ve finished with her.) And then we\u2019re both going on to The Look for the big promotional tie-in meeting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is the other reason why my star is so high at work at the moment: my idea about linking Danny\u2019s new collection with Shetland Shortbread totally worked! The whole collection is centred around tartan, so it\u2019s perfect. They\u2019re doing a special offer and joint publicity, and it\u2019s all in association with the British Wool Marketing Board, and the promotional shoot took place on Tarkie\u2019s farm with super-thin models standing amid herds of Tarkie\u2019s sheep. And the best bit is, it was all my idea, and now everyone\u2019s really impressed.</p><p>Jasmine said the other day that maybe they\u2019d even make me a director! Of course, I instantly gave a modest little laugh and said, \u2018Oh, rubbish.\u2019 But I\u2019ve already worked out what I could wear for my first board meeting \u2013 this amazing pale-yellow jacket from the new Burberry Prorsum collection, over dark pinstriped trousers. (I mean, you\u2019re allowed to buy new clothes if you get on the board of something. Even Luke must know that.)</p><p>On my way to St Cuthbert\u2019s two emails arrive on my BlackBerry which make me want to whoop. The first is from Bonnie, which she obviously sent last night. It says we\u2019ve had forty-three acceptances already. Forty-three! I can\u2019t believe Luke is so popular!</p><p>No. That came out wrong. Obviously I can.</p> <p>But still, forty-three in two days! And that\u2019s not even counting all the Brandon Communications staff, who still don\u2019t know there\u2019s a party but think they\u2019re going to a conference.</p><p>And the other is from Kentish English Sparkling Wine. They want to provide drinks for the party! They\u2019re sending me fifty bottles! All they ask is that they can issue a press release and publish photos of Luke and his guests enjoying their high-quality product. I mean, I\u2019ve never tasted Kentish English Sparkling Wine, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s delicious.</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling proud as I stride along. I am doing so well. I\u2019ve got the marquee, the drinks, the canap\u00e9s, the pompoms, and I\u2019ve booked a professional fire-eater called Alonzo, who doubles as a Country and Western singer, if we want it. (He doesn\u2019t sing Country and Western songs while he\u2019s fire-eating. He gets changed and calls himself Alvin.)</p><p>St Cuthbert\u2019s is in one of those posh white squares with lots of railings and stucco, and I\u2019m nearly at the school gate when my mobile rings and shows Suze\u2019s ID.</p><p>\u2018Suze!\u2019 I greet her. \u2018I\u2019m just outside. Where shall I meet you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not there! I\u2019m at the doctor\u2019s.\u2019 Suze sounds despairing. \u2018Ernie has a terrible earache. We\u2019ve been up all night. I won\u2019t be able to come to The Look, either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, poor you! Well ... should I just leave?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, don\u2019t be silly! Go to the exhibition and grab yourself a cake. They\u2019ll be delicious. Half the mothers have done a cordon-bleu course. And you could always look at Ernie\u2019s painting,\u2019 she adds, as though it\u2019s an afterthought.</p><p>\u2018Of course I\u2019ll look at Ernie\u2019s painting!\u2019 I say firmly. \u2018And we must meet up as soon as Ernie\u2019s better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Definitely.\u2019 Suze pauses. \u2018So ... how are you?\u2019 she adds. \u2018How are the party preparations going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great, thanks,\u2019 I say ebulliently. \u2018All under control.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Because Tarkie and I had this great idea, if you\u2019re serving coffee ...\u2019</p><p>I feel a flash of annoyance. No one will believe I can do this, will they? Everyone assumes I\u2019m totally incompetent and can\u2019t even serve coffee properly.</p><p>\u2018Suze, for the last time, I don\u2019t need your help!\u2019 The words shoot out before I can stop them. \u2018I can do it on my own! So leave me alone!\u2019</p><p>Instantly I regret sounding so harsh. There\u2019s silence at the other end and I can feel my cheeks turning pink.</p><p>\u2018Suze ...\u2019 I swallow. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, Bex, sometimes people want to help.\u2019 Suze cuts me off, her voice suddenly trembling. \u2018And it\u2019s not always about you, OK? It\u2019s not because we think you can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s because Luke isn\u2019t just your husband, he\u2019s our friend too, and we wanted to do something nice for him. Tarkie suggested getting the Shetland Shortbread guys to come up with a special shortbread recipe just for Luke. And we thought we could serve it at the party with the coffee. But fine, if you\u2019re that prickly we won\u2019t. Forget it. I have to go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Suze\u2014\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s too late. She\u2019s gone. I try redialling but get the busy signal.</p> <p>Oh God. She sounded really hurt. Maybe I was a bit defensive. But how was I supposed to know she had special shortbread? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a few moments I just stand there, wincing. Should I text her?</p><p>No. She\u2019s too angry with me. I\u2019ll just wait till she\u2019s cooled down a bit. And maybe had a night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I can do right now. I might as well go in and have a cake.</p><p>I head through the school gates, past all the babbling mothers, and follow signs to the exhibition. It\u2019s being held in an airy hall with a parquet floor, and I can already see what Suze means about the cakes. There\u2019s a whole trestle table of candy-coloured macaroons and mini chocolate brownies, and lots of very toned mummies in low-slung jeans, holding cups of coffee and eyeing up the goodies with hostile eyes. Not a single one is eating a cake \u2013 so why do they bother to have them?</p> <p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I approach the trestle table, where a well-groomed blonde woman is serving. \u2018I\u2019d like a chocolate brownie, please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 She hands me a tiny sliver of brownie in a napkin. \u2018Five pounds, please.\u2019</p><p>Five quid? For two bites?</p><p>\u2018All for the school!\u2019 She trills with laughter that sounds like icicles and puts my fiver into a felt-covered cash box, trimmed with gingham. \u2018Now, are you a new Reception mummy? Because we are expecting the decorated gingerbread houses by Tuesday, and response has been a little disappointing\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not a mummy,\u2019 I hastily correct her. \u2018At least, not here. I\u2019m just a visitor. My daughter isn\u2019t at school yet.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Ah. I see.\u2019 The interest in her eyes dies a little. \u2018So where will your daughter be going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 My voice is muffled by the brownie, which is absolutely scrumptious. \u2018She\u2019s only two.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Two months.\u2019 The woman nods knowingly. \u2018Well, you\u2019ll have to get your skates on ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, two.\u2019 I swallow the brownie. \u2018Two years old.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Two years old?\u2019 The woman seems riveted. \u2018And you haven\u2019t started?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Er ... no.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You haven\u2019t got her down anywhere?\u2019 She stares at me with wide, twitchy eyes. \u2018Nowhere?\u2019</p><p>OK, this woman is freaking me out, with her super-white teeth and stressy manner. I mean, I know schools get full up and everything. But come on, even the waiting list for that new Prada bag was only a year. No school can be more exclusive than a limited-edition Prada bag, surely?</p><p>\u2018Thanks so much for the brownie!\u2019 I quickly walk away. Now I feel all anxious, like I\u2019ve missed the boat and I didn\u2019t even know there was a boat. They should have Vogue for schools. They should have this month\u2019s Must-Have and Latest Trends and timings for all the waiting lists. Then you\u2019d know.</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019m not going to get obsessive about this. We\u2019ll get Minnie into a lovely school, I know we will.</p><p>I wonder where Madonna sends her kids to school. I mean, not that I\u2019d send Minnie to a school because of the celebrities. Obviously not.</p><p>But still. Maybe I\u2019ll look it up online. Just out of interest.</p><p>I buy myself a coffee and then head towards the art. Most of the paintings are of flowers, and when I get to Ernie\u2019s picture, right in the corner, I\u2019m a bit startled. It\u2019s ... different. It\u2019s very dark and splodgy, and shows a sheep on a dark background that might be a moor ...</p><p>Ah. Looking more closely, I think the sheep is dead.</p> <p>Well. There\u2019s nothing wrong with painting a picture of a dead sheep, is there? And the blood trickling from its mouth is quite realistic. I\u2019ll say that to Suze, when we\u2019ve made up. Yes. I\u2019ll say, \u2018I loved the blood! It had such ... movement!\u2019</p><p>\u2018... absolutely revolting!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Gross!\u2019</p><p>I become aware of a cluster of little girls, also looking at the painting. One of them has perfect blonde French plaits and a hand clamped over her mouth.</p><p>\u2018I feel sick,\u2019 she declares. \u2018You know who painted this? Ernest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s always drawing sheep,\u2019 says another one derisively. \u2018It\u2019s all he can do.\u2019</p><p>The others break into bitchy giggles, and I stare at them, livid. They all look like junior versions of Alicia Bitch Long-legs. A bell rings and they hurry off, which is a good thing, otherwise I probably would have said something undignified and immature involving the word \u2018cows\u2019.</p><p>Suddenly I notice a woman with dark hair in a bun and a queenly air sweeping the room, smiling graciously at people and having short conversations. I watch on tenterhooks as she nears me.</p><p>Yes! I thought so. On the lapel of her cardigan is a badge saying \u2018Harriet Grayson MA, Headmistress\u2019. This is the one who\u2019s been giving Ernie a hard time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, I\u2019ll give her a hard time. Especially as I still feel guilty about snapping at Suze.</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 She smiles at me and extends her hand. \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to remind me, are you in Reception?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I\u2019m not a parent at the school,\u2019 I begin. \u2018I\u2019m ...\u2019</p><p>I was going to launch into, \u2018I\u2019m Ernest Cleath-Stuart\u2019s godmother and I\u2019ve got a few things to say to you.\u2019 But now I have an even better idea. No one knows me here, do they?</p> <p>\u2018Actually, I\u2019m a professional art scout,\u2019 I say coolly.</p><p>\u2018An art scout?\u2019 She looks taken aback.</p><p>\u2018Yes, Professor Rebecca Bloomwood from the Guggenheim junior department. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have my card.\u2019 I shake her hand in a brisk, professional way. \u2018I\u2019m over here on business. We scouts like to visit school art events incognito, assess the new talent coming through. And I\u2019ve found some, right here.\u2019</p><p>I point at Ernie\u2019s dark, splodgy painting and the headmistress follows my gaze uncertainly.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s by Ernest Cleath-Stuart,\u2019 she says at last. \u2018An interesting child, Ernest.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Incredibly gifted, as I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to explain to you.\u2019 I nod gravely. \u2018Look at the subtle way he plants his message in the ... the texture.\u2019 I gesture at the sheep. \u2018Look at the form. So easy to underestimate. But as a professional, I saw it at once.\u2019</p><p>The headmistress\u2019s brow is wrinkled as she peers at the painting.</p><p>\u2018Quite,\u2019 she says at last.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure an excellent school such as yours is drawing out this unique child and nurturing him.\u2019 I smile at her with gimlet eyes. \u2018Because, believe me, you have something very special there. Does he have a scholarship for art?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ernest? A scholarship?\u2019 The headmistress seems pole-axed at the very idea. \u2018Well, no ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I foresee other schools wishing to poach this extraordinary talent.\u2019 I give her another gimlet smile and glance at my watch. \u2018Unfortunately I must go now, but thank you for your time.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Let me show you some work by our other pupils!\u2019 says the headmistress, hurrying along beside me as I head towards the door. \u2018This is by a very talented little girl called Eloise Gibbons, who\u2019s now left us ...\u2019 She gestures at a painting of a field full of poppies, which looks just like a Van Gogh.</p><p>\u2018Derivative,\u2019 I say dismissively, barely shooting it a glance. \u2018Thank you so much. Goodbye.\u2019</p><p>I stride swiftly out of the school gates and head down the pavement, clamping my lips together so I don\u2019t laugh. Ha. Maybe they\u2019ll start to appreciate Ernie now. And I meant it! OK, it was a bit weird \u2013 but I still thought Ernie\u2019s dead sheep was the best thing in the whole place.</p><p>As soon as I arrive at The Look I can tell Danny\u2019s already here, from the limo parked outside and the cluster of girls on the ground floor, comparing autographs on their T-shirts.</p><p>I head up to the conference room on the top floor \u2013 and as I walk in the big meeting is already in progress. There are plates of Shetland Shortbread everywhere, and images of the new collection up on the walls, and the table is full of business people. Danny is in the middle of it, looking like a peacock in a bright-blue and green coat over jeans. As he sees me he waves and pats the chair next to him.</p><p>All the top executives from The Look are here, plus some people I don\u2019t recognize who must be from Shetland Shortbread, and Luke\u2019s friend Damian, who has become a consultant to Tarkie. Brenda from our marketing department is doing a PowerPoint presentation, and she\u2019s on some kind of graph showing pre-orders of the new Danny Kovitz collection, compared to last year\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely thrilling,\u2019 she\u2019s saying. \u2018We\u2019ve never had a reaction like it. So, thank you Danny Kovitz, for a wonderful partnership, thank you Shetland Shortbread for coming on board \u2013 and here\u2019s to us all working together!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Awesome job you guys have done,\u2019 says Danny. \u2018Hey, Becky, you should have come to Scotland for the shoot! We had a blast! Did my bagpipes arrive yet, Zane?\u2019 He suddenly turns to a boy with dyed-red hair who is hovering behind his chair. He must be one of Danny\u2019s five zillion assistants.</p> <p>\u2018Um ...\u2019 Zane is already whipping out his phone, looking anxious. \u2018I can check ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018You bought some bagpipes?\u2019 I can\u2019t help giggling. \u2018Can you play the bagpipes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018As an accessory. Believe me, they\u2019re gonna be the new It Bag. Hey, you should have bagpipes in the store display.\u2019 Danny turns to Kathy, the head of merchandising, who instantly grabs her notepad, writes down \u2018Bagpipes\u2019 and underlines it three times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018We\u2019re also tremendously excited by the pre-launch publicity we\u2019re getting,\u2019 Brenda continues. \u2018We\u2019ve already had mentions in Vogue and the Telegraph, and I understand Lord Cleath-Stuart has recently done an interview with Style Central magazine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tarkie\u2019s in Style Central?\u2019 I stare at her, wanting to giggle. Style Central is the most cutting-edge Bible for avant-garde designers and fashion editors who live in places like Hoxton. And Tarkie is ... well ... Tarkie. I mean, he still wears the cricket sweater he had at Eton.</p><p>\u2018He did it with me,\u2019 chips in Danny reassuringly. \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I did most of the talking. Great pictures,\u2019 he adds. \u2018He wasn\u2019t afraid to push the boundaries. There\u2019s, like, a real experimental edge to Tarquin, you know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I say dubiously. Is this the same Tarquin we\u2019re talking about? Tarquin who still washes his face with carbolic soap, no matter how many bottles of designer facewash Suze buys him?</p> <p>\u2018Well, now.\u2019 Trevor, our managing director, speaks for the first time, and everyone turns to listen. \u2018While we\u2019re all gathered here, I would like to single out another person at this table. Becky was the inspired member of staff who came up with this collaboration. First, introducing Danny Kovitz to the store in the first place \u2013 and now forging a relationship with Shetland Shortbread. Well done, Becky!\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a smattering of applause and I start to beam modestly around, but Trevor holds up his hand to stop it.</p><p>\u2018Not just that. As we\u2019re all aware, times are hard for the high street at the moment. However, Becky\u2019s department has demonstrated a rise in sales over the last month of 17 per cent!\u2019</p><p>He pauses for effect, and everyone else shoots me looks of either awe or hatred. Gavin, our menswear director, has gone all red around the neck and has a sulky frown.</p><p>\u2018And Becky\u2019s customer testimonials are incredible,\u2019 Trevor adds. \u2018Jamie, would you like to read some out?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Absolutely!\u2019 Jamie from Customer Services nods enthusiastically. \u2018Here\u2019s one from Davina Rogers, a doctor. \u201cDear sir, I would like to commend you on your personal-shopping department and in particular, Rebecca Brandon. Her far-sighted and discreet approach to shopping in these times has made all the difference to me. I will be returning many times.\u201d\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help glowing with pleasure. I had no idea Davina would write a letter! She emailed me a picture of herself at her reception \u2013 and she did look spectacular in that Alberta Ferretti dress.</p><p>\u2018Here\u2019s another one.\u2019 Jamie reaches for another print-out. \u2018 \u201cFinally someone understands what women need and want when they shop! Thank you so much, Chloe Hill.\u201d\u2019</p><p>I remember Chloe Hill. She bought up about ten pieces from the new Marc Jacobs collection and left them in the store. We arranged that the next evening, Jasmine would go round to her house with the clothes in a bin bag and pretend to be a neighbour returning to New Zealand, off-loading unwanted clothes. Apparently Chloe\u2019s husband was there and was totally fooled. (The only hitch came when he suggested Chloe might give some of the clothes to their cleaner and accused her of being small-minded when she said not in a million years.)</p><p>\u2018In honour of this achievement,\u2019 Trevor is saying now, \u2018we would like to present Becky with this small token, and ask her: how on earth did you do it?\u2019</p><p>To my astonishment he produces a bouquet of flowers from under the table, passes it across to me and leads a round of applause.</p> <p>\u2018There\u2019s no doubt who we\u2019ll be announcing as Employee of the Year next month,\u2019 Trevor adds, with a twinkle. \u2018Congratulations, Becky.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 I can\u2019t help blushing with pleasure. \u2018Thanks very much.\u2019</p><p>Employee of the Year! That\u2019s so cool! You get five grand!</p><p>\u2018And now, seriously.\u2019 Trevor barely waits a beat. \u2018How did you do it, Becky? Can you explain the secret of your success?\u2019</p><p>The applause dies away. Everyone around the table is waiting alertly for me to answer. I bury my face in the flowers and smell them, playing for time.</p><p>Thing is ... I\u2019m not sure I want to explain the secret of my success. Something tells me no one here would understand about delivering clothes to customers in bin bags. And even if they did, they\u2019d all just start asking tricky questions like when did we start this initiative and who approved it and how does it accord with company policy?</p><p>\u2018Who knows?\u2019 I look up at last with a smile. \u2018Maybe all my customers are just trying to support the economy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But why only in your department?\u2019 Trevor looks frustrated. \u2018Becky, we want to harness your methods and apply them to all departments, whether it\u2019s because of a particular product ... a sales technique ...\u2019</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Maybe it\u2019s the department layout,\u2019 suggests a young guy in glasses.</p><p>\u2018Yes, good idea!\u2019 I say quickly.</p><p>But Brenda is shaking her head. She\u2019s quite bright, Brenda, that\u2019s the trouble.</p><p>\u2018Customer service is the key, in my opinion,\u2019 she says. \u2018You\u2019re obviously pressing the right buttons somewhere. Could I come and observe you for a few days?\u2019</p> <p>Oh my God. No way do we want Brenda skulking around. She\u2019d instantly realize what we were doing and blab to Trevor.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018Jasmine and I work very well as a team, with no one else. My worry is that if we start messing with the formula, we might jeopardize the success we\u2019ve got.\u2019</p><p>I can see that word \u2018jeopardize\u2019 lodge in Trevor\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u2018Well, let\u2019s leave it for now,\u2019 he says heavily. \u2018Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Good work, everyone.\u2019 He pushes his chair back and looks at me. \u2018Danny and Becky, would you like a spot of lunch? We\u2019ve booked a table at Gordon Ramsay, if that suits?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes please!\u2019 I say joyfully.</p> <p>Lunch at Gordon Ramsay with the managing director! Employee of the Year! I am so heading towards the board of directors.</p><p>As Trevor takes a call on his mobile, Danny pushes his chair over to mine.</p><p>\u2018So, how\u2019s the party going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sssh!\u2019 I glare at him. \u2018Not so loud!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only I was at this fashion bash in Shoreditch last week and I thought of you.\u2019 He offers me some gum. \u2018I don\u2019t know what security firm you\u2019re using, but Fifteen Star Security is in really terrible form. The bouncers were, like, totally aggressive and the valet parking was a shambles. So if you\u2019ve booked them, you might want to think again.\u2019</p><p>For a moment I can\u2019t quite find an answer.</p> <p>Bouncers? Valet parking? I haven\u2019t even thought about bouncers and valet parking.</p><p>\u2018Well, I certainly won\u2019t use that company, then,\u2019 I say as convincingly as I can.</p><p>\u2018Cool.\u2019 Danny swings his feet up on to a chair. \u2018Who are you using?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just ... er ... firming up on security arrangements.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t panic. I\u2019ll just add it to the list. Book bouncers and valet \u2013parking.</p><p>\u2018The restrooms were great, though,\u2019 he adds enthusiastically. \u2018They were in a separate tent, and everyone got a foot massage. Are you hiring foot masseurs?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t reply. I\u2019m too gripped by horror.</p><p>Restrooms. Shit. How could I have forgotten those? Was I expecting two hundred people to use Janice\u2019s en suite?</p> <p>Surreptitiously I write \u2018Book loos\u2019 on my hand with a biro.</p><p>\u2018Of course I\u2019m having foot masseurs.\u2019 I try to sound nonchalant. \u2018And hand masseurs. And ... reiki people.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m not letting some stupid fashion bash in Shoreditch beat my party.</p><p>\u2018Excellent.\u2019 His eyes gleam. \u2018And Luke has no idea?\u2019</p><p>\u2018None. And keep your voice down!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, that won\u2019t last. No one ever threw a surprise party that was a genuine surprise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes they did!\u2019 I retort crossly, but Danny is shaking his head.</p><p>\u2018Take it from me, Becky. Some moron\u2019ll blab. Hey, look what I made for my god-daughter.\u2019 He pulls out a little tartan T-shirt with \u201cMinnie Rocks\u201d in hot-pink letters.</p><p>It\u2019s always the same with Danny. Just as you\u2019re about to clonk him over the head for being so annoying, he does something really sweet and you fall in love with him all over again. I can\u2019t help throwing an arm around him and giving him a hug.</p><p>But, oh God. What if he\u2019s right?</p><p>As I\u2019m arriving home, my mobile rings, and it\u2019s finally Bonnie calling me back.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie!\u2019 I retreat into the bushes. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m well, thank you.\u2019 Bonnie sounds a bit strained, and not like her usual self. \u2018All\u2019s well.\u2019</p><p>I peer at the phone dubiously. \u2018Bonnie, what\u2019s wrong? You sound really hassled.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, the truth is ...\u2019 Bonnie sighs. \u2018Luke didn\u2019t react well when I tried to mention his shower gel just now. In fact, he became quite irritable with me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, sorry,\u2019 I say guiltily. \u2018Well, don\u2019t worry about that any more. It was worth a try. How\u2019s the party going your end?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve had lots more acceptances today! I\u2019ve made a file of all the details and special requests.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Special requests?\u2019 I echo uncertainly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018We\u2019ve had requests for vegetarian food, kosher food, wheat-free food ... I assume your caterers can take care of that? In addition, one guest needs a waiting area for his driver, another needs a baby-feeding area, one government minister would like to send in his security people first to sweep the area ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right! No problem!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m trying to sound confident and can-do, but inside, I feel a bit daunted. Since when did birthday parties get so complicated?</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 I wrench my mind back. \u2018Bonnie, there\u2019s something else. I need to ask you something.\u2019 I take a deep breath. \u2018Is Luke hiding something from me?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence and my heart plunges. I knew it.</p><p>\u2018Is it about Minnie? Be honest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, dear!\u2019 She sounds taken aback. \u2018I haven\u2019t heard Luke talking about Minnie at all!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 I rub my nose. \u2018Well, something to do with work, then?\u2019</p> <p>There\u2019s another silence. The answer is obviously \u2018yes\u2019. Suddenly I have an ominous feeling about this.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie, I thought you were my friend,\u2019 I say at last. \u2018Why can\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s going on? Is it bad? Is it another court case?\u2019 My mind is racing with awful possibilities. \u2018Is Luke in trouble? Is he bankrupt?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 Bonnie cuts in hastily. \u2018Please, Becky, don\u2019t think anything like that!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what am I supposed to think?\u2019 My voice rises in agitation. \u2018I know Luke wants to shield me from all the bad things, but how can I help him if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, please don\u2019t get upset! It\u2019s not bad! It\u2019s simply ... a new client.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019</p> <p>The wind is slightly taken out of my sails. That\u2019s not what I was expecting. Although now I remember it, Luke did mention another new client, didn\u2019t he? But why is it a huge secret?</p><p>\u2018Who is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t tell you,\u2019 Bonnie says reluctantly. \u2018Luke specifically asked me not to mention it. He thought you might get ... overexcited. He wanted to be sure it would work out first.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Over-excited?\u2019 I stare indignantly at the phone. \u2018Bonnie, you have to tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you can! We\u2019re a team, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 Bonnie sounds pained. \u2018Becky, you must realize that Luke is my boss\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m your friend. Friends are more important than bosses! Everyone knows that.\u2019</p> <p>There\u2019s silence, then Bonnie whispers, \u2018Becky, I should go. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>She rings off and I watch the light in my phone die away. I walk over to the willow tree in the middle of the front lawn and sit on the old wooden bench. To be honest, I feel a bit unsettled. What\u2019s going on with Luke? And how am I going to manage this party? I thought I was doing so well; I was so pleased with myself. But now I\u2019m feeling panicky.</p><p>Security guards. Valet parking. Kosher food. Loos. Foot masseurs. Oh God, oh God. How am I going to afford all this? Why have I spent so long making stupid pom-poms? What else do I need to think about?</p><p>Suze would know. Suze goes to posh parties all the time. But I can\u2019t ask her. Not now.</p><p>On impulse I open my BlackBerry and scroll down the acceptance list. The more names I read, the worse I feel. Why can\u2019t Luke have normal friends? Why do they all have to be so posh and important? These people will be used to grand receptions in smart venues. They\u2019re used to marble pillars and string quartets and waiters in white coats ...</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 Mum is looking out of the front door with a concerned look. \u2018Are you OK, love?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I say brightly. \u2018Just ... thinking.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s no way in a million years I\u2019m admitting I\u2019m worried about the party.</p><p>Mum disappears again and I nibble my thumbnail. Well, I don\u2019t have any choice, do I? I\u2019ll have to book the bouncers and the loos and the masseurs and everything else. And just pay for it ... somehow.</p><p>I wince as I think over my finances. I can\u2019t take the money out of the joint account because Luke will see. And I can\u2019t take it out of my own account because there\u2019s nothing to take out. There\u2019s no way the bank will extend my overdraft. Not at the moment. And I\u2019ve already maxed out half my cards. All the credit companies are so stingy these days.</p><p>Could I contact my old bank manager, Derek Smeath, and plead for a special emergency party overdraft? He\u2019d understand, surely. And he always liked Luke, and I could invite him to the party ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I suddenly sit bolt upright. No. I\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ll ask Trevor for my Employee of the Year money in advance. He can\u2019t refuse me, can he?

Why didn\u2019t I think of that before? He\u2019s just presented me with flowers, for God\u2019s sake. My department is the best by miles. It\u2019s bucking all the trends. It\u2019s obvious I should get a raise.

I pull it out, to see it\u2019s from Bonnie.</p><p>Becky dear. I have been torn by guilt. I feel you are right. Your friendship has come to mean a great deal to me and the major part of any friendship has to be trust. I will therefore trust you and send by separate text the name of the new client which Luke is keeping from you (for all the best reasons, I must assure you).</p><p>Please delete these texts straight away after reading.

I mean, it\u2019ll only be some boring bigshot finance type I\u2019ve never heard of, probably.</p><p>As for saying I\u2019ll need self-restraint ... for God\u2019s sake. I think sometimes people who work in PR start to believe their own hype. I press \u2018Reply\u2019 and start texting back:</p><p>Dear Bonnie, thank you so much. You are a great friend to me. Don\u2019t worry, I will not give away to Luke by a smidgen that I know the name of this client, and I really don\u2019t think self-restraint will be a problem\u2014</p><p>A bleep interrupts me. Ooh, that might be Bonnie\u2019s second text. I might as well have a look before I continue. I click on it and wait for the message to appear on the screen.</p><p>It consists of two words only. For a moment I stand stock still, blinking, not quite able to process what I\u2019m seeing.</p> <p>Sage Seymour.</p><p>Sage Seymour the movie star? She\u2019s the new client? But ... but ... how on earth ...</p><p>No. It can\u2019t be true. It\u2019s ridiculous.

How did he go from representing boring old banks to actresses? And why has he kept so quiet about it?</p><p>I\u2019m almost hyperventilating. I keep looking up and then looking down at the screen again, just to check it still says the same thing.</p><p>Sage Seymour\u2019s the coolest movie star ever. She was in that one about the Nazis.

But I can give him cutting little glances now and then, as though to say, \u2018Yes, well, someone\u2019s got a great big secret, haven\u2019t they?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Becky, is something wrong?\u2019 Luke looks at me, puzzled, as he passes by, hefting two massive carrier bags to the removal lorry. The guys have been here for an hour and we\u2019re nearly all packed up.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I say tartly. \u2018What could possibly be wrong?\u2019</p><p>Luke scans my face for a minute, then sighs. \u2018Oh God. I get it.\u2019 He dumps the bags down and puts his arms around me. \u2018I know it\u2019s a difficult day for you. Of course, it\u2019ll be great to have our own space \u2013 but we\u2019ve been happy living here. It\u2019s the end of an era.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s not about the \u2018end of an era\u2019! I want to yell at him. Why would I care about that? It\u2019s \u2018Why didn\u2019t you let me meet the famous movie star?\u2019</p> <p>I just can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve missed such an amazing opportunity. We could all have had dinner together by now. We probably would have really hit it off. Sage and I would have exchanged phone numbers and become best friends and she would have invited me out to her home in Malibu where she\u2019s got that shell-pink-mosaic swimming pool. It looks amazing.</p><p>I can just see us, floating on lilos, drinking smoothies, chatting about life. She could have told me how she gets her hair that amazing treacly colour and I could have told her exactly where she\u2019d gone wrong with that last boyfriend of hers. (Because I totally disagree with that columnist in Heat magazine \u2013 the split was not inevitable.) And then we could have gone shopping and been snapped by paparazzi and started a whole new trend with scarves or something.</p><p>But Luke\u2019s keeping me out of it. On purpose. He doesn\u2019t deserve a surprise party. I\u2019m so grouchy, I almost feel like telling him.</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 I look up to see Jess coming up the drive. \u2018Good luck with your new house,\u2019 she says matter-of-factly. \u2018Here\u2019s a house-warming present.\u2019</p><p>She hands me a massive bulky bag made of strong brown paper and I peep inside. Bloody hell. What on earth is that?</p> <p>\u2018Wow, thanks! Is it ... candy floss?\u2019 I say uncertainly.</p><p>\u2018Insulation lagging,\u2019 says Jess. \u2018Houses in this country are shockingly poor on insulation. Put it in your loft. Save some energy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lovely!\u2019 I pat it gingerly. \u2018So, how are you? I\u2019ve hardly seen you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been visiting friends. I try not to stay here for more than a night at a time.\u2019 Jess lowers her voice darkly. \u2018She\u2019s doing my head in. Tom\u2019s, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Janice?\u2019 I whisper back sympathetically. \u2018Is she still going on about you having a baby?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Worse! She knows she can\u2019t talk about it because Tom\u2019ll shout her down. So she\u2019s resorted to other measures.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What measures?\u2019 I say, intrigued.</p><p>\u2018She gave me this herbal drink the other day. She said I seemed \u201crun down\u201d. But I didn\u2019t trust her, so I looked it up online. It\u2019s only a natural fertility drug and libido enhancer.\u2019 She looks outraged. \u2018Tom had already drunk three cups!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No way!\u2019 I feel like giggling, except Jess is so fierce, I don\u2019t dare.</p><p>\u2018I wish this was us, moving out to our own place.\u2019 She looks wistfully at the van.</p><p>\u2018Well, why don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll be going back out to South America in a few weeks.\u2019 Jess shrugs. \u2018There\u2019s no point and we don\u2019t have any spare cash. But I\u2019m telling you, if she does one more thing\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come and stay with us!\u2019 Impulsively I squeeze her arm. \u2018We\u2019ll have a fab time and I promise not to feed you any fertility drugs.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Jess looks surprised. \u2018But your mum and dad said you didn\u2019t want anyone visiting your house till it was ready.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Er ... kind of.\u2019 I clear my throat.</p><p>I haven\u2019t had a chance to explain the situation to Jess. I\u2019ll call her later, when we\u2019re at the rented place.</p><p>\u2018Ready to go?\u2019 Luke is calling. He dropped our car off at the house yesterday, so we\u2019re going in the removal truck. It\u2019s the coolest thing ever. It\u2019s got a row of seats at the front so there\u2019s room for all of us, even Minnie. She\u2019s already strapped into her booster with her snack box and is passing raisins one by one to the removal driver. (He\u2019s called Alf and luckily seems a very patient guy.)</p><p>We should so buy a great big truck, I think idly. I mean, it\u2019s the perfect family car. You\u2019d never have to worry about having too much shopping again. We could all sit in the front and people would call us The Family in the Cool Truck, and\u2014</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019</p><p>Oh. Oops. Everyone\u2019s waiting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I head over to Mum and give her a hug. \u2018Bye, Mum. And thanks so much for putting up with us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, love.\u2019 Mum waves it off. \u2018Don\u2019t be silly.\u2019 She glances at Dad. \u2018Shall we ...\u2019</p><p>Dad nods, and clears his throat self-consciously. \u2018Before you go, darling, I\u2019d just like to say a few words,\u2019 he begins. Luke descends from the cab of the lorry with a questioning look and I shrug back. I had no idea Dad was planning to make a speech.</p><p>\u2018I thought this day would never happen.\u2019 Dad\u2019s voice rings round the tarmac drive. \u2018Our daughter has bought a house!\u2019 He pauses momentously. \u2018We\u2019re very, very proud, aren\u2019t we, Jane?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018We used to say, who on earth would ever give our little Becky a mortgage?\u2019 Mum chimes in. \u2018We were quite worried, love! But now you\u2019ve got a beautiful house in Maida Vale!\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t look at Luke. I\u2019m standing there in silence, chewing my lip, feeling more and more uncomfortable. I mean, I know we will have a house soon. So I haven\u2019t exactly lied. But still.</p><p>\u2018And so, in honour of the occasion ...\u2019 Dad clears his throat, suddenly sounding choked up. \u2018Becky, we\u2019d like you to have this.\u2019 He hands me a present, wrapped up in tissue paper.</p><p>\u2018Oh my God! You shouldn\u2019t have!\u2019 I pull the tissue off \u2013 and it\u2019s the picture of the lady with the flowers. The painting that\u2019s been hanging on the upstairs landing for as long as I can remember.</p><p>\u2018Wh\u2014What?\u2019 I look up in shock. \u2018I can\u2019t take this! This belongs here!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, sweetheart.\u2019 Mum suddenly looks misty-eyed. \u2018When you were a little girl, you always said you wanted that picture in your room. And I used to say, \u201cYou can have it when you\u2019re a grown-up lady with your very own house.\u201d\u2019 She dabs at her eyes. \u2018And now here you are, darling. A grown-up lady with your very own house.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt more guilty in my life.</p><p>\u2018Well ... thanks, Mum,\u2019 I stutter. \u2018I\u2019m really honoured. It\u2019ll have pride of place in our home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe in that lovely hallway!\u2019 suggests Mum. \u2018It would look beautiful with that fireplace.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, maybe.\u2019 My face is boiling by now.</p><p>Oh God. This is unbearable. We must get on to the lawyer and speed everything up. And as soon as we\u2019re in the proper house, we\u2019ll have them over, and we\u2019ll put the picture up and everything will be OK.</p> <p>\u2018You will tell us when we can visit,\u2019 says Mum longingly.</p><p>\u2018Well ... we\u2019ll come and see you very soon,\u2019 I say, avoiding a direct answer. \u2018I\u2019ll call you later, Mum.\u2019</p><p>Luke and I clamber up into the cab of the lorry and Alf looks over. He\u2019s so wizened he looks about a hundred and three although apparently he\u2019s only seventy-one. He\u2019s already told us he\u2019s got a bad hip and a dodgy shoulder and a dicky chest, so the other lads are meeting him at the site to help move the boxes. \u2018Ready?\u2019 he rasps, his gold tooth glinting.</p><p>\u2018Yes, let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Young lady want her raisins back?\u2019 He\u2019s got a whole fistful of them, I suddenly notice. Some of them chewed.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 I scold. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, let me take those from you ...\u2019 I hastily cram the raisins back into Minnie\u2019s snack box, then breathe out as the lorry rumbles out of the drive.</p><p>\u2018So, Mrs Home-owner,\u2019 says Luke sardonically. \u2018You must be feeling very proud.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up!\u2019 I clasp my head in my hands. \u2018Look ... it\u2019ll be OK. I\u2019ll give it a couple of days and then I\u2019ll phone home and make something up about the house needing renovation and say we\u2019re renting somewhere. They\u2019ll be fine. And then as soon as we do get the house we\u2019ll have a big dinner for everyone.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Christmas dinner, maybe.\u2019 Luke nods. \u2018Next year.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I stare at him in horror. \u2018Don\u2019t be silly! It\u2019s not going to take that long to get the house. The lawyer said it would all be sorted out quickly!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which in lawyer-speak means Christmas next year.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No it doesn\u2019t\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is that your mum?\u2019 interrupts Alf conversationally.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Blue Volvo? They\u2019re following us.\u2019 He nods at the wing mirror and I stare into it in disbelief. There they are. Driving along right behind us. What\u2019s Mum doing, following us?</p><p>I whip out my phone and speed-dial her number.</p><p>\u2018Mum, what are you doing?\u2019 I say with no preamble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh, Becky!\u2019 Her voice rings out. \u2018You\u2019ve ruined the surprise!

We said we\u2019d tell you when we were ready for you to come and visit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, love!\u2019 Mum laughs. \u2018This is your first house! The first property you\u2019ve ever owned! We don\u2019t mind what state it\u2019s in!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Darling, I know what you said. And to be honest, we were planning to let you have your privacy. But then we just couldn\u2019t resist it! We couldn\u2019t let you just slip off without helping you. I\u2019ve brought some teacakes and Dad\u2019s got his tools. We\u2019ll help you get ship-shape in no time ...\u2019</p><p>My heart is thudding. There\u2019s no way I can let them turn up at some crummy rented townhouse. Not after Dad\u2019s speech.</p><p>\u2018We could even pop round and meet your new neighbours!\u2019 Mum\u2019s still talking cheerily. \u2018They might turn out to be good friends to you, Becky. I mean, look at me and Janice, still friends after thirty years. I can remember the day we first moved in, and Janice came round with a bottle of sherry ... Ooh, Dad says, can you remind him of the address in case we get separated?\u2019</p><p>My mind works like a spring trap.</p><p>\u2018Mum, I can\u2019t hear you ... I\u2019m losing you ...\u2019 I rub the phone against my bag to make a kerfuffly noise, then switch it off and look at Luke. \u2018It\u2019s OK. They don\u2019t know the address.\u2019 I turn urgently to Alf. \u2018We need to lose them.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Lose them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes! Like in cop films. Duck down a side alley or whatever.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A side alley?\u2019 He sounds startled. \u2018What side alley?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know! Find one. You know, like in car chases!\u2019 Doesn\u2019t he watch movies?</p><p>\u2018I think my wife wants you to drive very fast down a narrow one-way street the wrong way, knock over a barrow of fruit, send crowds of people screaming, roll the van 360 degrees, and manage to elude my parents-in-law that way,\u2019 says Luke in a deadpan voice. \u2018I\u2019m assuming you are a stunt removal driver?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up.\u2019 I hit him on the chest. \u2018Do you realize the situation we\u2019re in?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018If it were up to me we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation,\u2019 he says calmly. \u2018Because we would have told your parents the truth in the first place.\u2019</p><p>We pull up at a set of traffic lights. Mum and Dad pull up alongside and wave merrily, and I wave back with a sick grin.</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I instruct Alf. \u2018When the lights change, you go!\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is a lorry, duck, not a Ferrari.\u2019</p><p>The lights change, and I start gesturing \u2018Go, go!\u2019 with my hands. Alf just shoots me a baleful look and puts the truck into gear unhurriedly.</p><p>Honestly. I feel like offering to drive myself.</p><p>\u2018Sorry folks. Fuel stop.\u2019 Alf pulls into a service station, and sure enough, Mum and Dad\u2019s Volvo follows us. A few moments later, Mum has got out of the car, bustled over and is knocking on the door of the cab.</p><p>\u2018Everything all right?\u2019 she calls up.</p> <p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 I wind down the window and smile brightly. \u2018Just getting some petrol.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only, I\u2019ve got Janice on the line. You wouldn\u2019t mind if she came along too, would you, love?\u2019</p><p>What?</p><p>Before I can answer, Mum\u2019s turned back to the phone. \u2018Yes, we\u2019re at the BP with the caf\u00e9 ... see you in a tick! Janice and Martin were in the car already, coming back from Yogacise ...\u2019 She turns to me. \u2018There they are!\u2019 She waves frantically as a black Audi turns in at the service-station entrance. \u2018Yoo-hoo!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky!\u2019 Janice leans out of the window as the Audi approaches. \u2018You don\u2019t mind, do you, dear? Only your mum\u2019s told us all about the house. So exciting!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You follow us,\u2019 Mum is telling Martin. \u2018And we\u2019ll follow the truck.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t believe this. We\u2019ve got a convoy.</p><p>\u2018Put \u201cMaida Vale\u201d in your sat nav, Martin,\u2019 Mum\u2019s saying bossily \u2018That way, even if we do get separated \u2013 Becky, what\u2019s the exact address?\u2019 She suddenly calls over to me.</p><p>\u2018I ... er ... I\u2019ll text you ...\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve got to tell her the truth. I\u2019ve got to. Right now.</p><p>\u2018The thing is, Mum ...\u2019 I swallow and look over at Luke for support, but he\u2019s got out of the truck and is taking a call on the forecourt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018No, it\u2019s not fucking OK,\u2019 I can hear him saying.</p><p>Oh God.

She\u2019s wearing a bright-pink yoga outfit which makes my eyes hurt just to look at it, together with pop socks and clogs. It\u2019s a look which some edgy nineteen-year-old model could just about carry off. \u2018I just wanted a little discreet word, while Luke is out of the way.\u2019 She lowers her voice almost to a whisper. \u2018It\u2019s about the P. A. R. T. Y. I was reading Hello! the other day. That \u201cRoyal Fashion\u201d party. Did you see it?\u2019</p><p>I nod absently, watching Luke. He\u2019s moved away from the cab, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s yelling at somebody. And I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t like Minnie to hear his language.</p> <p>Is he having a row with Sage Seymour? Is he breaking things off with her before I\u2019ve even had a chance to meet her and become her best friend? If so, I will kill him.</p><p>\u2018... and they had a touch-up area for all the celebrities!\u2019 Janice finishes with a flourish. \u2018You see?\u2019</p><p>I must have missed a beat somewhere.</p><p>\u2018Sorry, Janice.\u2019 I smile apologetically. \u2018I wasn\u2019t quite following you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a make-up artist, love,\u2019 she says as though it\u2019s obvious. \u2018And I\u2019d like to volunteer to host a little touch-up area myself. I\u2019ll make up all the guests! It will be my gift to Luke.\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m speechless. Janice is not a make-up artist. She did one course at the adult-learning institute, and learned how to apply peach blusher and highlighter in badger stripes to a plastic dummy\u2019s cheeks. And now she wants to make up people at my party?</p><p>\u2018Janice ... that\u2019s so sweet,\u2019 I say as convincingly as I can. \u2018But you mustn\u2019t miss the fun.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019d have shifts!\u2019 she says triumphantly. \u2018I\u2019ve got a team of chums, you know! We were all on the course together, so we all use the same techniques.\u2019</p><p>The idea of a team of Janices, all clutching palettes of frosted eyeshadow, makes me feel a bit faint.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I manage. \u2018Well, that would be really ... something.\u2019</p><p>OK. I need to put this on my to-do list, right at the top. Do NOT let Janice do any make-up on the guests.</p> <p>\u2018Better go,\u2019 she breathes dramatically. \u2018Luke approaching at one o\u2019clock.\u2019</p><p>Before I can say anything else, she\u2019s slipped away to her car, just as Luke gets back into the driver\u2019s cab.</p><p>\u2018Unbelievable.\u2019 He\u2019s breathing fast and his jaw is rock-hard. \u2018Unbelievable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019 I say nervously. \u2018And don\u2019t swear in front of Minnie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, I\u2019ve got bad news.\u2019 Luke looks directly at me. \u2018The townhouse has fallen through. We can\u2019t have it.\u2019</p><p>For a nano-second I think he must be joking. But his face doesn\u2019t flicker.</p><p>\u2018But ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Some fucking moron at the office rented it to another tenant. They\u2019ve already taken possession and our agent has only just realized.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But it\u2019s ours!\u2019 My voice is rising in panic. \u2018We need that house!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.

They\u2019re finding us an alternative within the hour or we\u2019re checking into a hotel at their expense.\u2019 He exhales. \u2018What a total fuck-up.\u2019</p><p>I feel a bit light-headed. This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d better tell your parents ...\u2019 Luke makes to get out.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I almost squeal. \u2018We can\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what do you suggest doing?\u2019</p><p>I can see Mum waving at me from the Volvo, and a moment later a text comes through on my phone.</p><p>Ready to go, love?</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just drive to Maida Vale.\u2019 I lick my dry lips. \u2018We might as well. And hopefully the agents will call on the way. We can busk it somehow.\u2019</p><p>Alf has hoisted himself back into the cab.</p><p>\u2018Ready, folks?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say, before Luke can speak. \u2018Drive. Go.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019ll take us an hour to get to Maida Vale, I\u2019m thinking. At least. And in the meantime they\u2019ll sort us out with another house and we\u2019ll go there and it\u2019ll all be fine. It has to be.</p><p>Except it only takes forty minutes to reach Maida Vale. I can\u2019t believe it. Where\u2019s all the traffic gone? Is there a conspiracy against us?</p><p>We\u2019re driving up the main shopping road and we still don\u2019t have a house. My exterior is strangely calm, even though my heart is galloping with panic. As long as we keep driving, we\u2019re OK. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Go more slowly,\u2019 I tell Alf yet again. \u2018Go some winding back route. Go down there!\u2019 I point at a narrow little street.</p><p>\u2018No left turn,\u2019 says Alf, shaking his head.</p><p>We\u2019ve told Alf the whole story. Or at least, he worked it out for himself, after Luke had a shouting match with the agent. (Luckily Minnie\u2019s fallen asleep. Two-year-olds can sleep through anything.) Luke\u2019s started calling other rental agencies as well \u2013 but so far, no one\u2019s got a house available that can be moved into within the next twenty minutes. I feel like screaming with frustration. Where are all the houses? And where\u2019s all the traffic?</p><p>I glance into the wing mirror, just in case by any chance Mum and Dad have peeled off or got lost \u2013 but there they still are, sticking to us like glue. Luke\u2019s listening to a message on his phone and I gaze hopefully at him, but he shakes his head.</p> <p>\u2018So where d\u2019you want me to go now?\u2019 Alf pauses at a junction, rests his arms on the throbbing steering wheel and looks at me.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say desperately. \u2018Could you just ... circle?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Circle?\u2019 He gives me a sardonic look. \u2018Do I look like a plane?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please. Just for a bit.\u2019</p><p>Shaking his head, Alf signals left and turns down a residential street. We go along the canal, then up another residential street and are almost immediately back where we started.</p> <p>\u2018That was too quick!\u2019 I say in dismay.</p><p>Sure enough, a moment later, a text comes through from Mum:</p><p>Darling, is your driver lost? We\u2019ve been down this road before. Dad says, what\u2019s the address, he\u2019ll use his sat nav.</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 Luke has come off the phone. \u2018We can\u2019t just drive round Maida Vale until we have a house.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Any luck, squire?\u2019 says Alf. He seems to have a new respect for Luke ever since he heard him swearing at the agent. In fact, despite all his sardonic little looks, I think he\u2019s enjoying the drama.</p><p>\u2018None,\u2019 replies Luke. \u2018Becky, we\u2019re going to have to come clean.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No. Not yet. Let\u2019s ... let\u2019s stop for lunch!\u2019 I say in sudden inspiration. \u2018We\u2019ll find a coffee shop or something. Luke, here\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll keep Mum and Dad entertained, and you go and see the agent, and force him to give us a house.\u2019</p><p>Alf rolls his eyes with forbearance and is soon trying to manoeuvre the lorry into a space opposite a Caf\u00e9 Rouge. I watch the others pulling over too, and Janice getting out to guide Martin with lots of beckoning and pointing and \u2018Careful, Martin!\u2019</p><p>I unbuckle Minnie and we all get out, stretching our legs. I feel like we\u2019ve been on some massive road trip, not just driven up from Oxshott.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I wave at the others, trying to look relaxed and cheery, like this was always the plan.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on, love?\u2019 Mum is first to reach us. \u2018Is this it?\u2019 She\u2019s peering at all the flats above the shops, as though one might suddenly turn out to be a family house with a basement and a garden and two parking spaces.</p><p>\u2018Trust Becky to live among the shops.\u2019 Martin gives a chortle at his own wit.</p><p>\u2018No, this isn\u2019t where we\u2019re going to live!\u2019 I laugh as naturally as I can manage. \u2018We\u2019re stopping for lunch.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a baffled silence.</p> <p>\u2018Lunch, love?\u2019 says Janice at last. \u2018But it\u2019s only twenty past ten.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, well. The ... um ... The lorry driver has to have lunch. It\u2019s union regulations,\u2019 I improvise, and shoot a meaningful look at Alf. \u2018Isn\u2019t it, Alf?\u2019</p><p>\u2018But we must be only a few minutes away from the house,\u2019 says Mum. \u2018This is ridiculous!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I say hurriedly. \u2018But the union\u2019s really strict. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t blame me,\u2019 says Alf, playing along. \u2018I don\u2019t make the rules.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For goodness\u2019 sake,\u2019 says Dad impatiently. \u2018I\u2019ve never heard such nonsense.\u2019 He turns to Alf. \u2018Now, look here. Couldn\u2019t you drop Becky at the house and then have lunch?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rules is rules,\u2019 says Alf, shaking his head implacably. \u2018I break \u2018em, I\u2019m up before a disciplinary tribunal and that\u2019s my job on the line, that is. I\u2019ll go and have my well-earned break and you let me know when you\u2019re ready to go, all right, my love?\u2019 He gives me a wink and heads into Caf\u00e9 Rouge.</p><p>God, he\u2019s fantastic. I feel like giving him a hug.</p><p>\u2018Well!\u2019 Mum seems outraged. \u2018Now we know what\u2019s wrong with this country! Who wrote these rules, anyway?

I\u2019ll be able to locate it in a trice!\u2019</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s looking at me expectantly.

Let me assure you, we\u2019re doing everything we can to house your daughter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But she\u2019s got a house!\u2019 says Mum shrilly. \u2018She\u2019s bought a house!

They told all their friends. And here I am, screwing everything up, as usual.</p><p>\u2018There was a delay with the house,\u2019 I mumble, staring at the pavement. \u2018And we couldn\u2019t bear to tell you because you were so hassled with us cluttering up the place at home.

Remember, Martin, that lovely new hotel with the rooftop spa? With all the mosaics?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, well, I wasn\u2019t taking any shit.\u2019 Luke flashes her a brief smile. \u2018We can move in today, the stuff will go into storage ...\u2019 He trails off, clearly aware of the tension in the air. \u2018So ... is that OK by you? Becky?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mum should take it.\u2019 The words come out of my mouth even before I\u2019ve properly thought them through. \u2018Mum and Dad should have it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018O-kaay,\u2019 says Luke hesitantly. \u2018Well, that\u2019s certainly one way to do it ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve put Mum and Dad out for all this time, and now we\u2019ve let them down. We should let them enjoy the luxury apartment. And then ... regroup.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m staring into the middle distance; I can\u2019t bring myself to look at Mum. Luke\u2019s head is swivelling between us as though for clues; I can see Janice mouthing something urgently at him.</p><p>\u2018Jane?\u2019 Luke says finally. \u2018Would that suit you? To stay in The West Place for a little while?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It would suit very well,\u2019 says Mum in clipped, unnatural tones. \u2018Thank you, Luke. I\u2019ll just call Graham and tell him.\u2019</p><p>Mum obviously can\u2019t look at me either. Well, good thing we won\u2019t be living together any more.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll take Minnie to look at the shops,\u2019 I say, taking Minnie\u2019s hand. \u2018Let me know when it\u2019s time to go home.\u2019</p><p>We eventually make it home by four o\u2019clock. Mum and Dad went back first, and packed some things, and Luke settled them into the serviced apartment, which apparently is amazingly swanky. Not that I want to hear about it.</p><p>I\u2019ve made Minnie her tea and put on Peppa Pig and am sitting by the fire, staring morosely into the flames, when Luke arrives back.

There\u2019s something I want to talk to you about.\u2019</p><p>He draws up a chair and I watch a little apprehensively.</p><p>\u2018You were right, Becky,\u2019 he says frankly. \u2018I was keeping something from you. And I\u2019m sorry. But I wanted to be sure before I said anything.\u2019</p><p>Instantly my mood lifts. He\u2019s going to tell me about Sage Seymour! Yes! Maybe we\u2019re all going to meet up tonight! Maybe he wants to take us out for dinner at the Ivy or somewhere! I know she\u2019s filming at Pinewood Studios at the moment, because I Googled her. (Simply because I take an interest in my husband\u2019s career like any supportive wife would.)</p><p>Oh, this will totally make up for a shitty day. And I can wear that Nanette Lepore dress I\u2019ve never worn, with my pink Vivienne Westwood shoes.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Luke.\u2019 I beam at him. \u2018I know you have to be discreet.\u2019</p><p>Maybe she\u2019ll ask me to be her personal shopper! Maybe Luke has recommended me! I could dress her for the Golden Globes. I could go to the Golden Globes. I mean, she\u2019ll need someone to make sure her hem\u2019s straight\u2014</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve recently been in touch with a contact I have.

Is he nuts? She\u2019s got an Oscar, for God\u2019s sake! She\u2019s one of the most famous women in the world!</p><p>\u2018Of course I have!\u2019 I blurt out excitedly, just as he says \u2018... a woman called Nanny Sue?\u2019</p> <p>For an instant we stare at each other in confusion.</p><p>\u2018Nanny Sue?\u2019 I echo at last.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a childcare expert, apparently.\u2019 Luke shrugs. \u2018Has a show on TV? I hadn\u2019t heard of her myself.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m so frustrated I feel like slapping him. Number one, obviously I\u2019ve heard of Nanny Sue, and he only hasn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t watch enough TV. Number two, why are we talking about her and not Sage Seymour?</p><p>\u2018Yes, I have,\u2019 I say grudgingly. \u2018I\u2019ve got her book. What about her?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Apparently she\u2019s planning to start a new private enterprise. A kind of ...\u2019 He hesitates, not meeting my eye. \u2018A children\u2019s behaviour-management camp.\u2019</p><p>He can\u2019t be serious.</p><p>\u2018You want to send Minnie to a boot camp?\u2019 The words almost stick in my throat. \u2018But ... but ... that\u2019s ridiculous! She\u2019s only two! They wouldn\u2019t even take her!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Apparently in exceptional cases they will accept children as young as that.\u2019</p><p>My mind is swirling in shock. There I was, sitting there happily, thinking he was about to tell me we\u2019re having cocktails with a movie star tonight. And instead he\u2019s saying he wants to send our daughter away.</p><p>\u2018Is it ...\u2019 I swallow hard. \u2018Residential?\u2019</p> <p>I feel hollow at the thought. He wants to send her to a boarding school for naughty children. I have a sudden image of Minnie in a braided blazer, her head bowed, sitting in the corner holding a sign saying \u2018I must not order sixteen coats off the internet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course not!\u2019 Luke seems shocked. \u2018It\u2019ll simply be a programme for children with particular behavioural issues. And it\u2019s only an idea.\u2019 He rubs the back of his neck, still not looking at me. \u2018I\u2019ve already spoken to this Nanny Sue. I explained the situation and she seemed very understanding. She\u2019ll come and assess Minnie for us if we like, and make a recommendation. So I made an appointment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You what?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe this. \u2018You\u2019ve already spoken to her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was just finding out what the options were.\u2019 At last Luke meets my gaze. \u2018Becky, I don\u2019t like the idea any more than you do. But we have to do something.\u2019</p><p>No we don\u2019t! I want to yell. And we especially don\u2019t have to invite strangers into our home to tell us what to do!</p><p>But I can tell he\u2019s set on this. It\u2019s just like that time on honeymoon when he decided we should take the train to Lahore, not fly. He\u2019s not going to budge.</p><p>Well, fine. He can hire all the childcare gurus he likes. No one\u2019s taking Minnie away from me. Let Nanny Sue come and do her worst. I\u2019ll see her off.

Nanny Sue\u2019s coming today, and I\u2019m totally prepared. I feel like a gladiator, ready to go into the arena with all my swingy metal spikes and bludgeons. But I\u2019m still livid with Luke. In fact, the more time goes on, the angrier I feel. How could he have arranged all this without consulting me? We\u2019re at breakfast and we\u2019ve hardly spoken two words to each other. Certainly neither of us has mentioned Nanny Sue.</p><p>\u2018Do you want some more milk, Minnie?\u2019 I say in chilly tones, and reach past Luke for the jug.</p><p>Luke sighs. \u2018Becky, we can\u2019t go on like this. We have to talk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine. Let\u2019s talk.\u2019 I shrug. \u2018What about?

Not so good.\u2019 He sighs. \u2018Didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u2019</p><p>What? He\u2019s doing what?</p> <p>I raise my head, unable to keep up my distant demeanour any more. He\u2019s going to bollock Bonnie? How can he bollock Bonnie? She\u2019s perfect! She\u2019s lovely!</p><p>\u2018But ... I thought you loved her,\u2019 I say, trying to sound only mildly interested. \u2018I thought she was the best assistant you\u2019ve ever had.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought so, too. But recently, she\u2019s become ...\u2019 Luke hesitates. \u2018I can only describe it as \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine Bonnie being inappropriate for one moment.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean? What\u2019s she done?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s odd.\u2019 Luke passes a hand over his brow, looking perplexed. \u2018Most of the time she behaves with impeccable discretion and tact. And then all of a sudden she\u2019ll lurch into territory that frankly is none of her business. Like commenting on my shower gel, of all things.\u2019 Luke frowns. \u2018I really think that\u2019s unprofessional behaviour, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>I feel the colour creep into my cheeks. \u2018Er ... I suppose ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018There have been other comments, too, even more intrusive and personal. Quite frankly, I haven\u2019t hired her to give me opinions about my family or house. Or choice of ties.\u2019</p><p>Shit. Shit. This is all my fault. Except I can\u2019t exactly say that, can I?</p><p>\u2018Well, I think you should give her another chance,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018You don\u2019t want to upset her, do you? She was probably just making conversation. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll never be intrusive again. In fact, I\u2019m positive.\u2019</p><p>Because I\u2019ll instantly ring her up and tell her to lay off the suggestions.</p> <p>Luke gives me a strange look. \u2018Why does it matter to you? You hardly know her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just feel very strongly that people should be given a chance. And I think you should give this assistant another chance. What\u2019s her name again \u2013 Bobbie?\u2019 I add innocently.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie,\u2019 Luke corrects me.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie.\u2019 I nod. \u2018Of course. I\u2019ve only really met her once,\u2019 I add for good measure. \u2018Ages ago.\u2019</p><p>I shoot a surreptitious glance at Luke but he doesn\u2019t seem suspicious. Thank God.</p><p>\u2018I must go.\u2019 He gets up, wiping his mouth. \u2018So ... I hope it goes well today.\u2019 He kisses Minnie. \u2018Good luck, poppet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s not running the Olympics,\u2019 I retort curtly. \u2018She doesn\u2019t need luck.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, anyway, let me know how it goes.\u2019 He hesitates awkwardly. \u2018Becky, I know how you feel about ... today. But I really think this could be the breakthrough we need.\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t even bother answering him. There\u2019s no way some child-catching boot-camp expert is having any \u2018breakthrough\u2019 in my family.</p><p>By ten o\u2019clock I\u2019m ready for her. The house is prepared and I\u2019m prepared and even Minnie is all dressed up in her most innocent-looking Marie-Chantal pinafore.</p><p>I\u2019ve done my research. First of all, I looked up Nanny Sue\u2019s website and read every page. (Unfortunately there\u2019s nothing about the boot camp on there yet, just a message saying, \u2018My new series of behaviour-management programmes for children and adults will be launched soon \u2013 check for details.\u2019 Huh. I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s being cagey.)</p><p>Then I bought all her DVDs and watched them back-to-back. And it\u2019s always the same pattern. What happens is, there\u2019s a family with kids haring about and parents arguing and usually an old abandoned fridge in the garden or dangerous electrical sockets or something. Then Nanny Sue comes in and watches carefully on the side and says, \u2018I want to see who the Ellises really are,\u2019 which means, \u2018You\u2019re doing loads of stuff wrong, but I\u2019m not going to tell you what yet.\u2019</p><p>The parents always end up having a screaming match and then sobbing on Nanny Sue\u2019s shoulder and telling her their life history. And every week she gets out her little box of tissues and says gravely, \u2018I think there\u2019s more to this than child behaviour, isn\u2019t there?\u2019 and they nod and spill all about their sex life or job troubles or family tragedy and they play sad music and you end up crying too.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s a total formula, and only complete suckers would end up falling for her tricks.</p><p>And now, presumably, she\u2019s going to crank up the drama and take all the children away to boot camp, somewhere really tough like Utah or Arizona, and it\u2019ll make even better telly when they\u2019re reunited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, not here. No way.</p><p>I look around the kitchen, just checking everything is in place. I\u2019ve put up a massive gold-star chart on the fridge, and I\u2019ve labelled the bottom step of the stairs the Naughty Step and there\u2019s a stack of educational toys on the table. But with any luck my first salvo will work and she won\u2019t even get this far.</p><p>What you can\u2019t do with Nanny Sue is say, \u2018My child doesn\u2019t have any problems,\u2019 because then she catches you out and finds some.

Nanny Sue herself, with her trademark blonde bob and neat little features and pink lipstick. She looks smaller in real life and is wearing jeans, a striped shirt and a padded jacket like horse-riders wear. I thought she\u2019d be in her blue uniform and hat, like she wears on the telly. In fact, I\u2019m half-expecting the theme music to begin and a voice-over to say \u2018Today Nanny Sue has been called to the house of the Brandons ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rebecca? I\u2019m Nanny Sue,\u2019 she says in her familiar West Country burr.</p><p>\u2018Nanny Sue! Thank God! I\u2019m so glad to see you!\u2019 I say dramatically. \u2018We\u2019re at our wits\u2019 end! You have to help us, right here, right now!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Nanny Sue looks taken aback.</p> <p>\u2018Yes! Didn\u2019t my husband explain how desperate we are? This is our two-year-old, Minnie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello, Minnie. How are you?\u2019 Nanny Sue crouches down to chat to Minnie and I wait impatiently till she rises again.</p><p>\u2018You won\u2019t believe the problems we\u2019ve had with her. It\u2019s shameful. It\u2019s mortifying. I can hardly admit it.\u2019 I let my voice wobble slightly. \u2018She refuses to learn how to tie up her shoe laces. I\u2019ve tried ... my husband\u2019s tried ... everyone\u2019s tried. But she won\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, during which I keep my anxious-mother look perfectly intact. Nanny Sue looks a little perplexed. Ha.</p><p>\u2018Rebecca,\u2019 she says. \u2018Minnie\u2019s still very young. I wouldn\u2019t expect any child of two to be able to tie her own laces.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I instantly brighten. \u2018Oh, I see. Well, that\u2019s all right then! We don\u2019t have any other problems with her. Thank you so much, Nanny Sue, please do invoice my husband, I mustn\u2019t keep you any longer, goodbye.\u2019</p> <p>And I slam the front door before she can reply.</p><p>Result! I high-five Minnie and am about to head to the kitchen for a celebratory KitKat when the doorbell rings again.</p><p>Hasn\u2019t she gone?</p><p>I peep through the spy-hole and there she is, waiting patiently on the doorstep.</p><p>What does she want? She\u2019s solved our problems. She can go.</p><p>\u2018Rebecca?\u2019 Her voice comes through the door. \u2018Are you there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello!\u2019 calls Minnie.</p><p>\u2018Sssh!\u2019 I hiss. \u2018Be quiet!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Rebecca, your husband asked if I could assess your daughter and report my findings to both of you. I can hardly do that on a one-minute acquaintance.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t need assessing!\u2019 I call back through the door.</p><p>Nanny Sue doesn\u2019t react, just waits with the same patient smile. Doesn\u2019t she want a day off?</p><p>I\u2019m feeling a bit thrown, to be honest. I thought she\u2019d just hoof off. What if she tells Luke I wouldn\u2019t let her in? What if we end up having another big row?</p><p>Oh God. Maybe it\u2019ll be simpler if I just let her in, let her do her so-called \u2018assessing\u2019 and get rid of her.</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 I throw open the door. \u2018Come in. But my daughter doesn\u2019t have any problems. And I know exactly what you\u2019re going to do and what you\u2019re going to say. And we already have a Naughty Step.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Goodness.\u2019 Nanny Sue\u2019s eyes spark a little. \u2018Well, you\u2019re ahead of the game, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 She steps in and beams at Minnie, then at me. \u2018Please don\u2019t be apprehensive or worried. All I\u2019d really like to observe is a normal day for both of you. Just act naturally and do what you would usually do. I want to see who the Brandons really are.\u2019</p><p>I knew it! She\u2019s set us our first trap. On telly, either the family haven\u2019t got a plan for the day or their child refuses to turn off the TV and they all start fighting. But I am so ahead of her. I prepared for this moment, just in case \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve even rehearsed it with Minnie.</p><p>\u2018Gosh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say in musing tones. \u2018What do you think, Minnie? Some home-baking?\u2019 I click my tongue. \u2018But I\u2019ve just remembered, we\u2019re out of organic stone-ground flour. Maybe we could make houses out of cardboard boxes, and you could paint them with non-leaded paint.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look meaningfully at Minnie. This is her cue. She\u2019s supposed to say \u2018Walk! Nature!\u2019 I coached her, and everything. But instead she\u2019s gazing longingly at the TV in the sitting room.</p><p>\u2018Peppa Pig,\u2019 she begins. \u2018Mine Peppa Pig\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018We can\u2019t see a real pig, darling!\u2019 I interrupt hastily. \u2018But let\u2019s go on a nature walk and discuss the environment!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m quite proud of the nature-walk idea. It counts as good parenting and it\u2019s really easy. You just have to walk along and say, \u2018There\u2019s an acorn! There\u2019s a squirrel!\u2019 every so often. And Nanny Sue will have to admit defeat. She\u2019ll have to give us ten out of ten and say she can\u2019t improve on a perfect family, and Luke will be totally sussed.</p> <p>When I\u2019ve put on Minnie\u2019s boots (tiny pink Uggs, so sweet), I reach in my bag and produce four dark-grey velvet ribbons, sewn in a bow and backed with Velcro. I did them last night, and they look really good.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019d better take the Naughty Ribbons,\u2019 I say ostentatiously.</p><p>\u2018Naughty Ribbons?\u2019 enquires Nanny Sue politely.</p><p>\u2018Yes, I noticed from your TV show that you don\u2019t use the Naughty Step while you\u2019re out and about. So I\u2019ve created a \u2018Naughty Ribbon\u2019. They\u2019re very simple, but effective. You just Velcro them on to the child\u2019s coat when they\u2019re naughty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I see.\u2019 Nanny Sue doesn\u2019t venture an opinion, but that\u2019s obviously because she\u2019s seething with jealousy and wishes she\u2019d thought of it first.</p> <p>Honestly, I think I might become a child expert. I have far more ideas than Nanny Sue, and I could give fashion advice too.</p><p>I usher her out of the house and we start heading down the drive. \u2018Look, Minnie, a bird!\u2019 I point at some creature flapping out of a tree. \u2018Maybe it\u2019s endangered,\u2019 I add solemnly. \u2018We have to protect our wildlife.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A pigeon?\u2019 says Nanny Sue mildly. \u2018Is that likely to be endangered?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m being green.\u2019 I give her a reproving look. Doesn\u2019t she know anything about the environment?</p><p>We walk along for a while and I point out a few squirrels. Now we\u2019re approaching the parade of shops at the end of Mum\u2019s road, and I can\u2019t help glancing right, just to see what they have in the antique shop.</p><p>\u2018Shop!\u2019 says Minnie, tugging on my hand.</p> <p>\u2018No, we\u2019re not going shopping, Minnie.\u2019 I give her an indulgent smile. \u2018We\u2019re going on a nature walk, remember? Looking at nature.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shop! Taxi!\u2019 She sticks her hand confidently out into the road and yells even louder, \u2018TAXI! TAX-EEEE!\u2019 After a moment, the taxi at the head of the rank rumbles forward towards us.</p><p>\u2018Minnie! We\u2019re not getting a taxi! I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s done that,\u2019 I add quickly to Nanny Sue. \u2018It\u2019s not like we take taxis all the time\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 comes a cheerful, booming voice. \u2018How\u2019s my best little customer?\u2019</p><p>Damn. It\u2019s Pete, who usually drives us to Kingston when we go shopping.</p><p>I mean, not that we go that often.</p><p>\u2018Pete sometimes drives us to the ... the ... educational soft-play centre,\u2019 I say quickly to Nanny Sue.</p><p>\u2018Tax-eee!\u2019 Minnie is getting that red-cheeked, angry-bull look. Oh God. I can\u2019t risk a tantrum in front of Nanny Sue. Maybe we could take a taxi somewhere.</p> <p>\u2018So.\u2019 Pete leans out of his window. \u2018Where is it today, my beauties?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Star-bucks,\u2019 enunciates Minnie carefully before I can speak. \u2018Starbucks-shops.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your usual, then?\u2019 Pete says cheerfully. \u2018Hop in!\u2019</p><p>I feel my face flood with colour.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re not going to Starbucks, Minnie!\u2019 I say shrilly. \u2018What a ... a crazy idea! Could you take us to the educational softplay centre, please, Pete? That one in Leatherhead that we go to all the time?\u2019</p><p>My eyes are fixed desperately on his, willing him not to say, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Muffin?\u2019 Minnie turns hopeful eyes on me. \u2018Muffin Starbucks?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, Minnie!\u2019 I snap. \u2018Now, you be a good girl or you\u2019ll get a Naughty Ribbon.\u2019 I take the Naughty Ribbon out of my bag and brandish it ominously at her. Instantly Minnie holds her hands out.</p><p>\u2018Mine! Miiiine!\u2019</p><p>She wasn\u2019t supposed to want the Naughty Ribbon.</p><p>\u2018Maybe later,\u2019 I say, flustered, and shove it back in my bag. This is all Nanny Sue\u2019s fault. She\u2019s putting me off.</p><p>We get in and I buckle Minnie up, and Pete pulls away from the kerb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Rebecca,\u2019 says Nanny Sue pleasantly, \u2018if you do have errands to do, please don\u2019t feel constrained by me. I\u2019m very happy to go to the shops, or do whatever you would normally do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is it!\u2019 I try to sound natural. \u2018This is our normal routine! Educational play! Have a snack, darling,\u2019 I add to Minnie, and produce a spelt biscuit which I got from the health-food shop. She looks at it dubiously, licks it, then chucks it on the floor and yells, \u2018Muffin! Muffin STARBUCKS!\u2019</p><p>My face flames red.</p><p>\u2018Starbucks is ... the name of our friend\u2019s cat,\u2019 I improvise desperately. \u2018And Muffin is the other cat. Minnie\u2019s such an animal-lover, aren\u2019t you, darling?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Have you seen the great white elephant?\u2019 Pete\u2019s voice comes cheerily from the front. \u2018They\u2019ve opened it at last!\u2019</p><p>We\u2019ve arrived at the junction where the road joins the dual carriageway, and are sitting in a line of traffic. Suddenly I see what Pete\u2019s pointing at. It\u2019s a massive black and white hoarding, reading:</p><p>HEATHFIELD VILLAGE!</p><p>NEW LUXURY OUTLET MALL OPENS TODAY!</p><p>Wow. They\u2019ve been talking about opening that place for ages. My eyes slide further down the hoarding.</p> <p>SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY OFFERS TODAY!</p><p>FREE GIFT FOR EACH CUSTOMER!</p><p>NEXT EXIT!</p><p>Free gift for each customer?</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s probably nothing to get excited about. It\u2019ll be a tiny scented candle or one single chocolate or something. And the place is probably nothing much either. Anyway, I\u2019m not even interested in some new shopping mall, because we haven\u2019t come out to go shopping, have we? We\u2019ve come out to do educational, bonding things.</p><p>\u2018Look at the clouds,\u2019 I say to Minnie, and point out of the opposite window self-consciously. \u2018Do you know how clouds are made, darling? It\u2019s with ... er ... water.\u2019</p> <p>Do I mean water vapour? Or steam?</p><p>\u2018Burberry,\u2019 says Pete with interest. \u2018Now, that\u2019s good-quality stuff. My son-in-law, he gets all the fakes from Hong Kong, and he says\u2014\u2019</p><p>Burberry? My head jerks round and I see another massive hoarding \u2013 this time listing all the designers in the outlet.</p><p>Burberry. Matthew Williamson. Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Oh my God.</p><p>Anya Hindmarch. Temperley Vivienne Westwood? All at discount prices? Yards away?</p><p>The taxi edges forward again and I feel a pull of alarm. We\u2019ll be past the exit in a minute. It\u2019ll be too late.</p><p>OK, let\u2019s just think this through properly. Let\u2019s be rational. I know we\u2019re supposed to be going to Leatherhead and bouncing around a ball-pit. But the thing is ... Nanny Sue said she didn\u2019t mind if we went shopping. She actually said it.</p><p>Not that I\u2019d buy anything for myself. Obviously. I\u2019m keeping my promise. But this is a brand-new, state-of-the-art discount shopping centre with free gifts. We can\u2019t just drive past. It\u2019s ... it\u2019s ... wrong. It\u2019s ungrateful. It\u2019s against the laws of nature. And I\u2019m allowed to buy things for Minnie, aren\u2019t I? It\u2019s part of the duties of a mother to keep your child clothed.</p> <p>I glance at the list again. Petit Bateau. Ralph Lauren Girls and Boys. Funky Kid. Baby in Urbe. I feel a bit breathless. This is a no-brainer.</p><p>\u2018You know, I\u2019ve just remembered, I do need to get Minnie some new socks.\u2019 I try to sound off-hand. \u2018So we could pop into this new mall instead of the softplay Just an idea. What do you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s up to you.\u2019 Nanny Sue lifts her hands. \u2018Entirely\u2019</p><p>\u2018So, um, Pete, could you take us to the outlet mall instead?\u2019 I raise my voice. \u2018Thanks so much!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Better clear my boot then, hadn\u2019t I?\u2019 He turns and flashes a grin at me. \u2018Ready for all the bags.\u2019</p><p>I smile weakly back. I\u2019ll tell Nanny Sue later that he has a really quirky sense of humour.</p><p>\u2018Are you fond of shopping then, Rebecca?\u2019 says Nanny Sue pleasantly.</p><p>I pause as though trying to think this over.</p><p>\u2018Not fond,\u2019 I say eventually. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say fond. I mean, it\u2019s got to be done, hasn\u2019t it? Keeping the store cupboard full.\u2019 I shrug ruefully. \u2018It\u2019s a necessary chore for any responsible mother.\u2019</p><p>We pull up at the main entrance, which has massive glass doors leading into a huge airy atrium. There are palm trees and a water feature crashing down a steel wall and as we enter I can already see Valentino and Jimmy Choo glinting at me in the distance. The air is filled with the smell of cinnamon pastries and cappuccino machines firing up, mingled with expensive leather and designer scents and just ... newness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018So where do you need to go?\u2019 says Nanny Sue, looking around. \u2018It was socks, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... um ...\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t quite think straight. Mulberry is straight ahead and I\u2019ve just seen the most amazing bag in the window. \u2018Um ...\u2019 I force myself to focus. \u2018Yes. Socks.\u2019</p><p>Children\u2019s socks. Not Valentino. Not Jimmy Choo. Not Mulberry. Oh God, I wonder how much that bag is ...</p> <p>Stop it. Don\u2019t look. I\u2019m not buying anything for myself. I\u2019m not even thinking about it.</p><p>\u2018Mine! Miiiine dolly!\u2019 Minnie\u2019s voice jerks me back to the present. She\u2019s standing outside Gucci, pointing to a mannequin.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not a dolly, darling, it\u2019s a mannequin! Come on.\u2019 Firmly I take her hand and lead her towards the mall guide. \u2018We\u2019re going to get you some socks.\u2019</p><p>We head towards the Kids\u2019 Zone, which is where all the children\u2019s stores are clustered. There\u2019s a clown greeting customers, and stalls laden with toys, and the whole area feels like a fairground.</p><p>\u2018Book!\u2019 Minnie has immediately made a beeline for one of the stalls and grabbed a big pink book with fairies on the front. \u2018Mine book.\u2019</p> <p>Ha! I glance smugly at Nanny Sue. My daughter went for the educational book, not the trashy plastic!</p><p>\u2018Of course you can buy a book, Minnie,\u2019 I say loudly. \u2018We\u2019ll take it out of your pocket money. I\u2019m teaching Minnie financial planning,\u2019 I add to Nanny Sue. \u2018I write down all her pocket-money expenditure.\u2019</p><p>I take out my little pink Smythson notebook with \u2018Minnie\u2019s Pocket Money\u2019 on the front. (I had it printed especially. It was quite expensive, but then, it\u2019s an investment in my daughter\u2019s financial responsibility.)</p><p>\u2018Man!\u2019 Minnie has grabbed a puppet in addition to the book. \u2018Mine man! Miiiine!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Er ...\u2019 I look doubtfully at the puppet. It is quite sweet, and we don\u2019t have any puppets. \u2018Well, OK. As long as you get it out of your pocket money. Do you understand, darling?\u2019 I speak super-clearly. \u2018It has to come out of your pocket money.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Goodness!\u2019 says Nanny Sue as we head to the till. \u2018How much pocket money does Minnie get?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Fifty pence a week,\u2019 I reply, reaching for my purse. \u2018But we have a system where she can have an advance and pay it back. It teaches her budgeting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 persists Nanny Sue. \u2018In what sense is she budgeting?\u2019</p><p>Honestly. She\u2019s quite slow, for a so-called expert.</p><p>\u2018Because it all goes in the book.\u2019 I scribble down the cost of the book and the puppet, slap the notebook shut and beam at Minnie. \u2018Let\u2019s find you some socks, darling.\u2019</p><p>God, I love Funky Kid. They change their d\u00e9cor each season, and today the whole place is done up like a barn, with wooden beams and bales of fake straw. It has fantastic clothes for kids, like quirky knitted cardigans with hoods, and padded coats with appliqu\u00e9 patches. I find some adorable socks with cherries and bananas round the hems, half price at \u00a34.99, and put two pairs of each into my basket.</p><p>\u2018There,\u2019 says Nanny Sue briskly. \u2018Well done. Shall we go to the check-out?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. I\u2019ve been distracted by a rail of little pinafores. I remember these from the catalogue. They\u2019re mint-green needlecord, with a white cross-stitch border. They\u2019re absolutely gorgeous, and they\u2019re 70 per cent off! I quickly look through the rails \u2013 but there aren\u2019t any in age 2\u20133. Of course there aren\u2019t. They\u2019ve been snapped up. Damn.</p><p>\u2018Excuse me?\u2019 I ask a passing sales assistant. \u2018Do you have any of these in size 2\u20133?\u2019</p> <p>At once she makes a face. \u2018Sorry. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got any in that size. It\u2019s so popular.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does Minnie need a pinafore?\u2019 enquires Nanny Sue, coming up behind me.</p><p>I\u2019m getting a bit sick of Nanny Sue and her pointless questions.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re tremendously good value,\u2019 I say smoothly. \u2018I always think as a responsible parent you should look for bargains, don\u2019t you agree, Nanny Sue? In fact ...\u2019 A sudden inspiration has come to me. \u2018I think I\u2019ll stock up for next year.\u2019</p><p>I grab a pinafore in age 3-4. Perfect! Why didn\u2019t I think of that before? I take a red pinafore too, and head towards a rack of pale-pink raincoats with flower hoods. They don\u2019t have any small sizes at all \u2013 but I find a size 7\u20138. I mean, Minnie will need a coat when she\u2019s seven, won\u2019t she? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there\u2019s a really lovely velvet jacket, age 12, only \u00a320, down from \u00a3120! It would be a total mistake not to get it.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe how far-sighted I\u2019m being as I fill my basket with more and more clothes. I\u2019ve practically bought all Minnie\u2019s key pieces for the next ten years, at rock-bottom prices! I won\u2019t need to buy her anything else!</p><p>As I pay for the lot I feel a glow of self-satisfaction. I must have saved hundreds.</p><p>\u2018Well!\u2019 Nanny Sue seems a bit lost for words as the assistant hands me three huge bags. \u2018You bought a lot more than a pair of socks!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Just thinking ahead.\u2019 I adopt a wise, motherly tone. \u2018Children grow so quickly, you have to be prepared. Shall we go and get a coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Starbucks?\u2019 chimes in Minnie at once. She\u2019s been watching me attentively, and has insisted on wearing the age 7\u20138 pale-pink raincoat, even though it\u2019s trailing on the floor. \u2018Starbucks-muffin?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We might just have to go to a chain coffee shop.\u2019 I try to sound regretful. \u2018They may not have an organic health-food cooperative.\u2019</p><p>I consult the map \u2013 and to get to the food court we\u2019re going to have to walk past all the designer shops. Which is fine. I\u2019ll be fine. I just won\u2019t look in the windows.</p><p>As the three of us start walking along, my eyes are focused straight ahead, on that pointy metal modern sculpture hanging down from the ceiling. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good. Actually, I\u2019ve got used to not shopping. I barely miss it at all ...</p> <p>Oh my God, it\u2019s that Burberry coat with the frills that was on the catwalk. Right there in the window. I wonder how much ...</p><p>No. Keep walking, Becky. Don\u2019t look. I close my eyes until they\u2019re two squinty slits. Yes. This is good. If I can\u2019t actually see the shops\u2014</p><p>\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 Nanny Sue suddenly notices me. \u2018Rebecca, are you ill?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine!\u2019 My voice sounds a bit strangled. It\u2019s been so long since I shopped. I can feel a kind of pressure building up inside me; a kind of bubbling desperation.</p><p>But I have to ignore it. I promised Luke. I promised.</p><p>Think about something else. Yes. Like when I did that labour class and they said you breathe to distract yourself from the pain. I\u2019ll breathe to distract myself from the shopping.</p> <p>Breathe in ... breathe out ... breathe in ... oh my God, it\u2019s a Temperley dress.</p><p>My legs have stopped dead. It\u2019s a white and gold Temperley evening dress, in a shop called Fifty Percent Frocks. It has stunning embroidery around the neck and it sweeps to the floor and it looks like something straight off the red carpet. And it has a sign by it, saying \u2018Extra 20% off today\u2019.</p><p>My fingers are gripped round my shopping bags as I stare through the window.</p><p>I can\u2019t buy this dress. I musn\u2019t even look at it.</p><p>But somehow ... I can\u2019t move, either. My feet are rooted to the polished marble floor.</p><p>\u2018Rebecca?\u2019 Nanny Sue has come to a halt. She peers in at the dress and clicks her tongue disapprovingly. \u2018These dresses are terribly expensive, aren\u2019t they? Even on sale.\u2019</p><p>Is that all she can say? This is the most beautiful dress in the world, and it\u2019s a fraction of its full price and if I hadn\u2019t made that stupid promise to Luke ...</p><p>Oh my God. I have the answer. In fact, this could be the answer to a lot of things.</p> <p>\u2018Minnie.\u2019 Abruptly I turn to her. \u2018My lovely, precious little girl.\u2019 I bend down and cradle her face tenderly between my hands. \u2018Darling ... would you like a Temperley dress for your twenty-first birthday present?\u2019</p><p>Minnie doesn\u2019t answer, which is only because she doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019m offering her. Who wouldn\u2019t want a Temperley dress for their twenty-first? And by the time she\u2019s twenty-one it\u2019ll be a rare vintage piece! All her friends will be really envious! They\u2019ll all say, \u2018God, Minnie, I wish my mother had bought me a dress when I was two.\u2019 People will call her The Girl in the Vintage Temperley Dress.</p><p>And I could borrow it for Luke\u2019s party. Just to try it out for her.</p><p>\u2018Muffin?\u2019 Minnie says hopefully.</p><p>\u2018Dress,\u2019 I say firmly. \u2018This is for you, Minnie! This is your birthday present!\u2019 Firmly I lead her into the shop, ignoring Nanny Sue\u2019s startled look. It takes me ten seconds to sweep the place and realize the Temperley dress is the best thing they\u2019ve got. I knew it was a bargain.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I say breathlessly to the assistant. \u2018I\u2019d like the Temperley dress, please. At least ... it\u2019s for my daughter. I\u2019m buying it in advance, obviously,\u2019 I add, with a little laugh. \u2018For her twenty-first.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The assistant stares at Minnie.

Do you like the lovely dress, Minnie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No dress.\u2019 Her brows knit together in a frown.</p><p>\u2018Darling, it\u2019s Temperley.\u2019 I hold the fabric up to show her. \u2018You\u2019ll look gorgeous in it! One day.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No dress!\u2019 She runs to the other side of the shop and starts climbing into an open stock drawer.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 I exclaim. \u2018Get out! So sorry ...\u2019 I add over my shoulder to the assistant.</p><p>\u2018Muffin!\u2019 she yells as I try to manhandle her out. \u2018Want muffin!\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll have a muffin after we\u2019ve got the dress,\u2019 I say soothingly. \u2018It\u2019ll take no time\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No dress!\u2019 Somehow she extricates herself from my grasp and scampers into the window display. \u2018Dolly! Mine dolly!\u2019</p> <p>Now she\u2019s grabbing a naked mannequin.</p><p>\u2018Minnie, please stop that, darling.\u2019 I try not to sound as rattled as I feel. \u2018Come back here!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mine dolly!\u2019 She drags the whole mannequin down off its podium on to the floor with a crash and starts hugging it. \u2018Miiiine!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get off, Minnie!\u2019 I say. \u2018It\u2019s not a dolly! She thinks it\u2019s a doll,\u2019 I add to the assistant, aiming for a light-hearted laugh. \u2018Aren\u2019t children funny?\u2019</p><p>The assistant doesn\u2019t laugh back, or even smile.</p><p>\u2018Could you get her off, please?\u2019 she says.</p> <p>\u2018Of course! Sorry ...\u2019 Red-faced, I try to pull Minnie off as hard as I can. But she\u2019s holding on like a limpet.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Minnie!\u2019 I try to sound relaxed and cajoling. \u2018Come on, sweetheart. Off you get.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 she shrieks. \u2018Mine dolleee!\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 snaps someone behind me. \u2018What\u2019s that child doing? Can\u2019t someone control her?\u2019</p><p>My stomach curdles. I know that whiny, toxic voice. I whip round \u2013 and sure enough, it\u2019s the elf who banned us from Santa\u2019s Grotto. She\u2019s still got purple nails and a ridiculous permatanned cleavage, but now she\u2019s dressed in a black suit with a badge reading \u2018Assistant Manager\u2019.</p><p>\u2018You!\u2019 Her eyes narrow.</p><p>\u2018Oh, hi,\u2019 I say nervously. \u2018Nice to see you again. How\u2019s Father Christmas?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Could you please remove your child?\u2019 she says in pointed tones.</p> <p>\u2018Er ... OK. No problem.\u2019</p><p>I look at Minnie, still clinging on to the mannequin for dear life. The only way I\u2019m going to get her away is by peeling each finger off individually. I\u2019m going to need ten hands.</p><p>\u2018Could we possibly ... buy the mannequin?\u2019</p><p>From Permatanned Elf\u2019s expression, I wish I hadn\u2019t asked that question.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Minnie. Off you get.\u2019 I try to sound brisk and jolly, like a mother in a soap-powder commercial. \u2018Bye-bye, dolly!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Noooooooooo!\u2019 She clasps it harder.</p><p>\u2018Get off!\u2019 With all my effort I manage to prise one hand off, but she immediately clamps it back down.</p><p>\u2018Miiiiine!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get your daughter off that mannequin!\u2019 snaps the elf. \u2018Customers are coming in! Get her off!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m trying!\u2019 I say desperately. \u2018Minnie, I\u2019ll buy you a dolly. I\u2019ll buy you two dollies!\u2019</p><p>A group of girls holding shopping bags have stopped to watch us, and one starts giggling.</p><p>\u2018Minnie, you will have a Naughty Ribbon!\u2019 I\u2019m totally hot and flustered. \u2018And you\u2019ll go on the Naughty Step! And you won\u2019t have any treats ever! And Father Christmas will move to Mars and so will the Tooth Fairy ...\u2019 I grab her feet but she kicks me in the shin. \u2018Ow! Minnie!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dolleee!\u2019 she wails.</p><p>\u2018You know what?\u2019 The elf suddenly savagely erupts. \u2018Take the mannequin! Just have the bloody mannequin!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have it?\u2019 I stare at her, bewildered.</p><p>\u2018Yes! Anything! Just go! GO! OUT!\u2019</p><p>Minnie is still lying full-length on the mannequin, gripping on to it for dear life. Awkwardly I pick it up with both hands, dragging it along between my legs as if it\u2019s a dead body. Somehow, panting with effort, I manage to lug it outside \u2013 then drop it and look up.</p><p>Nanny Sue has followed us out with my three shopping bags. Now she\u2019s just watching me and Minnie silently, her face unreadable.</p><p>And suddenly it\u2019s as if I come out of a trance. Suddenly I see everything that has just happened through Nanny Sue\u2019s eyes. I swallow several times, trying to think of some light-hearted comment about \u2018Kids, eh?\u2019 But I can\u2019t think of one, and anyway, my mouth is too dry with nerves. How could I have let this happen? No one on the TV series ever got chucked out of a shop. I\u2019m worse than all the families with fridges in the garden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What\u2019s she going to say in her assessment?

Shall we get off her now and buy you a nice snack? We can buy one for dolly too.\u2019</p> <p>Minnie swivels her head and looks mistrustfully at Nanny Sue for a few moments \u2013 then clambers off the mannequin.</p><p>\u2018Good girl,\u2019 says Nanny Sue. \u2018We\u2019ll leave the dolly here at her own home.\u2019 She hefts the mannequin up and props it against the door. \u2018Now, let\u2019s find you a drink. Say \u201cYes, Nanny Sue.\u201d \u2018</p><p>\u2018Ess Nanny Sue,\u2019 parrots Minnie obediently.</p><p>Huh? How did she do that?</p><p>\u2018Rebecca, are you coming?\u2019</p> <p>Somehow I manage to get my legs in gear and start walking along with them. Nanny Sue starts talking but I can\u2019t hear a word. I\u2019m too sick with dread. She\u2019s going to file her report and say Minnie needs special treatment at a boot camp. I know she is. And Luke will listen to her. What am I going to do?</p><p>By nine o\u2019clock that night I\u2019m in a total state, pacing around the house, waiting for Luke to get back.</p><p>This is the worst moment in our marriage. Ever. By a million miles. Because if it comes to it, I will be forced to take Minnie away to a safe refuge and never see Luke again and change our names by deed poll and try to forget through alcohol and drugs.</p><p>You know. Worst-case scenario.</p><p>At the sound of his key in the door I stiffen.</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 He appears at the kitchen door. \u2018I was expecting you to phone! How did it go?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Fine! We went shopping and we ... er ... had coffee.\u2019 I sound totally false and stiff, but Luke doesn\u2019t seem to notice, which just shows how observant he is.</p><p>\u2018So, what did she say about Minnie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not a lot. You know. I expect she\u2019ll report back later. When she\u2019s come to her conclusions.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 Luke nods, loosening his tie. He heads to the fridge, then pauses by the table. \u2018Your BlackBerry\u2019s flashing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, is it?\u2019 I say with stagey surprise. \u2018Gosh. I must have a message! Could you listen to it? I\u2019m sooo tired.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you like.\u2019 Luke shoots me an odd look, picks it up and dials voicemail while taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s her.\u2019 He looks up, suddenly alert. \u2018It\u2019s Nanny Sue.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I try to sound astounded. \u2018Well ... put her on speaker phone!\u2019</p> <p>As the familiar West Country vowels fill the kitchen we both listen, motionless.</p><p>\u2018... full report to come. But I just had to say, Minnie is an enchanting child. It was a pleasure to spend time with her and your wife. Becky\u2019s parenting skills are second to none and I can diagnose no problems in your family whatsoever. Well done! Goodbye now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow!\u2019 I exclaim as the phone goes dead. \u2018Isn\u2019t that amazing! Now we can put this whole episode behind us and get on with our lives.\u2019</p><p>Luke hasn\u2019t yet moved a muscle. Now he just turns and gives me a long, hard look.</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019 I flash him a nervous smile.</p><p>\u2018Was that by any chance Janice, putting on a West Country accent?\u2019</p><p>What? How can he even say that?</p><p>I mean, OK, it was Janice, but she disguised her voice perfectly. I was really impressed.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I bluster. \u2018It was Nanny Sue, and I\u2019m really offended you should have to ask.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great. Well, I\u2019ll give her a ring to chat about it.\u2019 He pulls out his own BlackBerry</p><p>\u2018No, don\u2019t!\u2019 I yelp.</p><p>Why is he so mistrustful? It\u2019s a massive character flaw. I\u2019ll tell him so, one of these days.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll disturb her,\u2019 I improvise. \u2018It\u2019s really antisocial to ring so late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s your sole concern, is it?\u2019 He raises his eyebrows. \u2018Being antisocial?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say defiantly. \u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, then I\u2019ll email her.\u2019</p><p>Oh God. This isn\u2019t going the way I planned. I thought I\u2019d buy myself some time, at least.</p><p>\u2018OK, OK! It was Janice,\u2019 I say desperately as he starts tapping. \u2018But I didn\u2019t have any choice! Luke, it was terrible. It was a disaster. Minnie got banned from a shop and she stole a mannequin and Nanny Sue didn\u2019t say anything, just gave us that look, and I know what she\u2019s going to recommend, but I can\u2019t send Minnie away to some boot camp in Utah, I just can\u2019t do it. And if you make me then I\u2019ll have to take out an injunction and we\u2019ll go to court and it\u2019ll be like Kramer vs. Kramer and she\u2019ll be scarred for life and it\u2019ll be all your fault!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out of nowhere, tears have begun pouring down my cheeks.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Luke stares at me incredulously. \u2018Utah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or Arizona.

Jesus!\u2019 He seems absolutely stunned. \u2018Who mentioned Utah, for fuck\u2019s sake?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I ... er ...\u2019 I\u2019m not quite sure now. I know someone did.</p><p>\u2018I hired this woman because I thought she could give us some childcare advice. If she\u2019s useful we\u2019ll use her. If not, we won\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>Luke sounds so matter-of-fact, I blink at him in surprise.</p><p>He\u2019s never seen the TV programme, I suddenly remember. He doesn\u2019t know about how Nanny Sue comes into your life and changes everything and you end up sobbing on her shoulder.</p><p>\u2018I believe in listening to professionals,\u2019 Luke is saying calmly. \u2018Now she\u2019s seen Minnie, we should hear her recommendations. But that\u2019s as far as it goes. Agreed?\u2019</p> <p>How can he take a situation that seems like a great big tangled spider\u2019s web and reduce it to a single thread? How does he do that?</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t send Minnie away.\u2019 My voice is still shaky. \u2018You\u2019ll have to prise us apart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, there\u2019ll be no prising,\u2019 says Luke patiently. \u2018We\u2019ll ask Nanny Sue what we can do that doesn\u2019t involve sending her away. OK? Drama over?\u2019</p><p>I feel a bit wrong-footed. To be honest, I was all ready for a bit more drama.</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I say at last.</p><p>Luke opens his beer and grins at me. Then he frowns, puzzled. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 He unpeels a place card from the bottom of the bottle. \u2018 \u201cHappy Birthday Mike\u201d. Who\u2019s Mike?\u2019</p> <p>Shit. How did that get there?</p><p>\u2018No idea!\u2019 I grab it from him and hastily crumple it. \u2018Weird. Must have got picked up at the shop. Shall we ... er ... watch TV?\u2019</p><p>The advantage of having the house to ourselves is we don\u2019t have to watch snooker all the time any more. Or real-life crime. Or documentaries about the Cold War. We\u2019re snuggled up on the sofa with the gas fire flickering away, and Luke is flipping through the channels, when suddenly he pauses and turns to me.</p><p>\u2018Becky ... you don\u2019t really think I would ever send Minnie away, do you? I mean, is that the kind of father you think I am?\u2019</p><p>He looks quite perturbed and I feel a bit guilty. The truth is, I did.</p><p>\u2018Er ...\u2019 My phone rings before I can answer. \u2018It\u2019s Suze,\u2019 I say apprehensively. \u2018I\u2019d better just get this ...\u2019 I head swiftly out of the room and take a deep breath. \u2018Hi, Suze?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve texted Suze several times since our mini-row but we haven\u2019t spoken. Is she still angry with me? Do I dare bring up the special shortbread thing?</p><p>\u2018Have you seen Style Central?\u2019 Her voice blasts down the line, taking me by surprise. \u2018Have you seen it? I\u2019ve just had a copy biked round. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What? Oh, you mean Tarkie\u2019s interview? Does it look good? Danny said Tarquin was really experimental\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Experimental? Is that what he calls it? Interesting choice of word. I could have chosen a better one.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a weird, sarcastic edge to Suze\u2019s voice. What\u2019s up? Suze is never sarcastic.</p><p>\u2018Suze ... are you OK?\u2019 I say nervously.</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m not OK! I should never have let Tarkie go to that photoshoot without me! I should never have trusted Danny. What was I thinking? Where were Tarkie\u2019s advisers? Who edited the photospread? Because whoever it was, I\u2019m suing them\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Suze!\u2019 I try to interrupt the stream of words. \u2018Tell me. What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They dressed Tarkie up in leather bondage gear!\u2019 she erupts. \u2018That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong! He looks like a gay model!\u2019</p><p>Oh God. The thing about Tarquin is, he can look a bit ... metrosexual. And Suze is quite sensitive about it.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Suze,\u2019 I say soothingly. \u2018I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t look gay ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes he does! And it\u2019s deliberate! They haven\u2019t even mentioned that he\u2019s married or has children! It\u2019s all about sexy Lord Tarquin with his \u201choned pecs\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s under his kilt?\u201d And they\u2019ve used all kinds of suggestive props ...\u2019 I can practically hear her shudder. \u2018I\u2019m going to kill Danny. Kill him!\u2019</p><p>She must be overreacting.

He has such a nerve.</p><p>\u2018Becky, OK, look. That guy was totally out of line. I told him off the record! We were just chatting after the interview! Anyway, what does it matter? Nobody reads Style Central. No one Luke knows, anyway.\u2019</p><p>To be fair, that\u2019s true. And that\u2019s the one thing that gives me comfort: Style Central only has about five hundred readers. I mean, they\u2019re all very cool and important and influential in fashion and design, but the point is, they don\u2019t know Luke.</p><p>First thing the following morning, I got in touch with the editor and begged him to let me contact all the subscribers, and eventually he agreed to pass on an email asking them not to let on. Two weeks have passed and nothing seems to have seeped out yet. I think I\u2019ve contained the outbreak. But I still can\u2019t relax.</p><p>In fact I\u2019m in a bit of a state all round. I\u2019m not sleeping well, and my hair looks terrible. In one sense the party is more under control than it was, because I\u2019ve booked all the things I hadn\u2019t thought about, like heaters and loos and flooring. But everything costs so much money. All my credit cards are starting to bounce and it\u2019s getting a bit scary. I had a really nasty conversation with the Portaloo lady yesterday (I must be more careful about answering the phone), who wanted to know why my deposit was being held up and wasn\u2019t at all sympathetic about my recent emergency root canal.</p><p>I just hadn\u2019t realized ... I mean, I hadn\u2019t quite planned ...</p><p>Anyway. Today is the big day. I\u2019m going to march in, wearing my smartest prospective-board-member suit and killer heels. Trevor\u2019s back from his holiday and I\u2019ve got an appointment at eleven to see him. And I\u2019m going to ask for the Employee of the Year money, plus a raise. Payable immediately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I arrive at work I\u2019m feeling quite jittery. I\u2019ve never asked for a raise before. But Luke always says it\u2019s perfectly normal and appropriate. He says he respects people who value their own worth correctly. Well, I value my own worth at precisely \u00a37,200 more than I\u2019m getting at the moment. (That\u2019s how much I\u2019ve worked out I need for the party. Maybe I\u2019ll ask for eight, to be on the safe side.)</p><p>I\u2019m not going to throw a tantrum about it. I\u2019m just going to be firm and to the point. I\u2019ll say, \u2018Trevor, I\u2019ve assessed the market rate, and I calculate that a personal shopper of my calibre is worth an additional eight thousand pounds. Which I would like advanced today, if possible.\u2019</p><p>Actually ... let\u2019s make it ten thousand. That\u2019s a nice round number.</p><p>And what\u2019s ten thousand pounds in the scheme of things? The Look is a massive department store with a great big turnover and they can easily afford ten thousand pounds for a valued employee and potential board member. I mean, Elinor spent way more than ten thousand pounds in my department in about five minutes flat. Which I might mention, if things get a bit sticky.</p> <p>As I\u2019m heading up the escalator my BlackBerry buzzes with two new emails. The lighting company and the security firm have both finally got back to me. I read both of their quotes in turn \u2013 and when I\u2019ve finished I feel so wobbly I nearly trip over the top of the escalator. They both want four-figure sums beginning with \u20184\u2019, with a 50 per cent deposit payable immediately, due to the lateness of the booking.</p><p>So let\u2019s work this out. In total, I now need ...</p><p>OK. Don\u2019t panic. It\u2019s very simple. To put this party on properly, I need ... fifteen grand.</p><p>Fifteen grand? Am I seriously going to ask my boss for fifteen thousand pounds? With a straight face?</p><p>I want to laugh hysterically, or maybe run away. But I can\u2019t. This is my only option. I have to stay bullish. I have to believe I\u2019m worth another fifteen thousand pounds. Yes. I am.</p> <p>As I reach our department I duck into one of the dressing rooms, lock the door, take three deep breaths and face myself in the mirror.</p><p>\u2018Trevor,\u2019 I say as confidently as possible. \u2018I\u2019ve assessed the market rate and I calculate that a personal shopper of my calibre is worth an additional fifteen thousand pounds. Which I would like today, if possible. Cheque or cash is fine.\u2019</p><p>I did it quite well. Apart from the shaky voice. And the gulping when I got to \u2018fifteen thousand\u2019.</p><p>Maybe I should start off asking for ten thousand. And then say, \u2018Actually, I meant fifteen,\u2019 just as he\u2019s about to write out the cheque.</p><p>No. Bad idea.</p><p>My stomach is turning over. This is where I wish I had \u2018people\u2019, like Danny does. He never has to ask anyone for money. In fact, he behaves as if money doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 Jasmine is knocking on the door. \u2018Your customer\u2019s here.\u2019</p><p>OK. I\u2019ll just have to wing it. Or hope someone gives me a really, really big tip.</p><p>On the plus side, it\u2019s a really good morning. As I grab a coffee at ten thirty, the place is full. Both Jasmine and I are in the middle of one-to-one appointments, and there are a few dropin customers too. We always let our regular clients come and use the nice dressing rooms, even if they haven\u2019t made a consultation appointment. There\u2019s a cappuccino machine, and sofas, and bowls of sweets, and the whole place is feel-good. I even have a few customers who regularly meet here for a chat, instead of a caf\u00e9.</p><p>As I look around, listening to the familiar noises of hangers and zips and chatter and laughter, I can\u2019t help feeling proud. The rest of the store may be struggling, but my department is warm and happy and buzzy.</p><p>Jasmine is packaging up a load of Paul Smith shirts, and as she rings up the till she arches her eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u2018Look what I got online.\u2019 She pulls out a plastic tabard reading \u2018OFFICESUPPLIES.COM\u2019. \u2018I wear it when I deliver clothes. No one ever gives me any gip.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 I say, impressed. \u2018That\u2019s thorough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My delivery name is Gwen.\u2019 She nods. \u2018I\u2019ve got a whole second personality going on. Gwen doesn\u2019t smoke. And she\u2019s Pisces.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Er ... great!\u2019 Sometimes I worry that Jasmine has gone a bit far with the whole cloak-and-dagger bit. \u2018Hi, Louise!\u2019</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s client has arrived at the till. It\u2019s Louise Sullivan, who has three kids and her own online food company and is constantly stressing over whether to have a tummy tuck or not, which is ridiculous. She looks great. It\u2019s not her fault her husband has zero tact and likes making crass jokes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Will you take your clothes now or have them delivered discreetly?\u2019 says Jasmine as she swipes Louise\u2019s card.</p><p>\u2018I could probably take one bag now,\u2019 says Louise, and chews her lip. \u2018But no more than one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem.\u2019 Jasmine nods in a businesslike way. \u2018So ... we\u2019ll deliver the rest in a computer-paper box?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually ...\u2019 Louise reaches in her carrier bag. \u2018I brought this.\u2019 It\u2019s a flatpacked box, stamped with \u2018Ligurian Olive Oil\u2019.</p> <p>\u2018I like it.\u2019 I can see Jasmine looking at Louise with new respect. \u2018Olive oil it is.\u2019 She takes the box. \u2018Tomorrow evening?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which one of you is Becky?\u2019 comes a man\u2019s voice, and we all start. You don\u2019t often get men on this floor, but a guy in a leather jacket with a fleshy face is striding towards us. He\u2019s holding a box marked \u2018Computer Paper\u2019 and wearing a deep scowl on his face.</p><p>I feel a sudden qualm. I really hope that\u2019s just a box of computer paper.</p><p>\u2018Me!\u2019 I say brightly, as Jasmine stuffs the olive-oil box under the counter and Louise quickly melts away. \u2018Can I help?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019 He brandishes the box at me. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Um ... a box? Would you like an appointment with a personal shopper, sir?\u2019 I add hastily. \u2018Menswear is actually on the second floor\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not after menswear,\u2019 he says menacingly. \u2018I\u2019m after answers.\u2019</p><p>He crashes the box down on the counter and lifts the lid. Jasmine and I exchange glances. It\u2019s the Preen dress I sold to Ariane Raynor last week. Oh God, this must be Ariane\u2019s husband. The one who used to be a rock star, apparently, but hasn\u2019t had a hit for years. The one who tried to make a pass at the au pair and trims his pubic hair in front of Desperate Housewives. (We\u2019ve chatted quite a lot, me and Ariane.)</p><p>\u2018 \u201cShop in Private\u201d.\u2019 He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and reads out loud in a sarcastic voice. \u2018\u201cHave clothes delivered in a cardboard box labelled \u2018Computer Paper\u2019 or \u2018Sanitary Products\u2019.\u201d \u2019</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s been shopping, hasn\u2019t she?\u2019 He thumps the leaflet down. \u2018How much has she spent?\u2019</p> <p>My phone bleeps with a text and I can see Jasmine jerking her head at it. I surreptitiously click on it to find a message from her.</p><p>Ariane is here for her alteration!!!! I put her in dressing room 3 while you were in with Victoria. Shall I warn her?</p><p>I nod unobtrusively at Jasmine and turn back to Ariane\u2019s husband.</p><p>\u2018Mr ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Raynor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mr Raynor, I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t comment,\u2019 I say smoothly. \u2018I have to respect my customers\u2019 privacy. Perhaps you could come back another time?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jasmine?\u2019 rings out Ariane\u2019s distinctive voice from the dressing rooms. \u2018Could you look at this hem? Because I don\u2019t think\u2014\u2019 Her voice abruptly breaks off, as though someone\u2019s muffled her \u2013 but it\u2019s too late. Her husband\u2019s face has jolted in recognition.</p><p>\u2018Is that Ariane?\u2019 Incredulity spreads over his face. \u2018Is she shopping again?\u2019</p> <p>No she\u2019s not, you oaf, I want to reply, she\u2019s having an alteration done on a dress she bought two years ago. And anyway, what about the Bang and Olufsen system you just insisted on replacing in your country house? That cost squillions more than a dress.</p><p>But instead I smile sweetly and say, \u2018Our customer appointments are confidential. Now, if that\u2019s all ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not!\u2019 He raises his voice to a bark. \u2018Ariane, you come out here now!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sir, please could you refrain from shouting in here?\u2019 I say calmly, while reaching for my phone and texting to Jasmine:</p><p>Ariane\u2019s husband v. irate. Take her out back way.</p><p>\u2018Ariane, I know you\u2019re in there!\u2019 he shouts threateningly. \u2018I know you\u2019ve been lying to me!\u2019 He makes for the entrance but I block his way.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let you in.\u2019 I smile. \u2018Only customers are permitted in the personal-shopping area. I\u2019m sure you understand.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Understand?\u2019 He turns his wrath on me. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what I understand. You\u2019re all in this together, you witches. Computer fucking paper.\u2019 He bangs a fist down on the box. \u2018You should be in jail.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help flinching. His blue eyes are bloodshot and I suddenly wonder if he\u2019s been drinking.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s simply a discreet packaging option.\u2019 I keep my voice steady. \u2018Not everyone wants to flaunt designer labels at this time.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I bet they don\u2019t.\u2019 He eyes me nastily. \u2018Not to their mugs of husbands, they don\u2019t.

I believe Ariane\u2019s furniture business is going very well at the moment.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help a little dig. I know he\u2019s threatened by her success. She says it every time she comes in. And then she says she\u2019s going to leave him.

It costs the same and you get a dress out of it.</p><p>\u2018Ariane!\u2019 He starts pushing past me.</p><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 I grab his arm, absolutely furious. \u2018I told you, only clients are permitted in the\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get out of my way!\u2019 He throws my arm aside as if I\u2019m a doll.</p><p>OK. Now this is a matter of principle. No one comes and barges past me, into my department.</p> <p>\u2018No! You\u2019re not going in!\u2019 I grab his shoulders, but he\u2019s too strong. \u2018Jasmine!\u2019 I yell as I grapple with him. \u2018Lead all the customers to safety!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You bloody well let me in!\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is a private shopping area.\u2019 I\u2019m panting with the effort of restraining him.</p><p>\u2018What on earth is going on?\u2019</p><p>A deep voice booms right behind me, and I relinquish my grasp. I swivel around, already knowing it\u2019s Trevor. Gavin is lurking behind him, face gleaming as though he\u2019s watching some kind of floor show. Trevor meets my eyes with a grim \u2018There\u2019d better be a very good reason for this\u2019 look, and I shrug defensively back, trying to convey \u2018Yes, there is.\u2019</p><p>As Trevor turns to Mr Raynor, his expression suddenly changes to one of awe. \u2018My goodness! Is it ... Doug Raynor?\u2019</p> <p>Trust him to know some ancient old rocker that no one else has even heard of.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Doug Raynor preens himself. \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mr Raynor, we\u2019re extremely honoured to see you here at The Look.\u2019 Trevor launches into full obsequious-manager mode. \u2018We\u2019re all huge fans. If there\u2019s anything I can do to help you ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018There is, as it happens.\u2019 Doug Raynor cuts him off. \u2018You can tell me what this is all about. You might call it discreet shopping; I call it downright lying.\u2019 He slaps the leaflet down on the reception counter. \u2018And I\u2019m calling the Daily World tomorrow. Exposing the bloody lot of you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 says Trevor, looking puzzled. \u2018 \u201cShop in Private\u201d? Do I know about this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s ... um ...\u2019 My mouth suddenly feels like cotton wool. \u2018I was going to mention it ...\u2019</p><p>I can feel blood filling my face as Trevor reads the leaflet in silence. When at last he looks up, his eyes are like two black holes of disapproval.</p><p>No. Worse than disapproval. He looks like he wants to murder me. Gavin is reading it over his shoulder now.</p> <p>\u2018You pretend to be cleaning ladies?\u2019 He gives a sudden snort of laughter. \u2018Jesus Christ, Becky!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think this is a responsible way to carry on?\u2019 Doug Raynor chimes in furiously. \u2018You think this is the way a top department store should be acting? It\u2019s criminal deception, that\u2019s what it is!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Gavin.\u2019 Trevor snaps into full damage-limitation action. \u2018Be so kind as to take Mr Raynor to menswear and offer him a new suit, with our compliments. Mr Raynor, perhaps I can offer you a glass of champagne at the oyster bar when you\u2019ve finished shopping, and you can express any concerns you have directly to me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. And you\u2019ll be getting an earful from me, I can tell you.\u2019 Doug Raynor is obviously torn between staying and shouting some more and getting a free suit \u2013 but at last allows himself to be led away by Gavin. Jasmine has vanished back into the dressing rooms, too.</p><p>It\u2019s just me and Trevor and an ominous hush.</p><p>\u2018You ... you said you wanted to know the secret of our success ...\u2019 I falter. \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019</p><p>Trevor says nothing, but reads the leaflet through again, his fingers gripping the paper hard. The longer he\u2019s silent, the less certain I feel. Obviously he\u2019s angry ... but might he not be a bit impressed too? Might he say this is the kind of risk-taking chutzpah we need in retail? Might he say that this reminds him of the kind of crazy stunt he pulled when he was just starting out and how would I like to be his special prot\u00e9g\u00e9e? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 He finally raises his head and my heart lifts with hope.

Is that why you made the eleven o\u2019clock appointment?\u2019</p><p>He sounds so reasonable, I relax. \u2018Actually, no. There was something else I wanted to discuss.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s another silence between us. Would this be a good time to bring up the raise, I suddenly wonder? I mean yes, he\u2019s cross about the leaflet, but that won\u2019t affect my long-term prospects, surely? Especially not if I\u2019m going to be his special prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.</p><p>Right. I\u2019ll do it.</p> <p>Except I won\u2019t ask for fifteen. I\u2019ll ask for ten.</p><p>No, twelve.</p><p>I take a deep breath and clench my fists by my sides.</p><p>\u2018Trevor, I\u2019ve assessed the market rate, and I calculate that a personal shopper of my calibre\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 He cuts across as though he didn\u2019t even hear me. \u2018This so-called initiative of yours was unapproved, inappropriate and dishonest.\u2019</p> <p>He sounds so cold and distant I feel a jolt of alarm. OK, forget the raise for now. I\u2019ll just go for the Employee of the Year money instead. I mean, he can\u2019t take that away from me, however cross he is, surely?</p><p>\u2018Um, Trevor, you know how you said I was going to be Employee of the Year?\u2019 I try again hurriedly. \u2018Well, I was just wondering ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Employee of the Year? Are you joking?\u2019 His voice has such a steely edge I step back nervously.</p><p>I suddenly notice how tight his lips have gone. Oh God, I was wrong. He is angry. In that horrible, quiet, scary way. My hands suddenly feel a bit clammy.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve behaved in a way that is to the detriment of The Look.\u2019 His voice is inexorable. \u2018You\u2019ve deceived myself and the other managers. You\u2019ve contravened every good practice and protocol of this organization and caused a fracas in front of customers. This is a serious breach of professional conduct. Not to mention embarrassing the entire store in front of Doug Raynor, a major celebrity. Do you think he\u2019ll ever come and shop here again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know I should have got permission first,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018And I\u2019m very sorry. But that\u2019s why my sales are up! Because of Shop in Private! All my customers love it. I mean, they even wrote you letters saying how much they love it. The whole place is buzzy, everyone\u2019s happy, everyone\u2019s buying stuff ...\u2019</p> <p>Trevor\u2019s not listening to a word.</p><p>\u2018Becky, I\u2019m afraid that as from this moment, you\u2019re suspended until further notice.\u2019 He looks at me as though I\u2019m some lowly worm. \u2018Take your things, please, and go.\u2019</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>As I sit on the Tube, I\u2019m numb with shock. Two weeks ago I was the star. I was going to be invited on to the board. I was being presented with flowers.</p><p>And now I\u2019m suspended in disgrace.</p><p>They\u2019re going to do an internal investigation. They\u2019re going to treat the matter \u2018very seriously\u2019. Jasmine looked absolutely stunned as I gathered my stuff together, but Trevor was standing right there, so she couldn\u2019t say anything other than \u2018Call me!\u2019 which she muttered just as I was going.</p><p>And then Trevor escorted me right to the staff door, as though I might try to nick stuff or something. I\u2019ve never felt so humiliated in my whole, entire life.</p><p>Actually, on second thoughts, maybe I have. But this is definitely equal with all those other times.</p> <p>No Employee of the Year money. No raise. Maybe no job at all. What am I going to do? How am I going to pay for the party? I\u2019m trying to think it through calmly but my chest keeps going into spasms of fear.</p><p>Could we do without loos, maybe, and tell everyone to go before they come? Could I get Dad and Martin to be the bouncers? I don\u2019t mind doing a bit of valet-parking myself, if it comes to it. Oh God ...</p><p>When I catch sight of my own reflection in the Tube window, my eyes are all wide and stary. I look like a demented, crazy person. Maybe this is what happens. People decide to hold surprise parties and they end up cracking up under the strain and their whole life falls apart. Maybe surprise parties are a major cause of mental illness. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</p><p>I\u2019ve agreed to meet Janice and Minnie at Waterloo, and as I approach them I wince.

She\u2019s bought a whole cupboardful of toys, even though I begged her not to, and taught Minnie loads of new nursery rhymes. The only downside is, apparently she keeps making even more pointed remarks to Jess about grandchildren and sighing loudly as she puts Minnie\u2019s finger paintings up on the wall.</p><p>\u2018It was my pleasure! Any time. So ... have you heard from your mum?\u2019 she adds hesitantly.</p><p>\u2018No. Have you?\u2019</p><p>Janice nods. \u2018They\u2019re having a super time!

I don\u2019t know what the rules are, but if she didn\u2019t tell me about the mud wrap I guess the not-speaking must still be on.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019d better let you go ...\u2019 Janice hands me Minnie\u2019s mittens. \u2018I\u2019m off to a craft fair now, to start my Christmas shopping. Where are you and Minnie going?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Green Park,\u2019 I say after a pause. Which is kind of true. The Ritz is right by Green Park.</p><p>As we come out of the Tube at Piccadilly, grey clouds rush into the sky as though they\u2019ve just been waiting for their chance, and there\u2019s a sudden smattering of rain. I put up Minnie\u2019s hood and trudge on miserably. Of all the things to raise my spirits, the prospect of tea with Elinor is really not one.</p><p>She\u2019s waiting for us in the same grand suite as before, wearing an ice-blue day dress, and on the table are three new jigsaw puzzles.</p><p>\u2018Ladeeee!\u2019 Minnie\u2019s face instantly lights up and she rushes forward to give Elinor a hug. A flash of utter shock and discomposure passes across Elinor\u2019s face, and despite my mood I almost want to giggle.</p><p>\u2018Well, Minnie,\u2019 she says awkwardly, almost curtly. \u2018You\u2019d better sit down.\u2019</p><p>Minnie is still clinging to her and, very stiffly, Elinor pats her shoulder. I wonder if any small child has ever hugged her before.</p> <p>Well, Luke, I suppose. Before she left him. Just the thought of it makes my stomach ache.</p><p>The table is laid with a sumptuous tea, like last time, but I\u2019m too churned up to feel like eating. I just want to get through this ordeal and go.</p><p>\u2018Wait there, Minnie,\u2019 says Elinor, as Minnie scrambles up beside me on the sofa. \u2018I\u2019ve bought you a special cake.\u2019</p><p>She heads to a nearby bureau against the wall. As she turns, holding a silver tray with a dome on it, her cheeks have turned just the faintest tinge of pink, and ... is that half a minuscule smile? Is Elinor excited?</p><p>She places the dish on the table and lifts the silver dome.</p><p>Oh my sweet Lord. How much did that cost?</p><p>It\u2019s a heart-shaped cake, covered in perfect pink fondant icing, with pink truffles and glac\u00e9 cherries arranged symmetrically around the edge, and a name piped in immaculate icing in the centre: Minnie.</p><p>\u2018Do you see?\u2019 Elinor is gazing at Minnie for a reaction. \u2018Do you like it?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Cake!\u2019 says Minnie, her eyes lighting up greedily. \u2018Miiiine cake!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not just a cake,\u2019 says Elinor a little sharply. \u2018It\u2019s a cake with your name on it. Don\u2019t you see that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elinor, she can\u2019t read,\u2019 I explain gently. \u2018She\u2019s not old enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Elinor looks put out. \u2018I see.\u2019 She\u2019s just standing there, still holding the silver dome, and I can tell she\u2019s disappointed.</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s lovely,\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018Really thoughtful.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m genuinely touched by the trouble she\u2019s gone to, in fact I wish I could take a picture of it with my phone. But then how would I explain it to Luke?</p><p>Elinor cuts a slice and hands it to Minnie, who stuffs it into her mouth, smearing cream and crumbs everywhere. I hastily grab a couple of napkins and try to contain the mess \u2013 but to my surprise Elinor doesn\u2019t seem as uptight about it as I expected. She doesn\u2019t even flinch when a glac\u00e9 cherry rolls on to the immaculate Ritz carpet.</p><p>\u2018Now, I\u2019ve bought some new jigsaw puzzles,\u2019 she says, sipping her tea. \u2018This particular one of Notre Dame is an interesting one.\u2019</p><p>Notre Dame? For a two-year-old? Is she crazy? What\u2019s wrong with Maisy Mouse?</p><p>But amazingly, Minnie is listening, entranced, as Elinor informs her about the different shades of grey and the need to start at the edges. When Elinor tips the puzzle out, she watches with huge eyes, and only timidly reaches for pieces when Elinor tells her to. She keeps looking up at me as though inviting me to join in, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do some stupid puzzle. There\u2019s a line of tension running through me like a steel thread, getting tighter and tighter. What am I going to do? What am I going to do? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mobile suddenly rings and I practically leap off the sofa, I\u2019m so nervy.

What if it\u2019s Luke and he hears Elinor\u2019s voice?</p><p>But as I pull out my phone I see Bonnie\u2019s ID.</p><p>\u2018Elinor, excuse me a moment,\u2019 I say quickly, and head over to the other side of the massive sitting room. \u2018Hi Bonnie, what\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dear, I can\u2019t speak for long.\u2019 Bonnie sounds really flustered. \u2018But we\u2019ve had rather a set-back.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Set-back?\u2019 I feel a jolt. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>Please let it be something small. Please let it be that we\u2019ve got another nut-allergy person. I can\u2019t cope with anything else big ...</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware that Luke\u2019s been trying to set up a meeting with Christian Scott-Hughes? He\u2019s Sir Bernard Cross\u2019s\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018... right-hand man,\u2019 I join in. \u2018Yes, he won\u2019t stop talking about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, they\u2019ve set a date. The only date Christian can do. And it\u2019s 7 April.\u2019</p> <p>I feel a nasty little twinge. \u2018What time?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lunchtime.\u2019</p><p>I breathe out. \u2018Well, that should still be all right\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018In Paris.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Paris?\u2019 I stare at the phone in horror.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re planning to stay overnight. Luke\u2019s asked me to book flights and a hotel.\u2019</p> <p>No. No. I can\u2019t be hearing this.</p><p>\u2018He can\u2019t go to Paris! Tell him his diary\u2019s booked! Or phone Christian Scott-Hughes\u2019s office and tell them\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, you don\u2019t understand.\u2019 Bonnie sounds as hassled as I feel. \u2018Christian Scott-Hughes is a very busy man. Just to get this slot has been quite a coup. If we rearrange, it will be for several months\u2019 time. I simply can\u2019t do it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But what about that whole fake conference you set up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke\u2019s missing it. He says it\u2019s not important enough.\u2019</p><p>I stare blindly at a gilt-framed painting of a girl in a red hat. My mind is whirling. Luke can\u2019t go to Paris on the day of his party. It just can\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll just have to get him to reschedule,\u2019 I say desperately. \u2018Make up some reason. Anything!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve tried!\u2019 Bonnie sounds at the end of her tether. \u2018Believe me, I\u2019ve tried! I\u2019ve suggested that he really should be at the conference, I\u2019ve invented a lunch with his financial backers ... I\u2019ve even reminded him it\u2019s his birthday. He just laughed. He won\u2019t listen to anything I say. Becky ...\u2019 She exhales. \u2018I know you wanted to surprise him. But I think you\u2019re going to have to tell him the truth.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No!\u2019 I stare at the phone, aghast.</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s the only way ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dear, is the surprise really that important?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I cry out, suddenly near tears. \u2018It is!\u2019 I know she thinks I\u2019m crazy and irrational. And maybe I am. But I\u2019m not giving up now.</p><p>As I put down the phone I\u2019m trembling. It\u2019s as if the line of tension has been drawn up another 50 per cent, till I can hardly breathe. Barely knowing what I\u2019m doing I head back to the sofa, reach for a tiny sugared bun and stuff it into my mouth. Then another one. Maybe sugar will help me think.</p><p>How do I stop Luke going to Paris? Pinch his passport? Kidnap him? Find some brilliant, watertight excuse which will stop him going?</p><p>Suddenly I become aware that Elinor has stopped reaching for pieces of puzzle and her chilly eye is resting on me. If she tells me my shoe is scuffed I will honestly throw this bun at her.</p><p>\u2018Rebecca, are you quite well? Have you had a shock?\u2019</p><p>I automatically open my mouth to say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u2019 But suddenly ... I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m not strong enough to keep up the happy fa\u00e7ade. Not to someone who doesn\u2019t even count.</p><p>\u2018To be honest, I\u2019ve been better.\u2019 With a shaky hand I pour myself a cup of tea and stir three sugars into it, slopping some over the edge.</p><p>\u2018Would you like a brandy? Or a stiff cocktail?\u2019</p><p>I eye her a bit suspiciously. Elinor\u2019s offering me a cocktail? Is she making a dig?</p><p>No. Her face is humourless. I think she means it. And you know what? It\u2019s the most welcome suggestion anyone has made to me for a long time.</p><p>\u2018Yes please,\u2019 I say after a pause. \u2018I\u2019d love a stiff cocktail.\u2019</p><p>Elinor passes me the room-service list and I order an apple martini, and after about a nano-second it appears. I sip it gratefully and the alcohol hits my bloodstream and at once I feel a bit better. Once I\u2019m halfway down I stop trembling. God, I could do with about three of these. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elinor is still calmly putting jigsaw pieces together as though nothing\u2019s wrong, but after a while she looks up dispassionately and says, \u2018Have you heard some bad news?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Kind of.\u2019 I take another sip of apple martini. There\u2019s something about sitting in this room which is mesmerizing. It feels totally detached from the real world, as if we\u2019re in a bubble. No one even knows I\u2019m here. It\u2019s like none of it really exists.</p><p>And suddenly I have an overwhelming urge to spill. I mean, if I tell Elinor, who can she blab to? No one.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been organizing this party for Luke for his birthday.\u2019 I stir my apple martini. \u2018A big surprise party. It\u2019s in two weeks.\u2019</p> <p>Elinor doesn\u2019t flicker, even though it can\u2019t be easy to hear that your only son is having a surprise party and you don\u2019t even know about it, let alone have an invitation.</p><p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t invite you,\u2019 I add bluntly. \u2018You know I couldn\u2019t.\u2019 Even if I wanted to, I don\u2019t add.</p><p>Elinor moves her head about a millimetre without replying, and I press on.</p><p>\u2018There were already loads of glitches.\u2019 I rub my face. \u2018I mean, I was already pretty stressed out. But now I\u2019ve just heard that Luke\u2019s arranged a meeting with this guy Christian Scott-Hughes on the same day as the party, in Paris. And we can\u2019t get him to change it. He\u2019s been wanting to meet Christian Scott-Hughes for ages. His assistant doesn\u2019t know what to do and nor do I. Either I pinch his passport and he\u2019s totally livid, or we move the whole party to Paris somehow, or I just give in and tell him the truth ...\u2019</p><p>I trail off miserably. I so, so, so don\u2019t want to tell Luke. But I have a horrible feeling that\u2019s what it might come to.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve kept it a secret all this time.\u2019 I nibble on the slice of martini-infused apple. \u2018Luke has no idea what I\u2019m up to. I can\u2019t bear to spoil it. But what else am I going to do?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and a waiter silently comes in with another apple martini. He takes my empty glass, replaces it with the full one and glides out again.</p><p>I gape stupidly. Does that always happen here? Or is it just Elinor?</p><p>\u2018Do you mean Christian Scott-Hughes who works for Sir Bernard Cross?\u2019 enquires Elinor, who has made no comment on the second apple martini.</p><p>\u2018Exactly. Luke\u2019s desperate to make contact with Bernard Cross for some environmental client.\u2019</p><p>I take a sip of my new cocktail, which is just as delicious as the first, then glance up to see if I\u2019m going to get any sympathy from Elinor. If this was anyone normal, they\u2019d already be going \u2018You poor thing!\u2019 or even giving me a hug. But her face is as rigid and distant as ever.</p> <p>\u2018I know Bernard,\u2019 she says eventually. \u2018We met at St Tropez on his yacht. A charming man.\u2019</p><p>Great. Just typical. Here I am, sharing my problems, and all she can do is boast about her superior social connections. And by the way, does Elinor even know what the word \u2018charming\u2019 means? Maybe she\u2019s mixed it up with \u2018rich\u2019. That would explain a lot.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure you do know him,\u2019 I say shortly. \u2018Well done.\u2019 I know I\u2019m being rude, but I don\u2019t care. Does she think I care whose stupid yacht she\u2019s been on? I fish out the slice of apple from the second martini and stuff it in my mouth, but not before Minnie has spotted it.</p><p>\u2018Apple! Miiiine apple!\u2019 She tries to reach inside my mouth and get it back out.</p><p>\u2018No, Minnie,\u2019 I manage to say, and remove her wriggling fingers from my mouth. \u2018Not your apple. It was a grown-up apple and it\u2019s all gone now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mine juice!\u2019 Now she focuses on the cocktail. \u2018Miiiine juice\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I could speak to Bernard.\u2019 Elinor\u2019s calm voice hits my ears. \u2018I could explain the situation and arrange to have the meeting changed. Luke would never know who had been behind it.\u2019</p><p>Startled, I meet Elinor\u2019s eyes. She looks so detached I can barely believe I heard her right. Is she actually offering to help me? Could she fix my problem, just like that?</p> <p>Something is sparking in my stomach. It feels a bit like hope.</p><p>But already I know I have to damp it down somehow. I can\u2019t let myself even think about it. Let alone hope, let alone ... I mean, this is Elinor. Elinor. Luke would kill me if he even knew Minnie and I were here, let alone giving away information about his business, let alone inviting offers of help ...</p><p>\u2018No. You can\u2019t help. I\u2019m sorry, but you just can\u2019t. If Luke ever found out I was even talking to you ...\u2019 A familiar anxiety is washing over me and I get to my feet, dumping my cocktail on the table. \u2018I\u2019ve already stayed too long. We should go. Minnie, say \u201cBye-bye, Lady\u201d\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Lad-eeee!\u2019 Minnie flings herself at Elinor\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u2018So what will you do?\u2019</p><p>She frowns with a kind of dispassionate interest, as though I\u2019m one of her jigsaw puzzles and she wants to see how it comes out.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say hopelessly. \u2018I\u2019ll just have to think of something.\u2019</p> <p>As I get back the house is empty and silent and there\u2019s a note on the table in Janice\u2019s handwriting. Nanny Sue\u2019s assistant rang. Please call to arrange meeting regarding Minnie.</p><p>In a reflex action I crumple the note up and throw it in the bin, then make myself a cup of tea, trying to keep my spirits up. Come on, Becky. Think positive. I can\u2019t let my problems get me down. I\u2019ll just have to come up with a solution.</p><p>But even though I load my cup with sugar and sit down with a pencil and paper, no solution comes to my mind. I feel blank and empty and defeated. I\u2019m just wondering whether I could mix myself another comforting cocktail when the doorbell rings. In surprise I head to the hall and open the door to see a grizzled old guy in overalls standing on the doorstep. His hands are filthy and he has about three teeth and there\u2019s a van pulled up behind him in the drive.</p><p>\u2018Marquee?\u2019 he says without preamble.</p><p>For a moment I just stare at him uncertainly.</p> <p>\u2018Love?\u2019 He waves a hand in front of my face. \u2018You want a marquee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I come to. \u2018Yes please!\u2019</p><p>Finally, some good news. This is a sign! Everything is going to turn around for the better. Already, the thought of a marquee billowing in Janice\u2019s garden is making me excited.</p><p>\u2018So, are you from Cliff\u2019s company?\u2019 I say as he undoes the back of the van.</p><p>\u2018Sends his apologies. Most of the lads were called away to an emergency job in Somerset. It\u2019s manic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought everything was really quiet,\u2019 I say in surprise.</p> <p>\u2018We had cancellations.\u2019 He nods. \u2018Then people change their minds, don\u2019t they? Lot of it about. Most of our tents have gone down to the West Country, but Cliff said you could have this.\u2019</p><p>He briskly unloads a pile of white tarpaulin on to the drive, and I eye it a bit uncertainly. It\u2019s not quite as big as I was expecting.</p><p>\u2018Is that a marquee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Gazebo, innit? Got a bit of damp on one side, but give it a go with some bleach, it\u2019ll scrub up.\u2019 He\u2019s already back in his cab and switching on the engine. \u2018Cheers, love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I call out. \u2018Where do I return it?\u2019</p><p>A look of amusement passes over the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u2018Nah, you\u2019re all right. We don\u2019t need that one back.\u2019</p><p>The van disappears out of the drive and I take a tentative step towards the pile of white tarpaulin. Maybe it\u2019s bigger than it looks.</p> <p>\u2018Blanket!\u2019 Minnie rushes out of the house behind me, leaps on to the tarpaulin and starts jumping up and down.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not a blanket! It\u2019s a ... a tent. Get off, sweetheart. Let\u2019s look at it.\u2019</p><p>Gingerly I lift up one of the layers and feel a pang of dismay. Underneath, it\u2019s green with mould. I lift up another panel \u2013and there\u2019s a massive flapping rip in it.</p><p>I feel a bit light-headed. This was the one bit of the party that was supposed to be sorted. It\u2019ll take me hours to clean this and try to mend the rip.</p><p>And it\u2019s not even a proper marquee. It\u2019s tiny. How am I supposed to hold a party for two hundred in this?</p><p>My whole body is pulsing with compressed panic. But I don\u2019t have any options. It\u2019s this or nothing.</p><p>\u2018Right!\u2019 I say as brightly as I can to Minnie. \u2018Well ... Mummy needs to clean this, doesn\u2019t she? Don\u2019t touch!\u2019 I whip her hand away from the green mould.</p><p>\u2018Jelleeee!\u2019 she wails crossly. \u2018Miiine!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not jelly! It\u2019s yucky!\u2019</p><p>I find rubber gloves, bleach and a washing-up brush under the sink, and after I\u2019ve parked Minnie safely in front of the TV, I start scrubbing. I thought the bleach would cut straight through the green grime like in the telly ads. But it doesn\u2019t. The mould is stuck to the tarpaulin and caked over with mud in some places. It must have been there for years. It takes me ten minutes\u2019 solid scrubbing to remove about six square inches of crust, and then I sit back on my heels, exhausted.</p><p>I can\u2019t clean this whole thing.</p><p>But I have to. I can\u2019t afford anything else.</p><p>I scrub for another ten minutes, then dunk my brush in the bowl of water and bleach, which is now black with dirt. My back\u2019s aching. My head\u2019s throbbing. As I push my hair off my hot face, I feel hollow with fear. For the first time, the worst-case-scenario, no-more-delusions reality of my situation is hitting me. Why did I think I could throw a massive grown-up party, all on my own? It\u2019s too big. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want to cry.</p><p>No. I\u2019m not going to cry.</p><p>Almost without meaning to, I find myself slowly reaching into my pocket and pulling out my phone.

One of them was!\u2019 Her voice rises indignantly. \u2018He said he did think it all looked rather odd, but he thought it must be the latest thing in fashion and he didn\u2019t want to interfere. I\u2019m telling you, Bex, I\u2019m becoming Tarkie\u2019s manager. Have you heard from Danny?\u2019 she adds. \u2018Because I keep calling him, and he won\u2019t return my calls.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, he won\u2019t answer my calls either.\u2019 I hear a sudden screaming in the background and a faint banging sound.</p> <p>\u2018Wilfie! Stop that! Bex, I\u2019d better go. How are you, anyway?\u2019</p><p>She hasn\u2019t even mentioned it.</p><p>And suddenly I feel a stab of humiliation. I can\u2019t tell her.

Do you want a cup of tea or anything?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Tom and I are in Staffordshire,\u2019 she says, her voice sounding distant. \u2018I\u2019ve come to do some research at the museum here. I couldn\u2019t bear Janice a minute longer. You won\u2019t believe her latest stunt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She stole our contraception! Took it! She denies it, but I know she did. Why else would our condoms have been in her bedroom drawer? I said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they\u2019re yours, Janice, because I won\u2019t believe you.\u201d I mean she\u2019s probably never even heard of Fair Trade ethical condoms, let alone bought them. We had a massive row. Martin went and hid in the tree house, he was so embarrassed.\u2019</p><p>Despite everything I can\u2019t help a half-giggle as I try to imagine Jess and Janice having a stand-up row about condoms.</p><p>\u2018So we had to get out of there for a few days,\u2019 Jess is continuing. \u2018Becky, I can\u2019t stand her. What am I going to do?\u2019 Her voice dips away.</p><p>\u2018Jess? Are you there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry! Listen, my phone\u2019s running out. Can I call you back later?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure!\u2019 I try to sound light-hearted. \u2018Give my love to Tom!\u2019</p> <p>As the light in my phone dies away the drive seems darker than ever.</p><p>My head droops down on to my knees. I feel exhausted. All my last remaining energy has been sapped away by those two calls. I\u2019ve got nothing left. I\u2019ve got no hope, no plans, no answers. I don\u2019t know why I thought I could throw a party. I must have been crazy.</p><p>A tear suddenly rolls down the side of my nose, followed by another. I\u2019m going to have to admit defeat. I\u2019m going to have to cancel the party. I can\u2019t see any other way. It\u2019s just too overwhelmingly massive. There\u2019s no way I can pull it off.</p><p>I give a huge sob and bury my face in my hands. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m giving up. But what else can I do?</p><p>I\u2019ll call Bonnie and ask her to email all the guests. We\u2019ll make up some excuse. Luke can go to Paris. He\u2019ll never even know what I was planning. Life will just carry on. It\u2019s the easiest solution. It\u2019s the only solution.</p><p>\u2018Rebecca?\u2019 My head jerks up and I blink at the tall, shadowy figure standing in front of me.</p><p>\u2018Elinor?\u2019 I feel a sudden choking panic. \u2018What are you doing here? You can\u2019t come here! This is where I live! What if Luke saw you, or my parents\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke isn\u2019t here,\u2019 replies Elinor calmly. She\u2019s wearing the dove-grey Chanel coat which I sold her at The Look, belted tightly around her waist. \u2018No one is here except you and Minnie. My driver ascertained these facts before I approached.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her driver?

I believe you rejected it too hastily, for reasons which I can only surmise. However, it seems to me that you need a personal contact with Sir Bernard Cross. I can ask him to rearrange Luke\u2019s meeting and I\u2019m sure he will do so.\u2019 She hesitates. \u2018If you would like me to do this, then please let me know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks,\u2019 I say dully. \u2018But there\u2019s no point now. I\u2019m cancelling the party.\u2019</p><p>For the first time Elinor looks at me directly, and I can see the flash of surprise in her eyes.</p> <p>\u2018Cancelling? Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 A fresh tear runs down my nose. \u2018It\u2019s all a disaster. I bartered for this marquee, but it\u2019s all mouldy and I\u2019ll never clean it in time, and it\u2019s not even big enough. And then I ran out of money, so I was going to ask for a raise, but I got suspended from work, and Luke\u2019s going to Paris anyway ...\u2019 I wipe my eyes. \u2018What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the point even trying any more?\u2019</p><p>Elinor is running her gaze coldly over the marquee.</p><p>\u2018Do you have no one to help you with this endeavour? Your friend Susan, perhaps?\u2019</p><p>God, I had no idea she even knew Suze\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u2018I kind of ...\u2019 I break off and flush. \u2018I told all my friends I didn\u2019t want their help.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s really getting dark now and I can barely see Elinor. I\u2019m just psyching myself to ask if she would like a cup of tea, hoping she\u2019ll say no, when she speaks again, sounding even more stiff and awkward than usual.</p><p>\u2018I have remembered the conversation we had and considered it often over the past few weeks. You are a perceptive young woman, Rebecca. I have never given anything to Luke outright. There have always been ... expectations attached. Now I would like to give him something. Unconditionally. And that is why I should like to help you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elinor ...\u2019 I wince. \u2018It\u2019s kind of you. It really is. But like I said, there\u2019s no point. Even if Luke doesn\u2019t go to Paris, I can\u2019t put this party together in time.\u2019 I lift up a mouldy flap of marquee and let it drop. \u2018You expect me to entertain two hundred people in this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019re simply giving up?\u2019</p><p>I feel stung by her tone. What does she care? It\u2019s not her party. She\u2019s not even invited.</p> <p>\u2018I suppose so.\u2019 I shrug. \u2018Yes. I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I find this disturbing.\u2019 She eyes me stonily. \u2018I have never known you give up on any project before. You have been misguided, yes. Unpolished, yes. Impulsive, yes. Foolish, yes.\u2019</p><p>Is she trying to make me feel better?</p><p>\u2018OK, thanks,\u2019 I interrupt. \u2018I get the picture.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you have always been tenacious,\u2019 continues Elinor as though I haven\u2019t spoken. \u2018You have always refused to give in, whatever factors are mounting against you. It is one of the things I\u2019ve always admired about you.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s always admired me? Now I\u2019ve heard it all.</p><p>\u2018Well, maybe this one is just too big, OK?\u2019 I say wearily. \u2018Maybe I\u2019m not Superwoman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If the will is there, anything is achievable with enough resources.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, well that\u2019s the whole point!\u2019 I erupt in frustration. \u2018Don\u2019t you understand? I\u2019ve been suspended from work! My credit cards are all used up! I don\u2019t have any bloody\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have resources.\u2019 Elinor cuts me off.</p><p>I stare at her uncertainly for a few moments. Is she saying ... She can\u2019t be ...</p><p>\u2018I have resources,\u2019 she repeats. \u2018We could ... do it together.\u2019</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Together? Is she trying to come on board as joint hostess?</p><p>\u2018Elinor ...\u2019 The idea is so preposterous I almost want to laugh. \u2018You can\u2019t be serious. Luke would ... He\u2019d be ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke would not know. Luke would never know.\u2019 She sounds so resolute, I stare at her, taken aback. She really means this, doesn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u2018Mummy!\u2019 Minnie comes rocketing out of the house, then stops dead in astonishment. \u2018Ladeee!\u2019 She throws herself on Elinor with delight.</p><p>\u2018Elinor ...\u2019 I rub my forehead. \u2018You can\u2019t just ... Do you know how bad things are? Do you know how Luke would react if\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do know. This is why I am asking you for this chance.\u2019 Her face is as stony as ever, but suddenly I notice the tiny quivering by her eye that I noticed before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unless it\u2019s just the dusky light.</p><p>\u2018It is impossible for me to give anything to Luke.\u2019 Her voice is entirely without self-pity. \u2018He has cut me out of his life. He mistrusts me. Any gift I attempted to make would be met with short shrift. If you say yes to my offer, then you are giving me the opportunity to make Luke an unconditional gift. Perhaps even to make my own reparation.\u2019 Elinor pauses. \u2018The kind of gift ... that his real mother would have made him.\u2019</p><p>What? Did she just call Annabel his real mother?</p><p>I swallow, several times. This is all getting too heavy. I\u2019m not sure I can cope. It was easier when Elinor was just the big bad witch that we never saw.</p> <p>\u2018If you refuse my offer,\u2019 she adds, as matter-of-fact as ever, \u2018then you are denying me this privilege.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Puzzle?\u2019 Minnie is tugging hopefully at Elinor\u2019s bag. \u2018Puzzle?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Here you are, Minnie.\u2019 Elinor reaches into her bag, pulls out one of the puzzles that she had earlier in the Ritz, and presents it to Minnie. Then she looks directly at me. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>My mind is shooting back and forth helplessly like a pinball. I can\u2019t ... I mustn\u2019t ... I could ...</p><p>Luke would never know ...</p> <p>No, I can\u2019t ...</p><p>But we wouldn\u2019t have to cancel ... Luke would get his party ...</p><p>\u2018Perhaps you need time to think about it,\u2019 says Elinor, and I look up, focusing on her as though for the first time. Standing there, holding her expensive bag with two gloved hands, her hair gusting a little in the wind, she looks pale and old and shadowy. And almost ... humble.</p><p>This is maybe the most mindblowing thing of all. Elinor Sherman, grandest, snootiest woman in the world, for once hasn\u2019t told me or bossed me or lectured me. She\u2019s asked. And now she\u2019s waiting meekly for an answer.</p><p>Or at least as meekly as you can when you\u2019re dressed head-to-toe in Chanel with your driver waiting.</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 I say slowly, and give her a sudden grin. \u2018OK, Elinor. You\u2019re on.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Elinor hesitates. \u2018Rebecca, I wish to say something else. I know you have been determined to throw this party yourself. I know you take pride in being independent. But you must not underestimate the pleasure it will give others to do something for Luke, in whichever way is appropriate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My friend Suze said something like that to me, too,\u2019 I say slowly. \u2018She wanted to help but I wouldn\u2019t let her.\u2019</p><p>I wince as I remember Suze\u2019s hurt voice, saying, \u2018It\u2019s not always about you, OK? It\u2019s not because we think you can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s because Luke isn\u2019t just your husband, he\u2019s our friend too, and we wanted to do something nice for him.\u2019</p><p>She really wanted to get involved. And I was too proud to let her. Even now, I haven\u2019t actually asked, have I? I\u2019ve waited for her to volunteer. Well, no wonder she hasn\u2019t.</p><p>I suddenly feel like the biggest cow there ever was.</p><p>\u2018Elinor, excuse me a minute ...\u2019 I take a few steps away, pulling out my phone, and speed-dial Suze again.</p><p>\u2018Bex?\u2019 She sounds surprised. \u2018Are you OK?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Listen, Suze,\u2019 I say in a trembling rush. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I wish I\u2019d asked you to help with the party all along. I love your idea about the special shortbread. Luke would be so touched. And I was just going to say ...\u2019 I swallow hard. \u2018Is it too late? Would you help?\u2019</p> <p>There\u2019s a still, beating silence for a moment, then Suze says, \u2018Be honest, Bex. Have you got yourself in a totally shit mess?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I give a half-laugh, half-sob. \u2018I have.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then Tarkie owes me a fiver,\u2019 she says with satisfaction. \u2018OK.

There are only three days to go. I can\u2019t quite believe it. And finally, finally, everything is on track.</p><p>Elinor has the most amazing contacts in the world. She can just make things happen. She points her bony finger and it\u2019s instantly done. At least, she points her bony finger at an assistant, and he gets it instantly done.</p><p>So she\u2019s not exactly a riot. We don\u2019t exactly high-five each other when we get a result. And she doesn\u2019t seem to understand the function of chocolate, let alone want to share the odd KitKat. But the plus points are:</p> <p>1.She wants Luke\u2019s party to be fabulous.</p><p>2.She\u2019s thrown a million smart parties before.</p><p>3.She has loads and loads and loads of money.</p><p>I mean, money\u2019s just not an issue any more. Even Suze has been quite wide-eyed at the way Elinor doles it out without a flicker. Jess, of course, can\u2019t cope. Jess puts her hands over her ears and says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to know.\u2019 And then she takes them off again and lectures Elinor on sustainability and responsible sourcing. To my amazement, Elinor always listens gravely \u2013 and a few times she\u2019s even agreed to Jess\u2019s suggestions. (Although not the one about knitting woolly hats out of recycled yarn which we hand out to guests, so we won\u2019t need heaters. Thank God.)</p><p>Honestly, the party\u2019s going to be just ...</p> <p>I mean, it\u2019ll be the most ...</p><p>No. I won\u2019t say anything more. I don\u2019t want to jinx it.</p><p>It\u2019s even been quite fun, the five of us having our top-secret meetings. (Me, Suze, Jess, Bonnie and Elinor.) Elinor always leaves first and the rest of us wait breathlessly till she\u2019s out of earshot, then erupt with hysteria at something she said or did. I mean, she\u2019s still totally ice-queen most of the time. But even so, she\u2019s almost starting to feel \u2013 in a weird way \u2013 like one of the gang.</p><p>Luke has no idea. None. He still thinks I\u2019m at work two and a half days a week and I haven\u2019t put him right.</p><p>The only unresolved issue is the meeting with Christian Scott-Hughes. Bernard Cross has been at some retreat in Sweden and uncontactable. But he\u2019s back today. Elinor has stated she\u2019s going to get on the phone to him this morning and won\u2019t take no for an answer. And I believe her.</p><p>So the biggest challenge left is keeping the party secret from Luke until Friday. But we\u2019ve got this far; we can make it to Friday, surely. Today, Bonnie\u2019s finally revealing to Luke\u2019s entire staff that there isn\u2019t a conference, it\u2019s a surprise party instead. There\u2019s bound to be a big buzz, and we decided I should keep Luke out of the office on some pretext. So we\u2019re going to see a possible school for Minnie this morning. (I told Luke we\u2019d already left it really late, and he had to come too because otherwise they\u2019d think we weren\u2019t committed parents and no, I couldn\u2019t just tell him about it later.)</p> <p>\u2018Ready?\u2019 Luke hurries down the stairs, looking immaculate in a navy suit and his really expensive cashmere coat from Milan.</p><p>\u2018Yes, ready.\u2019 I finish doing my lipstick and survey myself in the hall mirror. The school we\u2019re going to see today has a red and navy uniform, so I\u2019m wearing red and navy too, to show how keen we are. (I nearly bought the crested hat off the website, but then I thought that was going a bit far.)</p><p>\u2018Nanny Sue just called,\u2019 Luke adds. \u2018She\u2019s coming at six o\u2019clock.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 I say after a pause. There\u2019s no point trying to argue Luke out of Nanny Sue. I\u2019ve already tried.</p><p>\u2018Good luck at the school!\u2019 says Janice, who has come over to look after Minnie. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about us, we\u2019ll be fine, just the two of us!\u2019 I glance over and she gives me the tiniest of winks.</p><p>I\u2019ve already exchanged about ten secret texts with Janice since breakfast. The marquee guys are coming over to prepare her garden this morning, but neither of us mentions that, obviously.</p><p>As I\u2019m heading out of the door, Janice pulls me back with an urgent whisper.</p><p>\u2018Love, I heard from your mother yesterday.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, really?\u2019</p><p>The estate agents are having a nightmare finding us a rental place, so Mum and Dad are still living it up in the The West Place, having mud wraps and champagne cocktails every day, I expect.</p><p>\u2018She told me she\u2019s not invited to the party.\u2019 Janice peers at me anxiously. \u2018That can\u2019t be true, Becky, love?\u2019</p><p>That is so Mum. Trying to get everyone on her side. And anyway, it\u2019s not true. She\u2019s had an invitation.</p><p>\u2018Why does she want to come, anyway?\u2019 I know I sound sulky but I can\u2019t help it. \u2018She said it would be a fiasco.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018But Becky, it\u2019s going to be a wonderful party.\u2019 Janice looks all flustered. \u2018You can\u2019t let her miss it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She can come if she wants. She knows where I am.\u2019</p><p>My phone bleeps with a text and I pull it out.</p><p>I have secured a brief interview with Bernard today. I will keep you informed. Kind regards. Elinor.</p> <p>Elinor has to be the only person in the world who writes \u2018kind regards\u2019 on text messages. Mind you, \u2018kind regards\u2019 is a lot better than \u2018I remain disapprovingly yours\u2019, which is how she once ended a letter to me.</p><p>Thx! I text back. Look forward to hearing!</p><p>I head out into the drive \u2013 and it takes me a moment to notice what Luke is doing. He\u2019s unlocking the garage. Shit. Shit! Where did he get the key from? I hid it, precisely so he wouldn\u2019t open it and find the manky marquee, plus 132 plastic-bag pom-poms. (Which I am not disposing of, whatever Elinor says. I made them for the party and they took me hours and they\u2019re bloody well going in the party.)</p><p>\u2018Nooooo!\u2019 Somehow I make it across the drive in order to dive between him and the garage door. \u2018Don\u2019t! I mean ... what do you need? I\u2019ll get it. You start the engine. Get the car warmed up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky!\u2019 Luke looks astonished. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You ... don\u2019t want to get your nice coat dirty!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you don\u2019t want to get your coat dirty,\u2019 he points out reasonably. \u2018I\u2019m only after the road map. My bloody sat nav is on the blink.\u2019 He reaches for the handle again but I block his way.</p><p>\u2018We can buy one on the way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Buy one?\u2019 He peers at me. \u2018Why would we do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can always do with an extra road map.\u2019 My hand is clamped on the garage door handle. \u2018It\u2019ll be fun. We can choose it together!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But we\u2019ve already got one,\u2019 he says patiently. \u2018If you just let me into the garage\u2014\u2019</p> <p>OK, I need extreme measures.</p><p>\u2018Do you know how desperate I am to buy something?\u2019 I cry dramatically, my voice throbbing like a Shakespearean actress. \u2018You won\u2019t let me buy any clothes. Now you won\u2019t let me buy a road map, either! I need to spend some money or I\u2019m going to go crazy!\u2019</p><p>I break off, panting. Luke looks so freaked out, I almost feel sorry for him.</p><p>\u2018OK, Becky. Fine.\u2019 He backs away, shooting me wary little looks. \u2018We can stop at a service station. No problem.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 I fan myself as though overcome by emotion. \u2018Thank you for understanding. So, where did you get the garage key?\u2019 I add casually. \u2018I thought it was lost.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was the damnedest thing.\u2019 Luke shakes his head. \u2018I was looking for it, and I said aloud, \u201cWhere is that key?\u201d and Minnie led me to it at once. She must have hidden it herself!\u2019</p><p>Honestly. That\u2019s the last time I include Minnie in any of the preparations. She\u2019s a total blab.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll never guess where it was,\u2019 Luke adds as he starts the car. \u2018Inside your make-up bag. Can you believe it?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Incredible!\u2019 I try to muster an astonished voice. \u2018What a little monkey!\u2019</p><p>\u2018By the way, do you want to come to Paris with me on Friday?\u2019 Luke adds casually as he reverses.</p><p>I\u2019m so thrown I can\u2019t answer. I gaze blankly back at him, my mind skittering. What do I say? What would be the natural reaction?</p><p>\u2018Paris?\u2019 I manage at last. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to Paris for this meeting, remember? Just thought you and Minnie might like to come along. We could make a weekend of it. You know it\u2019s my birthday?\u2019</p><p>The word \u2018birthday\u2019 is like a hand grenade going off in the car. What do I say? Do I pretend I\u2019ve forgotten? Do I pretend I didn\u2019t hear him?</p><p>No. Act normal, Becky. Act normal.</p><p>\u2018Um ... is it?\u2019 I swallow. \u2018Wow, of course it\u2019s your birthday! Well, that sounds lovely.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll have to spend Friday night with my clients, I\u2019m afraid, but at least it should be a celebration. I mean, once we\u2019ve seen Christian, we\u2019re well on the way to meeting with Sir Bernard himself!\u2019 Luke sounds ebullient. \u2018I\u2019ll get Bonnie to make the arrangements. So that\u2019s agreed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fab!\u2019 I smile weakly. \u2018I just need to text Suze about something ...\u2019</p><p>I reach for my phone and quickly text Bonnie:</p><p>Luke wants to take us to Paris on Friday! Do NOT book tickets!!</p><p>Honestly, I\u2019m going to crack up at this rate. No I\u2019m not. It\u2019s fine. Elinor\u2019s on the case. Deep breaths. Only three days to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hardy House School is a much nicer school than St Cuthbert\u2019s, I instantly decide. For a start, the secretary who greets us has a really cool Pippa Small necklace on. And there aren\u2019t any pupils called Eloise. (I asked.) And they make their own homemade biscuits.</p><p>As we sip our coffee and eat the biscuits, we have a view out to the playground, which is surrounded by horse chestnuts. I watch all the little girls running round and skipping, and feel a sudden pang of longing. I can just see Minnie joining in with all of them. It would be perfect.</p><p>\u2018D\u2019you think Minnie\u2019ll get a place?\u2019 I turn anxiously to Luke.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure she will.\u2019 He looks up from his BlackBerry. \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t she?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Because it\u2019s really oversubscribed!\u2019</p><p>I glance again at the sheet of paper I\u2019ve been given entitled \u2018Our Entry Procedure\u2019. There are six stages to it, starting with filling out a form, and ending with \u2018Final Assessment Tea Party\u2019. Suddenly I can see why everyone gets stressed out by schools. I\u2019m already terrified. What if Minnie grabs all the cakes and yells \u2018Miiiine\u2019? They\u2019ll never give her a place.</p><p>\u2018Luke, stop looking at your BlackBerry!\u2019 I hiss. \u2018We have to make a good impression!\u2019 I pick up a leaflet on attainment grades and start flipping through it, just as the door opens and the secretary appears again.</p><p>\u2018Mr and Mrs Brandon? Come this way, please.\u2019 She ushers us along a short passage smelling of beeswax. \u2018Here\u2019s the headmistress\u2019s office,\u2019 she says, leading us straight into a panelled room with a mahogany desk and green upholstered chairs. \u2018Our current head, Mrs Bell, is leaving at the end of term, and the prospective head is with us for a few days, so we thought it would make more sense for you to see her. She\u2019ll be along in just a moment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 says Luke charmingly. \u2018And may I compliment the school on your delicious home-made biscuits?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Thank you!\u2019 She smiles. \u2018I\u2019ll be back presently with the new head. Her name is Mrs Grayson,\u2019 she adds as she exits. \u2018Harriet Grayson.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There,\u2019 murmurs Luke. \u2018We\u2019re making a perfect impression.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t reply. In fact, I\u2019ve frozen. Don\u2019t I know that name?</p><p>OK. This could be bad. I need to get out of here, or warn Luke, or\u2014</p><p>But the door is already swinging open again \u2013 and it\u2019s her. It\u2019s Harriet Grayson, MA, dressed in the same knitted suit. She comes forward with a professional smile \u2013 then recognition flashes across her face.</p><p>\u2018Professor Bloomwood!\u2019 she says in astonishment. \u2018It is Professor Bloomwood, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p> <p>There is no way out of this. None.</p><p>\u2018Um ... yes!\u2019 I say at last, blood flooding my face. \u2018Hi!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what a surprise!\u2019 She beams at Luke. \u2018Professor Bloomwood and I have met before. Brandon must be your married name?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s ... that\u2019s right.\u2019 I gulp.</p><p>I risk a tiny glance at Luke, then wish I hadn\u2019t. His expression makes me half want to burst into laughter and half want to dash out of the room.</p><p>\u2018Are you in the art world too, Mr Brandon?\u2019 she says pleasantly as she shakes his hand.</p><p>\u2018The art world?\u2019 Luke says after a fairly long pause.</p><p>\u2018No, he\u2019s not,\u2019 I chime in hurriedly. \u2018Not at all. Anyway, moving on to the really important subject, we\u2019d like to send our daughter Minnie here. I love your playground. Beautiful trees!\u2019 I\u2019m hoping we can move on, but Harriet Grayson, MA looks puzzled.</p> <p>\u2018So, are you relocating from New York?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um ... that\u2019s right,\u2019 I say after a pause. \u2018Isn\u2019t it, darling?\u2019 I shoot Luke a brief, desperate look.</p><p>\u2018Goodness! But what about your work at the Guggenheim, Professor Bloomwood?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Guggenheim?\u2019 echoes Luke in a slightly strangled voice.</p><p>\u2018Yes, the Guggenheim. Absolutely.\u2019 I nod several times, playing for time. \u2018Obviously I\u2019ll miss the Guggenheim very much. But I\u2019ll be ... focusing on my own art.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re an artist yourself?\u2019 Harriet Grayson seems bowled over. \u2018How wonderful! Are you a painter?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not really.\u2019 I cough. \u2018My work is ... it\u2019s quite hard to describe ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky\u2019s art form is unique,\u2019 Luke suddenly chimes in. \u2018She creates ... unreal worlds. Fantasyland, some might call it.\u2019</p><p>I shoot him a tiny glare, just as there\u2019s a knock on the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Mr Brandon?\u2019 The secretary looks in tentatively. \u2018You have an urgent message to call your office.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 Luke looks surprised. \u2018It must be very important for them to interrupt me. Excuse me.\u2019 As he heads out of the room, I grab the prospectus and flick randomly to a page.</p><p>\u2018So!\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018When you say the children read every day, what exactly do you mean by that?\u2019</p><p>Thank God. For about five minutes Mrs Grayson talks about reading schemes and I nod intelligently. Then I ask a question about the science building and I get another three minutes, and I\u2019m about to move on to netball when the door opens.</p> <p>I gape at Luke in surprise. His face is glowing. He looks like he\u2019s won the Lottery. What on earth ...</p><p>Oh my God. Elinor\u2019s done it!</p><p>OK, now I\u2019m dying to check my texts.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 Luke says politely to Mrs Grayson. \u2018I\u2019ve been called back to my office on unavoidable business. But Becky can stay and do the tour.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I jump to my feet as though I\u2019ve been scalded. \u2018I mean ... I\u2019d rather see it with you, darling. I\u2019m so sorry, Mrs Grayson ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s quite all right,\u2019 she says, smilingly. \u2018And may I say again what a pleasure it is to see you, Professor? You know, your advice regarding little Ernest Cleath-Stuart was invaluable.\u2019</p><p>Beside me, I can sense Luke prick up his ears. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 he says politely.</p><p>\u2018All in a day\u2019s work,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018It was nothing to speak of ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have to disagree! Professor Bloomwood cleverly spotted the potential of one of my pupils at St Cuthbert\u2019s,\u2019 Harriet Grayson tells Luke. \u2018A young boy who was having a few ... difficulties, shall we say? But he\u2019s really come out of himself since we gave him the art award. He\u2019s a different child!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 Luke nods in sudden understanding. \u2018I see.\u2019 His eyes are softer as they meet mine. \u2018Well, Professor Bloomwood\u2019s very good at that kind of thing.\u2019</p><p>We head along the corridors and out of the school without speaking, slide into the car and look at each other for a moment in the silence.</p> <p>\u2018So.\u2019 Luke raises a quizzical eyebrow. \u2018Professor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell Suze.\u2019 He nods. \u2018I got it. And Becky ... good for you. Except we can never send Minnie to this school now, you realize?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I say gloomily. \u2018And I really liked it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll find another.\u2019 He squeezes my knee, then reaches for his phone and dials. \u2018Hi, Gary? I\u2019m coming straight in. I know, incredible news!\u2019</p><p>Surreptitiously I turn on my BlackBerry and it bleeps with incoming texts, the first from Elinor.</p><p>I have spoken to Bernard. Kind regards, Elinor.</p><p>Just like that. Sorted, with no fuss. The more I get to know Elinor, the more I realize she\u2019s an incredible woman. I think Luke must have got some of her genes. The determined, steely, crush-every-obstacle ones. Not that I\u2019ll ever say that to him.</p> <p>\u2018So, what\u2019s up?\u2019 I say innocently as Luke starts the car. \u2018What\u2019s the big excitement at work?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You remember that trip to Paris?\u2019 Luke looks over his shoulder to reverse. \u2018It\u2019s off, I\u2019m afraid. We\u2019re not meeting Christian Scott-Hughes after all \u2013 we\u2019re meeting the main man, this afternoon. Sir Bernard just decided to give us half an hour, out of the blue! Sir Bernard Cross himself!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow!\u2019 It\u2019s lucky I\u2019m good at acting. \u2018How amazing!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s unheard of.\u2019 Luke nods, his eyes on the road. \u2018Everyone\u2019s in a state of shock.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, congratulations! You deserve it!\u2019</p><p>Thx Elinor, I\u2019m texting back. You are a total STAR!!!!!!!!</p><p>\u2018What I do think ...\u2019 Luke pauses as he negotiates a tricky roundabout, \u2018... is that someone has pulled some strings for us. This kind of thing doesn\u2019t just happen out of the blue.\u2019 He glances at me. \u2018Someone, somewhere is behind it. Someone influential.\u2019</p><p>My heart seems to jump right into my mouth. For a moment my throat is too tight with panic to answer.</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I say at last. \u2018Who would do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. Difficult to say.\u2019 He frowns thoughtfully for a moment, then flashes me a tiny grin. \u2018But whoever it is, I love them.\u2019</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon I\u2019m on tenterhooks. It\u2019s all going to plan \u2013 as long as each bit of the plan works out. As long as the meeting goes well; as long as Luke doesn\u2019t decide to go to Paris anyway; as long as no one at the office blabs ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m trying to do a seating plan, but honestly, it\u2019s worse than Sudoku, and I\u2019m too preoccupied to concentrate. Janice keeps coming in and fussing about where exactly the marquee entrance will be, and Minnie jams a pencil in the DVD player halfway through Finding Nemo. So basically it\u2019s five o\u2019clock and I haven\u2019t got beyond table three when there\u2019s the sound of a key in the front door. Hastily I gather up my table charts and shove them in the cupboard behind Dad\u2019s Sounds of the Seventies CD collection. When Luke comes in, I\u2019m sitting on the sofa, reading a book which I\u2019ve just grabbed off the floor.</p><p>\u2018Hi, how was it?\u2019 I look up.</p><p>\u2018Great. Really good.\u2019 Luke is glowing even more triumphantly than he was this morning. \u2018Sir Bernard\u2019s a great guy. He was on side, wanting to listen, interested. We raised a lot of thought-provoking side issues ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fantastic!\u2019 I smile \u2013 but I can\u2019t quite relax yet. I have to be sure. \u2018So ... you definitely won\u2019t need to go to Paris on Friday?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Afraid not. Although we could still go if you wanted?\u2019 Luke adds.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 Relief sends my voice shooting sky-high. \u2018God, no! Let\u2019s just ... stay here. Chill out. Not do anything.\u2019 I\u2019m babbling, but I can\u2019t help it. \u2018So, a good day all round.\u2019 I beam at him. \u2018We should open some champagne.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. Apart from one thing.\u2019 Luke frowns briefly. \u2018I had to give my assistant a verbal warning. Not really the way I wanted to end the afternoon. I may have to let her go.\u2019</p><p>What? My smile falls away.</p><p>\u2018You mean Bonnie? But ... why? You said you wouldn\u2019t say anything. What did she do?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh, it\u2019s very disappointing.\u2019 Luke sighs. \u2018For months she seemed the perfect assistant. I couldn\u2019t fault her. But then she started making the inappropriate comments that I mentioned to you before. I\u2019ve recently noticed she seems very distracted. And now I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been making illicit phone calls of some kind.\u2019</p><p>Oh God, oh God. This is all because of me and the party.</p><p>\u2018Everyone\u2019s allowed to make the odd phone call,\u2019 I say quickly, but Luke shakes his head.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s more than that. I have my suspicions. At best she\u2019s moonlighting; at worst, stealing company information.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She wouldn\u2019t do anything like that!\u2019 I say in horror. \u2018I\u2019ve met her. She\u2019s obviously completely honest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Darling, you\u2019re very trusting.\u2019 Luke shoots me a fond smile. \u2018But I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re wrong. Something\u2019s going on. I came across Bonnie dealing with a pile of paperwork that quite clearly had nothing to do with Brandon Communications. Not only that, she looked as guilty as sin when I appeared and she hid some papers under the desk. She obviously didn\u2019t expect me back for a while. So I had to have a stern word.\u2019 He shrugs. \u2018Not pleasant for either of us, but there you go.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You were stern?\u2019 I say in horror.</p><p>I can just picture what happened. Bonnie was going through the guest list with me this afternoon. That must be what she hid under the desk. I thought she rang off rather hastily.</p><p>\u2018What exactly did you say?\u2019 I demand. \u2018Did she get upset?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does it matter?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I feel a surge of frustration. You stupid idiot! I feel like yelling. Did it never occur to you that she might be helping to organize your surprise birthday party?</p><p>I mean, obviously I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t occur to him. But still. I just hope Bonnie\u2019s OK. She\u2019s so mild-mannered and sweet, I can\u2019t bear the idea of Luke upsetting her.</p><p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke seems perplexed. \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t say anything else. I\u2019ll give myself away.</p> <p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 I shake my head. \u2018No problem. I\u2019m sure you were right. It\u2019s just ... a shame.\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK,\u2019 Luke says slowly, giving me a slightly odd look. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll go and change. Nanny Sue will be here before too long.\u2019</p><p>The instant he\u2019s gone, I dash into the downstairs cloakroom, speed-dial Bonnie\u2019s number, and get voicemail.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie!\u2019 I exclaim. \u2018Luke just told me he gave you some kind of verbal warning. I\u2019m so sorry. You know he doesn\u2019t understand. He\u2019ll feel terrible when he finds out. Anyway, the good news is, Paris is definitely off! So everything\u2019s finally falling into place. Have you told all the Brandon C lot yet? Call me as soon as you have a chance.\u2019</p><p>As I ring off, I hear the doorbell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great. That must be Nazi Sue.</p><p>Today Nanny Sue\u2019s wearing her official blue uniform. Sitting on the sofa, with a cup of tea and a laptop open beside her, she looks like she\u2019s a policewoman come to arrest us.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 she begins, looking from me to Luke and then smiling down at Minnie, who\u2019s sitting on the floor with a puzzle. \u2018It was a pleasure to spend some time with Becky and Minnie.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m not falling for her so-called friendly overtures. This is how she always starts on her TV show. She\u2019s all nicey-nicey and then she goes in for the kill and by the end everyone\u2019s sobbing on her shoulder and saying \u2018Nanny Sue, how can we be better people?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Now.\u2019 She taps at the laptop and a video screen appears with \u2018Minnie Brandon\u2019 in black letters above it. \u2018As you know, I filmed our morning together, as is my common practice. Just for my own records, you understand.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I gape at her. \u2018Are you serious? Where was the camera?\u2019</p><p>\u2018On my lapel.\u2019 Nanny Sue looks equally taken aback and turns to Luke. \u2018I thought you\u2019d informed Becky?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You knew? You didn\u2019t tell me anything!\u2019 I round on Luke. \u2018I was being filmed the whole time and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought it better not to. I thought if you knew, you might ...\u2019 He hesitates. \u2018Act unnaturally. Put on a show.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I would never put on a show,\u2019 I retort, outraged.</p><p>Nanny Sue is scrolling through the images, pausing every now and again, and I catch a glimpse of myself talking stagily about organic Play-Doh.</p><p>\u2018That bit\u2019s not relevant,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018I\u2019d fast-forward.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So, what did you think, Nanny Sue?\u2019 Luke is leaning forward in his chair, hands clasped anxiously on his knees. \u2018Did you spot any major problems?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Unfortunately, I did notice something that concerned me,\u2019 Nanny Sue says seriously. \u2018I\u2019ll show you now ... can you both see the screen?\u2019</p><p>What did she notice? Whatever it was, she\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m feeling a burning indignation. What gives her the right to come into our house and film us and tell us what\u2019s wrong with our daughter? Who said she was an expert, anyway?</p> <p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I exclaim, and Nanny Sue stops the footage in surprise. \u2018Plenty of children have spirit, Nanny Sue. But it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re spoiled. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve got problems. Human nature is a varied and beautiful thing. Some people are timid and some are feisty! Our daughter is a wonderful human being and I\u2019m not having her spirit crushed at some ... oppressive boot camp! And Luke agrees!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I agree too.\u2019 Nanny Sue\u2019s voice takes me by surprise.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I say feebly.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think Minnie has problems in the slightest. She could do with more structure and discipline in her life, but otherwise she is just a lively, normal toddler.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Normal?\u2019 I stare at Nanny Sue stupidly.</p><p>\u2018Normal?\u2019 exclaims Luke. \u2018Is it normal to squirt ketchup at people?\u2019</p><p>\u2018For a two-year-old, yes.\u2019 Nanny Sue looks amused. \u2018Entirely normal. She\u2019s just testing the boundaries. Incidentally, when did she last squirt ketchup at anybody?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ...\u2019 Luke looks at me a little uncertainly. \u2018Actually ... I don\u2019t remember now. Not for a while.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018She is wilful. And at moments, she does seem to have the upper hand. I suggest that I spend a day with you and give you some advice on controlling her wilder ways. But I really don\u2019t want you thinking that you have a problem child. Minnie is a normal child. A lovely child, in fact.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m so taken aback I can\u2019t find a reply.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s very intelligent,\u2019 adds Nanny Sue, \u2018which will be a challenge as she grows older. Intelligent children can often test their parents the most ...\u2019</p><p>She starts talking about boundaries again but I\u2019m too chuffed to listen properly. Minnie\u2019s intelligent! Nanny Sue said my child was intelligent! A genuine expert off the telly!</p><p>\u2018So, you\u2019re not going to recommend any boot camps?\u2019 I cut into her speech joyfully.</p><p>\u2018Ah, now, I didn\u2019t say that.\u2019 Nanny Sue\u2019s face turns graver. \u2018As I said, I did pick up something in my observations. And it worried me. Watch this.\u2019</p><p>She presses a button and the film starts \u2013 but to my surprise, it\u2019s not Minnie on the screen. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m in the taxi on the way to the discount mall and the camera is zooming in on my hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Where are you?\u2019 Luke peers at the screen. \u2018In a taxi?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We ... went out. Do we need really to see this?\u2019 I make to close down the screen, but Nanny Sue smoothly moves it out of my reach.</p><p>\u2018We could pop into this new mall instead of the softplay,\u2019 I can hear myself saying on screen.</p><p>\u2018Becky, I\u2019d like you to look at your hands.\u2019 Nanny Sue points with a pencil. \u2018They\u2019re shaking. Look at your fingers twitching. They began when we first saw the sign for the shopping mall, and I don\u2019t believe they stopped until you\u2019d bought something.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve just got twitchy fingers.\u2019 I give a casual little laugh. But Nanny Sue is shaking her head.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to alarm you, Becky ... but has it ever occurred to you that you might have an addiction to shopping?\u2019</p><p>A sudden snort comes from Luke, which I ignore.</p><p>\u2018Shopping?\u2019 I echo at last, as though I\u2019m not even certain what the word means. \u2018Er ... I don\u2019t think so ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look at the tension in your jaw.\u2019 She gestures at the screen. \u2018Look at the way you\u2019re tapping the seat.\u2019</p> <p>Honestly. Aren\u2019t people allowed to tap seats any more?</p><p>\u2018You have an air of desperation about you,\u2019 persists Nanny Sue. \u2018To my eyes, this is a disproportionate reaction.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No it\u2019s not!\u2019 I realize I sound too defensive and immediately backtrack. \u2018Look, I hadn\u2019t been shopping for a while, it\u2019s a new discount mall, I\u2019m only human! They were giving away free gifts! They had Jimmy Choo at 50 per cent off! And Burberry! Anyone would be twitchy!\u2019</p><p>Nanny Sue looks at me for a moment as though I\u2019ve been speaking gibberish, then turns to Luke.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m starting a new series of adult programmes. We\u2019re going to be tackling all sorts of disorders, from addiction to anger\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait a minute.\u2019 I cut her off in disbelief. \u2018You\u2019re saying you want me to go to boot camp? Luke, can you believe this?\u2019</p> <p>I turn to him, waiting for him to laugh and say, \u2018What a ludicrous idea.\u2019 But he has an anxious frown.</p><p>\u2018Becky, I thought you said you weren\u2019t going to shop for a while. I thought we\u2019d made an agreement.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t shop for myself,\u2019 I say impatiently. \u2018I only bought a few essential clothes for Minnie. And they were all on sale!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your life is your own concern, of course,\u2019 Nanny Sue is saying. \u2018However, my worry is that Minnie may pick up your tendencies. She already has an advanced knowledge of brand names, she seems to have an unlimited amount of money to spend\u2014\u2019</p><p>This is the final straw.</p><p>\u2018That is not true!\u2019 I exclaim indignantly. \u2018She only spends her pocket money. It\u2019s all written down in a special book, which I showed you!\u2019 I reach into my bag and produce Minnie\u2019s pocket-money book. \u2018Remember?\u2019 I thrust it at Nanny Sue. \u2018I mean, yes, she has the odd little advance, but I\u2019ve explained to her she\u2019ll need to pay it back.\u2019</p><p>Nanny Sue leafs through the book for a moment, then gives me an odd look.</p><p>\u2018How much pocket money does she have?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Fifty pence a week,\u2019 says Luke. \u2018For now.\u2019</p><p>Nanny Sue has produced a calculator from her own bag and is tapping at it.</p><p>\u2018Then according to my sums ...\u2019 She looks up calmly. \u2018Minnie has spent her \u201cpocket money\u201d until the year 2103.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I stare at her, discomfited.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Luke grabs the book from her and starts flipping through. \u2018What the hell has she bought?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not that much ...\u2019</p><p>The year 2103? Can that be right? I\u2019m trying to do frantic sums in my head as Luke examines the entries in Minnie\u2019s book like the Gestapo.</p><p>\u2018Six dolls?\u2019 He jabs at a page. \u2018In one day?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They were a matching set,\u2019 I say defensively. \u2018And they\u2019ve got French names! It\u2019ll help her language!\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 He\u2019s already on another page. \u2018Junior Dolce boots?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She wore them the other day! Those little suede ones. You said how nice she looked!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know they cost two hundred quid!\u2019 he erupts. \u2018I mean, Jesus Christ, Becky, she\u2019s a little kid. Why does she need designer boots?\u2019</p><p>He looks really shocked. To be honest I\u2019m a bit shocked myself. Maybe I should have added up what she was spending a bit better.</p><p>\u2018Look, OK, I\u2019ll stop ...\u2019</p><p>Luke isn\u2019t even listening to me. He\u2019s turned back to Nanny Sue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You\u2019re saying that if we don\u2019t cure Becky, Minnie could turn into a shopaholic herself?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve never known him look so anxious.</p><p>\u2018Well, addictive behaviour is known to run in families.\u2019 They\u2019re both talking as though I\u2019m not even here.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not addicted,\u2019 I say furiously. \u2018And neither is Minnie!\u2019 I snatch the pocket-money book from him.

Shops!\u2019 Minnie is tugging at my hand in frustration, as though if I just understood, I\u2019d do what she wanted. It\u2019s the same look Dad got in France, that time we wanted to buy an electric fan and all the French shop assistants stared blankly as he shouted \u2018Fan! Fan! Electrique!\u2019 and whirled his hands around.</p><p>\u2018Shops.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, Minnie!\u2019 I snap. \u2018Be quiet now!\u2019</p><p>Minnie looks as though she\u2019s racking her brain for another way to put it \u2013 then her face lights up. \u2018Visa?\u2019</p><p>Luke breaks off his conversation and stares at her, stricken.</p><p>\u2018Did she just say \u201cVisa\u201d?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t she clever?\u2019 I give an over-bright laugh. \u2018The things children say ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, this is bad. Really bad.\u2019</p> <p>He looks so upset I feel a sudden clanging in my chest.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not bad!\u2019 I say desperately. \u2018She\u2019s not ... I\u2019m not ...\u2019 I trail off helplessly. For a moment no one says anything except Minnie, who is still tugging my arm, exclaiming, \u2018Visa!\u2019</p><p>At last I draw breath. \u2018You really think there\u2019s a problem, don\u2019t you? Well, fine. If you think I should go to boot camp, I\u2019ll go to boot camp.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Becky.\u2019 Nanny Sue laughs. \u2018It won\u2019t be as bad as all that. It\u2019ll simply be a programme of discussion and behaviour modification, based at our London headquarters, with a residential option for those from far away. We\u2019ll be having workshops, one-to-ones, role play ... I think you\u2019ll enjoy it!\u2019</p><p>Enjoy it?</p><p>She hands me a leaflet, which I can\u2019t even bring myself to look at. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve agreed to go to boot camp. I knew we should never have let Nanny Sue back in the house.</p><p>\u2018The main thing is, Minnie\u2019s OK.\u2019 Luke exhales. \u2018We\u2019ve been really worried.\u2019</p><p>Nanny Sue takes a sip of tea and looks from him to me. \u2018Out of interest ... what made you think she had problems in the first place?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I never did,\u2019 I point out at once. \u2018It was Luke. He said we couldn\u2019t have another baby because we couldn\u2019t control Minnie. He said she was too wild.\u2019</p><p>As I\u2019m speaking, it hits me. He hasn\u2019t got any more excuses! Result! I whip round to Luke.</p><p>\u2018So will you change your mind now about having another baby? You have to change your mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... don\u2019t know.\u2019 Luke looks cornered. \u2018You don\u2019t just rush into these things, Becky. It\u2019s a big step ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything in life is a big step!\u2019 I say dismissively. \u2018Don\u2019t be a scaredy-cat. You think Minnie should have a sibling, don\u2019t you?\u2019 I appeal to Nanny Sue. \u2018You think it would be good for her?\u2019</p><p>Ha. That\u2019ll teach Luke. Two can play the Getting-Nanny-Sue-On-Their-Side game.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s a very personal decision.\u2019 She looks thoughtful. \u2018However, it\u2019s sometimes helpful to discuss these things. Luke, is there a particular reason why you don\u2019t want to have another child?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 says Luke after a long pause. \u2018Not really.\u2019 He looks very uncomfortable, I suddenly notice.</p><p>Why is this such a sore point with him?</p><p>\u2018Of course, babies are disruptive little creatures ...\u2019 begins Nanny Sue.</p><p>\u2018Minnie wasn\u2019t!\u2019 I defend her immediately. \u2018I mean, only a tiny bit\u2014\u2019 I break off in sudden dismay. \u2018Is it because of when she chewed up those papers that time? Because she was teething, Luke, and you shouldn\u2019t have left them on the bed, and you should have made photocopies\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not that!\u2019 Luke cuts me with a sudden heat. \u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous. That wouldn\u2019t be a reason. That wouldn\u2019t be\u2014\u2019 He breaks off abruptly, an odd, jarring note to his voice. His face is turned away, but I can see the tension growing in his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What is up?</p><p>\u2018I think there\u2019s more to this than child behaviour, isn\u2019t there, Luke?\u2019 says Nanny Sue quietly, and I stare, agog. This is just like the TV show! \u2018Take your time,\u2019 she adds, as Luke takes a deep breath. \u2018There\u2019s no hurry.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence apart from Minnie chomping another shortbread. I don\u2019t dare move a muscle. The whole atmosphere in the room has changed and become stiller. What\u2019s he going to say?</p><p>\u2018Having Minnie has been wonderful.\u2019 Luke speaks at last, his voice a little gruff. \u2018But I just don\u2019t feel as though I could give the same intensity of feeling to another child. And I couldn\u2019t risk that. I know what it is to feel abandoned and unloved by a parent and I\u2019m not going to do it to a child of my own.\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m so gobsmacked I can\u2019t even utter a sound. I had no idea Luke felt like this. None. None.</p><p>\u2018Why do you feel abandoned, Luke?\u2019 Nanny Sue is using the soft, sympathetic voice she always uses at the end of the show.</p><p>\u2018My mother left me when I was small,\u2019 says Luke matter-of-factly \u2018We did meet in later life, but we never ... bonded, you might say. Recently, we had a major disagreement, and as a result, I\u2019m fairly sure we\u2019ll never speak again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I see.\u2019 Nanny Sue looks unfazed. \u2018Have you made any attempts at reconciliation? Has she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My mother never gives me a thought.\u2019 He gives a small, wry smile. \u2018Trust me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Becky, are you familiar with this situation?\u2019 Nanny Sue turns to me. \u2018Do you feel that Luke\u2019s mother never gives him a thought?\u2019</p><p>My face flames and I make a tiny, inarticulate noise that doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>\u2018Becky hates my mother even more than I do,\u2019 chimes in Luke with a short laugh. \u2018Don\u2019t you, darling? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re heartily relieved that we never have to see her.\u2019</p><p>I gulp my tea, my face burning. This is unbearable. I\u2019ve got about two hundred texts in my phone, all from Elinor, all about Luke. She\u2019s done nothing this week except devote herself to giving him the best party in the world.</p><p>But I can\u2019t say anything. What can I say?</p><p>\u2018I was brought up by a wonderful stepmother.\u2019 Luke is talking again. \u2018She really was my mum. But even so, that feeling of abandonment never leaves you. If I had another child, and it felt abandoned ...\u2019 He winces. \u2018I couldn\u2019t do that.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But why would it feel abandoned?\u2019 asks Nanny Sue gently. \u2018It would be your child. You would love it.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence \u2013 then Luke shakes his head.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s the trouble. My fear, if you like.\u2019 His voice is suddenly very low and husky. \u2018I don\u2019t see how I could have enough affection to be split so many ways. I love Becky. I love Minnie. I\u2019m done.\u2019 He turns to me suddenly. \u2018Don\u2019t you feel that? Haven\u2019t you ever felt afraid you might not have the capacity to love another child?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, no,\u2019 I say, a bit baffled. \u2018I just feel like ... the more the merrier.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke, this is a very common fear,\u2019 says Nanny Sue. \u2018I\u2019ve known many, many parents express this worry before having a second child. They look at their first, beloved child and all they can feel is guilt that there won\u2019t be enough love to go round.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly.\u2019 His brow furrows deeply. \u2018That\u2019s exactly it. It\u2019s the guilt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But each of those parents, without exception, has said to me afterwards that there is enough love. There\u2019s plenty.\u2019 Her voice softens even more. \u2018There\u2019s plenty of love.\u2019</p><p>I feel a sudden pricking at my eyes.</p> <p>Oh, no way. I am not going to let Nanny Sue make me cry.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t know in advance how much you would love Minnie, did you?\u2019 Nanny Sue says quietly to Luke. \u2018But that didn\u2019t stop you then.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause.</p><p>My fingers are crossed tightly, I suddenly realize. Both hands. And my feet.</p><p>\u2018I ... guess not,\u2019 says Luke slowly at last. \u2018I guess in the end you just have to have faith.\u2019 He looks up at me and gives a tentative smile, and I beam joyfully back.</p><p>Nanny Sue is the cleverest expert in the world, and I love her.</p><p>It\u2019s an hour before we\u2019ve said our last goodbye to Nanny Sue, promised to stay in touch for ever and finally got Minnie into bed. Luke and I tiptoe out of her bedroom, lean back against the wall and look at each other silently for a moment.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 says Luke at last.</p><p>\u2018So.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you think we\u2019ll have a boy or a girl?\u2019 He pulls me towards him and I sink into his arms. \u2018Do you think Minnie wants a brother or sister to boss around?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s talking like this.

In fact ... I\u2019m feeling a bit ill. Maybe you could bring it to me in bed? And some toast?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... OK.\u2019 Luke gives me a slightly strange look. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bathroom!\u2019 I gasp, heading away. \u2018Just make the tea!

Bonnie?</p><p>Oh my God. The strain has got to her. She\u2019s messed up some piece of work and now she\u2019s getting me to cover up her tracks. Maybe she\u2019ll ask me to fabricate evidence or lie to Luke or delete emails off his computer. I feel simultaneously touched that she trusts me enough to ask me ... and remorse that I\u2019ve driven her to such a state.</p><p>\u2018Were you upset by Luke telling you off?\u2019 I demand. \u2018Is that why you made a mistake?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was a little flustered this afternoon,\u2019 she says hesitantly, \u2018yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew it!\u2019 I clutch my head. \u2018Bonnie, I feel so bad about what happened. Was Luke really angry with you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He wasn\u2019t unreasonable, in the circumstances, but I was shaken, I must confess\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bonnie, stop right there.\u2019 My voice is trembling with resolution. \u2018Whatever you\u2019ve done, whatever mistake you\u2019ve made, whatever losses Brandon Communications suffer as a result ... there is no way it was your fault. I won\u2019t let Luke fire you. I\u2019ll defend you to the hilt!\u2019</p> <p>I have a sudden image of myself squaring up to Luke in his office, holding Bonnie by the wrist and saying, \u2018Do you realize what a treasure this woman is? Do you realize what an asset she is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, dear, don\u2019t worry! I haven\u2019t made any mistake regarding Brandon Communications.\u2019 Bonnie\u2019s voice cuts into my reverie. \u2018I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s to do with the party.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The party?\u2019 I feel a sudden tremor. \u2018What\u2019s happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018As you know, today was the day I informed the company about Luke\u2019s surprise. I sent out the group email and all went smoothly. People are very excited and pleased.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019 I\u2019m trying to quell a growing panic. \u2018So ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I then realized that I hadn\u2019t mentioned the group birthday card. So I prepared a second email, informing the recipients that the card was in reception and would be presented to Luke at the party. I was just spell-checking when I thought I heard Luke\u2019s voice. In my confusion, I hastily sent the email and closed down my screen.\u2019 She pauses. \u2018I didn\u2019t realize my error till later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your error?\u2019 My heart is pounding. \u2018Oh God. You didn\u2019t send it to Luke, did you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I\u2019m afraid it went to Luke,\u2019 says Bonnie after the briefest of pauses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a tiny flash of shock, like sparks in my head.

I\u2019ll delete it off his computer and his BlackBerry. No harm done. Thank God you caught it, that\u2019s all\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky, you don\u2019t understand. Luke got it because he\u2019s on our General Contacts list. That\u2019s where I sent it by mistake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018General Contacts?\u2019 I echo uncertainly. \u2018Well ... who\u2019s that? Who\u2019s on the list?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Around ten thousand City analysts, pundits and national press. I\u2019m afraid it went out to all of them.\u2019</p><p>I feel another flash \u2013 but this one isn\u2019t tiny sparks. It\u2019s massive, crashing, overwhelming tsunamis of horror.</p><p>\u2018Ten thousand people?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I immediately sent a retraction and asked for complete discretion. But I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not as easy as that. People have started responding. Birthday messages have started arriving for Luke. His in-box is full. He\u2019s had fifty-six already.\u2019</p><p>With a shaking thumb I jab at Luke\u2019s inbox on his BlackBerry. As it opens up, a list of unread emails fills the screen.</p> <p>Many Happy Returns, Buddy!</p><p>Wishing You a Good One</p><p>Happy Birthday and all the best from the marketing team at HSBC</p><p>I can hear Luke\u2019s tread as he comes up the stairs. I want to gibber with panic. I need to hide the BlackBerry. I need to hide everything, squash everything away.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll guess everything!\u2019 I whisper in horror, ducking into the bathroom. \u2018We have to delete them! We have to stop them!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 Bonnie sounds fairly desperate, too. \u2018But it seems people have been forwarding the email on. He\u2019s getting messages from all over the place. I don\u2019t know how we can contain them.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But it\u2019s a secret!\u2019 I almost wail. \u2018Don\u2019t they realize?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky.\u2019 Bonnie sighs. \u2018Maybe you\u2019ve kept the secret for long enough. The party\u2019s only two days away. Isn\u2019t it time to tell Luke?\u2019</p><p>I stare at the phone in utter shock. She thinks I should just give up? After all this?</p><p>\u2018Absolutely not!\u2019 I retort in a savage whisper. \u2018No way! I\u2019m giving him a surprise party, OK? A surprise. I\u2019ll just have to distract Luke so he doesn\u2019t see any emails or anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dear, you can\u2019t possibly distract him from his emails for two entire days\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes I can! I\u2019ll lose his BlackBerry, and I\u2019ll deal with his laptop somehow ... Get the tech guys to delete all the emails if they can. Keep me posted. Bonnie, I\u2019ve got to go ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 Luke is calling from the bedroom. \u2018Darling, are you OK?\u2019</p><p>I ring off, gaze at Luke\u2019s BlackBerry for a heart-thumping moment, then quickly stamp on it, treading it into the tiled floor. There. Take that, ten thousand people all giving my secret party away.</p> <p>\u2018Becky?\u2019</p><p>I open the door to see him standing with a mug and plate bearing two slices of toast.</p><p>\u2018Are you OK?\u2019 He peers at me in concern, then holds out his hand. \u2018Can I have my BlackBerry back?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... broke it. Sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus!\u2019 He stares in shock at the mangled remains. \u2018How the hell did you do that?\u2019 He looks around the room. \u2018Where\u2019s my laptop got to? I\u2019ll have to email Bonnie\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 My cry is so piercing he gives a startled flinch and tea slops out of the mug. \u2018Forget your laptop! Forget everything! Luke ...\u2019 I cast desperately around. \u2018I\u2019m ... ovulating!\u2019</p><p>Yes!</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 He stares blankly at me.</p><p>\u2018Right now!\u2019 I nod firmly. \u2018This minute! I just did a test. They\u2019re very specific these days. So we need to get down to it! Quickly! Minnie\u2019s asleep, it\u2019s just you and me in the house ...\u2019 I sidle up to him suggestively, take the mug and plate out of his hands and dump them on a shelf. \u2018Come on, darling.\u2019 I lower my voice huskily. \u2018Let\u2019s make a baby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, there\u2019s a thought.\u2019 His eyes gleam as I start to unbutton his shirt and tug it out of his trousers. \u2018No time like the present.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Absolutely.\u2019 I close my eyes and run my hand down his chest in my most sultry way. \u2018I am so in the mood.\u2019</p><p>Actually, it\u2019s true. All the adrenalin pumping round my body is getting me quite hot and bothered. I pull his shirt off completely and move closer, breathing in his faint scent of sweat and aftershave. Mmmm. This was a very good idea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Right back at you,\u2019 murmurs Luke against my neck. He\u2019s obviously in the mood too, in quite a major way. Excellent. I\u2019m good for a few hours. He won\u2019t even think about laptops or BlackBerries. In fact, if I play things right, this will take care of things till morning. And then ...</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019ve got no idea. I\u2019ll just have to think of something else. I\u2019ve got plenty of time to work out a plan.</p><p>All I know is one thing. He\u2019s having a surprise on Friday night, if it kills me.</p><p>NINETEEN</p> <p>OK, it practically is killing me. It\u2019s seven thirty the next morning and I\u2019m totally sleep-deprived because every time I was about to drop off, Luke would murmur something like \u2018I\u2019ll just check my emails\u2019 and I had to do my sultry nymphomaniac act all over again.</p><p>Which, you know, had its benefits. But now we truly are sated, both of us. I mean, really. We\u2019re done. (For the moment, at least.) And I know Luke\u2019s mind will be roaming. So far, I\u2019ve managed to keep him confined to the bedroom. I brought us all breakfast in bed, and he\u2019s sipping his second cup of coffee while Minnie eats a piece of toast. But any minute he\u2019ll start looking at his watch and saying\u2014</p><p>\u2018Have you seen my laptop?\u2019 He looks up.</p><p>I knew it.</p><p>\u2018Um ... Have you lost it?\u2019 I prevaricate.</p> <p>\u2018It must be around here ...\u2019 He pushes at the shirt which he discarded on the floor last night.</p><p>\u2018I expect so.\u2019 I nod wisely. I secreted it out of the room earlier and stuffed it behind the bottles at the back of the detergent cupboard in the utility room. Then I propped an ironing board and overflowing basket of laundry in front of the cupboard door. He\u2019ll never find it.</p><p>\u2018I need to get in touch with Bonnie and explain the situation ...\u2019 He\u2019s searching the room with more energy. \u2018Where the hell is it? I had it last night! I must be going fucking demented. Can I use your BlackBerry?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Out of power,\u2019 I lie smoothly. \u2018I forgot to charge it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll use your parents\u2019 computer, then\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018They\u2019ve changed the password,\u2019 I say hastily. \u2018You won\u2019t be able to get in. More coffee, darling?\u2019</p> <p>The phone on the bedside table rings and I pick it up as naturally as possible.</p><p>\u2018Hello? Oh, it\u2019s for you, Luke!\u2019 I muster tones of surprise. \u2018It\u2019s Gary!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hi Gary.\u2019 Luke takes the receiver. \u2018Sorry, my BlackBerry\u2019s bust\u2014\u2019 He breaks off and gapes at the phone. \u2018What?\u2019 he exclaims at last. \u2018But Gary ...\u2019</p><p>I sip my coffee demurely, watching Luke and trying not to smile. At last Luke puts down the phone, looking shaken.</p><p>\u2018Bloody hell.\u2019 He sinks down on the bed. \u2018That was Gary. I think he\u2019s having a nervous breakdown.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No way!\u2019 I exclaim theatrically.</p><p>Good old Gary. I knew he wouldn\u2019t let me down.</p><p>\u2018He said he needs to see me urgently, talk about the company, talk about his life, get away from the pressure. He sounded absolutely on the edge. Gary, of all people!\u2019 Luke looks staggered. \u2018I mean, he\u2019s the last person I would expect to crack up. He\u2019s always been so steady. He said he can\u2019t face London, he wants to meet me at some remote place in the New Forest, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019</p> <p>It\u2019s a holiday lodge Gary goes to with his family. It\u2019s got no phone signal, no internet and no TV. Gary and I had a little chat early this morning. He said he reckons he can keep up his nervous-breakdown act for the morning, and meanwhile we\u2019ll come up with more plans.</p><p>\u2018You must make Gary a priority,\u2019 I say seriously. \u2018After all, he\u2019s your right-hand man. I think you should go to wherever he says and hear him out. He might do something stupid otherwise,\u2019 I quickly add as Luke seems to hesitate. \u2018You don\u2019t want to risk that, do you? Call Bonnie and see if she can rearrange your appointments.\u2019</p><p>Automatically Luke claps his hand to his pocket for his BlackBerry \u2013 then remembers.</p><p>\u2018Oh, this is a bloody joke.\u2019 Cursing under his breath, he reaches for the landline phone. \u2018I don\u2019t even know her direct line.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s\u2014\u2019 I bite my lip just in time. Shit. I\u2019m getting careless. \u2018It\u2019s probably more sensible to go via the switchboard,\u2019 I hastily cover. \u2018Look!\u2019 I proffer an old Brandon Communications notepad, and laboriously Luke taps in the number, a deep scowl on his face.</p><p>I have to bite my lip hard so I don\u2019t smile. He\u2019s so ratty.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Maureen. It\u2019s Luke. Can you put me through to Bonnie?\u2019 He takes a slug of coffee. \u2018Bonnie. Thank God. You will not believe the fiasco this end. I haven\u2019t got my BlackBerry or my laptop, I\u2019ve just had a crazy call from Gary, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing\u2014\u2019 He breaks off, and I can see the ripples gradually calm on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Well, thanks, Bonnie,\u2019 he says at last. \u2018That would be great.

If you take delivery, I can pick it up on my way back to the office.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What a good idea!\u2019 I exclaim, as though this is news to me and I haven\u2019t already exchanged about fifty emails on the subject. \u2018Good thing Bonnie\u2019s so efficient, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I can\u2019t resist adding.</p><p>Bonnie\u2019s sending over a specially modified laptop which will be unable to access the internet due to a \u2018server flaw\u2019. The tech department have also disabled Luke\u2019s email account and set up a dummy one. Bonnie\u2019s going to fill it with enough emails to keep him busy and unsuspicious \u2013 but nothing else. Basically, we\u2019re cutting him off from virtual civilization.</p><p>\u2018And she\u2019s sorting out a car to take me to wherever the hell Gary is. It should be here in about twenty minutes.\u2019 Luke looks around the room yet again, his brow furrowing. \u2018I\u2019m sure I brought my laptop back last night. I\u2019m sure I did.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry about your laptop,\u2019 I say soothingly, as though he\u2019s a psychotic patient. \u2018Tell you what, why don\u2019t you get Minnie dressed?\u2019</p><p>My BlackBerry has been vibrating with incoming calls, and as soon as Luke\u2019s out of earshot, I grab it and answer without even checking the screen.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Bonnie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s Davina.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m so focused on this morning\u2019s events, it takes me a nanosecond to realize who it is.</p> <p>\u2018Davina?\u2019 I can\u2019t hide my surprise. \u2018Hi! How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky! You poor thing! This is terrible!\u2019 For one mad moment I think she means about the party nearly coming out. Then I realize what she\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u2018Oh, that.\u2019 I wince. \u2018Yes, I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>I really could do without going over the whole thing again. I\u2019d kind of managed to forget about it for now.</p><p>\u2018Well, my boss found out about the Shop in Private service.\u2019 I keep my voice low. \u2018And he didn\u2019t like it. So I\u2019m suspended and they\u2019re going to do an investigation.\u2019 To be honest, I\u2019ve been so frantic over the last few days I\u2019ve barely given the investigation a thought.</p> <p>\u2018But you saved our lives!\u2019 Davina sounds impassioned. \u2018We\u2019re all agreed, we\u2019re not standing for it. We had a meeting yesterday, a few of your regular clients. Jasmine was the one who spread the word, then we all got on a group email ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jasmine?\u2019 I\u2019m quite taken aback at the idea of Jasmine rallying the troops.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re not letting this go. We\u2019re going to take action. And that boss of yours will wish he never messed with you.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s so fierce, I feel touched. By Jasmine, too. Although, to be honest, what on earth can any of them do? Maybe they\u2019re all going to write a joint letter of complaint.</p><p>\u2018Well ... thanks, Davina. I really appreciate it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll keep you posted. But what I wanted to ask is, are you OK, Becky? Is there anything I can do? Anything at all? I\u2019ve got the whole day off, so if you need to talk, if you want cheering up ...\u2019</p><p>I feel a wash of gratitude. Davina\u2019s such a sweetheart.</p><p>\u2018Thanks, but not really.\u2019 Not unless you can somehow distract my husband\u2014</p> <p>Ooh. My thoughts have stopped abruptly in their tracks. Davina\u2019s a doctor, isn\u2019t she? So she could maybe ...</p><p>No. I can\u2019t ask that. It\u2019s too big a favour.</p><p>But it would save my life, and she did offer ...</p><p>\u2018Actually, there is something that would really help me out,\u2019 I say cautiously. \u2018But it\u2019s really massive ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Anything! Just tell me!\u2019</p><p>Davina is a star. By the time Luke comes back into the room with Minnie, the plan is in place. Both Davina and I have texted Bonnie; everything\u2019s set. I hastily whip my BlackBerry back under the duvet and smile at Luke, just as the phone rings on cue.</p><p>\u2018Oh, hi Bonnie!\u2019 I say innocently. \u2018Yes, Luke\u2019s here. Did you want him for something?\u2019</p><p>I hand over the receiver \u2013 and this time I have to bite my lip even harder as Luke\u2019s face becomes more and more aghast.</p><p>\u2018An emergency medical?\u2019 he expostulates at last.</p><p>Oh God, I mustn\u2019t laugh. I mustn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t be serious!\u2019 he\u2019s exclaiming. \u2018How can it be an emergency, for fuck\u2019s sake? Well, tell them I can\u2019t.\u2019 I can see him getting frustrated. \u2018Well, tell the insurance company to sod off. Well ...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Good for Bonnie.

Some sort of insurance cock-up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What a pain!\u2019 I say sympathetically.</p><p>Davina\u2019s promised to give Luke the most full-on medical going. It\u2019ll last at least six hours, he\u2019ll be in a hospital gown, unable to use his laptop or a mobile phone and no one will be able to get to him.</p> <p>\u2018This is the most fucking ludicrous day ...\u2019 He thrusts two hands through his hair, looking totally beleaguered.</p><p>Luke really isn\u2019t used to things being out of his control.

Shouldn\u2019t you get ready?\u2019</p><p>As Luke is putting on his jacket, a text buzzes through on my BlackBerry and I surreptitiously click on it. It\u2019s from Bonnie and it\u2019s very short and to the point.</p><p>Becky. Have you seen YouTube?</p> <p>OK. Just as I think everything\u2019s happened that possibly can, something else does.</p><p>The marketing department at Foreland Investments have made a video in which everyone says \u2018Happy Birthday Luke!\u2019 to the camera and they\u2019ve posted it on YouTube under the heading \u2018Happy Birthday Luke Brandon!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m torn between being really, really touched, and really, really climbing the walls. I mean, YouTube, for God\u2019s sake! Could they have done anything less discreet? Couldn\u2019t they have waited till tomorrow evening to post it? Every time I watch it I have to have a squirt of calming Rescue Remedy afterwards.</p><p>By ten o\u2019clock it\u2019s already had 145 hits, only about ten of which are me. By eleven o\u2019clock, when Janice and Suze arrive, it\u2019s up to 1,678 \u2013 and to my disbelief, two more videos have been posted. One is from Sacrum Asset Management, in which \u2018Happy Birthday Luke Brandon\u2019 has been spelled out in paperclips on someone\u2019s desk. The other is from Wetherby\u2019s, where the whole marketing department sings \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 to the camera.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s so cool!\u2019 Suze gapes at my laptop in disbelief.</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I can\u2019t help feeling proud. I mean, all these people must really like Luke to bother to do a video for him. But I can\u2019t help feeling jittery, too. \u2018What if he sees it, though?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He won\u2019t see it,\u2019 says Suze confidently. \u2018Why would he search on YouTube? I bet he never goes on YouTube. He\u2019s too busy. It\u2019s only tragic cases like you and me who are always online.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m about to object that I am not a tragic case, when the doorbell rings and we all start.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not him, is it?\u2019 says Janice in a gasped whisper, clapping a hand over her heart.</p><p>Honestly. Janice does overreact. I hardly spilled my coffee at all.</p><p>\u2018Of course not. It\u2019ll be the marquee guys.\u2019</p><p>But it\u2019s not them, it\u2019s Danny. He\u2019s standing on the doorstep, wearing a battered leather coat over ripped jeans and silver Converse, and holding a pile of garment bags.</p><p>\u2018Costumes, anyone?\u2019 he says, deadpan.</p><p>\u2018Danny, you star!\u2019 I seize them. \u2018I can\u2019t believe you did this!\u2019</p> <p>I peek inside one of the bags and see a flash of gold brocade, trimmed with twinkling lace. Oh my God. These will be perfect.</p><p>\u2018Well, I had to. Jesus. That mother-in-law of yours is like Stalin. She\u2019s the worst boss I ever had.\u2019 He looks around, haunted. \u2018She isn\u2019t here, is she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not right now,\u2019 I say reassuringly. \u2018But Suze is. So beware. She\u2019s still really furious with you about that photoshoot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Danny looks uncomfortable and takes a step away. \u2018The thing with that is, Suze just didn\u2019t understand the aesthetic. You have to remember, she\u2019s not a creative person.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes she is! She\u2019s an artist! Look at her photo frames!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019 Danny tries a different tack. \u2018Well, OK, she is a creative person, but she totally didn\u2019t get the look I was going for ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes I did!\u2019 Suze\u2019s voice rings out scornfully behind me. \u2018I got \u201cthe look\u201d perfectly! You stitched Tarkie up, Danny! Admit it!\u2019</p><p>Danny looks at her silently for a moment. He seems to be considering his next move. \u2018If I admit it,\u2019 he says finally, \u2018will you forgive me instantly, no questions, move right on?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ...\u2019 Suze hesitates. \u2018Well ... I suppose so.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018OK, I stitched him up. Love you too.\u2019 Danny plants a kiss on her cheek and heads past me into the house. \u2018Do you have any coffee? Janice!\u2019 He greets her flamboyantly. \u2018My style icon! My muse! What is that fetching shade of lipstick?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s ... impossible!\u2019</p><p>Suze looks so infuriated, I\u2019m about to offer her a squirt of Rescue Remedy. But a noise from outside attracts my attention. A big lorry is pulling into Janice\u2019s drive. Its reversers are bleeping and a guy in jeans is beckoning it in. That must be the marquee!</p><p>OK. This party really is starting.</p> <p>By four o\u2019clock, the marquee is up in Janice\u2019s garden. It isn\u2019t decorated yet, but it still looks fab, all big and billowy. (My little gazebo is up, too, at the side. Elinor\u2019s marquee guys haven\u2019t stopped teasing me about it.) I\u2019ll have to make sure Luke doesn\u2019t catch a glimpse \u2013 but by the time he gets back tonight it\u2019ll be dark, anyway. Janice wanted me to sew all the curtains together, but I think that would just be weird.</p><p>Gary managed to spin out his nervous-breakdown act for three hours, and now Luke\u2019s with Davina, doing his medical in some basement suite at her hospital. She\u2019s just phoned to give me an update.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got him on the treadmill for an hour to assess his heart. He\u2019s really not enjoying this,\u2019 she adds cheerily. \u2018So where will he go after me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... don\u2019t quite know,\u2019 I admit. \u2018I\u2019ll call you back.\u2019</p><p>I haven\u2019t yet formulated the next part of the Luke-containment plan, and it\u2019s starting to worry me \u2013 especially as now there are thirteen \u2018Happy Birthday Luke Brandon\u2019 videos on YouTube. All day, Martin\u2019s been going online to look, and shouting out \u2018There\u2019s a new one!\u2019 And now someone\u2019s created a web-page called happybirthdaylukebrandon.com, which has links to them all and invites people to post their funny/fond/rude stories about \u2018The City\u2019s King of Spin\u2019, which is what they\u2019re calling Luke.</p> <p>The whole thing makes my mind boggle. Who\u2019s done that? Danny\u2019s theory is, no one in the City is doing any work at the moment and they\u2019re all dead bored, so they\u2019ve seized on this as a diversion.</p><p>\u2018Number fourteen\u2019s just gone up,\u2019 calls out Martin from his laptop as I put the phone down. \u2018Some girls from Prestwick PR, singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 like Marilyn Monroe. In the nude,\u2019 he adds.</p><p>\u2018Nude?\u2019 I hurry over to see, followed swiftly by Suze.</p><p>OK, so they\u2019re not totally nude. Their crucial bits are hidden by office plants and files and corners of photocopiers. But honestly. Don\u2019t they know Luke\u2019s married? Especially that one with the dark curly hair and the swivelly hips. I hope she\u2019s not coming to the party.</p><p>\u2018What are you going to do with Luke next?\u2019 says Suze, who overheard me talking to Davina. \u2018I mean, he can\u2019t do a medical all day, can he? He must be spitting by now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I bite my lip. \u2018I thought I\u2019d get Bonnie to send him loads of emails. Like, pages of really dense paperwork, saying it\u2019s urgent and he\u2019s got to read it all at once.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And tomorrow?\u2019 persists Suze.</p><p>\u2018Dunno. More paperwork, I suppose.\u2019</p><p>Suze is shaking her head. \u2018You need something bigger. What is the one thing that you can guarantee will grab his attention? Like with Tarkie I know exactly what I\u2019d say. I\u2019d say the Historical Society have phoned with evidence that Great-Great-Great-Uncle Albert didn\u2019t fire the cannon, after all. He\u2019d drop everything instantly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 I stare at Suze in admiration. \u2018That\u2019s really specific. Who was Great-Great-Great-Uncle Albert?\u2019</p><p>Suze makes a face. \u2018It\u2019s quite boring. Do you really want to know?\u2019</p><p>Hmm. Maybe not.</p><p>\u2018The point is, I know what presses Tarkie\u2019s buttons,\u2019 Suze is saying. \u2018And you know Luke. So what will get him going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A work crisis,\u2019 I say after a moment\u2019s thought. \u2018That\u2019s all I can think of. He always jumps when some big client is in trouble.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Can you invent a work crisis?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019 On impulse, I reach for my phone and call Bonnie.</p><p>\u2018Hey, Bonnie. Have you seen the latest YouTube?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh Becky,\u2019 begins Bonnie miserably. \u2018I feel so wretched. If only I hadn\u2019t sent that email\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry about that now,\u2019 I say quickly. \u2018But maybe we can use the fact that everyone knows. Could you email his clients and say we\u2019re trying to distract him till tomorrow night and ask them to invent a crisis that will keep him busy?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018What sort of crisis?\u2019 says Bonnie doubtfully.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know! They could pretend they\u2019re going bust, or make up some sex scandal ... anything! Just to keep him occupied for a few hours. Tell them that anyone who comes up with any ideas should call you and you can coordinate them.\u2019</p><p>One of his clients will come up with something clever. I mean, if they can make videos then they can invent a crisis, surely?</p><p>Already my phone is ringing again and I glance at the ID as I answer, but it\u2019s not a number I know.</p> <p>\u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rebecca?\u2019 booms a jolly voice.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say cautiously. \u2018Who\u2019s this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eric Foreman, Daily World. Remember me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eric!\u2019 I exclaim in delight. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p> <p>Eric is a journalist at the Daily World and I first met him when I was a financial journalist. I use to write pieces for him, in fact, but then I gave that up and we lost touch. How come he\u2019s tracked me down?</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m good, my beauty. Just putting together a piece about your husband\u2019s birthday for the City diary and I was after a quote from you. Or even better, him. Is he around?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I stare at the phone, aghast. \u2018Why are you doing a piece about his birthday?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you joking? Prime bit of gossip like this? Have you seen YouTube? Have you seen how many hits he\u2019s got?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I say desperately. \u2018But that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. It was supposed to be a secret!\u2019</p><p>Eric\u2019s guffaw of laughter nearly deafens me. \u2018Is that your quote?\u2019 he says. \u2018 \u201dIt was supposed to be a secret?\u201d I\u2019ve been emailed about it eight times today already. I thought this was your own viral campaign, my love.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No! I want it to stop!\u2019</p><p>He roars with laughter again. \u2018You can\u2019t control it now. It\u2019s all over the place. Even people who don\u2019t know him are passing it on. You know the marketing team from Atlas Fund Management are on retreat in Kent? They\u2019ve written \u201cHappy Birthday Luke\u201d with their cars in the car park. Just sent me the picture. I\u2019m going to print it tomorrow unless I get a better one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I nearly shout in horror. \u2018You can\u2019t! I\u2019m throwing Luke a surprise party! Which means he\u2019s supposed to be surprised.\u2019 I feel hot with frustration. Doesn\u2019t anyone get this?</p><p>\u2018Oh, this gets better and better. So he has no idea, does he?\u2019</p><p>\u2018None!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And the party\u2019s tomorrow night?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say automatically, then curse myself. Eric might be my friend, but first and foremost he\u2019s a tabloid journalist.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t let him near the Daily World, then.\u2019 Eric gives a laugh. \u2018I\u2019ll be featuring this as my main story. The City needs a good cheer-up after all that\u2019s happened recently. You, young lady, have given everyone a reason to have a bit of fun. I\u2019m not spiking that. General features editor\u2019ll be on to you too, I\u2019m sure.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018But\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018And we won\u2019t be the only ones, either. So you\u2019d better keep your old man away from the press.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! You can\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>But he\u2019s gone. I stare dumbly at the phone. This can\u2019t be happening. My top-secret, surprise party which no one was supposed to know about ... is being printed in the newspapers?</p><p>By the evening, I\u2019m just about holding it together, even though there are now twenty-three YouTube tributes and Eric has already put a piece about Luke\u2019s party on the Daily World online City page. I\u2019ve sent a desperate email out to all the guests and Brandon Communications clients, telling them the party is still a surprise and asking them please, please not to try and contact Luke.</p><p>Bonnie has biked round a big pile of paperwork to distract Luke tonight, and a couple of friendly clients have agreed to try and occupy him tomorrow with various made-up issues. But none of them sounds that convincing. To be honest, I\u2019m stressed out. We still have a whole night and day before the party and the whole world knows about it and there\u2019s a massive great marquee flapping next door. I mean, how am I going to keep this a secret?</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry. Not long now.\u2019 Suze gives me a kiss, her coat and scarf already on. \u2018I\u2019ll be off now. See you tomorrow for the big day!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Suze.\u2019 I catch her hands. \u2018Thanks so much. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without you, and Tarkie and ... and everything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s been fun! Anyway, Elinor did most of it. And Bex ...\u2019 She pauses, suddenly more serious. \u2018Luke will be blown away. He really will.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You really think so?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know it.

I\u2019ve been on the phone so long today, I feel like my vocal cords are wearing out. At last I summon the energy to pick it up. I don\u2019t recognize the number, which is no surprise.</p><p>\u2018Hello? Becky here.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 comes a soft, female voice. \u2018You don\u2019t know me, but my name is Sage Seymour.\u2019</p><p>What?</p><p>A huge spurt of adrenalin shoots through me, like three cans of Red Bull and winning the Olympics, all at once. I\u2019m talking to Sage Seymour? She knows my name?</p><p>Sage Seymour is sitting somewhere, holding a phone, talking to me. Ooh, I wonder what she\u2019s wearing. I mean, not in a pervy way. Just in a\u2014</p><p>Come on, Becky. Answer.</p> <p>\u2018Oh. Oh hi.\u2019 I\u2019m trying desperately to sound cool, but my stupid voice has shot up three octaves. \u2018Um, hi! Hi!\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t seem to move off the word \u2018hi\u2019.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve hired your husband to do some publicity work,\u2019 she says, her lilting voice totally familiar now. \u2018But I guess you know that.\u2019</p><p>My mind scampers in panic. Do I know? I mean, obviously not officially. But if I say Luke hasn\u2019t told me, does it sound weird? Like he\u2019s not interested or never talks to his wife?</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s so exciting!\u2019 I swallow. \u2018I\u2019m a huge fan.\u2019</p><p>I want to shoot myself. I sound so lame.</p> <p>\u2018It was a bit \u201cout there\u201d as a choice. But, you know, I was so sick of Hollywood bullshitters. Your husband had more sensible ideas for me in ten minutes than any of those bozos.\u2019</p><p>I feel a flash of pride. I knew Luke would do a good job.</p><p>\u2018So, I heard about your party,\u2019 Sage adds casually. \u2018Sounds like a big deal.\u2019</p><p>G\u2019uh? How does she\u2014</p><p>\u2018Y-yes,\u2019 I stutter. \u2018I mean, pretty big ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I went on YouTube. Awesome tributes. Then my assistant got the email from Bonnie. You need to distract Luke, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes! It\u2019s all got out on the internet, and it\u2019s supposed to be a big surprise and\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018How about I keep him busy for you?\u2019 says Sage calmly. \u2018I could demand he comes to the set. Throw a diva hissy. I can put on a good show. Once he\u2019s at the set we\u2019ll take care of him. Show him around, keep him occupied till you need him. Then we\u2019ll send him off in a car.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 I gulp. \u2018That would be amazing.\u2019</p><p>I am so jealous. I want to go to the movie set. I want to be shown around. I\u2019m frantically trying to think of an essential reason why I should go there too, when she adds, \u2018You used to be on the telly, right? Morning Coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I say in amazement.</p><p>\u2018I used to watch you when I was off work. You were funny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... thanks!\u2019 I gulp.</p><p>\u2018We should have a drink some time.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s like the world tips on its side. I grip the phone, wondering if I just dreamed that. Sage Seymour has suggested we have a drink? A top, Oscar-winning movie star has suggested we have a drink? My whole life I\u2019ve fantasized about this moment. I mean, I always felt it was meant to be. Didn\u2019t I say? Didn\u2019t I know all along I was meant to mix with movie stars?</p><p>Maybe we\u2019ll become best friends!</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll be a bridesmaid at her wedding. You know, if she gets married or anything. I wouldn\u2019t need to be the one standing next to her. I could be three along.</p><p>\u2018That would be ... great.\u2019 I somehow manage to get the words out.</p><p>\u2018Cool. Well, don\u2019t worry about Luke. It\u2019s in hand. And good luck tomorrow! Bye, Becky.\u2019</p><p>And just like that, she\u2019s gone. Feverishly I save her number in my phone. Sage Seymour. In my phone. Sage Seymour. Just like she\u2019s any of my friends.</p><p>Oh my God, this is so cool.</p><p>I\u2019m just sending a quick text to Gary and Bonnie \u2013 Good news! Sage Seymour says she will take care of Luke tomorrow till party \u2013 when I hear the crackling sound of Luke\u2019s key in the front door. I thrust my phone away and grab a magazine.</p><p>OK. Act natural. I have not just been chatting with my new best friend Sage Seymour.</p><p>\u2018Hi there!\u2019 I say, glancing up. \u2018Good day? How was Gary?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck knows.\u2019 Luke shakes his head. \u2018He was making no sense at all. I\u2019ve told him he needs a holiday.\u2019 He grimaces as he takes off his coat. \u2018Bloody hell. My arm. I\u2019ve had five thousand jabs.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh dear!\u2019 I say sympathetically. \u2018Well, I\u2019m sure they were all necessary.

Sure enough, after a little while, Luke curses again.</p><p>\u2018Bloody thing\u2019s got no internet access!\u2019 He jabs at it a few times. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with this bloody server?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh dear,\u2019 I say innocently. \u2018Never mind. Well, why not just deal with the paperwork? You can sort out your laptop tomorrow. Have you eaten? Would you like some risotto? Janice brought some round.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m just heating up the risotto in the kitchen when I hear Luke\u2019s phone ring.</p><p>\u2018Luke Brandon.\u2019 I can just about hear him answer. \u2018Oh, Sage! Hello there. Just wait a minute ...\u2019</p><p>The living-room door is shut. Damn.</p><p>I hesitate for a moment \u2013 then tiptoe through the hall and press my ear to the door.</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u2019 Luke is saying. \u2018Of course you\u2019re our number-one priority. Sage ... Listen, Sage ... No one\u2019s saying that, Sage ...\u2019</p> <p>Yes! She\u2019s obviously giving a brilliant show. Well, of course she is. She\u2019s an actress.</p><p>\u2018Well, of course I can ... 8 a.m.? At Pinewood. OK, fine. I\u2019ll see you there.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence from the living room, and I wonder whether to tiptoe away, when I hear his voice again.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie? It\u2019s Luke here. Just had Sage Seymour on the phone. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s confirmed every suspicion I ever had. Nightmare woman. She\u2019s insisting I come to her movie set first thing tomorrow.\u2019 He pauses. \u2018I don\u2019t know why! This has come out of nowhere! She was talking gibberish about press statements and strategies, she seems totally self-obsessed, paranoid we\u2019re not taking enough interest ... Anyway, I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m on my way back to the office.\u2019 He lowers his voice, so I have to press even harder against the door to hear. \u2018Thank goodness I didn\u2019t tell Becky. Something told me to wait until we knew it was going to work out\u2014\u2019 He breaks off. \u2018No! Of course I haven\u2019t mentioned that to Becky yet. It\u2019s only a possibility. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we need to.\u2019</p><p>My ears prick up. What\u2019s a possibility? What bridge?</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Bonnie. Thanks for that.\u2019</p><p>Shit. He\u2019s coming. I dart back to the kitchen, where of course the risotto has burned at the bottom of the pan. I\u2019m briskly stirring the burnt bits into the rest when Luke comes in.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got an early start tomorrow, by the way,\u2019 he says guardedly. \u2018Seeing a client.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Have some food, then.\u2019 I put a plate down in front of him, like a perfect, unsuspicious wife. \u2018Big day tomorrow. Your birthday, remember?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit. Of course it is.\u2019 Alarm briefly crosses his face. \u2018Becky, you haven\u2019t made any plans, have you? You know we\u2019ve got this big company training programme? It\u2019ll go on into the evening, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 I manage an easy tone. \u2018No worries! We\u2019ll do something nice on Saturday.\u2019</p><p>Oh God. I can\u2019t cope. My mouth keeps twitching with faint hysteria and I feel as if thought bubbles must be floating above my head.</p><p>There\u2019s a marquee outside the window! It\u2019s your party tomorrow! We\u2019re all in on the surprise except you!</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he hasn\u2019t guessed. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve kept it secret for this long. I feel like there\u2019s only the thinnest curtain hiding everything in my brain and any minute he\u2019ll sweep it aside and see the lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke is surveying me with a perplexed frown. \u2018Is something up?

Everything\u2019s in place and it all looks breathtaking. Everyone\u2019s in position. The team-leaders have had their final meeting. Elinor\u2019s in overdrive. She and Jess have become a sort of sub-team, ticking off lists and double-checking every detail obsessively together. In fact there\u2019s a competitive spirit growing between them, as they locate all the glitches and find solutions as fast as possible, like crack party troubleshooters.</p><p>Jess keeps telling Elinor that she\u2019s a talented woman, and she should come out to Chile and use her organizational skills for something worthwhile, and has she ever thought about voluntary work? To which Elinor just puts on that blank, stony expression. (I couldn\u2019t help retorting to Jess yesterday: who says a party isn\u2019t worthwhile?)</p><p>Luke is still with Sage on her movie set at Pinewood and she keeps sending me updates by text. Apparently everyone\u2019s in on the secret, the whole cast and crew. They confiscated his new mobile phone as soon as he arrived, and plonked him on a director\u2019s chair with earphones. When he got restless, they showed him around all the sets and trailers. Then they gave him lunch. Then Sage made up a load of stuff to complain about. Then they plonked him back on the director\u2019s chair. Every time he tries to speak to her she says \u2018Shh! I have to concentrate!\u2019 or the director tells him off.</p><p>So basically, he\u2019s taken care of until six o\u2019clock. Then Bonnie is going to ring him and say she sent over a vital contract to the house by mistake and it needs signing today, so could he go and sign it and fax it to her? And the car will bring him back here. And I\u2019ll greet him at the door. And then ...</p><p>Every time I think about it I get goosebumps. I can\u2019t wait. I can\u2019t wait!</p><p>The caterers are scurrying about in Janice\u2019s kitchen. The marquee is lit up like a spaceship. Janice\u2019s garden is like a festival of bunting.</p><p>Now I just need to have a bath and do my nails and get Minnie ready ...</p><p>\u2018Hello, Becky, love.\u2019</p><p>Mum\u2019s voice nearly makes me drop my cup of tea all over the floor. She must have let herself in without me hearing.</p><p>My stomach flips with apprehension as she comes into the room. I\u2019m not ready for this. The only communication I\u2019ve had with Mum has been cryptic back-and-forth texts during the last few days via Janice\u2019s mobile.</p><p>It all kicked off when Janice asked Mum and Dad for drinks before the party, whereupon Mum replied that if her own daughter wasn\u2019t going to invite her then she wasn\u2019t going to come. Janice texted back that she was sure Mum was invited, didn\u2019t she have an invitation? Mum replied touchily that she\u2019d been disinvited. So I told Janice that Mum was only disinvited if she wanted to be. And Mum said that she wasn\u2019t going to impose herself where she wasn\u2019t welcome. Then Dad chipped in and rang Janice and said we were all being ridiculous. And that was kind of where it was left.</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 I swallow. \u2018Hi, Mum.

She\u2019s the one who\u2019s been living it up with mud wraps and cocktails. How come she gets to be stiff and resentful?</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I pause a moment, then add with a shrug, \u2018You were right, by the way. It was all nearly a disaster. Turns out I couldn\u2019t do it on my own.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Love, no one ever said you had to do it on your own. And I\u2019m sorry I said ...\u2019 Mum trails off awkwardly.</p> <p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m sorry too,\u2019 I say, a bit stiffly. \u2018I hope I don\u2019t let you down tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t aware that I was invited.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... I wasn\u2019t aware that you weren\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019re both standing at angles to each other, our chins averted. I\u2019m not sure where we go from here.</p><p>\u2018Oh, love.\u2019 Mum\u2019s cool fa\u00e7ade crumbles first. \u2018Let\u2019s not argue! I\u2019m sorry I ever mentioned ... you-know-who. Mr Wham! Club Tropicana fellow. Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know who you mean,\u2019 I say hastily, before she does the whole of Wham! Rap.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to put you down. I was just anxious for you, love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mum, you don\u2019t need to worry about me!\u2019 I roll my eyes. \u2018I\u2019m a grown-up, remember? I\u2019m twenty-nine. I\u2019m a mother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m a mother!\u2019 She claps a hand to her chest dramatically. \u2018You wait, love! It doesn\u2019t go away! Ever!\u2019</p><p>Oh my God. Is that true? Am I still going to be stressing about Minnie when she\u2019s twenty-nine and married?</p><p>No. No way. I\u2019m nothing like Mum. I\u2019ll be on a Caribbean cruise by then, having a good time.</p> <p>\u2018Anyway,\u2019 Mum\u2019s saying, \u2018Dad and I have done a lot of talking over the last few days, in the steam room and during massages ...\u2019</p><p>Honestly. Have my parents once made it out of the spa?</p><p>\u2018I can see why you might have felt you needed to mislead us about the house,\u2019 Mum presses on, her face pink. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I overreacted, love. And I realize I\u2019ve been a bit ... tense, these last few weeks.\u2019 She sighs gustily. \u2018It\u2019s just been a tricky time, what with all of us in the house ... and the Cutting Back didn\u2019t help ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 Instantly I\u2019m full of remorse. \u2018And we\u2019ve been so grateful to live here ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to feel grateful! This is your home, love!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But even so, it was too long. No wonder we all got a bit tetchy. I\u2019m sorry all our stuff stressed you out, and I\u2019m sorry about fibbing ...\u2019 My cool fa\u00e7ade has totally crumbled too. \u2018And of course I want you to come to the party, if you want to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I want to! Janice says it\u2019s going to be wonderful. She says she\u2019s doing touch-ups! She\u2019s bought three extra tubes of Touche \u00e9clat!\u2019</p><p>I have to talk to Janice.</p> <p>\u2018It is going to be wonderful.

And the decorations.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, love, come here.\u2019 Mum holds out her arms for a hug and squeezes me tight. \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be wonderful! Janice says it\u2019s a Pride and Prejudice theme now? Luke\u2019ll look super as Mr Darcy! I\u2019ve bought a bonnet and Dad\u2019s got some breeches, and I\u2019m going to curl my hair\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I draw away. \u2018It\u2019s not bloody Pride and Prejudice! Where did that come from?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Mum looks taken aback. \u2018Well, I\u2019m sure Janice said she was wearing that lovely blue dress from the am dram production ...\u2019</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. Just because Janice is wearing her Mrs Bennet costume, suddenly the whole thing is Pride and Prejudice?</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not Pride and Prejudice. And it\u2019s not Japanese. So don\u2019t get any ideas about kimonos.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what is it? Is there a theme?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Kind of.\u2019 I debate internally for a moment \u2013 then make a snap decision. \u2018Come and see.\u2019</p><p>I pull her into the kitchen, unlock my box file and pull out Danny\u2019s drawings. \u2018Here are the designs.

Don\u2019t say a word to anybody.\u2019</p><p>Mum peers at them uncertainly for a moment \u2013 then recognition flashes over her face.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Becky,\u2019 she says at last. \u2018Oh, love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I can\u2019t help beaming. \u2018Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was me who insisted it should be an individual, bespoke party that would be more meaningful to Luke than to anybody else there. And it was me who came up with the actual idea. But to be truthful, it was Elinor who made all this happen.

Somehow Elinor\u2019s managed to orchestrate everything from the background.

Even Janice has no idea.</p> <p>Which is making me feel more and more uncomfortable as time goes on. I mean, Elinor has done so much. She should get the credit. But what can I do about it?</p><p>\u2018So what have you done with Luke?\u2019 Mum looks around, as though I might have stuffed him in a cupboard.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s fine. He\u2019s on a film set with this new client of his.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Film set?\u2019 Mum goggles.</p><p>\u2018Sssh! I\u2019m not supposed to know about it! He\u2019s being taken care of for another three hours.\u2019 I glance at my watch. \u2018Then he\u2019s coming here and ... surprise!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And what are you going to wear, Becky love?\u2019 Mum interrupts my thoughts, her eyes suddenly bright and inquisitive. \u2018Have you bought something new?\u2019</p><p>For a while I pretend I didn\u2019t hear the question. I\u2019ve been avoiding thinking about this.</p><p>\u2018Becky? Have you bought something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I say finally. \u2018I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m going to pick something out of my wardrobe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Darling!\u2019 Mum sounds astonished. \u2018That\u2019s not like you!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I sink down into a chair and pick at my nails, my spirits deflating a little. \u2018But I couldn\u2019t go shopping, could I? Not after I\u2019d promised Luke.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He didn\u2019t mean for a party, surely. I mean, surely he\u2019d make an exception\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to risk it. You don\u2019t understand, Mum, he\u2019s taking it all really seriously. Nanny Sue said I\u2019m a shopaholic,\u2019 I add gloomily. \u2018She said I need to go to boot camp or Minnie will turn into one too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Mum looks satisfactorily outraged. \u2018What nonsense! Don\u2019t listen to a word of it. Money-making charlatans, all of them. Boot camp sounds like \u201crip-off\u201d to me. You\u2019re not going to go, are you, love?\u2019</p><p>I love Mum. She always says the right thing.</p><p>\u2018Dunno. Maybe. The point is, Luke totally believed her.\u2019 I sigh. \u2018And after all, it\u2019s his birthday. It\u2019s his day. How would I be making it his day by buying myself a new dress?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t want to admit to the scenario I\u2019m secretly afraid of \u2013which is that I organize a brilliant surprise party but then ruin it when he asks me how much my new shoes cost and we end up having a row.</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019ve decided, Mum.\u2019 I raise my head. \u2018It\u2019s something out of my wardrobe. I\u2019m adamant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... good for you, love.\u2019 She gives me an encouraging smile. \u2018Tell you what, let\u2019s go and look in your wardrobe right now. See what we can find. Chop, chop!\u2019</p> <p>As I follow her up the stairs, my feet are heavy. This is why I\u2019ve been putting off the whole outfit moment. Everyone else will have a new dress tonight, even Minnie.</p><p>Anyway. Never mind. I made a promise and I have to make the best of it. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have any clothes.</p><p>\u2018So, did you have any ideas?\u2019 says Mum as we enter the room. \u2018What\u2019s already in your wardrobe?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe my black lace dress?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to sound upbeat. \u2018Or that blue dress I wore before Christmas? Or maybe\u2014\u2019 I open the wardrobe door and stop mid-stream. What\u2019s that?</p><p>What\u2019s that brand-new posh garment carrier from The Look, hanging right in the middle of my wardrobe? And why has it got a big red bow on it?</p><p>\u2018Open it!\u2019 Mum says excitedly. \u2018Go on!\u2019</p><p>Shooting her looks of suspicion, I pull it open. I see a glimpse of sumptuous dark-green silk and inhale sharply. No. That can\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>I drag the zip all the way down, just to be sure ... And it flows out of the garment carrier, like a deep-green glimmering river.</p><p>It\u2019s the Valentino.</p><p>It\u2019s the Valentino dress with the single jewelled shoulder which came into The Look a month ago. I must have tried it on about twenty times, but there\u2019s no way I could ever afford it and\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I suddenly spot a gift card tied to the hanger and open it with scrabbling fingers.</p><p>To Becky.

We\u2019ve disagreed about Wendy\u2019s Boutique many times, over the years.</p><p>\u2018Anyway. I asked your nice colleague Jasmine what I should get and she suggested this dress at once. And she gave it to me at the discount staff rate, with another big discount for damage!\u2019 she ends in triumph.</p><p>\u2018Damage?\u2019 I peer at it. \u2018It\u2019s not damaged!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018She snipped the hem,\u2019 says Mum conspiratorially. \u2018She\u2019s clever, that one. And then all your nice friends rallied round and chipped in. So it\u2019s from them, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What friends?\u2019 I\u2019m not following this at all. \u2018You mean Jasmine?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! All your shopping friends. Your clients! They were all there, you know. They signed a card, too. Where is it?\u2019 She starts to root around in her bag. \u2018Here we are.\u2019</p><p>She presents me with a plain Smythson card, on which someone has scrawled: \u2018Have a great time tonight, Becky, and see you back at The Look VERY SOON! With all our love from Davina, Chloe and all your loyal friends.\u2019</p><p>Underneath are about twenty more signatures, and I read them in growing bewilderment.</p><p>\u2018But what were they all doing at the store at once?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Getting refunds!\u2019 says Mum, as though it\u2019s obvious. \u2018Didn\u2019t you know? They\u2019ve started a campaign to reinstate you!\u2019</p><p>She hands me a bright-pink, printed piece of paper and I take it in disbelief. Is this what Davina was talking about?</p><p>BRING BACK BECKY!!!</p><p>We, the undersigned, would like to protest at the treatment of our esteemed friend and fashion consultant, Becky Brandon (n\u00e9e Bloomwood).</p><p>As a result of her callous and unjustified treatment by The Look we will be</p><p>\u2013 Boycotting the Personal Shopping Department</p><p>\u2013 Spreading the word amongst our friends and contacts, and</p><p>\u2013 Unshopping with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u2018Unshopping?\u2019 I look up with a giggle. \u2018What does that mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re returning everything they\u2019ve bought,\u2019 says Mum with satisfaction. \u2018Quite right, too. There was a whole line of them, beautifully dressed, all bringing back expensive things, still in their wrappers. All getting the money back on their gold cards. I dread to think how much it was all worth. One woman had three long dresses. Yves Saint whatsit? Five thousand pounds each, apparently. Blonde woman from Russia or some such?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olenka?\u2019 I say in astonishment. \u2018Those dresses were special order. She returned them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She threw them down on the counter like this.\u2019 Mum demonstrates with a flamboyant gesture. \u2018Quite dramatic, isn\u2019t she? \u201cThees is for Becky and thees is for Becky.\u201d Then the manager came down to the department.\u2019 Mum is warming to her tale. \u2018I can tell you, he got the heebie-jeebies when he saw how long the queue was. Quite flustered, he was. He said, \u201cLadies, please reconsider.\u201d Offered them all a free cappuccino. But they laughed at him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I bet they did!\u2019 I can just imagine Trevor trying to keep control of all my clients. They\u2019re a pretty sassy lot.</p><p>\u2018So if he isn\u2019t on the phone to you apologizing within the day, then I\u2019m a monkey\u2019s uncle,\u2019 says Mum comfortably. \u2018From what I heard, you should be claiming from them, love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait.\u2019 Suddenly the blood is pulsing in my face. \u2018Wait a minute. Mum, I never told you I\u2019d been suspended from work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know you didn\u2019t,\u2019 she says equably. \u2018I was a bit surprised, I must admit. I mean, I knew it was your day off. I didn\u2019t realize every day was your day off now!\u2019 She laughs merrily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018So you came here ...\u2019 I say disbelievingly, \u2018and you knew I\u2019d been suspended and you didn\u2019t say a word?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s there to say? You\u2019ll work it out. We do worry about you, Becky. But we\u2019ve got faith in you, too.\u2019 Mum pats my hand. \u2018You\u2019ll be all right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh Mum.\u2019 I look from the Valentino to her kind, cosy face, feeling the tears rise again. \u2018I can\u2019t believe you bought me a dress.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, love.\u2019 She pats my hand again. \u2018We\u2019ve had such a super time at The West Place. We wanted to say thank you. Shoes too!\u2019 She nods at a shoe box at the bottom of the wardrobe.</p> <p>\u2018Shoes too?\u2019 I grab the box.</p><p>\u2018Yes, Cinderella!\u2019 Mum twinkles. \u2018I hear even Jess is wearing a lovely new frock for the occasion.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She is now.\u2019 I roll my eyes.</p><p>Jess\u2019s dress has been such a saga. At first she was going to order this drab unbleached cotton shift from the worthy-lentil catalogue. So I said she had to wear something more glam and she got on her high horse and said why should she support throwaway consumerism just for one night? Whereupon I said, \u2018I meant you should borrow something. All the celebs do it, and it\u2019s far more green than buying something out of a catalogue.\u2019 To which she couldn\u2019t find an answer. So she\u2019ll be in an exclusive Danny Kovitz number and there\u2019s no way she can get out of it.</p><p>I\u2019m ripping the shoe box open in excitement as my mobile rings.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll get it, love.\u2019 Mum reaches over to the chair where my mobile\u2019s lying. \u2018It\u2019s ...\u2019 She peers more closely at the screen and her mouth drops open. \u2018Sage Seymour? Sage Seymour the actress?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I giggle. \u2018Ssh! Be cool!\u2019</p><p>I expect Sage will be giving me another update on Luke. Last time she phoned, he was eating a burrito and talking to the choreographer, apparently.</p><p>\u2018Hi Sage! How\u2019s it going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s gone!\u2019 She sounds desperate. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. We\u2019ve lost him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I sit back on my heels, a piece of tissue paper trailing from my fingers. \u2018But ... how?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He just upped and left. Booked himself a car and went. Didn\u2019t even pick up his mobile from the floor manager. I was in make-up, I had no idea ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long ago?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Half an hour, maybe?\u2019</p><p>Half an hour? My pulse is quickening in alarm. \u2018So, where\u2019s the car gone? Can you find out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! It\u2019s not even one of ours. Apparently he\u2019d been saying he needed to go and the line producer had been promising to get him a car as soon as one was ready, you know, stringing him along ... But I guess he couldn\u2019t wait.\u2019</p><p>That is so typical of Luke. He can\u2019t just sit still and enjoy being on a movie set like any normal person. He has to organize himself a car and go back to work. Celebrities are wasted on him.</p><p>\u2018I need to get back,\u2019 Sage is saying. \u2018But Becky, I\u2019m sorry. We fucked up.\u2019 She sounds genuinely apologetic.</p><p>\u2018No! Don\u2019t be silly! You did an amazing job. It\u2019s not your fault he left. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find him.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, let me know how it works out, yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 I turn off my phone, breathing hard, and look at Mum. \u2018You won\u2019t believe this. Luke\u2019s gone missing. No one knows where he is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, ring him, love! He\u2019ll have his mobile\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018He hasn\u2019t got a mobile!\u2019 I almost wail. \u2018I broke his BlackBerry and he had some crappy substitute which he\u2019s left behind. I don\u2019t know what car company he\u2019s using. I mean, I guess he\u2019s heading back to the office, but I don\u2019t know ...\u2019</p><p>I feel a drumbeat of panic as the full enormity of this sinks in. What if he\u2019s not on his way to the office? What if he\u2019s coming here? He could stumble on the whole thing before we\u2019re ready.</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 I snap into action. \u2018We need to warn everybody. I\u2019ll call Bonnie, you tell Janice, we\u2019ll call all the car companies ... we\u2019ll track him down.\u2019</p><p>Within ten minutes, I\u2019ve got everyone gathered in Janice\u2019s kitchen for an emergency crisis meeting.</p><p>It\u2019s all even worse than I thought. Bonnie has just forwarded me an email from Luke, which he sent before he left the studio, using the film\u2019s email account. He told her he wouldn\u2019t be able to get back to the office in time for the company training programme, sent his apologies and told her to have a good weekend.</p><p>What the fuck is he doing? Where is he going? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK, Becky. Stay calm. He\u2019ll turn up.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I announce to the assembled group. \u2018Oxshott, we have a major problem. Luke has gone AWOL. Now, I\u2019ve drawn a map.\u2019 I point to my hastily constructed flip chart. \u2018These are the directions he might have gone in from Pinewood Studios. I think we probably can rule out north ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ooh!\u2019 Suze suddenly exclaims, looking at her phone. \u2018Tarkie says one of the Royal Family has seen the YouTube clips and wants to send Luke a happy birthday text. They\u2019re out shooting together,\u2019 she explains bashfully as everyone looks at her, agog.</p><p>\u2018Which member?\u2019 Janice clasps her hands. \u2018Not Prince William!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Tarkie didn\u2019t say. It might be Prince Michael of Kent,\u2019 Suze adds apologetically.</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Everyone subsides a little in disappointment.</p><p>\u2018Or David Linley?\u2019 Janice perks up. \u2018I do love his furniture, but have you seen the prices?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it!\u2019 I wave my arms frustratedly. \u2018Focus! Who cares about furniture? This is an emergency. First, we need a lookout stationed outside, so if Luke comes back here we can head him off. Second, we need to think hard where he might have gone. Third\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your phone,\u2019 says Mum suddenly. My BlackBerry is vibrating on the table, with a central London number I don\u2019t recognize.</p> <p>\u2018It might be him!\u2019 says Dad.</p><p>\u2018Ssh!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quiet!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Put him on speaker!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everyone quiet!\u2019</p> <p>It\u2019s as though the terrorist kidnapper is on the line after days of waiting. Everyone goes quiet and watches as I answer.</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becky?\u2019 Luke\u2019s voice is unmistakable. And relaxed. Doesn\u2019t he realize how stressed we\u2019ve all been?</p><p>\u2018Keep him talking!\u2019 hisses Mum as though she\u2019s a federal agent trying to triangulate his position.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Luke! Where are you? At the office?\u2019</p><p>That was good. Play completely ignorant.</p><p>\u2018As it happens, no. I\u2019m at the Berkeley Hotel.\u2019 There\u2019s a smile in his voice. \u2018And I want to invite you and Minnie to join me for a little birthday celebration. If you\u2019re up for it.\u2019</p><p>What-what-what-what-what?</p> <p>I sink down on to a chair, my legs rubbery, trying to block out all the questioning faces around me.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 I falter at last.</p><p>If he has arranged his own birthday party without telling me, I will murder him. I mean it.</p><p>\u2018Darling, I could tell you were disappointed last night when I said I\u2019d be at the training progamme,\u2019 he\u2019s saying. \u2018I could see it in your face.\u2019</p><p>No I wasn\u2019t! I want to yell. I wasn\u2019t! You\u2019re all wrong!</p><p>\u2018Oh yes?\u2019 I manage.</p><p>\u2018And it got me thinking. It\u2019s my birthday! Fuck it, we should celebrate. We\u2019ve got through a hell of a year and we deserve a treat. Let\u2019s meet up, the three of us, have some dinner, drink some champagne ... then we can put Minnie to bed next door and see about making her a little sibling.\u2019 His voice is as seductive and teasing as I\u2019ve ever heard it. \u2018What do you think? I\u2019ve ordered the champagne already.\u2019</p><p>I cannot believe what I\u2019m hearing. Any other time, I would die and go to heaven to hear this invitation. Any other bloody time.</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I say weakly. \u2018Well ... that sounds wonderful! Just ... hang on a minute ...\u2019</p><p>I clamp my hand over the phone and look desperately round at everybody.</p><p>\u2018He wants me to come to a hotel room and drink champagne! For his birthday!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s the party!\u2019 says Janice, who is clearly out to get the Most Obvious Comment prize.</p><p>\u2018I know it\u2019s the party!\u2019 I say, almost savagely. \u2018But how can I say no without looking suspicious?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do both?\u2019 says Suze. \u2018Champagne, celebrate, whatever, whizz back here?\u2019</p><p>I think it through frantically.</p><p>Champagne. Food. Sex.</p><p>We could get it done in ... half an hour? Forty minutes max? We\u2019d still be back in good time.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I come to a decision. \u2018I\u2019ll go up there, play along and bring him back as quickly as I can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t hang around, love.\u2019 Janice looks anxious.</p><p>\u2018Traffic can get nasty this time of day,\u2019 Martin chips in. \u2018I\u2019d grab him and go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can I leave Minnie with you, Mum?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course, love!\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 I take a deep breath and turn to the phone again, trying to sound as syrupy as possible. \u2018Hi Luke. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can. But without Minnie. Mum\u2019s here and she\u2019s going to babysit.

Low, jazzy music is playing and he\u2019s in a robe. A robe.</p> <p>\u2018Well, hello there.\u2019 He smiles and bends to kiss me.</p><p>Oh God. This is all more extreme than I realized. He\u2019s completely switched gear. His rhythm is slower, his voice is lazier, I haven\u2019t seen him look so relaxed since we were on honeymoon. The suite is amazing, too, with panelled walls and plushy sofas and a massive bed. If this were any other time ...</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I pull away. \u2018Well, this is a big surprise!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Total impulse.\u2019 Luke grins. \u2018In fact, this is your doing,\u2019 he adds over his shoulder as he heads to the cocktail bar.</p><p>\u2018Mine?\u2019 Is he joking?</p> <p>\u2018All the times you\u2019ve told me we should relax more, enjoy ourselves, take it easy ... you were right. I hope you\u2019re impressed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say shrilly. \u2018This is fab.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So let\u2019s just kick back. We\u2019ve got all night.\u2019 He hands me a glass and kisses my neck lingeringly. \u2018Shall I run a bath? It\u2019s big enough for two.\u2019</p><p>A bath? How long will that take? I have to nix that idea at once. I have to speed things up. I glance at my watch and feel a twinge of alarm. It\u2019s already later than I thought. We have a party to get to. There is no time for a bath.</p><p>But then ... look at his face. He\u2019ll be crushed. And he\u2019s gone to so much effort and I bet it\u2019s a lovely bath ...</p><p>We could have a really quick bath. In, out, done.</p> <p>\u2018Good idea! I\u2019ll do it!\u2019 I hurry into the sumptuous marble bathroom and whack on the taps.</p><p>Oh wow. Asprey toiletries. I can\u2019t help opening the bath oil and smelling it. Mmm.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t this great?\u2019 Luke has come up behind me and wraps his arms around me, firm and strong. \u2018Just us, all night long. There\u2019s no rush, no hurry ...\u2019</p><p>OK, we have not got time for any of this \u2018all night long\u2019 business.</p><p>\u2018Luke ... um ... we have to have quick sex.\u2019 I turn round, thinking desperately. \u2018We have to have really, really fast, speedy sex because ... I want to conceive a boy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Luke looks dumbfounded. As well he might, since I\u2019m making this all up as I go along.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I nod seriously. \u2018I read a book about it, and it said that you have to have sex really fast. No foreplay. Just ... boom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Boom?\u2019 echoes Luke dubiously.</p> <p>Why is he looking so reluctant? He should be pleased. I mean, if you knew how many times ...</p><p>Anyway. Not relevant, right now.</p><p>\u2018Boom,\u2019 I say firmly. \u2018So ... come on!\u2019</p><p>Why isn\u2019t he moving? Why is he crumpling his brow and sitting on the edge of the bath and looking as though some deep problem has occurred to him?</p><p>\u2018Becky,\u2019 he says at last. \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable aiming for one particular sex of baby or another. I love Minnie. I\u2019d love another Minnie. And if you feel in any way that I\u2019ve been hankering for a son\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! I don\u2019t think that!\u2019 I say hurriedly. \u2018It\u2019s just ... why not? And later on we can try for a girl! Even it up!\u2019</p><p>Even I can tell I\u2019m making no sense, but luckily Luke is used to that.</p><p>\u2018Bath\u2019s ready!\u2019 I rip off my top. \u2018Come on!\u2019</p><p>OK, so I don\u2019t feel it necessary to go into the details of what happens next. And anyway, there hardly are any details. Except we start off in the bath and end up in the shower and we still only take fourteen minutes, and Luke has no idea I\u2019m subtly chivvying him along.</p><p>Well, to be honest, I kind of forgot about the chivvying, once we got down to it. Or to put it another way, we were both chivvying each other along. I don\u2019t want to boast, but I reckon we could have got an Olympic medal in the \u2018underwater pairs formation\u2019, maybe. Or the \u2018synchronized freestyle programme\u2019. Or the ...</p><p>Oh. OK then. Moving on.</p><p>The point is, what a fab way to start the evening. I feel so glowy I won\u2019t even need blusher! And if we get dressed and leave right now ...</p><p>\u2018Want something to eat?\u2019</p><p>As I head into the living room, hastily drying myself, Luke is back in his robe, lolling on the sofa.</p><p>\u2018Have a look at these.\u2019 He gestures at the platter on the table. \u2018Fashion cakes.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fashion cakes?</p><p>In spite of myself, I have to hurry over \u2013 and I can\u2019t help gasping in delight.

Just a quick one.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t this wonderful?\u2019 Luke pulls me against him and I nestle into his chest, feeling lulled into relaxation; feeling his heart beat against my skin. \u2018This has been quite a day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t agree more.\u2019 I take a deep gulp of champagne.</p> <p>\u2018Losing all my technology has been weirdly liberating. I\u2019ve been forty-eight hours now without emails or internet or even a proper phone. And you know what? I\u2019ve survived.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew it.\u2019 I turn my head to look at him. \u2018I think you should have a BlackBerry-free day every week. It\u2019d be good for your health.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe I will,\u2019 says Luke, his hand edging up the inside of my leg again. \u2018Maybe we\u2019ll come here every week. That would be great for my health.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, definitely!\u2019 I giggle. \u2018Here\u2019s to that!\u2019 As I lift my champagne glass my own BlackBerry rings, and I stiffen.</p><p>\u2018Ignore it,\u2019 says Luke comfortably.</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s Mum,\u2019 I say quickly, glancing at the display as I grab it. \u2018It might be about Minnie. I\u2019d better get it ... Hello?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Becky!\u2019 Mum\u2019s voice is so high-pitched and anxious, I jump. \u2018Janice has just seen a traffic alert! Terrible snarl-up on the A3. How are you doing? Have you left yet?\u2019</p><p>I feel a jolt of panic.</p><p>Oh God. What I am doing, drinking champagne and eating cakes? I glance at Luke. He\u2019s lying back on the sofa in his robe, his eyes closed. He looks like he could stay there all night.</p><p>\u2018Er, not yet ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019d get cracking, love! You don\u2019t want to get stuck!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will! We\u2019re on our way. See you soon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 Luke opens one eye as I put down the BlackBerry. I have about ten seconds to think of a fully fledged, convincing story.</p><p>OK. Got it.</p> <p>\u2018Luke, we need to go, right now,\u2019 I say urgently. \u2018Minnie\u2019s hysterical because neither of us kissed her goodnight. So we need to go back to Oxshott, kiss her goodnight, make sure she\u2019s settled and come back. Quick! Get dressed!\u2019 I\u2019m already pulling on my underwear.</p><p>\u2018Go back?\u2019 Luke hauls himself to a sitting position and peers at me. \u2018Becky, are you crazy? We\u2019re not going back!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Minnie\u2019s in a terrible state! Mum said she was going to make herself ill. We can\u2019t just leave her!\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019ll fall asleep and she\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 He calmly takes a sip of champagne and I feel a stab of indignation. I mean, OK, so Minnie isn\u2019t really in a state, but what if she was?</p><p>\u2018How can you say that? She\u2019s our child!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And we\u2019re having a night off! It\u2019s not a crime, Becky. If we go back to Oxshott I guarantee she\u2019ll be asleep before we even get there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I won\u2019t be able to relax! I won\u2019t be able to enjoy myself! How can I sit here and drink champagne when my little girl\u2019s having ...\u2019 My mind roams wildly. \u2018... convulsions?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Convulsions?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mum said she was seriously worried for Minnie\u2019s health. She said she\u2019d never seen anything like it.\u2019 I stare defiantly at Luke. \u2018I\u2019m going, even if you\u2019re not!\u2019</p><p>For a frozen moment I\u2019m petrified he might say, \u2018Fine, you go, see you later.\u2019 But at last he puts his glass down heavily and sighs.</p><p>\u2018Fine. Whatever. We\u2019ll go and kiss her goodnight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great! Perfect!\u2019 I can\u2019t hide my relief. \u2018It\u2019s still early, we can still have a good evening. Let\u2019s take the cakes and the champagne,\u2019 I add casually. \u2018Just in case we\u2019re hungry on the way.\u2019</p><p>No way am I leaving those gorgeous little cakes behind. And as soon as I\u2019m dressed I hurry into the bathroom and scoop all the toiletries into my bag. I\u2019m not leaving those behind either.</p><p>I\u2019m just about ready to go and Luke is putting on his overcoat when my BlackBerry bleeps with a text. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>R u on way to Oxshott yet?

We\u2019re nearly there! It\u2019s nearly his surprise! After all this time, all this planning ...</p><p>Excitement suddenly rushes up through me like a glittering firework and I can\u2019t help giving him a hug. \u2018All right?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I suppose so.\u2019 He raises his eyebrows wryly. \u2018We\u2019d better be getting special parenting angel points for this somewhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure we will.\u2019 Somehow I manage a normal-ish voice \u2013but I can hardly contain myself. This is it! In less than an hour we\u2019re going to arrive and Luke\u2019s face is going to drop and he\u2019s going to be so blown away he can\u2019t even speak ...</p><p>I hurry him out of the lifts and into the foyer. My legs feel light; my whole body is fizzing with anticipation.</p><p>\u2018You check how long the bar\u2019s open,\u2019 I improvise. \u2018I\u2019ll see if I can hail a cab.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve got a car service waiting outside. I\u2019ll pretend I just found it on the street.</p> <p>\u2018Luke? Luke Brandon?\u2019</p><p>A balding businessman leaning against the concierge\u2019s desk has looked up. He\u2019s had quite a few drinks, I instantly realize from his bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u2018Oh. Hello, Don.\u2019 Luke smiles briefly. \u2018How are you? Donald Lister from Alderbury Consulting,\u2019 he introduces him. \u2018This is my wife, Becky.\u2019</p><p>A delighted realization is dawning on the man\u2019s flushed face.</p><p>\u2018Wait a minute. Shit! Luke Brandon! It\u2019s you!\u2019 He points at Luke as though he\u2019s won the prize and is claiming his ten quid. \u2018Bloody hell! Happy birthday, old man! So how was it?\u2019</p><p>The world goes blurry for an instant.</p> <p>OK, we have to leave. Now. Trying not to give away my panic, I put my arm through Luke\u2019s and tug gently, but he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u2018Good, thanks.\u2019 Luke gives a polite, surprised smile. \u2018How on earth did you know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you kidding? Everyone\u2019s been\u2014\u2019 The man breaks off as he sees my face. \u2018Shit.\u2019 He gives an awkward guffaw. \u2018Haven\u2019t given the game away, have I?\u2019</p><p>I want to say something quick and sharp that will neutralize him, I want to rewind, I want to smother this stupid man, get rid of him, go away\u2014</p><p>\u2018Is it the bash tonight?\u2019 The man claps a hand over his mouth. \u2018Were you on your way\u2014 Oh bugger.\u2019</p><p>I want to launch myself at him like a tigress and rip his head off with my teeth. Shut up, shut UP.</p><p>\u2018Sorry, sorry! Didn\u2019t say anything.\u2019 He pats the air a few times as though to bury his words, then hastily heads away across the marble floor.</p><p>But he can\u2019t bury his words. They\u2019re out there, like flying ants wheeling in the air.</p> <p>For the first time ever, I wish I were married to some stupid, unperceptive, Neanderthal-type moron.</p><p>But Luke\u2019s no moron. And I know him too well. He might look impassive to a stranger, but I could see his mind crunching. I could see exactly when the truth landed. Now his face is carefully blank but it\u2019s there in his eyes. He turns and smiles.</p><p>\u2018Well ... I\u2019ve got no idea what that was all about,\u2019 he says, his voice a little too hearty.</p><p>He knows.</p><p>I feel numb.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>During the long taxi ride we hardly talk. At first I try to keep up a jolly fa\u00e7ade but everything I say sounds false and hollow to my own ears. We turn off towards Oxshott and we\u2019re nearly there and I should be bubbling with excitement \u2013 but it\u2019s not like I planned at all.</p><p>A sudden tear rolls down my cheek and I brush it away quickly before Luke can see.</p><p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke sounds agonized.</p><p>Great. He did see. Even my own stupid body is giving it all away.</p><p>For a moment we just stare at each other and it\u2019s as though marital telepathy is finally kicking in between us. I know what he thinks. I know what he feels. He\u2019d give anything to rewind; he\u2019d give anything not to know. But he can\u2019t un-know.</p><p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke looks tortured as he scans my face. \u2018Please ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine. I just ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t ...\u2019</p><p>Everything we say is meaningless half-sentences. It\u2019s like neither of us can risk edging near the truth. Then suddenly Luke seems to come to a decision and pulls me close.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be surprised,\u2019 he says in an intense, low voice. \u2018I will. I don\u2019t know anything. If you knew how touched ...\u2019 He breaks off, breathing hard. \u2018Becky, please don\u2019t be upset ...\u2019 He grabs my hands and crushes them so tight I wince. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t speak.

Suze is all primed with my dress, and Danny is in charge of Luke\u2019s outfit too.</p><p>It\u2019s fine, I tell myself sternly. Even if it\u2019s not exactly what I planned, it\u2019s fine. Luke\u2019s here, I\u2019m here, he\u2019s going to have his party and it\u2019s going to be fabulous.</p><p>\u2018Happy birthday, darling,\u2019 I murmur as the taxi pulls into Janice\u2019s drive, and squeeze Luke\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u2018What? Why are we pulling in here?\u2019</p><p>Luke is heroically trying to sound like the most astonished person in the world. I wish he wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s not very good at it.</p><p>\u2018Get out ...\u2019 I flash him a smile \u2013 and even though I know he knows, I can feel the excitement fizzing up again. I mean, he doesn\u2019t know everything. I pay the taxi driver and lead Luke through Janice\u2019s darkened house. The catering staff are either hiding in the kitchen or already in the marquee, but even so, I don\u2019t dare turn on the lights.</p><p>Ow. I just bumped my hip on Janice\u2019s stupid table. Why does she have tables everywhere?</p><p>\u2018OK, outside ...\u2019 I push him forward, through the French windows into the garden. There\u2019s the marquee, all decorated with twinkly fairy lights and lit up inside \u2013 yet completely silent as though two hundred people aren\u2019t gathered inside.</p> <p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke stops dead and stares. \u2018I can\u2019t believe this. I can\u2019t believe what you\u2019ve ... Did you arrange all this yourself?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on!\u2019</p><p>I drag him along the matting to the entrance, my heart suddenly racing. They\u2019d better all be there.</p><p>Of course they\u2019re there.</p><p>I take a deep breath \u2013 then pull open the flap to the marquee.</p><p>\u2018SURPRISE!!\u2019</p> <p>The noise is phenomenal. A massive throng of lit-up faces is turned towards us. I recognize only some of them. Janice is near the front, in her Mrs Bennet dress, and Jess is in the most amazing sculptured black sheath, with dramatic make-up to match. As I look around the marquee I can\u2019t help a twinge of pride. Fairy lights are strung up and silver balloons are bobbing with \u2018Happy Birthday Luke\u2019 printed in the Brandon Communications logo font. All around the marquee are glossy mock promotional posters and blown-up newspapers, each with a different headline and story about Luke Brandon. (I wrote them all myself.) The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is a massive back-lit graph, just like the ones they produce for Brandon C press launches. It shows pictures of Luke every year, from a baby right up to adulthood, and is headlined: \u2018Luke \u2013 a Bumper Year\u2019.</p><p>And right above our head, all around, are my pom-poms. We strung fairy lights through them and hung them in garlands \u2013 and they look amazing.</p><p>\u2018Happy birthday to you ...\u2019 Someone launches into singing and the crowd follows lustily.</p><p>I dart a glance at Luke.</p><p>\u2018Wow!\u2019 he exclaims as though on cue. \u2018This is such ... I had no idea!\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s making the hugest effort to look supremely shocked. I have to give him that.</p><p>\u2018For he\u2019s a jolly good fellow ...\u2019 the crowd is now singing. Luke keeps spotting faces in the crowd and acknowledging them with waves and smiles, and as soon as the singing finishes, he takes a glass from a waitress and raises it towards the general m\u00eal\u00e9e.</p><p>\u2018You bastards!\u2019 he says, and there\u2019s a roar of laughter. The little three-piece band in the corner strikes up with some Gershwin, and people surge round Luke, and I watch his face as he greets them.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t blown away. He wasn\u2019t speechless with surprise. But then ... I knew he wouldn\u2019t be. The minute that guy opened his mouth in the Berkeley Hotel.</p><p>\u2018Becky! This is fantastic!\u2019 A woman from Brandon Communications whose name I\u2019ve forgotten (but I remember that amazing Alexander McQueen dress) descends on me. \u2018Did you do all these decorations yourself?\u2019</p><p>Erica and her staff are circulating with canap\u00e9s and I can see Janice approaching a chic blonde girl with a powder compact. For God\u2019s sake. I told her, no touch-ups. I have to head her off, quick.</p><p>But before I can, a greying man hands me a cocktail and introduces himself as an old colleague of Luke\u2019s and asks me how long it all took to plan, and then his wife (floaty dress, too much lipstick) asks me excitedly if I\u2019ve seen the clips on YouTube, and about fifteen minutes go by and I haven\u2019t done anything except talk to strangers. I don\u2019t even know where Luke is.</p><p>There\u2019s a bit of a draught coming through the flaps of the marquee, too, and everyone\u2019s gradually huddling away from the entrance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018People! A word if you please.\u2019 Luke\u2019s commanding voice fills the tent and at once all the Brandon Communications people stop talking and stand to attention, as though he\u2019s about to make some company presentation. The others follow suit, and the whole place falls silent with incredible speed.</p><p>\u2018I just want to say ... thank you.\u2019 He surveys the crowd of smiling faces. \u2018To all of you. I can\u2019t believe so many old friends are here and I look forward to catching up. I can\u2019t believe you all knew about this, you devious lot.\u2019 There\u2019s an appreciative laugh around the marquee. \u2018And I can\u2019t believe how clever my wife has been.\u2019 He turns to me. \u2018Becky, take a bow.\u2019</p><p>A spattering of applause breaks out and I dutifully make a little bow.</p><p>\u2018Was it a total surprise, Luke?\u2019 calls out the woman with too much lipstick. \u2018Did you have absolutely no idea?\u2019</p> <p>Luke darts the wariest of glances at me; you\u2019d hardly notice it.</p><p>\u2018Yes, absolutely!\u2019 He sounds a little forced. \u2018I had no idea until I stepped into the\u2014\u2019 He breaks off. \u2018At least, obviously I suspected something when we got into the taxi ...\u2019 He stops again and rubs his face awkwardly, and there\u2019s a curious, expectant hush around the tent.</p><p>\u2018Here\u2019s the thing.\u2019 Luke looks up at last, and his usual polished veneer is gone. \u2018I don\u2019t want to lie to all of you. I don\u2019t want to put on an act, because this is too important to me. I want to say what I really feel. Someone did give the game away earlier on. A little. So yes, I was expecting ... something. But you know what? A party like this isn\u2019t about the surprise factor. It\u2019s about someone going to so much trouble that it just ... overwhelms you. And you think, \u201cWhat did I do to deserve this?\u201d\u2019 He pauses, his voice trembling a bit. \u2018I am the luckiest man alive, and I\u2019d like to propose a toast. To Becky.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m glancing at my phone. It\u2019s been buzzing with texts throughout and I\u2019ve only had half an ear on Luke\u2019s little speech. But now I look up.</p><p>\u2018OK, Luke.\u2019 I allow myself a smile. \u2018You\u2019re wrong. This kind of party is all about the surprise factor. Take your drink. Take your coat. And step this way, please. Everyone, if you could collect your coats and follow us ...\u2019</p> <p>Out of nowhere, Daryl, Nicole, Julie and three of their friends have materialized and are efficiently pushing in rails of coats. All the guests are looking at each other, flummoxed. Daryl winks at me \u2013 and I wink back. He\u2019s a total star, Daryl. He got in touch a week ago and said he\u2019d really improved on the fire-eating and did I want to audition him again? Whereupon I said no thanks \u2013 but there was another little job he could do. All six teenagers are dressed smartly in white shirts and waistcoats, and Nicole\u2019s wearing her Vivienne Westwood shoes, I notice.</p><p>Luke hasn\u2019t moved a muscle. He looks utterly gobsmacked.</p><p>Ha!</p><p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 He wrinkles his brow. \u2018What on earth ...\u2019</p><p>Ha! Ha!</p><p>\u2018You think this is your party?\u2019 I nod at the marquee derisively.</p> <p>I almost want to skip with glee as I lead him back through Janice\u2019s house to the drive. And they\u2019re here. Right on cue. Four massive coaches, parked outside. They\u2019re jet black and on the side is printed in white:</p><p>LUKE\u2019S REAL SURPRISE PARTY.</p><p>\u2018Wh\u2014\u2019</p><p>Luke\u2019s jaw has dropped. He seems unable to speak.</p><p>Yessssss!</p><p>\u2018In you get,\u2019 I say blithely.</p><p>I know, I know, I didn\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I wanted to. But I was afraid you might blab.</p> <p>The atmosphere in the coach is fantastic. The whole level of festivity seems to have gone up ten notches. I keep hearing snatches of \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 and \u2018Did you know?\u2019 and gales of laughter.</p><p>And Luke just seems stunned. I\u2019ve never seen him so stunned. I must surprise him more often.</p><p>\u2018OK, blindfold on ...\u2019 I say as we reach the turning.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He starts to laugh. \u2018You can\u2019t be serious!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Blindfold on!\u2019 I lift a mock-stern finger and waggle it at him.</p><p>This is quite a power trip, actually. He\u2019s totally under my control. I yank the ends of the blindfold really tight, and peer out of the front of the coach. We\u2019re nearly there!</p><p>I text Suze Five minutes and immediately get back OK. She\u2019s there, waiting for me, along with Mum, Dad, Minnie, Danny and the rest of Team Two.</p><p>Oh yes. I had two teams. Well, actually, that was Elinor\u2019s idea.</p><p>I know Elinor\u2019s still there too, because Suze sent me a text a few minutes ago saying that Elinor had been checking every last-minute detail fanatically and all the staff were petrified of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we head up the long avenue of trees I can see all the guests peering curiously out of the coach windows and I furiously make a finger-to-lips gesture. Not that Luke would guess, probably. He\u2019s only been to Suze\u2019s new house once.</p><p>I say \u2018house\u2019. What I mean is, \u2018stately home with parkland\u2019.</p><p>It was such a last-minute decision to come here. We\u2019d planned to hire a venue, and Elinor was poised to bribe some other event to move (she\u2019s totally ruthless, like a trained assassin), when Suze suddenly said, \u2018Wait! What about Letherby Hall?\u2019</p><p>I think sometimes Suze actually forgets how many houses she and Tarquin possess. She certainly had no idea how many bedrooms it\u2019s got.</p> <p>Anyway. Once we\u2019d made that decision, everything fell into place. Or at least, was shoved very quickly into place. And it\u2019s the perfect, dreamiest, most romantic setting for a party. I can hear people oohing and aahing behind me as they catch sight of the house, with its two grand wings and central dome and Doric pilasters all over the place. (I know they\u2019re Doric pilasters because Tarkie told me. In fact, I\u2019m quite hoping someone asks me about them.)</p><p>There\u2019s a breeze in the air as we all pile out of the coaches and crunch forward over the gravel. The front entrance is open and lit up and I usher everyone in silently, still guiding Luke. We cross the ancient stone floor and soon we\u2019re all assembled, standing in front of the grand double doors to the Great Hall.</p><p>I can hear the whispers and giggles and \u2018sssh!\u2019s going on behind me. I can feel the anticipation now. I almost feel frightened. This is it. This is the moment.</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 My voice shakes a little as I untie his blindfold. \u2018Luke ... happy birthday.\u2019</p><p>As I open the double doors, the gasp behind Luke is like hearing the rush of water. But I\u2019m only looking at his face. It\u2019s ashen.</p> <p>If I wanted blown away and speechless ... then I\u2019ve got it.</p><p>He takes a step forward, wonderingly. Then another ... then another.</p><p>The whole of the Great Hall has been transformed into the stage of that vintage toy theatre he bought for Minnie; the toy theatre of his childhood. All the Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream sets have been painstakingly reproduced. There are the same bushes and trees and castle spires, there\u2019s a brook and moss. Little tables and chairs are nestled amongst the foliage. A band is playing low, magical music. Set here and there in the trees, like big flowers, are more of my pom-poms. I can\u2019t help feeling proud. They do look good.</p><p>\u2018This is ...\u2019 Luke swallows hard. \u2018It\u2019s exactly the same as ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I grip his hand tight.</p><p>This was always my idea. But I could never have done it as spectacularly as this if it weren\u2019t for Elinor.</p> <p>\u2018Daddeeeee!\u2019 Minnie comes running out from behind a tree, dressed in the most beautiful, gossamer fairy dress with wings that Danny made for her. \u2018Happy! Happy Daddy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 Luke looks overwhelmed as he scoops her up. \u2018Where did you ... How did you ... Suze! Jane! Graham! Danny!\u2019 He\u2019s turning his head in bewilderment as they all pop out from their hiding places.</p><p>\u2018Happy birthday!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Surprise!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Say something, Luke, love! Give us a little speech!\u2019 I can\u2019t believe Mum\u2019s pointing a camcorder at Luke\u2019s face. She knows we\u2019ve hired a professional cameraman.</p><p>\u2018Bonnie?\u2019 Luke looks even more shellshocked as Bonnie emerges from behind the waterfall in a spectacular aquamarine dress, an abashed smile on her face. \u2018Please don\u2019t tell me you were in on all of this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just a little.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is just ... unreal.\u2019 He shakes his head and looks around the magical room again. \u2018Who else knows it\u2019s my birthday?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Who else? Um ...\u2019 I meet Bonnie\u2019s eyes and want to laugh. \u2018Quite a few people. Most of the City.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The readership of the Daily World,\u2019 adds Bonnie. \u2018And the Standard City Diary, and the Mail just ran a little piece.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got messages from three members of the Royal Family,\u2019 puts in Suze brightly.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t forget YouTube!\u2019 puts in Dad. \u2018Hundred thousand hits at the latest count!\u2019</p><p>Luke looks as though we all must have gone mad. \u2018You\u2019re joking,\u2019 he says and we all shake our heads.</p><p>\u2018Wait till you see the tributes!\u2019 says Mum. \u2018And you\u2019ve got your own Happy Birthday website!\u2019</p><p>\u2018But ... this is crazy.\u2019 Luke puts a hand to his head. \u2018I never celebrate my birthday. Who on earth ...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Becky\u2019s been very busy,\u2019 Bonnie says.</p><p>\u2018Trying to keep it secret!\u2019 I exclaim indignantly. \u2018Trying to stop people blabbing and posting stuff on the internet! It\u2019s been like trying to keep control of an octopus.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A drink, sir?\u2019 A stunning male model wearing one of Danny\u2019s Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream costumes appears from nowhere. His thighs are clad in fur and there\u2019s a wreath of leaves round his head, and his chest is bare and tanned, and very honed. (I think this is Danny\u2019s own fantasy interpretation of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, i.e. basically just a forest full of hot men.)</p><p>The male model is holding out a wooden tray which looks like a slice of tree, bearing cocktails with silver tags. \u2018I can offer you a Brandon, a Bloomwood, or a Minnie. And then if you and your wife would like to get changed before the show?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The show?\u2019 Luke turns to me. I raise my eyebrows mysteriously and squeeze his hand again.</p><p>\u2018Wait and see.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s the most incredible, blow-your-mind party. It just is.</p><p>I mean, I know I helped organize it and everything, so I shouldn\u2019t boast. I should be all modest and self-deprecating and say, \u2018Oh, it was OK, I suppose,\u2019 or \u2018As parties go, it wasn\u2019t bad,\u2019 and shrug and change the subject and talk about the weather.</p><p>But too bad, I\u2019m not going to, I\u2019m going to tell you the truth. Which is that it\u2019s the most out-of-this-world party and everyone\u2019s said so, even people who go to loads of parties like the Right Reverend St John Gardner-Stone, who turns out to be a total sweetie with a good line in knock-knock jokes.</p> <p>Everything so far has gone perfectly. When Luke had put on his dinner jacket and I was in my divine green dress, we took our seats on little chairs around the hall, drinks in hands, and a circus dance troupe performed the most amazing acrobatics all around us in the trees of the forest, with thumping music and laser lights flashing.</p><p>Then came the fire-eaters \u2013 a Czech troupe who do all kinds of amazing stunts. (They included Alonzo/Alvin in the routine, because I told them they had to, and he looked totally terrified and exhilarated all the way through.)</p><p>Then a massive screen came down from the ceiling, another soundtrack played, and all the YouTube tributes to Luke began, and I nearly cried.</p><p>OK. I did kind of blink away a few tears.</p><p>Not that any of them were any good. I mean, seeing a bunch of marketing executives from Kettering do a rubbishy \u2018Happy birthday Luke da man\u2019 rap into a shaky mobile phone isn\u2019t exactly The Shawshank Redemption. But it was the fact of them. People I don\u2019t even know, wishing Luke a happy birthday.</p><p>Then we had video messages from all the friends who couldn\u2019t be here, like Michael and Luke\u2019s dad, followed by the text messages from the website, flashing up, one after another. And finally a clip I didn\u2019t even know about, which Suze had been emailed ten minutes before we arrived, apparently. It starts off with Sage Seymour, on her film set, sitting on a director\u2019s chair, saying \u2018Luke, honey, where the hell ARE you?\u2019 and pretending he\u2019s supposed to be doing a scene with her, and it ends up with all the cast and crew wishing him happy birthday. Even the really famous ones.</p> <p>As soon as Sage appeared on the screen, Luke\u2019s head whipped round to me, and he said, \u2018How the fuck\u2014\u2019</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t help giggling, and whispering in his ear, \u2018Luke, just face it. There\u2019s no point trying to keep any secrets from me.\u2019</p><p>I was expecting him to laugh, but he didn\u2019t. To be honest he looked a teeny bit freaked.</p><p>Then we sat down for the most amazing feast in the Long Gallery, which was decorated with flower garlands and yet more plastic pom-poms. (I really did make a lot.) There were loads of speeches and Luke thanked everyone a zillion times and I thanked everyone a zillion times. Then Luke made a really touching speech about Annabel and the toy theatre and how special those memories were to him, and how he\u2019d bought the same theatre for Minnie and hoped she would have the same memories of him one day. And everyone dabbed at their eyes.</p><p>Oh, and he said some nice stuff about me. You know.</p><p>Then the coffee came round with Suze\u2019s special \u2018Luke\u2019s Walnut Shortbread\u2019 and everybody oohed and aahed again, and I met Suze\u2019s eyes and silently mouthed \u2018Thank you\u2019.</p><p>Then the band appeared on stage in the East Hall (all Suze\u2019s rooms have names). And now there\u2019s dancing in there and mood-music-and-lounging-around-on-sofas in another huge room and people are still milling around the Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream room, and later on there\u2019ll be ice-cream and fireworks and a stand-up comedian, only Luke doesn\u2019t know that yet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m watching him from my perch by the brook. He\u2019s surrounded by old friends, holding Minnie in his arms, and I haven\u2019t seen his face lit up like that for ...</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Way too long.</p><p>I\u2019m just wondering which kind of cocktail to move on to next, when Suze comes swooshing up to me in her dress \u2013which, I have to admit, is almost more fabulous than mine. It\u2019s dark purple with a train and she got it in Paris from Christian Dior and wouldn\u2019t tell me how much it cost, which means it was a squillion.</p><p>\u2018Bex, I don\u2019t know what to do about ...\u2019 She pauses, then mouths, \u2018Elinor.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What about her?\u2019 I look nervously around to check Luke isn\u2019t in earshot. Suze leans close and breathes in my ear, \u2018She\u2019s still here.\u2019</p><p>I feel a bolt of shock. She\u2019s here?</p><p>Elinor told me a million times that she wasn\u2019t staying for the party. She said she was leaving half an hour before we arrived. I just assumed she had.</p><p>\u2018But where ...\u2019 I look wildly around.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s my fault.\u2019 Suze\u2019s face crumples. \u2018I just couldn\u2019t bear for her not to see any of it. Not after everything she\u2019s done. I knew she couldn\u2019t actually come to the party ... so I said, would she like to hide in the Priest\u2019s Passage and watch?\u2019</p> <p>Suze glances up meaningfully and I follow her gaze. There\u2019s a tiny iron balcony at first-floor level, which I\u2019ve never really noticed. But it\u2019s empty.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 I say stupidly. \u2018Where is she?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hidden behind a secret panel, looking out through a spyhole.\u2019 Suze chews her lip anxiously. \u2018She said she only wanted to see you and Luke arrive and know that everything had worked. She said she\u2019d slip away after that. But I just got Tarkie to go and check her car \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t left. She must still be there! She hasn\u2019t had any food, she\u2019s just standing in this tiny space ... and I\u2019m worried. What if she gets ill? I mean, how old is she?\u2019</p><p>Oh God. This could all go horribly wrong.</p><p>I glance over at Luke \u2013 but he\u2019s laughing at something and doesn\u2019t even notice me. \u2018Come on, let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>The stairs up to the Priest\u2019s Passage are tiny and narrow and musty, and I clutch my precious Valentino dress to me. As Suze cautiously pushes open the old wooden door, it\u2019s Elinor\u2019s shoulders I see first \u2013 narrow and rigid. Her face is pressed right up to the panel in front of her and she looks like a statue. She hasn\u2019t even heard us.</p> <p>\u2018Elinor?\u2019 I whisper, and she whips round, a fleeting look of panic on her pale face.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine! It\u2019s me and Suze. We\u2019ve brought you a snack.\u2019 I offer her a plate of mini desserts from dinner, but she shrinks away.</p><p>\u2018I must go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! You don\u2019t have to. We just wanted to make sure you were all right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke doesn\u2019t suspect I\u2019m here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. Not at all.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Elinor resumes her watch and I glance at Suze, who gives me a \u2018What do we do now?\u2019 shrug.</p><p>\u2018Luke and Minnie seem very close,\u2019 says Elinor, her eye pressed right up against the spyhole. \u2018He has a natural manner with her.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Um ... yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With your parents, too.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. This is all too surreal. How did I get into this situation? How can I be standing in a tiny cramped hole with my rich-bitch mother-in-law, both of us hiding from the man who links us?</p><p>And how can I be feeling like I want to give her a great big, warm, proper family hug? Like I want to gather her in, away from this dark, distant hiding hole, into the light and warmth of the party? She\u2019s never seemed so vulnerable and alone as she does right now. And it\u2019s because of her that we\u2019re all having the time of our lives.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just wonderful down there.\u2019 I put a hand out cautiously and squeeze her arm. \u2018Everyone\u2019s said it\u2019s the best party they\u2019ve ever been to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Luke has enjoyed it?\u2019 She turns.</p><p>\u2018Oh my God, yes! He\u2019s bowled over! Did you see his face?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve made his year!\u2019 Suze nods enthusiastically. \u2018He\u2019s so touched. He\u2019s been round the whole forest, looking at every detail. It\u2019s so clever.\u2019</p><p>Elinor says nothing, but I see the tiniest flicker of satisfaction in her eyes. And suddenly I can\u2019t bear it. This is all wrong. I want Luke to know. I want everyone to know. There was a massive driving force behind tonight, and it was Luke\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u2018Elinor, come down.\u2019 The words spill out before I can stop them. \u2018Come down and join the party.\u2019 I hear Suze\u2019s astonished gasp, but ignore it. \u2018Come on. I\u2019ll make things OK with Luke.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I fear that will be impossible.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No it won\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I must leave. Now. I have stayed too long.\u2019 Elinor has unclasped her handbag and is pulling on a pair of kid gloves. Oh God, now I\u2019ve frightened her away.</p><p>\u2018Look, I know you\u2019ve had difficulties, you two,\u2019 I say cajolingly. \u2018But this is the perfect time to mend them. At his party! And when he knows you were behind all this ... he\u2019ll love you! He\u2019ll have to love you!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s precisely why I cannot go down.\u2019 Her voice sounds so harsh that I flinch \u2013 though it might just be because of the dusty air up here. \u2018I did not fund this party in order to win Luke\u2019s love in some ostentatious way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not ... I didn\u2019t mean ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will not go down. I will not join in the festivities. I will not have him knowing that I was any part of tonight. You will never tell him. Never, do you hear me, Rebecca?\u2019</p><p>Her eyes flash at me furiously and I recoil in fright. For all the vulnerability, she can still be pretty scary.</p><p>\u2018OK!\u2019 I gulp.</p> <p>\u2018There are no conditions attached to tonight. I have done this for Luke.\u2019 She\u2019s looking again through the spyhole. \u2018I have done this for Luke,\u2019 she repeats, almost as though to herself.</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence. Suze and I are glancing at each other nervously but neither of us dares speak.</p><p>\u2018If I went down, if I were to make myself known as the benefactor, I would have done it for myself.\u2019 She turns and regards me evenly, her eyes giving nothing away. \u2018As you said so clearly, an unconditional act does not require reward.\u2019</p><p>God, she\u2019s hard on herself. If it were me I\u2019d make up some reason why I could do it all for Luke, be the noble benefactor and go to the party.</p><p>\u2018So ... you\u2019ll never tell him?\u2019 I venture. \u2018Ever? He\u2019ll never know it was you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He will never know.\u2019 She looks at Suze dispassionately. \u2018Please stand aside so I can leave.\u2019</p> <p>That\u2019s it? No high fives, group hugs, let\u2019s-do-this-again?</p><p>\u2018Elinor ... wait.\u2019 I hold out my arms, but she doesn\u2019t react, so I shuffle towards her in the tiny space, but she still doesn\u2019t seem to know what I\u2019m doing. So at last I wrap my arms gingerly around her bony frame, feeling like Minnie when she randomly hugs a tree in the park.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe this is happening. I\u2019m hugging Elinor.</p><p>Me. Hugging Elinor. Because I want to.</p><p>\u2018Thanks,\u2019 I murmur. \u2018For everything.\u2019</p><p>Elinor draws away, looking stiffer than ever. She nods briefly to me and Suze, then slips through the wooden door.</p><p>\u2018Will anyone see her?\u2019 I mutter anxiously to Suze, who shakes her head.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a back way out. I showed her earlier.\u2019</p> <p>I lean against the dusty old wall and breathe out heavily. \u2018Wow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>Our eyes meet through the dimness, and I know Suze is thinking all the same thoughts I am.</p><p>\u2018D\u2019you think he\u2019ll ever know it was her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dunno.\u2019 I shake my head. \u2018I just ... don\u2019t know.\u2019 I glance through the spyhole again. \u2018Come on. We\u2019d better go down.\u2019</p><p>The party is in full swell downstairs. Guests are milling around everywhere, holding drinks, wearing their silver party hats (we had crackers at dinner), wandering around the midsummer forest and looking at the waterfall, which is now lit up with amazing coloured lights, or gathered around the roulette tables. The catering staff are circulating with tiny little passion-fruit sorbets on individual spoons. Danny\u2019s models are stalking around in their spectacular Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream costumes, looking like they\u2019ve popped in from a magic faraway land. There\u2019s echoing laughter everywhere, and chatter, and the thud-thud of the band reverberating through the floor, and every so often the flash of a laser from the show. I must go and dance again in a minute.</p><p>I head towards the cocktail bar, where a bartender flown in especially from New York is entertaining a small crowd with cocktail-shaker tricks. There, to my astonishment, I find Janice and Jess clinking glasses with massive warm, friendly smiles.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? I thought they hated each other.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 I touch Jess\u2019s shoulder. \u2018How\u2019s it going? Doesn\u2019t Jess look amazing?\u2019 I add to Janice.</p><p>\u2018Absolutely super!\u2019 agrees Janice. \u2018What a wonderful outfit!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a nice dress,\u2019 says Jess, tugging awkwardly at it so the neckline goes crooked. \u2018Nice and plain. And the fabric\u2019s sustainable.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s always the same. The minute I compliment her appearance she gets uncomfortable and starts trying to sabotage it.</p><p>\u2018Jess borrowed this from Danny,\u2019 I tell Janice as I patiently adjust the neckline back again. \u2018It\u2019s a prototype from his new eco-couture collection. You know it\u2019s probably the most expensive dress in this room?\u2019 I add airily. Which is true, even if Suze did pay a squillion. \u2018It\u2019s more expensive than mine,\u2019 I add for good measure.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Jess blanches. \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019</p><p>I want to burst into laughter at her expression. I\u2019ve kind of been saving this titbit up.</p> <p>\u2018Oh yes. Because it\u2019s made of hand-spun, free-range silk,\u2019 I explain. \u2018They have to wait for the cocoons to fall naturally from the trees, and they don\u2019t use any machines, and all the artisans are paid really generously. Only about three of these will ever be made. In Browns, it would cost ...\u2019</p><p>I lean forward and whisper the price in Jess\u2019s ear. She looks as if she wants to expire on the spot.</p><p>\u2018Plus, no one in the world has worn any of the pieces from this new collection yet,\u2019 I inform her. \u2018You realize you\u2019re an exclusive fashion story?\u2019</p><p>Anyone else in the world would be thrilled to be an exclusive fashion story. Jess still looks completely freaked out.</p><p>\u2018Enjoy it! You look fab.\u2019 I put an arm round her shoulders and squeeze tight until she reluctantly laughs.</p> <p>\u2018So are you having a good time? Have you danced yet?\u2019 I can\u2019t help smiling at Janice\u2019s beatific face. She looks as though she\u2019s had a good few cocktails.</p><p>\u2018Oh Becky!\u2019 Janice bubbles over. \u2018Guess what, love, guess what? Jess is having a baby!\u2019</p><p>What? I look, staggered, from Jess to Janice, to Jess\u2019s stomach, to her cocktail, and back to her face. She can\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>Oh my God, did Janice\u2019s fertility drug work? And why is Jess looking so happy about it?</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s only a possibility,\u2019 corrects Jess, rolling her eyes. \u2018And he\u2019s not a baby. He\u2019s three.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s the dearest little angel!\u2019 Janice acts as though Jess hasn\u2019t even spoken. \u2018Can we show Becky the picture?\u2019</p> <p>I watch in bewilderment as Jess reaches into her evening bag. She pulls out a photograph and turns it around to show a grinning little boy with dark floppy hair and olive skin and a few freckles scattered over his nose.</p><p>Instantly my heart melts. He looks so goofy and endearing, I almost want to laugh, except it might hurt Jess.</p><p>\u2018Is that ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019 Jess is glowing. \u2018It\u2019s early days.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should really think of adoption, you know, Becky.\u2019 Janice is puffed up proudly like a pigeon. \u2018As I said to your mother, it\u2019s the only responsible way to have a child these days. Angelina showed us the way, of course.\u2019</p><p>Angelina showed us the way? Is this the woman who was having hysterics about five minutes ago because her son might not carry on his genes? I roll my eyes at Jess, but she just laughs and shrugs.</p><p>\u2018Well, good luck!\u2019 I say. \u2018When do you ... you know. Get him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I say, it\u2019s early days.\u2019 Jess immediately looks cautious. \u2018We may not be approved, we may still fail on all sorts of counts ... I shouldn\u2019t have shown you the picture, really.\u2019</p> <p>Yeah, right. Like Jess is going to fail at anything.</p><p>I\u2019ll be an aunt! Minnie will have a cousin!</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m really happy for you.\u2019 I squeeze Jess\u2019s arm. \u2018And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having a good time, Janice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, love, it\u2019s amazing! I know it was a huge effort for you.\u2019 Janice sweeps a tipsy arm around. \u2018But it was all worthwhile.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 says Jess, before I can reply. \u2018It was worthwhile.\u2019 She meets my eyes and gives a little smile.</p><p>Jess and Janice head off to find Tom, and I order myself a drink, and as I\u2019m standing there, almost lost in a happy dream, I spot Luke in the mirror behind the bar. He\u2019s standing at the roulette table, with Minnie next to him, peeping over the top. He looks totally, utterly, 100 per cent happy. Everyone\u2019s focused on one massive pile of chips, and when the wheel comes to a standstill there\u2019s an almighty roar. Everyone starts laughing and clapping each other on the back, and Minnie is crowing in delight.</p><p>As the croupier starts her patter and players start placing new bets, Luke suddenly notices me watching him. He jerks his head at a quiet sofa nestling in the corner and peels away from the crowd, Minnie\u2019s hand clutched in his.</p><p>\u2018Sweeties!\u2019 Minnie says triumphantly as they reach us, and brandishes a handful of red and green gambling chips at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018They\u2019re not sweeties, darling.\u2019 I want to laugh. \u2018They\u2019re chips!\u2019 Now she looks totally confused. \u2018Not eating chips, special chips. You make money with them at the magic table! Or ... lose,\u2019 I add hastily as I see Luke\u2019s raised eyebrows. \u2018Often you lose. So you shouldn\u2019t ever gamble, Minnie. Gambling is very bad.\u2019</p><p>There. A quick zap of responsible parenting.</p><p>Luke sinks down into the sofa and I follow suit. My ears are ringing from dancing next to the band, and my feet are starting to ache ... but the rest of me is almost trancey with exhilaration. The party\u2019s been so utterly perfect. It\u2019s been better than I could ever have hoped. And it hasn\u2019t even ended yet. We\u2019ve still got some of the best bits to go!</p><p>\u2018Were you surprised?\u2019 I say for the millionth time, just to hear him say it.</p> <p>\u2018Becky ...\u2019 Luke shakes his head incredulously. \u2018I wasn\u2019t just surprised. I was absolutely blown away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I say in satisfaction. I take a sip of my cocktail (a Brandon) and nestle back on the old plushy sofa, Minnie on my lap and Luke\u2019s arm around both of us. For a few moments we\u2019re both quiet, just taking in the scene around us.</p><p>\u2018That Christmas wish,\u2019 Luke says suddenly. \u2018You made a wish about me. In the shopping mall. Remember?\u2019</p><p>Oh God, I knew he heard. And he\u2019s kept quiet about it all this time.</p><p>\u2018Was your wish about this party?\u2019 he\u2019s saying. \u2018Is that why you rushed to shut the elf up?\u2019</p> <p>My mind flashes back to the words I scrawled on the Christmassy paper. It seems a million years ago now.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say after a pause. \u2018That\u2019s right. I wished that I could plan you a surprise party and you really would be surprised. And you were!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You got your wish.\u2019 He smiles.</p><p>\u2018I did.\u2019 I survey his face, then reach up and run a hand gently down his cheek. \u2018I really did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So, tell me.\u2019 His eyes suddenly glint with amusement. \u2018Exactly which bits of your recent strange behaviour can I ascribe to party-planning?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t been strange.\u2019 I hit him.</p> <p>\u2018My love, you\u2019ve been bordering on lunacy. Conceiving a boy, so we have to have sex very, very quickly?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Party.\u2019 I grin.</p><p>\u2018Ovulating?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Party.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The Botox? The so-called \u201cboob job\u201d?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling at his expression. \u2018Party. I\u2019d been meeting Bonnie for the first time. Oh, and don\u2019t bollock her about mentioning your shower gel any more!\u2019 I add sternly. \u2018It was me who told her to mention it. And the gym. And anything else that sounded a bit strange.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You?\u2019 He stares at me. \u2018Oh, for fuck\u2019s ...\u2019 He shakes his head as it obviously all starts falling into place. \u2018Why the hell didn\u2019t I realize? I should have known she wouldn\u2019t become that erratic overnight. What about the sixteen coats?\u2019 he adds suddenly. \u2018Was that a party thing too?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Er ... no,\u2019 I admit. \u2018That really was Minnie. Naughty girl, Minnie,\u2019 I add reprovingly.</p> <p>\u2018But what I really don\u2019t understand is ... how did you achieve all this?\u2019 He sweeps the air with a hand. \u2018I mean, Becky, this is beyond spectacular. This is ...\u2019 He trails off.</p><p>I know what\u2019s underlying his words. He doesn\u2019t want to say it, but he\u2019s worried I took out some massive loan for all this and I won\u2019t tell him till tomorrow when I\u2019ll reveal we\u2019re broke.</p><p>Honestly, he could have more faith.</p><p>But there\u2019s no point pretending this evening didn\u2019t cost shed-loads of money. Any moron can see that it did.</p><p>\u2018I had ... help,\u2019 I say. \u2018Major, major help. With everything. Bonnie was amazing,\u2019 I add quickly, before he presses me more on exactly who helped with the finances. \u2018She coordinated everything, she arranged the guest list, she sent out the invitations ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018And of course that\u2019s why she was looking so shifty the other day.\u2019 Luke exhales, looking rueful. \u2018OK. I get it. I\u2019ve really fucked up. I owe her a big bunch of flowers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not lilies,\u2019 I put in. \u2018You always get them and she can\u2019t stand them, but she\u2019s too polite to say anything. Get sweet peas and ranunculus. Or I could tell you all her favourite Jo Malone products.\u2019</p><p>Luke shoots me an astonished look. \u2018Anything else?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Loads, if you\u2019re interested,\u2019 I say blithely. \u2018Bonnie and I are best friends now. We tell each other everything.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh, you do, do you?\u2019 Luke looks as though he\u2019s not sure what he thinks about this.</p><p>\u2018We really bonded over this whole thing. It\u2019s been such a saga.\u2019 I take a swig of cocktail and kick off my shoes. Talking everything over with Luke, it feels as if some wound-up part of me is finally starting to relax. \u2018You can\u2019t imagine. Trying not to let you see the internet, and breaking your BlackBerry ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I still can\u2019t believe you did that.\u2019 He raises a half-grin \u2013although I\u2019m not sure he totally has a sense of humour about his BlackBerry.</p><p>\u2018And the worst thing was that bloody meeting in Paris! Oh my God, I nearly killed you!\u2019 I can\u2019t help starting to laugh. \u2018We were all, like, \u201cWhat do we do? How do we move it?\u201d And you were so bloody pleased with yourself ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Shit.\u2019 I can see the realization hitting Luke. \u2018Of course. The meeting was supposed to be today\u2014\u2019 He breaks off. \u2018Wait a minute, though. You\u2019re not saying ...\u2019 I can sense the cogs whirring in his brain. \u2018You couldn\u2019t have been behind that, surely. You\u2019re not telling me that you personally somehow arranged for Sir Bernard Cross to decide he wanted to give me a meeting?\u2019 He gives an astonished laugh. \u2018I mean, I\u2019ll believe many things of you, Becky, but that ...\u2019</p><p>I keep smiling, but inside I\u2019m kicking myself. I\u2019ve said too much. Let\u2019s move on, quick.</p><p>\u2018Not me, exactly. Oh God, and the marquee ...\u2019 I hastily launch into a full account of bartering for the marquee, and Luke laughs at all the right places, but I can tell he\u2019s preoccupied. When I\u2019ve finished, we lapse into silence and he sips his drink pensively, and I know exactly where his mind is roaming.</p><p>\u2018I always knew someone influential was behind that meeting,\u2019 he says at last, staring into his drink. \u2018I said so at the time. I could sense some powerful person behind the scenes, helping me out. And now I think I know who it was.\u2019 He looks up, straight at me. \u2018It\u2019s obvious. And it\u2019s obvious why you don\u2019t want to tell me.\u2019</p><p>My heart has stopped. My hand has frozen round the stem of my glass. Luke\u2019s so sharp. His mind\u2019s so quick. I should never have let anything slip out.</p> <p>Is he angry?</p><p>I lick my lips nervously. \u2018Luke, I really can\u2019t say anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I understand.\u2019 He takes a deep slug of his drink and for a while neither of us speaks.</p><p>As we sit there, the party thrumming around us, I keep darting cautious looks at him. He hasn\u2019t exploded. He hasn\u2019t stormed out saying that the whole evening\u2019s spoiled for him now. Is he not as bitter as I thought?</p><p>I keep thinking of Elinor, hidden away in her tiny, musty hole. If I\u2019d just persuaded her to stay ... could I somehow have worked things out between them?</p><p>\u2018But Becky, you realize this isn\u2019t just some tiny little favour.\u2019 Luke breaks into my thoughts. \u2018This is immense. I mean, all this.\u2019 He gestures around the room and lowers his voice. \u2018This ... person. They were behind that too, weren\u2019t they?\u2019</p> <p>Slowly I nod. If he knows, there\u2019s no point pretending.</p><p>Luke exhales sharply, cradling his drink. \u2018You know I\u2019m going to have to say thank you, Becky. Somehow. Even if they don\u2019t want to be thanked.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I ... I think that would be nice, Luke.\u2019 I swallow. \u2018Really nice.\u2019</p><p>I can feel a pressing of tears behind my eyes. Just like that, things have been mended. We\u2019ll meet up and yes, it\u2019ll be stilted and awkward, but they\u2019ll talk. And Luke will see his mother with Minnie. And he\u2019ll realize there\u2019s a different side to her.</p><p>\u2018No time like the present.\u2019 Luke gets to his feet with sudden energy. \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t say anything \u2013 but all along I half-suspected Tarquin. How do he and Sir Bernard know each other? Go shooting together, do they?\u2019</p><p>It takes a moment for me to catch up with what he\u2019s saying. He thinks all this was Tarquin?</p><p>\u2018And of course he\u2019s been desperately trying to repay me for that help I gave him earlier this year,\u2019 Luke is saying. \u2018But really, such extraordinary generosity was uncalled for.\u2019 He looks around the room as though with fresh disbelief. \u2018I don\u2019t know how I can ever thank him properly. And Suze, too. I assume they were in it together?\u2019</p><p>Noooo! Wrong! You\u2019ve got it all wrong!</p> <p>I want to say something; dislodge him off this track. But what can I do? I can\u2019t betray Elinor\u2019s confidence, not after everything she said.</p><p>\u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 I scramble to my feet, depositing Minnie on the sofa. \u2018Luke, you mustn\u2019t say anything!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Becky.\u2019 He smiles. \u2018I\u2019m not going to give the game away. If they want to stay incognito, so be it. But if somebody goes to all the trouble of doing something as exceptional and special as this ...\u2019 His face is shining. \u2018They deserve a public thank-you. Don\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>My heart is tying itself into knots. He should know what his mother did for him. He should know, he should know.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Minnie, Daddy needs to make a little speech.\u2019 Before I can react, Luke is striding into the East Hall. \u2018Suze?\u2019 He beckons to her cheerfully as he passes. \u2018Could you come in here a moment? And Tarquin?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Suze says as she follows us in. \u2018What\u2019s Luke doing?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He thinks it was all you,\u2019 I mutter under my breath. \u2018You and Tarkie. He thinks you fixed Sir Bernard and paid for all this. Now he wants to say thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re joking!\u2019 Suze stops dead, her eyes dark and troubled. \u2018But ... we didn\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know! But how can I tell him that?\u2019</p><p>For a moment we just stare at each other anxiously.</p><p>\u2018Does Luke suspect Elinor had anything to do with it?\u2019 says Suze at last.</p> <p>\u2018Nothing. He hasn\u2019t mentioned her once.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s mentioned everyone else in the world. All his family. All his friends. He toasted them all in his speech. But not her.</p><p>Luke has already bounded up on stage between songs and the lead singer of the band has handed the microphone to him.</p><p>\u2018Ladies and gentlemen, just a moment, if I may?\u2019 Luke\u2019s voice booms around the room. \u2018There\u2019ve been many thankyous tonight. But I just want to draw attention to one very, very special couple. They have opened this beautiful house to us, provided us with stunning hospitality ... and much, much more besides, which I won\u2019t go into here ...\u2019 He pauses meaningfully and I can see Tarquin darting a puzzled look at Suze. \u2018But please know, Suze and Tarquin, I will never forget what you did. To the Cleath-Stuarts.\u2019 Luke raises his glass, and all the guests on the dance-floor echo him, then break into applause.</p><p>Suze is trying to smile charmingly as people turn to her, applauding.</p><p>\u2018I feel terrible,\u2019 she murmurs desperately through her smiles. \u2018What about Elinor?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It was her choice,\u2019 I murmur back. \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u2019</p><p>I think of EIinor speeding home through the night, shoulders rigid. With no one toasting her, no one smiling at her, no one even giving her a passing thought. And suddenly I make a silent vow to myself.</p><p>Luke\u2019ll know one day. He\u2019ll know one day.</p><p>\u2018Give us \u201cNew York, New York\u201d!\u2019 someone yells at Luke, and the room breaks into laughter.</p><p>\u2018No chance.\u2019 Luke flashes a smile and hands the microphone back to the lead singer, who immediately counts the band into a new song.</p><p>\u2018Suze, darling.\u2019 Tarquin has made it over to us, looking perplexed. \u2018What on earth was Luke\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just thanking us for being good friends,\u2019 she says brightly. \u2018You know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 Tarquin\u2019s brow clears. \u2018Generous chap.\u2019 He has an ancient school name-tape poking out of his dinner jacket, I suddenly notice. It says \u2018W. F. S. Cleath-Stuart\u2019. Which is his father.</p> <p>\u2018Tarkie.\u2019 I beckon him over. \u2018Piece of fluff.\u2019 I push the name-tape back inside his collar and wink at Suze, who just shakes her head with a rueful grin.</p><p>We watch as Luke threads his way slowly through the throng, chatting and nodding to people as he goes. As he pauses to talk to Matt from Brandon C, I suddenly notice Minnie reaching for Matt\u2019s cocktail glass and putting it to her lips. Matt hasn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>\u2018Minnie!\u2019 I charge forward and grab it. \u2018No! You don\u2019t drink cocktails! Luke, did you see what she did?\u2019</p><p>Once upon a time, Luke would have hit the roof. Now he just swings her up and frowns at her mock-sternly.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Minnie. Don\u2019t you know the rules? No gambling and no drinking. Got it? And no online shopping. Not till you\u2019re at least ... three.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Happy Daddy!\u2019 Minnie pokes him with a glittery cocktail umbrella.</p><p>\u2018Now, you go to Grana for a minute.\u2019 He puts her down and shepherds her towards Mum. \u2018I just need to have a little chat with Mummy.\u2019 As he leads me off the dance-floor I feel a bit surprised. What does he need to chat about?</p><p>It\u2019s not the Valentino dress, surely. It can\u2019t be. I\u2019ve told him it was a present from Mum.</p><p>\u2018I was going to leave this till later,\u2019 he begins as we reach a quiet spot in the Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream glade. \u2018But why not now?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Absolutely.\u2019 I nod, slightly apprehensive.</p><p>\u2018Although you\u2019re probably in the loop already.\u2019 He rolls his eyes ruefully. \u2018I mean, you obviously know about Sage Seymour being a client.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We party-planners make it our business to know everything.\u2019 I smile sweetly. \u2018Even secrets our husbands were trying to keep from us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you\u2019ve spoken to her.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Several times, actually.\u2019 I flick my hair back nonchalantly. \u2018We got on really well.

Why don\u2019t I know everything?</p><p>\u2018The estate agents just called and left a message with Bonnie.\u2019 He appears to change tack completely. \u2018They\u2019ve found us a rental place. But of course, it all depends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019 I nod wisely. \u2018Of course. It all depends.

Tell me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have no inkling of what I\u2019m about to say.\u2019 He crosses his arms, looking as though he\u2019s enjoying himself.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s probably really boring,\u2019 I shoot back. \u2018So I do know but I forgot, because it\u2019s so dull.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fair enough.\u2019 He shrugs. \u2018Never mind. Not really important. Shall we go back?\u2019</p><p>God, he\u2019s maddening.</p><p>\u2018Tell me.\u2019 I glare at him. \u2018At once. Or you can\u2019t have a party bag. And they\u2019re really good party bags.\u2019</p><p>\u2018OK.\u2019 Luke relents. \u2018Well, to recap on what you probably already know ...\u2019 He shoots me a grin. \u2018I\u2019ve started working for Sage Seymour.\u2019</p> <p>I feel a little twinge of glee. My husband\u2019s working for a movie star! It\u2019s so cool!</p><p>\u2018And she likes the idea of having someone from outside the film business giving her a fresh take on things. In fact, she likes it so much ...\u2019 Luke pauses, his mouth twitching, \u2018... that she\u2019s asked me to go and work for her in LA for a little while. I\u2019d work with her team, make some contacts, and maybe, if things go really well, open a media division of Brandon Communications. Becky.\u2019 His face changes to alarm. \u2018Are you all right? Becky?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t speak. LA?</p><p>Hollywood?</p><p>\u2018And ... and we\u2019d all go?\u2019 I stutter as soon as I\u2019ve got my voice back.</p><p>\u2018Well, that was my idea. Gary can take care of things here for a while, so I was thinking three months. But obviously your job is a big consideration.\u2019 He looks anxious. \u2018I know it\u2019s been going well for you, I know you were hoping to make it on to the board ...\u2019</p><p>My job. Fuck. He doesn\u2019t even know about my job.</p><p>\u2018You know what, Luke?\u2019 I say as earnestly as I can. \u2018We\u2019re a partnership. A team. And if my career has to take a back seat for a while ... so be it. That\u2019s what marriage is all about. Plus, they have shops in LA, don\u2019t they? And I\u2019ve got a green card, haven\u2019t I?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... great!\u2019 He lifts his glass towards me. \u2018Looks like we have a plan.\u2019</p><p>He really means it? Just like that?</p><p>\u2018So ... we\u2019d be in Hollywood,\u2019 I say, just to be sure. \u2018For three months.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never been to Hollywood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 He grins. \u2018Fun, huh?\u2019</p><p>My heart is leaping around like a fish. Hollywood! Me, Becky Brandon, n\u00e9e Bloomwood, in Hollywood!</p><p>Luke\u2019s saying something else. His mouth is moving, but I can\u2019t hear him. My mind is too stuffed with alluring images. Me rollerblading down a boardwalk, all tanned and fit. Me driving down Sunset Boulevard in a convertible. (I must find out how to drive American cars.) Me and Sage Seymour hanging out by her shell-pink pool, wearing bikinis from some really hip downtown boutique, while Minnie looks adorable in a sundress.</p><p>People will call me The Girl with the English Accent. Or maybe The Girl Who\u2019s Best Friends with Sage Seymour. Or maybe ... The Girl in the White Sunglasses. (Yes. I\u2019ll get some tomorrow. That can be my look.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>And it\u2019ll be sunny all the time!
