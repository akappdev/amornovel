Big and brown, it probably gave the lady back problems, so it wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d really miss it. If nothing else, she was doing the old bat a favor.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes when the woman clutched the handbag tighter, wrinkled fingers splayed across the worn leather like it was an irreplaceable national treasure.</p> <p>She hated having to ask twice. \u201cI said give me your purse.\u201d</p><p>When the geriatric gulped, eyes searching the dark streets for a Good Samaritan, Logan ripped the bag from her weak grasp and took off down the sidewalk.</p><p>Did no one understand the concept of getting mugged anymore? You weren\u2019t supposed to fight back for the twenty bucks in your wallet. You weren\u2019t supposed to stand defiant in the face of the robber. You were supposed to care more about your life, more about your safety than your possessions.</p><p>What was the world coming to?</p><p>Slowing, she slid around a corner before breaking into a full out run again. The worn soles of her too small shoes made little noise against the cold pavement, save for wet sloshing sounds as she splashed through urine tainted puddles.</p> <p>No one could just be a victim anymore. Everyone had to fight. Everyone had to be a damn Reader\u2019s Digest cover story.</p><p>You should have taken her umbrella, too. Logan smiled as she raised an arm and wiped her rain soaked face on the sleeve of her dirty coat. If rain wasn\u2019t the closest she could get to a real shower, she might have considered it. However, running with an open umbrella didn\u2019t make for a quick getaway.</p><p>Turning sideways, she slipped between the cracked doors of an abandoned warehouse. She sucked in mouthful after mouthful of air, trying to slow the hammering of her heart against her ribs. She shook out the tight muscles in her legs between steps, moving towards the heap of soiled blankets in the far corner.</p><p>She seriously needed to find a better way to get money. This ripping off purses and wallets for twenty to forty bucks at a time just wasn\u2019t cutting it anymore.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until after she\u2019d sank into the damp blankets and dumped out the purse that Logan realized her manufactured bliss was wearing off. Scattering the contents with a swipe of her hand, she tore open the change purse and counted.</p><p>Thirty-two dollars.</p> <p>Thirty-two dollars in the form of thirty-two one-dollar bills.</p><p>No credit cards. No ATM card. No checkbook.</p><p>Not even a drivers license with an address so she could go punch the stripper loving old lady for giving her grief over thirty-two dollars!</p><p>After standing up and shoving the money into her pocket, Logan kicked the purse. \u201cStupid, perverted crone!\u201d she yelled, taking comfort in the hollow sound as it bounced off the crumbling walls. She\u2019d intended to catch Granny before she went to the strip club, but there were too many people around.</p><p>No doubt, the hag was now standing at the police station, crying her eyes out about the hooligan who stole her purse. She was probably making up some story about not being able to buy her life saving medications with her social security.</p><p>Logan laughed as she worked through the doors and back out into the alley. Little did the officers know that Grandma was spending hundreds of dollars a month to watch young, muscled studs shake their dicks. Hell, maybe she was paying for more than just a little shaky-shaky.</p><p>Maybe she was getting some serious couch time.</p><p>Pulling the half-eaten apple she\u2019d found in the trash outside the strip club from her coat pocket, Logan took a bite and continued down the alley. Cold rain pelted her face, acid laced droplets clinging to her eyelashes, dripping from her hair.</p> <p>Some people said New York City was at its most beautiful in the rain. She truly believed those people had never sauntered down a trash strewn back alley, ankle deep in jagged potholes teeming with fetid body fluids.</p><p>Sure, Broadway and Times Square were great places. Fancy cars, expensive clothes, spoiled celebrities. Where some people would stuff more cash in a valet\u2019s pocket than most people made in a month.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the city Logan knew.</p><p>She knew the darker parts. Chopped cars, ratty clothes, filthy rich drug dealers. Where if you so much as looked up when you heard the crack of a gunshot, the next bullet was shattering your skull.</p><p>That was the city Logan Ellis had known for over a decade.</p><p>She jogged across the street intersecting the alley, unmoved by the screeching tires of an old Buick as it swerved around her. When the driver snarled a lackluster string of obscenities through the passenger window made of plastic and tape, she presented the New York one-finger salute and kept going.</p><p>Less than three blocks away, a little bag of powdered-escape lie nestled in the pocket of a greasy man with chipped teeth. She wasn\u2019t about to let a car get in her way.</p><p>Halfway down the next alley, Logan slowed to a lazy pace. Fifteen yards in front of her, shadowed figures blurred and twisted. Feral growls mingled with the steady drumming of raindrops against the pavement, a symphony of mindless rage and nature\u2019s hatred.</p><p>Vampires. She stopped and leaned against the grungy brick wall of what used to be a Chinese Buffet. She bit off another piece of apple and chewed it as she watched the three figures attack each other. All roughly the same size, they clashed then drew back, circling like starved animals before doing the same dance again.</p><p>Six months ago she\u2019d have run away as fast as her legs would take her. Six months ago she\u2019d have let those legs run her straight to the nearest police station. Unfortunately, six months ago she\u2019d needed those very legs to stay upright when said police tossed her out on her ass after reminding her they didn\u2019t take statements from homeless drug addicts.</p><p>As an afterthought, she really didn\u2019t blame them. What were they supposed to do when a dirty street waif stormed through the doors, screaming about vampires fighting in an alley down the block? Run out into the night with their guns drawn and bust a cap in some undead ass?</p><p>Not hardly.</p><p>At first, she\u2019d been convinced a bad batch of drugs made her see them. But after seeing another fight break out a week later, then watching one stalk through a dilapidated warehouse leaving a trail of bloodless, vagrant corpses in his wake, she realized no amount of drugs would make them go away.</p><p>Neither did a week without drugs.</p><p>In the end, she\u2019d found herself with little choice to do anything other than accept that vampires were real, they had fangs, and they were everywhere. There was nothing she or the police could do about it, other than give her yet another NYPD standard issue boot print across her right ass cheek.</p><p>Having learned her lesson, now she just kept her distance and waited for the carnage to end. Eventually, they\u2019d either kill each other or scurry away at the first signs of morning, licking their wounds like human sized sewer rats.</p><p>Shaking back her sleeve, Logan glanced down at the shattered but still working face of her recently acquired timepiece. Three o\u2019clock in the morning. There was still a solid three hours of darkness before the sun would rear its ugly head.</p><p>She stared between the vamps and her watch. She really didn\u2019t have time for this kind of obstacle and couldn\u2019t take another route. Street dwellers were a territorial lot and she didn\u2019t have permission to follow any path but the one she was currently taking.</p><p>They left her with little choice.</p><p>Shearing off the last good piece of apple between her teeth, she smiled as she turned sideways and planted her right foot. Lifting her left knee, she bent her elbows and locked on her chosen target before whipping the apple core as hard as she could.</p><p>It smashed against the tallest vampire\u2019s head with a hollow, mushy thud. In less than the time it took her to resume her place against the wall, all three were facing her, fangs clearly visible.</p><p>She finished swallowing her dessert and grinned at their disbelieving faces. \u201cWould you beasties mind killing each other somewhere else, or at least stopping for a minute so I can get by?\u201d</p><p>The one she\u2019d thrown the fruit at snarled and snapped his teeth together like an angry dog. \u201cWhose Puppet are you?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. What the hell was that supposed to mean? But she didn\u2019t have time to consider it further, focusing instead on the much larger figure fading into view behind her fanged roadblocks. As it loomed forward, the shadows gave way to a pallid face framed by long, dark hair, spilling over broad shoulders.</p><p>Now he was a classic vampire.</p><p>The sound of clicking teeth pulled her attention back to the pissed off puppy and his question. \u201cPuppet? I\u2019m not exactly sure what that means. I suppose the only frayed strings I dance on are God\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a Puppet. She\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>Logan watched, more than just a little amused when her three roadblocks whirled around then straightened. Apparently the new vampire scared them with his comment. Whether it was the deep, rumbling timbre of his voice or the words themselves, she wasn\u2019t sure. Either way, the man garbed from head to toe in black didn\u2019t appear to be pleased.</p><p>He stared down at the men through sharp, narrowed eyes. \u201cHow many rules have I set for my city?\u201d</p><p>Each passed a glance between the others before the smaller one spoke. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know she was there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raised a large, black gloved hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask about her. I asked, how many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you recall the punishment for breaking that one, very simple rule?\u201d</p> <p>All three managed to nod before their bodies burst into a golden red haze, which quickly dissipated in the falling rain. No flash and flare, no theatric sounds, not even an angry declaration...they\u2019d simply vanished.</p><p>Had Logan not seen a vampire die before, she might have felt a tad unnerved by the sight. But having witnessed it a time or two already, she mainly found herself intrigued by how clean the whole process was. There was no release of foul smelling body fluids, no pools of blood to clean up, not even a body to dispose of.</p><p>It must be nice to leave nothing behind. Shaking her head to clear the dark memories threatening to overtake her, Logan stepped around the stone-faced ghost and continued down the alley.</p><p>She\u2019d barely gotten more than a few feet away before she sensed him fall into step beside her. Eyes focused ahead, hands in her pockets, she kept moving. \u201cAm I supposed to say thank you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no questions about what you just witnessed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think, to one such as yourself, it\u2019s not exactly normal, surmise it\u2019s not something you see every day.\u201d</p><p>Great. She was being stereotyped by a vampire. She made a mental note to return the favor at the first available opportunity before shooting him a sideways glare. \u201cWell, since one such as myself happens to walk these alleys rather frequently, one such as myself happens to see that on a fairly regular basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often?\u201d he asked, his tone tinged with something between anger and concern.</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cOnce every two, maybe three weeks. It usually ends with one killing the others or all of them running away when the sun spills over the horizon.\u201d She balanced her arms out to her sides as she prepared to jump over a large, overflowing pothole. \u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d</p><p>He caught her just as she landed, strong fingers closing tight around her elbow. \u201cLook at me.\u201d He didn\u2019t leave her much choice when he whipped her around to face him.</p><p>She tipped her head back and stared up into his piercing blue eyes. Had it been a much earlier time in her life, she might have thought him handsome and those eyes incredibly beautiful, but a decade on the street had done strange things to her perception of beauty.</p><p>Had it been a few months ago, she\u2019d have also spit in his face and kneed him in a very special place until he let her go. But after what he\u2019d done to the guys in the alley, she thought better of it. If he could kill other vampires so easily, she could only imagine the mess he\u2019d make of a human.</p><p>She momentarily considered the distinct slope of his cheekbones and chiseled cut of his jaw before returning to his eyes. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>His firm, full lips drew tight after what felt like an hour of intense scrutiny. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wrenched her arm free and started across the street towards a rundown convenience store on the corner. Casting a glance back over her shoulder, she smiled when he moved to follow. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p> <p>Kerestyan Nelek stared through the dingy windows of the convenience store, watching intently as the street waif pointed at something on the wall behind the clerk. Unusually tall and thin to the brink of emaciation, she nodded before tossing a few crumpled dollars on the counter.</p><p>She stepped out onto the sidewalk less than a minute later, a pack of cigarettes in one hand and a bottle of water in the other. Shards of short black hair hung in her green eyes, rain still dripping from the jagged ends even as she stood beneath the tattered green awning.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d opened the pack, discarded the wrapping in a rusty trashcan and lit a cigarette that she finally acknowledged his presence. \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</p><p>He considered her for another long moment. Thus far, she appeared to have little concern for how dire her situation was. Perhaps she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen something you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. It was a light, feminine sound and far more carefree than he\u2019d anticipated. \u201cBuddy, I\u2019ve seen a lot of things I probably shouldn\u2019t have, and done even more.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her dismissal. \u201cMy name is not Buddy, and what you\u2019ve seen doesn\u2019t bode well for your survival.\u201d</p><p>Again, her melodic laughter filled the air. \u201cLook, Vlad, I\u2019ve lived on the street for a long time. A lot of things don\u2019t and never did bode well for my survival. But at the end of the day, you know what?\u201d</p><p>Internally, he grinned at the Dracula reference. It was amazing what modern media had done to his kind. Outwardly, he showed no hint of amusement. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath and blew out a cloud of white smoke. \u201cI\u2019m still here. So spare me the threats and get on with whatever it is you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was he was going to do, had been decided the moment he\u2019d learned of her presence in the alley. Even more unfortunate for her was the lethal edge the decision gained when he\u2019d stared into her eyes and found she possessed several months\u2019 worth of memories involving vampires. However, her apparent and decided lack of concern for not only his very existence, but her own, caused a long forgotten emotion to spark in his mind.</p><p>He stepped forward to join her under the awning. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>She turned and, much to his surprise, motioned for him to follow as she began walking down the sidewalk. \u201cLogan. You?\u201d Taking another drag from her cigarette, her words puffed out past a smile, \u201cUnless it really is Vlad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my name isn\u2019t Vlad. It\u2019s Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds old.\u201d She tucked the bottle of water into a large pocket on the side of her ragged coat, which was easily three sizes too big and made for a man. \u201cSo, Kerestyan, what brings you out into the city on a beautiful night like this?\u201d</p><p>The sarcasm dripping from her words wasn\u2019t lost on him. He returned it. \u201cI was watching the Children.\u201d</p><p>She coughed out a laugh. \u201cAre you a babysitter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Lord.\u201d</p><p>Another smile spanned her colorless lips, lingering somewhere between playful and devious. \u201cHad I known God was so easy on the eyes, I might have thought twice about giving up on Him.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her appraisal of his physical body and focused on her admission. When he chose to engage with human women, they often commented on his pleasing appearance, but very rarely did they bother to share their beliefs with him. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in God?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, lips pursed as she inhaled another mouthful of acrid smoke. \u201cOh, I believe in Him. I just don\u2019t think He believes in me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan absorbed the irony of her statement and followed when she turned down another alley. Ambient light from faded billboards and storefronts cast a pale blue glow down the corridor. Refuse containers lined the crumbling brick walls, their contents spilling over the edges, littering the broken pavement in a rainbow of decaying colors. The stench of rotten food, wet animals and old blood hung heavy in the air, reminding him of London a thousand years previous.</p><p>He ground his teeth together, a habit he\u2019d adopted well before his earliest memories of London. Vampires were long rumored to be the most depraved, debased species, yet what humanity allowed itself to be surrounded by never ceased to amaze him. He knew few vampires who didn\u2019t surround themselves with luxury at every turn, and even fewer who wouldn\u2019t be enraged if caught in a place like this.</p><p>A few feet behind her, Kerestyan watched as rats scurried under windblown tents of damp, yellowed newspapers, squeaking and screaming near Logan\u2019s feet. She appeared to pay them little mind as she moved forward, her long legs allowing her to cover almost as much ground with one step as he could.</p><p>He stared at the back of her dark brown coat, which his heightened perception told him had once been a light caramel color. The woman moved with a confidence, a certainty that belied her familiarity with the territory, as if she knew nothing else \u2013 no other home.</p><p>Although he knew many humans did, Kerestyan had never understood how one could call a stretch of concrete their home. A lush swath of land one fought for and protected, yes. But not a cold, vapid maze of pavement that lent no comforting qualities.</p><p>He cast another glance over the dark alley. A home was a place for family, where safety was felt as easily as warmth and comfort. Even in death he knew what it was to have family, what it meant to have a home.</p><p>Did Logan have such a place, or was this truly all she knew?</p><p>He closed the distance between them in a single stride and tilted his head towards her. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see Larry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Larry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan felt his lips curl. He only knew one dealer in the city who went by the name of Larry, and he\u2019d never been overly fond of the man. \u201cWhy are we going to see a drug dealer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She brushed the glowing end of her cigarette against the wall, pinched the end then dropped it into her pocket before offering yet another smile. \u201cSo we can buy drugs. What else would we do with a drug dealer?\u201d</p><p>He could think of hundreds of things to do with a drug dealer, none of which ended in the dealer\u2019s favor. Unfortunately, he\u2019d quickly learned upon assuming the throne of New York that drugs were an integral part of human society here. And like it or not, a handful of vampires, some of whom were far older than Kerestyan, had their fingers firmly dug into the profits from the trade.</p><p>He smiled internally. His systematic eradication plan hadn\u2019t exactly gone over well with those vampires. Then again, it hadn\u2019t gone over well with the humans, either. In the end, too much investigation which brought the wrong kind of human authorities far too close to members of the vampiric race, forced him to accept that drugs always had, and would forever be a part of New York City.</p> <p>Kerestyan gazed down at Logan, noting for the first time the slightly sunken state of her eyes. \u201cHow long have you been engaging with Larry?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose as she pulled the bottle of water and a small plastic case from her pocket. \u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m getting down and dirty with him.\u201d Her body stiffened and her shoulders trembled a second before she stuck out her tongue. \u201cOh, it makes me want to gag just thinking about it. Yuck. Trust me when I tell you, it\u2019s a cash only transaction.\u201d</p><p>Although her reaction brought him great pleasure, and conjured a rather undesirable image of Larry, Kerestyan chose to focus on the matter at hand. \u201cYou do understand that whatever your chosen drug is, your life would be substantially better without it. Yes?\u201d</p><p>She jerked open the white case, flipped one end over and jammed it into the other, revealing an unexpected but well used toothbrush. \u201cGreat. My very own vampire moral compass.\u201d Bright blue paste bubbled up from the bristles as she squeezed the end. She slid it in her mouth and held it against the inside of her cheek. \u201cShould those words even be in the same sentence?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile. Truthfully, those words should have never been in the same thought, let alone a spoken sentence. But he wasn\u2019t about to openly admit that to her. \u201cAm I to infer that you believe vampires are morally corrupt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBankrupt,\u201d she said, though the word was garbled by the back and forth movement of the brush against her teeth.</p><p>Kerestyan stopped walking and crossed his arms over his chest when she turned around to face him. He\u2019d been many things through the course of his existence, but in no way or form was he, or had he ever been, bankrupt. He gave her a hard look. \u201cBankrupt?\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth around the toothbrush, using her teeth to hold it in place while she twisted open the bottle of water. It was only after she took a large mouthful, swished it around for what felt like an unnecessary amount of time and then spit it out, that she finally returned her attention to him. \u201cYes, bankrupt. As in, totally depleted or ruined.\u201d</p><p>He studied the frothy, blue and white marbled puddle less than two inches from his left boot. \u201cI am not morally bankrupt.\u201d</p><p>She took another drink of water then shoved the head of the brush in the bottle and shook it. \u201cOh no?\u201d Wickedness spread across her face as she deconstructed the toothbrush then slipped it back into her pocket. \u201cThen tell me, Great-Loving-and-Kind-Lord-Vampire,\u201d she paused to toss the bottle in a trashcan, \u201cwhy you\u2019re stalking me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the evil smile draped across her lips he found so intriguing, but more the challenge flickering behind her emerald eyes. \u201cI\u2019m following you because I can\u2019t allow you to return to your normal life, knowing what you\u2019ve witnessed.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes slowly traced the length of his frame before she stepped forward and tipped her head back. \u201cHave you been in this situation before?\u201d</p><p>He considered the thin strip of space separating them. Outside of feeding, he\u2019d never had a human, male or female, approach him with such little hesitation. \u201cThis exact situation, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne similar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cDid whoever was in my shoes meet the same end as the guys back in the alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled before she turned and began walking away. \u201cI may not be an expert, but something tells me murder probably strains the moral compass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know all other avenues were exhausted first.\u201d</p> <p>She slowed and spun on her heel. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t explain yourself to the human. Part of him wanted to heed the voice in his mind, but the other side was curious about how she\u2019d respond to the truth. As it was, she already knew far more than she should.</p><p>He moved forward, crowding her the way she\u2019d done to him only moments before. \u201cMental manipulation, memory reconstruction, and in some instances, memory removal.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t back away. Instead, she smiled again, only this time it was a wide grin revealing her perfect teeth. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure death causes memory removal.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist any longer. \u201cHow is it you\u2019re wearing a coat which looks to have been dragged behind a vehicle for fifty miles, your pants don\u2019t appear to have fared much better, and I\u2019d guess you haven\u2019t eaten in days...but you have the teeth of what most would refer to as a supermodel?\u201d</p><p>She stretched up to her toes and leaned in close, her warm, minty breath searing his ear. \u201cMost supermodels haven\u2019t eaten in days either.\u201d</p><p>This time, it was his laugh filling the air around them. From look alone, he would\u2019ve never expected such a quick and intelligent retort. He reached out and brushed away a few strands of wet hair that had fallen in her eyes. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Resting back on her feet, she eyed his hand as he withdrew it. \u201cYou know, for a bankrupt vampire who\u2019s resigned me to death, you\u2019re awfully interested in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d term it more as temporary curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m obviously not the first human who\u2019s been in this predicament with you.\u201d She tipped her head from side to side. \u201cOkay, so maybe not this exact predicament if I believe what you said earlier. But still, why me?\u201d</p><p>He stared down into her distant eyes. Much to his dismay, the reasons were growing by the minute, but he disclosed the most important. \u201cYou show little concern for your own safety, not to mention your complete dismissal of what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dismiss what you are.\u201d She shrugged and started walking again. \u201cIt\u2019s just...what am I supposed to do about it?\u201d She didn\u2019t leave time for him to answer before she added, \u201cAbout as much as I could do if you tried to kill me right here.\u201d</p><p>He fell into step beside her. \u201cI assure you, should I decide to end your life, I won\u2019t do so in the middle of a vermin infested alleyway.\u201d</p><p>She walked for a few minutes in silence, seemingly transfixed by the broken pavement at her feet. It wasn\u2019t until they neared the end of the alley that she finally raised her head and nodded at Larry, who stood under a broken streetlight on the corner across from them, hands hidden in the pockets of his dirty grey trench coat.</p><p>She stepped into the street but turned, leaving him with a view of her thin profile. \u201cWhatever you do to me, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be better than any way I\u2019d die out here.\u201d She stood quiet for another moment before inclining her head towards the corner opposite him. \u201cI have some business with Larry. Should I expect you\u2019ll be waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan slowly nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve not yet begun to finish our business.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Logan slid the baggie into her coat pocket then nodded at Larry, who smiled up at her, chipped teeth beaming rotten yellow. She rubbed the warm plastic between her fingers and felt her muscles relax, solely from knowing it was in her possession.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d Larry asked, motioning across the street behind her.</p><p>She turned and smiled as her eyes traced the length of Kerestyan\u2019s body. He was, without question, a much better sight than the one audibly counting twenty one-dollar bills less than a foot away.</p><p>He looked out of place standing at the mouth of the alley, an image of irony with his wide shoulders and regal stance as the wind sent trash scraping across the concrete around him. His stature alone was an oddity in this section of town, but his black button down shirt, matching slacks and clean, knee length wool coat, were even more so.</p><p>Truthfully, he looked like a business man who\u2019d made a wrong turn and ended up having to walk, because as destiny would have it, his Mercedes had broken down.</p><p>She waited until Larry reached twenty before she laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>Larry shoved the cash in his pocket. \u201cThen what the hell\u2019s he waitin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><p>After pushing her rain soaked hair away from her face , Logan shook the water from her hands. \u201cHonestly, I have no idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Larry looked her up and down from beneath a single raised brow, an appraisal that made her skin crawl. \u201cHe\u2019s dressed a little too fancy to be standin\u2019 out in the rain for nothin\u2019. You start hookin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, Larry. I started earlier tonight and already caught myself a millionaire. He says he gets off on skinny druggies with nice teeth.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, pulled a cell phone from his pocket and started punching numbers. \u201cI\u2019ve heard worse. Take care of yourself.\u201d He raised the phone to his ear and flashed that disturbing smile again. \u201cIf you wanna work for someone, let me know. I know a couple a people who\u2019d love to add a tall white girl to their stable.\u201d</p> <p>She turned her back to him and stepped into the street. \u201cThanks, Larry. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cKeep it in mind in case all of the Dumpsters in New York suddenly become empty and it never rains again.\u201d</p><p>When she heard Kerestyan laugh, she glared at him. Considering she was still a good fifteen feet away from where he stood, it was highly unlikely he\u2019d heard her grumbled comment. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything until she\u2019d rejoined him in the alley. \u201cThe chances of that happening are remote at best.\u201d</p><p>Well, apparently he did hear her. She started to ask for an explanation, but stopped and rerouted her thoughts. \u201cI take it super bat hearing comes standard on all vampires?\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t mistaken, the glow behind his intense blue eyes was born of pure amusement. \u201cSuper bat hearing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pulled the half cigarette from her pocket and lit it. \u201cDon\u2019t all the movies and whatnot compare vampire abilities to bats?\u201d</p><p>He gave a sideways nod, which caused his long, wet hair to fall over one shoulder. \u201cI suppose they do. However, I have to admit I know very few vampires who can turn into the fabled bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? No bats?\u201d She let smoke roll across her tongue for a minute before blowing it out. \u201cWell, what about turning into a wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Vampires do not turn into wolves.\u201d His tone was curt, and far more serious than she expected.</p><p>Interesting. She took another drag from her cigarette and tipped her head to the side. \u201cI remember seeing Fright Night when I was a kid. That guy turned into a wolf.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and exhaled a gusty breath. \u201cI don\u2019t care what modern media depicts. Vampires do not turn into wolves. That form is reserved for an entirely different species.\u201d</p> <p>Logan coughed and sputtered a few times before she could force the words out. \u201cA different species? What species?\u201d</p><p>With the way his lips thinned and tightened, it was clear he didn\u2019t appreciate the questions or their delivery. But his displeasure became even more obvious when he stopped and spun her to face him, his strong fingers digging into her biceps. \u201cYou need to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>She tried to jerk free of his hold, but this time it didn\u2019t work. He squeezed tighter, sending shocks of pain down the backs of her arms. \u201cLet me go. You said you wouldn\u2019t kill me in the middle of a dirty alley.\u201d She stumbled back and dropped her cigarette when he did as she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What the hell did I do?\u201d</p><p>He straightened, dark eyes locked on her. His pale face was cold and expressionless, like it had been right before he\u2019d done whatever resulted in the death of her once roadblocks. \u201cThe amount of information you currently possess calls for immediate execution. It benefits neither of us for me to add to your knowledge of the supernatural. Your choice is death, or temporary confinement while other avenues are explored. Make a decision.\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t do anything for a moment but stare up at him. Had she known two simple questions would cause such an extreme mood shift, she wouldn\u2019t have asked. But then, maybe it didn\u2019t have anything to do with her questions. Maybe he just ran out of blood or something and it happened to coincide with the timing of her questions?</p><p>Maybe vampires suffered from some backwards version of PMS...</p><p>The deep, rumbling sound of him clearing his throat pulled her attention away from considering his potential blood related emotional problems. She tipped her head back and closed her eyes, letting the cold rain splash against her face. \u201cYou want me to make the decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight here, right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d For the first time, the word rolled out as a growl.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see his thick arms folded over his chest, biceps straining the fabric of his coat. \u201cNeither choice is very appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither is this situation.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. She wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled with the situation either. It wasn\u2019t like she crawled out of her grungy warehouse one day and went searching for vampires. Of all the times she\u2019d stumbled across them, aside from her first encounter, only two instances ended in her having to run away. Once, they\u2019d even run from her. But more often than not, they just continued attacking each other or sucking on a bum or prostitute, and paid her little mind.</p><p>She considered Kerestyan\u2019s set jaw and narrowed eyes. Not one of those vampires looked like him. While he only appeared to be in his mid-thirties, there was something flickering behind his eyes, something dangerous about the way he held himself that said he hadn\u2019t been thirty for a very, very long time.</p><p>She shook her head. With that realization, she definitely didn\u2019t like her choices. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just make the decision, Lord Vampire?\u201d</p><p>He gave a single, clipped nod. \u201cFrom this moment forward, consider yourself remanded to my custody, duration unknown.\u201d</p><p>She threw her hands out. \u201cWait! What happened to temporary?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his arms and moved forward, which caused her to take small steps back until her shoulders were pressed against the slimy wall, palms flat against his hard chest. \u201cYou gave up negotiation rights when you refused to decide your own fate.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until that moment, with her back to the wall, that she finally felt the odd tingles running the length of her spine. Fear had never been an emotion she particularly cared for, and feeling it now, in a situation she\u2019d lost complete control over, only made her despise it more.</p><p>It also made her realize just how much smaller she was than him. At a little over six feet tall, most men were either at eye level or shorter than her. But the big, angry vampire in front of her, who still hadn\u2019t backed off, was a head taller and easily twice as wide.</p><p>She leaned her head back against the wall and cast a glance down one side of the alley, then the other. Choice one: She could knee him in the junk and hope he doubled over long enough for her to race down the alley and find a place to hide. Pro: She had to know the nooks and crannies of this end of town better than he did. Con: If she didn\u2019t, chances were he wouldn\u2019t be pleased at all and it would probably lead to memory removal.</p><p>Choice two: She accepted that fate had dealt her a really fucked up hand and she\u2019d become his prisoner \u2013 whether she liked it or not. Pro: Unless he started physically abusing her (which she didn\u2019t get the sense was his style), even prison involved a bed and three meals a day, none of which were prepared in a trashcan. Con: See memory removal.</p><p>Logan searched Kerestyan\u2019s stern face when the taut muscles under her fingertips flexed, taking on the texture of steel. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a choice, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ve had too much exposure to vampires to undergo mental manipulation or memory reconstruction, and your drug use only complicates the process.\u201d</p><p>The tingles danced a frantic number at the top of her spine, but what he\u2019d said was only half the reason...</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>He didn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The entire time she\u2019d stared at him, watching his eyes for any hint of emotion, not once had they closed. His chest didn\u2019t rise and fall at a steady pace underneath her hands. The only air he inhaled was just before he spoke, the only air he exhaled was while he talked or as an expression of irritation when she\u2019d asked about vampires turning into wolves.</p><p>He really was a vampire, not that she\u2019d doubted it. She knew they were real. She\u2019d seen them enough to believe her own eyes, whether they were drug hazed at times or not. She\u2019d just never had a conversation with one, never took the time to seriously consider the ramifications of their existence or the possible affect on her life.</p><p>Maybe she should have.</p><p>She stared between her fingers at the tiny crisscrosses of black fabric that made up his shirt. \u201cWhat avenues does that leave then?\u201d</p><p>His chest rose ever so slightly. \u201cNot many.\u201d It didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>The damn tingles exploded across the skin at the nape of her neck and shot down her arms, chilling her fingers more than the cold air and rain combined.</p><p>He inched closer and pushed an arm between her lower back and the wall. \u201cDo you have any personal items you\u2019d like to collect?\u201d His voice was quiet, almost a whisper.</p><p>She closed her eyes, knowing any opportunity to enact choice one had just slipped away. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there anything else you need before we leave?\u201d</p><p>She gave in to the shiver working its way through her body, focusing instead on how similar the feeling of complete resignation was to the moment she decided to leave home. How empty it felt then, how hard it was to feel now.</p><p>When she was little, her mother always told her everything happened for a reason. That life was a series of fragile moments strung together with diamond thread, and how she believed those threads led to a defining moment that forever changed a person\u2019s life.</p> <p>Everything seemed to go still as memories Logan wished could be removed flashed in her mind. Images blurred and twisted. Hazy pictures of happiness melted into crudely drawn nightmares, brought to life through a soundtrack of angry screams.</p><p>She shook her head, wanting nothing more than to drown it all out. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder how many threads connected to this moment. How many glittering strands were woven around her now, while she stood in more than just the darkness of the alley?</p><p>\u201cLogan? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>Pushing her memories as far back into her mind as possible, she forced herself to smile. \u201cHow about a juicy steak and a bottle of vodka?\u201d</p><p>A cool puff of air caressed her ear at the same moment his arm tightened around her, pulling her body tight against his. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do. In the meantime, keep your eyes closed. Mystical travel tends to be easier on the human psyche if the subject doesn\u2019t watch.\u201d</p> <p>Better for the human psyche it might have been, but his comment only made her very human curiosity peak. She squeezed her eyes hard, fighting the urge to open them as wide as possible. But when wind screamed down the alley, kicking up trash, dust, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, a squeaking rat or two \u2013 she was more than convinced of the reason to keep them closed.</p><p>It was when the wind reached fevered pitch that she felt the pavement drop out from under her feet and a wave of nausea crash over her. Her stomach churned and tightened. The muscles of her abdomen cramped and twitched. Bile seared the back of her throat.</p><p>For fifteen seconds, she felt like she\u2019d been sucked into icy oblivion.</p><p>But as quickly as the sense of dislocation came, it ended.</p><p>She wiggled her toes, relieved to feel solid ground against the soles of her shoes again. She had no idea where she was, though she knew they weren\u2019t outside because she wasn\u2019t getting wet. She had no clue what the hell had just happened, she only knew she never wanted to do it again.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p> <p>She slowly opened one eye when a deep, gravelly voice filled the room. A rather dark room she quickly realized, save a subtle blue light flickering against the white walls.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Logan.\u201d She heard Kerestyan\u2019s voice a second before his arm left her waist and a lamp clicked on a few feet away. \u201cShe\u2019s a guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose guest?\u201d</p><p>Logan really couldn\u2019t do anything but blink when the owner of the voice stood up from a comfortable looking couch across the room and stared right at her. She\u2019d seen a lot of strange things on the streets of New York City, but this...this took the cake.</p><p>Armor. The guy was wearing armor as clothing. Thick, black leather covered his body, and attached at the forearms, chest, thighs and shins were molded metal plates. The chest piece had the head of a dragon carved into it, but aside from that one simple embellishment, every inch of it was blacker than coal.</p><p>Kerestyan waved a hand in Medieval Man\u2019s general direction. \u201cSit down, Odin. She\u2019s my guest.\u201d</p><p>Odin, if that indeed was his real name, looked almost identical to Kerestyan in every way, except for their clothes, the faint scar marring his bottom lip, and the fact that his eyes were black. And not just his irises; his eyes were completely blacked out.</p><p>He raked her with a hard glare from those creepy depths then scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s wet and dirty. Where did you get it?\u201d</p> <p>Did she really just hear that? She stiffened and narrowed her eyes to match his. \u201cI\u2019m not an it.\u201d</p><p>He turned towards Kerestyan, mouth agape. \u201cYou brought one home that can still talk?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan made a good show of exhaling a deep breath as he shrugged his coat from his shoulders. \u201cYes, she is wet and dirty. Yes, she can speak. And yes, she is human.\u201d He stuffed his gloves into the pocket of his coat then draped it over the back of a dark grey chair. \u201cHer name is Logan, not it, and you will address her by her name and nothing else while she\u2019s in my home.\u201d</p><p>Odin\u2019s black eyes popped wide open. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping it?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan disappeared through a doorway, but his voice seemed to stay in the room. \u201cDo me a favor. Knock off the offended vampire routine. She\u2019s more than aware of what you are, and probably cares less about your undead state than you do about her dependence on oxygen.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled as she looked around the room, but even more when Odin wrinkled his nose as her eyes moved past him. Now that she knew, she wasn\u2019t surprised this was Kerestyan\u2019s home.</p><p>It suited him.</p><p>The colors were dark but rich. The furniture wasn\u2019t fancy, more comfortable in appearance and constructed from durable materials like leather. A few black and white photographs of the New York skyline from different time periods adorned the walls. Plants sat atop various dark wood end tables. Matching bookcases took up the wall farthest from her, and a line of heavy black curtains covered the entire wall to her right.</p><p>And of course there was the large television situated in the corner near the bookshelves, just a few feet away from the Renaissance Reject who was still giving her the evil eye.</p><p>She took a few hesitant steps towards him. \u201cDo I offend you or something?\u201d</p><p>It looked as though he intended to respond, but his mouth snapped shut when Kerestyan came back into the room with a cobalt blue plate in hand.</p><p>He held it out towards her. In the center was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, surrounded by apple slices. \u201cIt\u2019s not steak, but it\u2019ll have to do for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t feed it. It\u2019ll never leave!\u201d</p><p>Logan would have responded to the Tin Can, she really would have, but there were two very different reasons why she didn\u2019t. One, Kerestyan was already striding across the room. And two, she forgot just how sticky peanut butter, jelly and bread became when mixed with saliva.</p><p>By the time she managed to clear a path between her teeth and tongue, Kerestyan already had his finger jammed into Odin\u2019s chest. \u201cI told you what her name was. Brother or not, I\u2019ll rend the flesh from your bones if you defy my wishes again. Remember where you\u2019re standing.\u201d</p><p>Brothers? Well that certainly explained the resemblance. Content to let Kerestyan handle his own obviously dysfunctional family member, Logan shoved a piece of apple into her mouth and savored the clean, sweet taste of it.</p><p>Besides, who was she to interrupt vampire dinner theatre?</p><p>Odin tipped his head down and stared at Kerestyan\u2019s hand for a second before knocking it away. \u201cYeah, yeah. Your home, your law, and all that other old bullshit I\u2019ve tried so hard to forget. What the hell is she doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t here of her own accord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, is she food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kerestyan boomed. \u201cShe is not food.\u201d</p><p>Logan covered her plate as Odin took a few steps in her direction, but relaxed when he stopped a good ten feet away. She arched a brow, feeling a sudden and rather strange kinship with the apples as he leaned forward and sniffed the air around her.</p><p>He scrunched up his face and covered his nose. \u201cOh, gross. She stinks like a Jersey sewer.\u201d He lowered his hands and used one to waft air towards his face. \u201cShe\u2019s also an addict. My nose says heroin, white not brown, injected. For at least three years, maybe four.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s not a glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>Logan straightened. \u201cYou can smell my blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you open a package of meat, can you smell if it\u2019s rotten?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t award his response with an answer. Instead, she shrugged and took the biggest bite of peanut butter and jelly sandwich humanly possible. She\u2019d been cut down most of her life, one more person demeaning her, vampire or other, wasn\u2019t going to make a difference.</p><p>\u201cOdin, leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She seemed more than capable of defending herself when I called her an it, she can do the same now.\u201d</p><p>Logan licked a glob of strawberry jelly from her lower lip and smiled up at Odin. Only one comment seemed to perfectly fit her current situation. \u201cI see dead people.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, hands on his hips. \u201cMe, too. It\u2019s the only explanation for what\u2019s standing in front of me. Unless some high school kids broke into the anatomy closet and stole the classroom skeleton, stretched some cadaver skin over that bitch then cast an ancient ritual to animate it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. For as much as she now disliked the bastard, she had to admit he was amusing. \u201cDid they do the same to that shit you\u2019re wearing? You do realize it\u2019s 2008, right?\u201d She raised a hand. \u201cWait, let me see if I can reach you using your own language. You do ken \u2018tis year of our Lord two thousand and eight, aye?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood up and turned to Kerestyan, a shit eating grin stretched all the way across his face. \u201cI shall dub her, Bones. Henceforth, I shall refer to her by no other means. \u2018Tis now her title, she shall wear it well.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan didn\u2019t respond to his brother\u2019s anachronistic declaration. Instead, he pulled a roll of bills from his pocket and tossed it at Odin. \u201cThere\u2019s still two hours before sunrise. Would you please go down to the grocery store that\u2019s open all night and buy Logan a few articles of clothing?\u201d</p><p>Logan tried as hard as she could to keep the last piece of apple firmly in her mouth when the roll of bills sailed across the room and smacked into Kerestyan\u2019s chest with a hollow thud.</p> <p>\u201cI am so not going to buy her clothes. I\u2019m your twin, not your bitch.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan glared at him. \u201cI can\u2019t very well do it myself. After witnessing both of you in childish action, by the time I returned, you\u2019d most likely be missing a vital piece of anatomy, she\u2019d be dead, and my home would be in flames.\u201d</p><p>Odin gave her a dirty look but smiled at Kerestyan. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d He reached out and pinched Kerestyan\u2019s cheek. \u201cBut I\u2019m only doing it because my little brother asked so sweet.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing Logan had swallowed her last bite of sandwich; otherwise she\u2019d be choking on it. If for no reason other than the half-appalled, half-murderous look on Kerestyan\u2019s face.</p><p>Of course, by the time Odin had walked over to her, snatched the empty plate, unzipped her coat with a quick drop of his hand then wrenched it over her head...she was fairly sure her face mirrored Kerestyan\u2019s with astounding accuracy.</p> <p>When he grabbed at the hem of her first shirt, she jumped back and smacked his hand. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>A rather animalistic and equally as unsettling growl rumbled in his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t buy you clothes if I can\u2019t see what size you are. And I swear to God, if you so much as touch me again, I\u2019ll smear you from one end of this penthouse to the other.\u201d</p><p>Much to her relief, Kerestyan collared Odin from behind and yanked him back. \u201cLogan, would you be so kind as to strip down to a single layer, please?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cWhy yes, Kerestyan, because you asked so nicely and didn\u2019t start ripping off my clothes, I\u2019d be more than happy to fulfill your polite request.\u201d</p><p>Odin pushed the now laughing Kerestyan away. \u201cYou two sarcastic bitches deserve each other.\u201d</p><p>By the time Logan had removed shirts one through six, all of which ranged an odd span of colors and sizes, the laughter had faded and both men were staring at her. One mouth hung open while the other formed a thin line of disapproval.</p> <p>She smoothed the long sleeve of her tight, orange t-shirt. \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve never seen a woman wear more than one shirt before?\u201d</p><p>Odin\u2019s mouth closed and opened a few times before words finally came out. \u201cShe\u2019s like a fuckin\u2019 seven layer burrito someone forgot was in the back of the fridge for six months.\u201d</p><p>She had to laugh. How could she not with such vivid imagery coming from someone who dressed like he was going on an unholy crusade at any moment? \u201cIt\u2019s February in New York. Considering I sleep wherever I can, which is mainly outside or in buildings that don\u2019t have electricity, learning to layer is essential.\u201d</p><p>He actually snorted. \u201cSo is eating, Bones. Did you ever try that?\u201d</p><p>She stepped back when Odin squatted in front of her and moved to poke her, having learned her lesson about smacking him. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>It may have stopped him from touching her, but it didn\u2019t stop him from staring at her chest and abdomen like she was a science project. \u201cI think I can actually see all of her ribs.\u201d He stood up, inhaled a deep breath through his nose then returned to Kerestyan\u2019s side. \u201cYou should probably call Vouclade.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan nodded. \u201cAgreed. Are you returning to the castle tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, after I get her the clothes you asked for. Want me to tell him to stop by in the morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you would, please.\u201d</p><p>Not that she was part of the conversation anymore, but she had to point it out. \u201cIt is morning. And because I just have to ask, who\u2019s Vouclade and why is he in a castle?\u201d</p><p>Odin grinned. \u201cNot your morning, our morning. Vouclade is our brother, and he\u2019s in the castle because he lives there.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes closed then opened them slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re two thirds of triplets?\u201d</p><p>This time, it was Kerestyan who smiled at her. \u201cVouclade is our brother in blood, not birth. Odin and I are brothers in both.\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed a hand down her face. Vampires, castles and blood brothers. What the hell had she gotten herself into?</p><p>And where did names like Odin and Vouclade come from?</p><p>She splayed her fingers and peeked between them. \u201cI take it you\u2019re named after the Greek God of War, Odin?\u201d</p><p>His face scrunched up in a most unattractive way. \u201cWhat is this, mix and match mythology hour? Do I look Greek to you?\u201d She didn\u2019t have time to answer. \u201cI\u2019m a fucking Norseman, not some Greek pussy.\u201d He fisted a hand and slammed it against his chest plate. \u201cI wasn\u2019t named after Odin, I am Odin.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hand, eyes immediately jumping to Kerestyan as if she needed his affirmation. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI assure you, he was only worshiped as a God because of his supernatural abilities.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared between the twins. As if her night hadn\u2019t already taken a surreal turn, now she had to find a way to digest that she was standing less than five feet away from a revered mythological figure?</p><p>Maybe memory removal wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing after all.</p><p>Odin smacked Kerestyan on the back of the shoulder hard enough the crack echoed through the room. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get Bones some clothes. While I\u2019m gone, I\u2019d suggest a bath. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to give her a razor. Lord knows how much bush she\u2019s grown since the last time she used one.\u201d Then, right in front of her all too sober eyes, he disappeared into thin air.</p><p>In the moment immediately following, Logan felt as though she\u2019d taken the strange train to Vampireville. Human population: one lonely addict.</p><p>Unwilling to consider the thought any further, she gathered her shirts and coat then glanced up at Kerestyan, who was already watching her. \u201cWhere should I put these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>She indulged his request and stayed close as he moved through the doorway he\u2019d used earlier. A short hallway brought them to the kitchen, which much like the living room was decorated in dark colors and rather large. All the expected appliances were present, along with a few she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Another longer hallway opened at the back of the kitchen, four doors lined either side spaced about twenty feet apart, while a single door ended the hall roughly a hundred feet away. More art decorated the walls, only now it was in the form of paintings. Most were of older city scenes, and she was willing to bet not a single one was American.</p><p>He stopped in front of the third door on the right, pushed it open, and then turned around to face her. \u201cThis will be your room for the duration of your stay. A full bathroom adjoins it, so you should have all the privacy you need. There\u2019s a range of toiletries in the cabinet under the sink, feel free to use whatever you please.\u201d</p><p>Logan peered into the room, wondering whether what was happening to her was really all that bad. Huge wasn\u2019t even the right word to describe it, and luxurious barely did it justice. She inched inside when he stepped back and motioned towards the door. If he\u2019d looked out of place standing in the alley, right now she had to be returning the humorous image tenfold.</p><p>The large bed, a striking vision of cobalt blue velvet and silver silk, set angled in the left corner at the back of the room. Ornate chests, mirrors and dressers, all made of blackened woods and glass were scattered about. And the thick, black carpet actually squished under her feet as she slowly crept farther into the room.</p><p>She was definitely the odd one out now, with her arms full of clothes equally as dirty as the ones she still wore, and just as wet.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she heard a door close in the hallway that she realized Kerestyan had left her. She turned around just in time to see his large frame fill the doorway, dark fabric draped over one of his forearms, lips slightly upturned at the corners.</p><p>\u201cDo you like the room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Truthfully, it wasn\u2019t her style, but she\u2019d never say it wasn\u2019t beautiful. She also wouldn\u2019t deny it had a uniquely aged appeal. \u201cIt feels really old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Well, not the room itself, but everything inside.\u201d His firm lips stretched into a full smile. \u201cIncluding me.\u201d</p><p>She considered his position, leaning against the door frame. \u201cTechnically, you aren\u2019t in the room.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not argue semantics. I do that on an almost nightly basis with Odin.\u201d He slid the mass of black fabric down his arm and held it out for her. \u201cI brought you something to wear after you bathe. I apologize if they swallow you, but there\u2019s a marked difference in our stature.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She accepted his offering and resisted the odd impulse to hold his clothes under her nose. \u201cI thought Odin was bringing me new clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing you\u2019ll learn about Odin, he\u2019s easily distracted.\u201d He raised a hand and let the genuine smile touch his eyes. \u201cHe will bring you clothes, he said he would and he never goes back on his word. However, it may not be with any kind of alacrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it could be tonight, could be a week from now, but eventually they\u2019ll turn up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Eventually is a perfect word.\u201d</p><p>She jostled the arm holding her clothes. \u201cWhat should I do with these?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider the pile for a moment. \u201cHonestly, I think it would be better for your health if you allowed me to dispose of them, but I can have them laundered if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared down at her soiled layers. If someone had asked her a week ago whether making the choice to throw them away would be so hard, she would have easily said no. But right now, in a situation she had no control over, standing in a room that wasn\u2019t hers, deciding to throw away something that truly was her own, was more difficult than she ever imagined.</p><p>When he attempted to pull shirt six from the top of the pile, she tightened her arm against her chest. \u201cI, I don\u2019t...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Logan.\u201d His voice took on a gentle quality that made her shiver. \u201cI\u2019ll have them laundered.\u201d</p><p>Relaxing her arm, she allowed him to take her clothing. Once he had everything except her coat, she moved back in an effort to put a little more space between herself and the vampire. \u201cThanks. So, do you have any house rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re free to move about as you wish. The only thing I ask is should you move about during the day, please don\u2019t throw open any of the heavy draperies. The sun and I have a mutual disdain for each other.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, she wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cRoger that, Lord Vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, should you choose to explore and Odin happens to return in the midst of you doing so, consider him the mean dog and yourself the child with the sharp stick.\u201d</p><p>Her wide grin was completely involuntary. \u201cDoesn\u2019t deal well with humans, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the contrary, he spends a great deal of time with humans. It\u2019s just that there are places he expects them to be, and places he doesn\u2019t. My home happens to be one of the places he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and rested a hand on the door handle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, given a little time, he\u2019ll get used to you.\u201d He bowed his head as he pulled the door closed. \u201cGoodnight, Logan.\u201d</p><p>The second the door clicked into place, Kerestyan\u2019s offered clothes, which were so neatly draped over Logan\u2019s forearm, enveloped her face. She smiled against the soft material and inhaled deep, letting the scent fill her senses. Smoky and warm, the aroma reminded her of a wood fire just after a cold rain. There was also a hint of something sweet and earthy, and she would have tried harder to place the scent had the ghostly image of a campfire, complete with the faces of her mother, sister and father, not flared to life in her mind.</p><p>Forcing the memory aside, Logan dropped her coat on the floor, tossed Kerestyan\u2019s clothes on the bed then rushed to remove her own. After opening the door a few feet away and flipping on the light to make sure it was the bathroom, she dumped her wet underclothes in the chair outside and slammed the door closed behind her.</p><p>She pressed the heels of her palms against her closed eyes and curled her fingers around her forehead, letting her fingernails dig into her scalp. Given her current situation, she didn\u2019t have the strength to relive her past. What she needed to do was wash three weeks\u2019 worth of New York City filth from her body. She needed to focus on what was happening now, not what used to be.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to remember how happy and normal her life had been eighteen years ago when she was only twelve. She didn\u2019t need to remember how empty it\u2019d become less than a year later. And she most certainly didn\u2019t want to remember what it would never be again.</p><p>Chapter 4</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019d Bones go?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan looked up from the book he\u2019d been reading when Odin\u2019s much too happy voice broke the peaceful silence of the living room. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Odin wiggled his black eyebrows. \u201cIs she naked?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan flipped the book closed and stretched in his chair. \u201cI would assume not. I offered her a pair of sleeping pants and a t-shirt since I knew how unlikely it was you\u2019d return in a reasonable amount of time.\u201d</p><p>Odin dropped a canvas duffle bag on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s only Noon. Besides, I stopped at home and told Vouclade you needed a vet.\u201d He kicked the bag, which landed directly in front of Kerestyan\u2019s feet. \u201cHer clothes are in there.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan picked up the bag and set it in his lap. When he pulled open the zipper and saw the contents, a smile curved his lips. \u201cYou made her clothes.\u201d</p><p>Odin reached up and scratched the back of his head, false irritation crinkling the faint lines around his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a choice. The all night grocery store doesn\u2019t sell a size two meant to fit a six foot tall bean pole.\u201d</p><p>And thus his brother\u2019s true colors emerged. It was just a shame he refused to show them except for rare occasions.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Odin.\u201d</p><p>He abruptly turned and headed for the kitchen. \u201cYeah, yeah. You know you owe me a lot more than the grand you gave me, right?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan laughed as he set the bag back on the floor and moved to stand in the doorway of the kitchen. Nothing was closer to the truth. The only skill that outshined Odin\u2019s ability to make war \u2013 was his remarkable talent as a tailor.</p><p>He arched a brow as Odin, nose to the air, sniffed his way down the hallway leading to the bedrooms. Apparently his skill as a bloodhound was becoming almost as remarkable.</p><p>Odin stopped outside Logan\u2019s door and grumbled before working his way back to the kitchen. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping because she\u2019s high as a fucking kite, you know that right? I can\u2019t believe you let her shoot up in there.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan slumped against the door frame. He\u2019d caught the sweet yet chemically laced scent shortly after he\u2019d left her room, but hadn\u2019t felt it was his place to intervene. \u201cI\u2019m not her keeper, Odin. What she chooses to do with her own body is none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be her keeper, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be her savior. Have you smelled her? I mean, really gotten close and taken a big whiff?\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d intended the \u201csavior\u201d comment to sting, it worked. \u201cNo,\u201d Kerestyan growled. \u201cUnlike you, I never viewed her as food.\u201d</p><p>After pulling open the door, Odin buried his head in the refrigerator. \u201cYou should. Because what she\u2019s choosing to do with her own body,\u201d his accusing black eyes peeked over the top of the door, \u201cher very human and very fragile body...is slowly killing her. Not to mention how much it\u2019s gonna piss off Vouclade.\u201d His eyes returned to searching the shelves. \u201cYou know how he feels about drug addicts.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan rubbed a hand across his forehead. He knew all too well how Vouclade felt about substance abusers and their dealers. After all, he\u2019d been a more than willing participant in the short lived systematic eradication plan, and a rather happy one at that.</p><p>The impending conversation with Vouclade had the propensity to get very ugly, equally as fast.</p><p>\u201cKerestyan? Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stepped back into the living room and picked up the book he\u2019d been reading before Odin so rudely interrupted his day. \u201cWhat form of payment would you like for the clothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna know what you plan on doing with Bones.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and stared at the empty slot on the bookshelf across the room.</p><p>So much for changing the subject.</p><p>He inhaled a deep breath then slowly blew it out. As much as he wanted to, lying to Odin wasn\u2019t an option. Not that he couldn\u2019t, it just never worked. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>Only a few moments of silence passed before Odin reappeared in the living room with a sandwich almost as big as his head. He took a disturbingly large bite and somehow managed to make intelligible sounds around it. \u201cWell, you better get your ass in gear and make up your mind before Vouclade gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already here.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan turned just in time to see his older sibling materialize through the steel elevator doors, which also served as the entrance to his home. \u201cA little warning would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Odin I would be leaving shortly after he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOobs.\u201d This time the cheese stringing between the sandwich and Odin\u2019s big mouth hampered his annunciation.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to leave?\u201d Vouclade asked.</p><p>Kerestyan shook his head. \u201cNo. I just hadn\u2019t fully prepared for your arrival. I was expecting to see you sometime after sunset.\u201d</p><p>When a rather satisfied moan followed the wet sounds of chewing, Vouclade narrowed his grey eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we adjourn to the kitchen before I kill your brother?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMucc Ooo, Ookie.\u201d</p><p>Fairly certain he\u2019d understood exactly what Odin had just said, Kerestyan smiled at Vouclade. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother, too.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade melted through the wall between the living room and kitchen, but not before countering. \u201cGenetics are thicker than blood.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Kerestyan put the book away and made it to the table in the back corner of the kitchen, opposite the hallway leading to the bedrooms, Vouclade was already sitting with his hands neatly folded in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Kerestyan, what\u2019s so interesting about your human.\u201d</p><p>Knowing how Vouclade preferred to get right to the point, Kerestyan sat down and did his best to appease him. \u201cAside from needing basic medical care, I believe she\u2019s suffered some kind of emotional trauma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would imagine she\u2019d benefit from some kind of therapy. I thought you would be more than capable of helping her. You are the family doctor.\u201d</p> <p>A single obsidian brow arched over the top of Vouclade\u2019s wire rimmed glasses. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of my station, thank you. However, not every human needs therapy, Kerestyan. What makes you believe she does, and that she\u2019d even agree to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a human, she\u2019s remarkably detached and entirely disengaged from the world around her. Her emotional responses are few and far between, and it takes an extreme amount of provocation to elicit one.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade cocked his head, his long, black dreadlocks sliding across his leather clad shoulder with the movement. \u201cHave you tried to provoke her?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan nodded. \u201cI threatened to kill her, to which she seemed completely unmoved. I also physically accosted her and forced her to make a decision between death and imprisonment, to which her emotional response was minimal at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she knew you didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan relaxed in his chair and closed his eyes. He should have known his brother would try to psycho analyze him first. \u201cAt the time, I was more than serious and had every intent to do so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. She\u2019s strangely intriguing for a human. It\u2019s not often you find one who\u2019s been exposed to vampires, with no explanation for our existence, who shows such little concern for our presence. She simply accepted it and adjusted accordingly.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade didn\u2019t appear to be impressed. Then again, his cold and logical demeanor didn\u2019t lend well to emotional displays of any kind. \u201cOdin told me he suspects she\u2019s lived on the streets for quite some time. Perhaps her survival instincts have been honed to a fine point. Maybe she realized there was little she could do about the heathens roaming your city and thought it best to stay away instead of inquiring as to why they had fangs.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan caught the whisper of bare feet against hardwood a second before he heard Logan\u2019s voice. \u201cActually, I just didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He focused past Vouclade to see her, dressed in the clothes he\u2019d given her, standing at the other end of the kitchen. He stood up and rested a hand on the back of the chair he intended to pull out for her as a flood of warm sensations rippled in his blood.</p><p>Bathed, she looked like an entirely different woman.</p><p>Her glossy black hair hung in her eyes, lending her a sexy, playful quality he hadn\u2019t noticed before. Her skin, although still pale, starkly contrasted the dark t-shirt and satin pants, making her green eyes glow with an alluring intensity. And her lips, once tight and colorless, now relaxed and taunted him with a dusky pink hue even from across the room.</p><p>The light scents of mint and juniper invaded his senses as she slowly moved towards him, the gentle sway of her stride allowing him to see the erect state of her nipples as his t-shirt shifted over her small breasts.</p> <p>Though she wasn\u2019t what the general human population would consider beautiful, there was something in her confident manner, something about the way she sauntered up to him and stood only inches away that made every inch of his body acutely aware of hers.</p><p>It was the parting of her lips and the flash of her perfect teeth that pulled his attention back to her eyes. \u201cI take it you approve of the way I clean up, Lord Vampire?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taken even more by her direct nature. \u201cI do.\u201d He reached out and tucked an unruly strand of hair behind her ear, enjoying the soft, warm feel of her skin and the damningly seductive curve of her lips as she smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never wished to repossess a shirt before.\u201d</p><p>The acute sound of choking that emanated from the living room, followed by unnecessarily loud coughing, reminded Kerestyan they weren\u2019t exactly alone. He withdrew his hand and pulled out the chair across from Vouclade. \u201cPlease, sit and accept my apologies. I meant no offense by talking about you when you weren\u2019t present.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath when, instead of walking around him, Logan slipped her thin body between him and the back of the chair. He stiffened as her taut nipples grazed his chest, rousing the slumbering animal inside him. He pressed his lips together, struggling to keep his fangs from growing as he moved to retake his own seat.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time since merely the touch of a woman had stirred the beast inside him. He shifted as a surge of blood rushed to his groin. It\u2019d been even longer since anything but the promise of feeding had stirred that, too.</p><p>He focused back on Logan as she smiled at Vouclade, who watched her through curious eyes. \u201cIs Kerestyan always so damn polite and courteous?\u201d</p><p>The bastard nodded. \u201cYes. If you find it distasteful now, imagine being subjected to it for ten millennia.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose as she braced her hands against the arms of the chair then curled her long legs beneath her. \u201cNow that would be torture.\u201d She eyed Vouclade\u2019s black leather shirt as disbelief touched her eyes. \u201cBut ten thousand years? That\u2019s just an exaggeration for effect, right?\u201d She didn\u2019t sound the least bit convinced.</p><p>Although Kerestyan wasn\u2019t sure it was possible anymore, by the way Vouclade\u2019s spine straightened, he actually appeared offended. He narrowed his grey eyes on her. \u201cI deal in facts, Logan, not exaggerations nor theories which hold no merit. Why is ten thousand years so difficult for you to accept? What would you say if I told you I was twice Kerestyan\u2019s age?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re full of shit. I spent a lot of time at the public library on subzero and blistering days, reading and watching movies. I\u2019m pretty sure if anything more than spear chucking humans were around 20,000 years ago, science would know. Or at the very least, found signs of more than crude stone tools.\u201d She tipped her head to the side and flashed Vouclade a brilliant, taunting smile. \u201cYou\u2019re just messing with me.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan forcefully cleared his throat. Concerned Logan might be overwhelmed by the amount of information Vouclade had the propensity to spout, he pinned his brother with a hard glare. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we focus on the matter at hand? I\u2019m not sure now is the best time to explain ancient history to Logan.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade, whose cold grey eyes were still locked on Logan, completely ignored the request. \u201cHuman scientists and historians know of the world, only what we want them to know,\u201d he said in a dry but serious tone. He raised a boney hand and motioned towards Logan\u2019s head. \u201cThe difficulty your mind is experiencing at this moment is exactly why we release historical truths in very small, carefully timed doses. The human brain has great difficulty reconciling advanced civilizations existed so long ago. I believe it has something to do with the human ego, which absolutely despises the thought of not being the superior species. However, it\u2019s that very ego which allows most humans to reason away any interaction with a supernatural creature. They dismiss what is sometimes obvious as a side effect of stress or an over active imagination. The human mind is our greatest ally in terms of keeping our existence hidden. That is, until our true nature is revealed to someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan watched as Logan\u2019s green eyes shimmered with a dark but strangely beautiful light, which only worsened his surging blood problem.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes on Vouclade. \u201cYeah, well, I stopped ignoring what was right in front of my face a long time ago.\u201d She relaxed and brushed the hair from her eyes with pale, delicate fingers. \u201cI won\u2019t lie. When I realized vampires were real, it scared the crap out of me. But after a few weeks, I was shocked at how much more sense my world made.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan smiled as she absently stroked the hollow of her throat. \u201cThe truth has an odd habit of illuminating even the darkest places.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her gaze to him. \u201cSpeaking of dark,\u201d she said, peering at him through long black lashes. \u201cI looked outside before I came out here. I thought vampires slept all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young ones do,\u201d Vouclade offered before he had a chance. \u201cHowever, as we age, our vulnerability to the sun\u2019s crushing presence wanes. Unfortunately, our resistance doesn\u2019t extend to its rays.\u201d He glanced up at the ceiling for a moment before refocusing on Logan. \u201cIn other words, while we\u2019re more than functional during the day, we still can\u2019t venture outdoors.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The perturbed look on Logan\u2019s face said she didn\u2019t appreciate the layman\u2019s terms. \u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d she quipped. She switched the position of her legs, her sparkling eyes fixed on Vouclade. \u201cSo, how long has it been since you\u2019ve seen the sun?\u201d She arched an inquisitive brow, lips slightly pursed. \u201cDo you miss it?\u201d</p><p>Vouclade didn\u2019t even flinch at the personal question. \u201cFar longer than it\u2019s been since Kerestyan last saw the sun,\u201d he offered plainly, \u201cbut not nearly as long as it\u2019s been since our Father last gazed upon it. And no, under no circumstances do I miss it. I revel in my undead state.\u201d He leaned forward as if he meant to stare through her. \u201cSo tell me, Logan, how is it you became homeless?\u201d</p><p>Logan fought the urge to smile. She wasn\u2019t sure which was worse: Vouclade\u2019s challenging stare, which she was more than willing to accept; or the way Kerestyan\u2019s eyes kept lingering on her lips.</p> <p>You could accept those, too. She pushed the traitorous voice aside and focused on Vouclade\u2019s question. \u201cAfter my mom died, my father became a verbally abusive alcoholic. By the time I turned fifteen; I\u2019d had enough of his mouth and figured I\u2019d be better off on my own. I don\u2019t have a diploma. I don\u2019t have a license or social security card, and,\u201d she couldn\u2019t hold the smile any longer, \u201cI don\u2019t have any legally marketable skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you stay at the beginning of your independence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir parents didn\u2019t ask questions?\u201d</p><p>She took a moment to laugh. \u201cThe kind of friends I had didn\u2019t have parents. I fell in with a bad crowd right after I turned thirteen. Most of them were already over eighteen.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a sharp, disapproving look, which wasn\u2019t difficult due to his hawkish features. \u201cAre they the ones who assisted you in becoming addicted to heroin?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. Was he trying to bait her? Hopefully he wouldn\u2019t be too disappointed to learn she didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what he thought of her. \u201cDid they introduce me to drugs? Yes. Did they get me addicted? No. I did that all on my own.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t visibly react, he simply fired again. \u201cSo you take complete responsibility for where you\u2019re currently at in your life?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. If there was one thing she could say, she\u2019d always taken responsibility for the consequences of her actions, good or bad. Although, the number of the second far outweighed the first. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame your mother for your situation?\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in her body tensed at once. Her mother\u2019s death may have precipitated the change in her father, but she\u2019d never thought to blame her for it. \u201cWhy would I blame her? She didn\u2019t ask to have her insides eaten by cancer. What happened between me and my father didn\u2019t really have anything to do with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you blame your father for your situation?\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. Her father was a topic she felt absolutely no remorse when discussing. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe if he hadn\u2019t been an alcoholic and forced you to leave your home, things might have turned out differently for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t force me to leave. I could\u2019ve stayed, but I made my choice. And if you took me back to that moment, even knowing then what I know now, I\u2019d still make the same choice. Living anywhere would have been preferable to staying with him.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade reached up and adjusted his glasses. \u201cWhat about the situation you\u2019re in at this moment? You\u2019re being held captive by an Ancient vampire, The Lord of New York. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>She slid her gaze over Kerestyan and grinned when he shifted in his chair. Apparently, and without proper notice, a much earlier time in her life had just crashed into her present, because now she did see his handsome face and incredible blue eyes.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t deny he was easy to look at when she\u2019d first met him. But now...right now she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if some invisible, gossamer-winged creature had shot her in the ass with a horny dart.</p><p>She smiled at the thought. Hell, if vampires were real, she supposed anything was possible.</p> <p>She squirmed as Kerestyan\u2019s eyes moved over her lips then down across her neck, an appraisal that made her nipples tighten and pucker again.</p><p>Damn it! The man needed to stop looking at her like that.</p><p>The insistent sound of Vouclade clearing his throat drew Logan\u2019s attention back to his question. \u201cHow do I feel?\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cIt could be a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Vouclade asked.</p><p>She nodded again. One possibility immediately came to mind. \u201cI could be stuck with Odin.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle rumbled in Kerestyan\u2019s muscular chest. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Vouclade added. He adjusted one of the many silver buckles on his bondage-style, black leather shirt. \u201cHe takes quite a bit of patience.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cI bet he does. But to honestly answer your question,\u201d she motioned towards the covered windows, \u201cit was snowing when I looked outside earlier, which means the temperature\u2019s either below or hovering around freezing. It was raining last night, which also means in about six hours all that water is going to ice over. The building I usually stay in leaks and the wind cuts through the walls. Most of the shelters around here know I\u2019m a lifer and usually don\u2019t let me in for anything more than a quick meal.\u201d</p><p>She cast a slow glance over the spotless kitchen before returning to Vouclade. \u201cIt\u2019s warm in here, there\u2019s food that\u2019s probably never been in a trashcan, and Kerestyan gave me a bed with clean sheets. You may see me as just another homeless person, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stupid. For now, my life could be a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade unfolded his hands and leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou have no intention of running?\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed out loud this time. Truthfully, she\u2019d considered it. But after looking out her window and realizing she was roughly eighty stories above the street, she couldn\u2019t come up with an escape route that didn\u2019t end with her splattering the sidewalk in an array of blood and brain matter.</p><p>Being viewed as a Nouveau piece of artwork by the population of downtown Manhattan wasn\u2019t exactly her first choice of how to spend her final moments.</p><p>She eyed Vouclade when he tapped an impatient thumb against the table. \u201cWhy? So Kerestyan can hunt me down? No thanks. Besides, I\u2019ve accepted I don\u2019t have a choice right now. Trust me. I spent a good two hours thinking about how to escape this morning. No matter what I came up with, it all led to something unpleasant or right back to him.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade tipped his head back slightly and stared at her. \u201cAnd if he chooses to kill you when all is said and done?\u201d</p><p>Logan rolled her eyes. What the hell kind of question was that? \u201cThen I suppose he does. There\u2019s not much I can do about it. He\u2019s bigger than me, stronger than me, and although he comes off all polite and gentlemanly like a politician, he\u2019s probably just as mean and ruthless when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>It took everything she had not to laugh when Kerestyan immediately stiffened and his eyes narrowed to thin slits. \u201cI take offense to that. I\u2019m not a child. I don\u2019t throw a temper induced fit when denied whatever I set my sights on.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand at him. \u201cTake all the offense you want. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve seen vampires in action. I\u2019ve watched them get all pissed and freak out when someone does something they don\u2019t like. They get this look in their eyes, this glazed no-one\u2019s-home kind of stare. And I\u2019ve seen it more than once, on one\u2019s from completely different walks of life. So I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a shared trait. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan\u2019s mouth opened, but it was Vouclade\u2019s voice she heard. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not wrong. Actually, that\u2019s a very astute observation. Granted, Kerestyan is far older than any of the whelps you\u2019ve come across and it would take much more provocation to elicit that response from him, but he too is susceptible to \u2018freaking out\u2019 as you called it.\u201d</p><p>She stretched out her arms and folded them behind her head. \u201cI may not be afraid to die, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to go out and try to get myself killed.\u201d She stared between the both of them. \u201cI may be a lot of things, but I\u2019m not suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t bothered by being forced to stay here?\u201d Vouclade asked, now watching her with a different kind of intensity. \u201cHaving your freedom taken away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I absolutely tickled to be here?\u201d She shrugged a shoulder. \u201cNot really. I didn\u2019t ask for this. I didn\u2019t ask to be introduced to vampires. I didn\u2019t necessarily want to know there are people,\u201d she cocked her head, \u201cdo you call yourselves people?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since the interrogation began, Vouclade\u2019s mouth relaxed into a smile. \u201cYou can call us whatever you like. We were all human once. Some were far longer ago than others, but we were all human in the beginning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, well, I didn\u2019t necessarily want to know there were people out there who considered me food. I\u2019d use the meat analogy Odin used on me earlier, but I\u2019m not sure if an animal really knows it\u2019s someone\u2019s food. I, on the other hand, have the mental capacity to feel a little weirded out by the whole thing.\u201d She cast a tentative glance to Kerestyan. \u201cAre you going to eat me?\u201d</p><p>Amusement flashed behind his eyes before he gave a more thoughtful look. \u201cHeroin thins human blood and leaves a rather bitter taste in its wake. In all honesty,\u201d he raised a hand, \u201cand I mean no offense, but it\u2019s not a flavor I particularly care for. Besides, as I told Odin earlier this morning, I never viewed you as food.\u201d</p><p>Logan shivered as a chill skittered up her spine. There was something seriously disconcerting about being referred to as food. \u201cI guess I never thought about what chemicals might do to my blood. But then again, I wasn\u2019t really trying to make myself taste better.\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan laughed a warm sound, which only caused Vouclade to shoot him a nasty glare. \u201cYou intend to allow her to continue using that vile substance while she\u2019s in your care?\u201d</p><p>She watched intently as Kerestyan shifted again. Only this time he appeared much more uncomfortable. \u201cIf that\u2019s her choice, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade didn\u2019t look pleased. \u201cAnd exactly how do you intend to supply the drug for her?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan glanced around the room before returning to his brother. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019d be viewed as a poor Lord if I didn\u2019t know where and who sold illegal drugs in my city. Besides, if need be, you can provide her with the clean, natural version.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade\u2019s hand smacked hard against the table, sending a small crack spidering across the dark wood. \u201cAbsolutely not. If she wishes to fill her body with all manner of putrid substances when she\u2019s on the streets, then so be it. I, however, refuse to be party to what appears to be a very intelligent young woman, murdering herself in small doses.\u201d</p> <p>Tired of watching the verbal ping-pong match in which her life was the little plastic ball, Logan leaned forward and jabbed a finger in Vouclade\u2019s direction. \u201cNo one has the right to tell me what I can put into my body, but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncorrect,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou relinquished your freedom the moment Kerestyan ushered you into his home. Your life is in Nelek hands now, subject to Nelek whims.\u201d He stood and faced Kerestyan. \u201cHe will not condone it, and you well know that.\u201d</p><p>Logan unfolded her legs and stood as anger bubbled up inside her. \u201cNo one needs to condone anything. I\u2019m an adult. If I choose to inject anything into my body, it\u2019s my choice. Not yours, or Kerestyan\u2019s, or anyone else\u2019s for that matter.\u201d</p><p>When Vouclade completely ignored her, as if she hadn\u2019t spent the last half-hour politely answering his rapid fire questions, she started around the table.</p><p>Maybe if she got in his face, he\u2019d be more willing to acknowledge her.</p><p>She was half way around the large table when Kerestyan appeared in front of her, blocking her path. She moved to push past him but winched as his cold fingers clamped around her shoulders. \u201cLet me go, Kerestyan.\u201d</p> <p>He stared down at her, concern etched into the faint lines around his eyes she hadn\u2019t noticed before. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Logan. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d His deep voice took on a soft, calming quality. \u201cAt this point, I have to ask that you return to your room.\u201d</p><p>Logan tried to pull away, but when she realized he wasn\u2019t going to let her, she straightened and stared right back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to tell me I\u2019ve seen too much and make me come with you until you decide what to do. I don\u2019t like it, but I know when I\u2019m in over my head...that I can at least accept. It\u2019s another thing to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do with my own body!\u201d</p><p>His fingers tensed, digging even deeper into her shoulders as Vouclade\u2019s voice rose from behind them. \u201cPerhaps one day when you have more respect for yourself, you\u2019ll start treating your body accordingly.\u201d</p><p>She was fairly sure if she had a pissed off gauge, Vouclade had just broken it. \u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, Bones. After God knows how many years on the streets, drugs probably aren\u2019t the only foreign thing you\u2019ve put into your nasty little human body.\u201d</p><p>Logan thrashed against Kerestyan\u2019s hold as Odin\u2019s snide voice filled the room. \u201cOh, great...the Tin Can\u2019s back. Maybe the stick figure over there has a scientifically advanced can opener up his ass that I can use to pry you out of that shit you call clothes!\u201d</p><p>Odin\u2019s loud laughter echoed all around her. \u201cThat was a good one, Bones. I think I might\u2019ve just gained a little respect for you.\u201d His fat head disappeared behind the refrigerator door.</p><p>She ground her teeth as Kerestyan crushed her against his hard body then pressed his soft lips to her ear. \u201cPlease. It\u2019s not my wish to force you, but I think it would be best if you returned to your room for now.\u201d Her earlobe tingled from the sting of his cool breath.</p> <p>\u201cNot your wish to force me?\u201d She focused on her anger, anything to help lessen the impact his tangy scent had on her racing heart. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve done since I met you.\u201d</p><p>His body went rigid. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best to offer you as many choices as possible, which is a courtesy not many in this life are given.\u201d His jaw flexed like cold stone against her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret the decision.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan released Logan when she attempted to pull away again, and then watched as she disappeared down the hallway in a flash of black satin. The only sound that followed was the door to her room slamming shut, hard enough to rattle every painting in the hall.</p><p>This was not, in any form or fashion, how he\u2019d hoped her conversation with Vouclade would end. He\u2019d half expected she\u2019d be irritated with his older brother by the end of the discussion, but he\u2019d hoped her anger wouldn\u2019t encompass him.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need therapy.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan spun around and stared at Vouclade. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe displays no signs of mental illness. She\u2019s a competent, functioning adult who understands her own actions have brought her to this point, and she takes responsibility for them. I agree there is a past trauma, but it\u2019s my opinion if you press her to reveal it, you\u2019ll find she\u2019s come to terms with her past and it doesn\u2019t hinder her daily life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her obvious detachment?\u201d</p><p>Vouclade gave a bored stare. \u201cIs to be expected considering her lifestyle. To be blunt, she\u2019s the product of too many years spent alone, and too much time experiencing the worst the world has to offer. Her heart may still beat, she may still need oxygen and food to fuel her body, but at her core she\u2019s more vampiric than most of the Fledglings running around your city.\u201d He moved to retake his seat, a vicious smile twisting his mouth. \u201cTell me, when you found her, how deep into her memories did you delve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very far, I only skimmed the surface of her mind to ascertain how long she\u2019d been exposed to our kind. Once I realized the length of time I withdrew, knowing the chances for reconstruction were minimal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more correct than you know,\u201d Vouclade said, sounding slightly amused. \u201cHaving fully perused her memories during our exchange, I think it\u2019s important you know that she\u2019s had a number of encounters with your Fledglings. Some of whom completely ignored her when she interrupted them feeding.\u201d</p><p>Fury roiled in Kerestyan\u2019s gut, but he wasn\u2019t sure what bothered him more. That Vouclade had so casually traipsed through Logan\u2019s mind; or that the younger vampires of his city would be so ignorant to the presence of a human.</p><p>Unfortunately, because Vouclade was older, Kerestyan had no right to question his use of blood magic on Logan. However, he could pick his brother\u2019s Ancient mind regarding the stupidity of Fledglings and hope it lead to more answers about her situation.</p><p>He inhaled a deep, unnecessary breath. \u201cWhy would they dismiss her if she interrupted their feeding? Why wouldn\u2019t they report her or call for assistance if they couldn\u2019t contain the situation? I have an Enforcement Team for that very reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect the reason she\u2019s gone undetected for so long is the strong detachment in her eyes. After viewing her memories, it\u2019s clear to me that your Fledglings assumed she was already a vampire, or at the very least, a Servio of substantial age. Otherwise she\u2019d have never gotten away with throwing fruit at the three she found last night. No Fledgling could believe a human would be so brazen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Odin gleefully interjected. \u201cBones threw food at vampires? You should take her to see Dad.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan rubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Vouclade said. \u201cShe displays a number of traits which suit our blood.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan lowered his hand and stared at Vouclade. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. Need I remind you how Father feels about modern humans?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vouclade drew an irritated breath, a sign his patience was diminishing. \u201cI\u2019m very serious, Kerestyan. Logan is intelligent, forthright, and has lived a life closer to that of a peasant than most modern humans ever will. And for the most part, aside from her addiction, she appears to have lived it successfully. She has no real aversion to our kind, has a survival instinct that would rival any young vampire\u2019s, but also realizes sometimes survival means bending to outside forces. I believe she has at least a fifty percent chance of becoming our newest sibling.\u201d</p><p>While Kerestyan struggled to digest the seriousness in Vouclade\u2019s tone, Odin could barely choke the words out between hysterical bursts of laughter. \u201cDad\u2019s not gonna turn her. Make her a Servio, maybe. But he\u2019s not gonna put the bite on her.\u201d He waved a flailing arm at Vouclade. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>The lethal set of Vouclade\u2019s eyes said he didn\u2019t appreciate Odin\u2019s dismissal. \u201cServing a Nelek in blood is almost as dangerous as being a Nelek in blood. Need I call Alfred to explain why your laughter is completely uncalled for?\u201d</p> <p>Odin quickly sobered. \u201cHell no, he\u2019ll kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for illustrating my point.\u201d Apparently finished with Odin, Vouclade turned to face Kerestyan. \u201cSince you have no real intention of killing her, I suggest you start the process of purging her system immediately. Father will not look favorably upon her unless her blood is free of impurities.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan ground his teeth together. \u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind as to whether this life suits her yet. She\u2019s already detached from humanity. Suffering the dark urges of the beast in any capacity, be it as a servant or a full-fledged vampire, may only degrade her further.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade\u2019s gaunt frame flickered between solid and insubstantial, a clear sign his patience had reached its end. \u201cSpare me your misplaced concern for her humanity,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou may have begun your association with her intending to take her life, but that ended the moment you brought her into your home. And if by chance it didn\u2019t,\u201d he raked Kerestyan with a knowing glare, \u201cit certainly did the moment she stepped into the kitchen.\u201d He moved through the table to stand in front of Kerestyan. \u201cAs it stands, above all else, Logan is a breach of the Veil. She knows we exist and she shouldn\u2019t. That fact doesn\u2019t change simply because she\u2019s in your home. Her presence here only assures she can\u2019t run to the media or human authorities.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan straightened to his full height and met his brother\u2019s intimidating stare. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of what bringing her into my home does and does not mean. I am the Lord of New York, Vouclade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen start acting like it,\u201d he growled. \u201cIt\u2019s clear you have some sort of interest in her, and due to her extensive exposure to vampires her mind cannot be fixed without risk of major damage. You\u2019re left with one option, whether you like it or not. Clean her up, explain to her how much more dangerous her situation has become, and then take her to the real Lord Nelek. If we\u2019re lucky and she passes his tests, he\u2019ll accept her as a Nelek Child or Servio.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan steadied himself as the beast in his stomach unfurled and crimson danced at the edges of his vision. While he believed Logan to be an exception to the modern human rule, that didn\u2019t mean his Father would. \u201cYou\u2019re only giving her a fifty percent chance. What if she doesn\u2019t pass his tests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she dies, Kerestyan. But the blame for her death, should it come to that, lies at both of your feet. She allowed the degradation of this city, the breakdown of society combined with the vice available on every pathetic corner, to affect her. However, you alone bear the burden of allowing ignorance to flourish among the Fledglings you allow to exist.\u201d He jammed a ghostly finger into Kerestyan\u2019s chest. \u201cYou are just as responsible for Logan\u2019s situation as she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think every Fledgling is ignorant, Vouclade,\u201d Kerestyan snapped as he knocked his brother\u2019s hand away. \u201cYou also never, in any time period, approved of this city. Your opinion is biased by old, stagnant views, which is exactly why I took a city full of Fledglings. I may be partly responsible for Logan\u2019s misfortune, but I\u2019m not going to slaughter droves of young vampires who have nothing to do with this situation, simply for existing.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade\u2019s eyes snapped with grey fire. \u201cYou are just as ignorant as your Fledglings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Mr. Mad Scientist, why don\u2019t you fuck off and leave my brother...\u201d Odin didn\u2019t have a chance to finish his sentence, mainly because Vouclade snapped out a boney hand and severed his tongue.</p> <p>Vouclade used Odin\u2019s tongue to punctuate his own words. \u201cThe next time you address me as such, you childish waste of blood, I\u2019ll remove your nervous system while you watch.\u201d He turned back to Kerestyan. \u201cI\u2019ll be advising Father of Logan\u2019s situation. If I were you, I\u2019d prepare to hear from him.\u201d Having spit his last bit of venom, Vouclade disappeared in a cold gust of wind.</p><p>Kerestyan stared down at the empty space in front of him. Sometimes the second eldest of the Nelek Children caused more trouble than he was worth. However, much to Kerestyan\u2019s dismay, there was little he could do to change the views of someone as old as Vouclade.</p><p>Forcing the thought from his mind, he pulled a towel from the rack by the sink and held it out for Odin. \u201cHow many times has he done that to you?\u201d</p><p>Odin grabbed the towel and grinned as small rivulets of blood dribbled from his lips. \u201cAouw unce ah eek or en ousan eers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout once a week for ten thousand years?\u201d When he nodded, Kerestyan shook his head. Only Odin would have such an extended learning curve. \u201cHaven\u2019t you learned your lesson yet?\u201d</p><p>He dabbed at his mouth then tipped his head back and laughed. \u201cO.\u201d</p><p>In an attempt to calm his nerves, Kerestyan seized the opportunity to laugh with his brother. But what the familiar action couldn\u2019t wash away was the realization that, as much as it burned him, Vouclade was right about some of the accusations he\u2019d made.</p><p>He felt more than just a temporary curiosity for Logan. There was something about her blatant honesty he respected, something about not being able to anticipate what she\u2019d do or say next that excited his weary blood.</p> <p>Unfortunately, neither of those qualities would assist her when it came to his Father.</p><p>Kerestyan leaned back against the counter and considered the silvered track lights cutting across the white ceiling. By now, Vouclade had returned to the castle and was no doubt ranting about the state of New York and Logan\u2019s situation. And if Vouclade was persuasive enough, which he often was, Kerestyan would be lucky if his Father didn\u2019t appear and judge Logan on the spot.</p><p>He rubbed a hand down his face. How was he going to explain to her that she had to relinquish yet another facet of her life? While he didn\u2019t approve of her drug use, he respected her choice and despised merely the thought of taking that choice away.</p><p>Then give her a choice...</p><p>He lowered his head when he felt a heavy hand squeeze his shoulder, only to find Odin\u2019s smiling black eyes staring back at him. \u201cOnt wuhwee, bo. Sill be awite.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan did his best to return the reassuring gesture. For once, he just hoped his brother was right.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Logan slipped through her cracked bedroom door and crept down the hall towards the kitchen. She had no idea what was so damn funny that she could hear the chorus of hearty laughter through the walls, but she had every intention of finding out.</p><p>When she reached the end of the hallway, she flattened herself against the wall and peeked around the corner. Odin, with a rag stuffed in his mouth, made all manner of odd noises while Kerestyan, eyes twinkling under the gentle track lighting, twisted a black wine bottle setting in one of the odd appliances she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Reminiscent of a fancy silver bowl, instead of tapering near the bottom the machine belled out into black rubber feet. The digital panel centered on the front read 88.2, but the glowing red numbers quickly changed. When the contraption emitted a loud beep as the number reached 99.0, Kerestyan pulled the bottle out, popped the cork then handed it to Odin.</p><p>\u201cWarmed to your distinguished preference, Sir,\u201d Kerestyan laughed, with a bad English accent.</p><p>Odin pulled the towel from his mouth, grabbed the bottle and wrapped his lips around it like a hooker who\u2019d just been paid five thousand dollars to suck off a professional athlete.</p><p>Logan mulled the scene over for a minute. This was what they were doing? She\u2019d been herded back to her room for a time-out so they could laugh like idiots and drink themselves into a wine induced stupor?</p><p>At least it\u2019s not whiskey. She shivered as an icy chill slipped down her spine in response to the errant thought. At thirteen, she may not have known how to properly express how she felt to her father. Now thirty, her prowess for self expression was quite the opposite.</p><p>She pushed around the corner and locked eyes with Kerestyan. \u201cThis is why you sent me to my room? So you and your brother could get wasted in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Every ounce of humor drained from his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like, Logan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Odin\u2019s lips popped off the bottle. \u201cOp. Ot wuh eh ooks ike ah aww.\u201d He closed his eyes for a second, smacked his lips together then stuck his tongue out to a dull point and wiggled it. Eyes wide, his head bobbed from side to side then back before he righted it and smiled. \u201cAhh, much better.\u201d</p><p>Logan stood still for a moment while her brain tried to reconcile his idiotic movements. \u201cWhat in the hell was that? How much of that stuff have you had?\u201d</p><p>He set the bottle on the counter and spun it. \u201cIt only takes one. That\u2019s some good shit, Baby.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring the fact he\u2019d called her something other than it or Bones, she snatched up the wobbling vintage and tipped it to her mouth. If the wine was good enough for them, it was definitely good enough for her.</p><p>Besides, maybe her father had been right. Maybe all of life\u2019s answers were at the bottom of a bottle.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she parted her lips and let the liquid surround her tongue.</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! Let her do it. It\u2019s kinda kinky.\u201d</p> <p>Logan wrinkled her nose as her taste buds caught up with her. Hot and coppery, it didn\u2019t take her long to figure out what the distinct metallic taste reminded her of...</p><p>Being punched in the nose, that\u2019s what it reminded her of.</p><p>She swallowed the thick fluid, waited a moment to make sure it would stay down, and then gently set the bottle back on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThat was fuckin\u2019 hot! Kerestyan, get out another bottle!\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and stared at Odin, whose face was lit up like a Gothic Christmas tree. \u201cYou could\u2019ve warned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss watching you do that?\u201d He wiggled a finger in front of her nose. \u201cOh, no. No way.\u201d He lowered his hand and rubbed it affectionately over his stomach. \u201cWatching humans drink blood gets my monster all excited. You want some more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour monster?\u201d She eyed his leather covered groin. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t name it.\u201d</p><p>He kicked his head back and laughed. \u201cNo. He would have a much more imposing name.\u201d He poked at his abdomen. \u201cI\u2019m talking about my beast. He drives the scary, predatory vampire side of me. You know, the animal that craves blood and power and ultimate control. But he\u2019s also really old and kinda jaded, and loves watching humans do things they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He pushed the bottle closer. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want more?\u201d</p><p>When her mouth took on the texture of sandpaper, Logan licked her lips. It didn\u2019t taste horrible, and she had to admit it even had a sweet yet slightly tangy quality, but there was something about swallowing a mouthful of blood that made her feel a little queasy.</p><p>She pushed the bottle back towards him. \u201cNo thanks. I think one shot is enough for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Admit it. It wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I tasted worse? Yes, a lot of rotten things taste a whole hell of a lot worse than that. But, there\u2019s just something wrong about standing in such a normal looking kitchen, drinking blood with two vampires.\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed a hand across her cheek. Of course, there was something fundamentally wrong with standing in a kitchen with two vampires to begin with.</p><p>She studied the dark blue floor tiles as a shiver worked its way down the back of her neck. There was also something seriously wrong when one of those vampires made her more aware of her body than she\u2019d been in a long time.</p> <p>When she heard Odin laugh again, she looked up just in time to see him wave a hand in front of Kerestyan\u2019s face. \u201cKerestyan, you still alive over there man?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at Kerestyan and frowned. His irises were an odd mixture of sapphire and onyx, lit from behind a sheet of glass. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d She stepped closer to him. \u201cYour eyes are almost as dark as Odin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d It was the way his lips parted when he formed the \u201cf\u201d that allowed her to see a quick flash of his fangs.</p><p>She stared at his mouth for a minute, trying to recall the moment he\u2019d gotten so close to her in the alley. Were they out then? Had they always been there?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>A low, evil chuckle rumbled in Odin\u2019s throat, drawing her attention away from Kerestyan\u2019s dental irregularity. He grinned wide, no fangs present. \u201cWell, this is a good time for me to leave. Bones, your clothes are in the duffle bag out in the living room.\u201d He smacked the back of Kerestyan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLittle brother, behave yourself.\u201d Then, just like he did before, he vanished from the room.</p><p>Logan blinked a few times then turned to Kerestyan. \u201cDo vampires even need cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on their age.\u201d There they were again, flashing between his soft lips like razor blades under a strobe light.</p><p>Most intriguing. She allowed curiosity to get the better of her and moved even closer. \u201cDo they have holes in the bottoms?\u201d</p><p>He snatched the bottle from the counter then turned his back to her and tucked it into a cabinet under the sink. \u201cDo what have holes in the bottom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fangs, Lord Vampire. Do you suck blood through them like a straw? How does it work?\u201d</p><p>He braced his hands against the edge of the sink, his shoulder blades bunching together in a tantalizing ripple of muscle. \u201cNo, my fangs don\u2019t have holes in the bottoms.\u201d</p><p>Logan kicked her foot back and dragged out one of the stools surrounding the center island. She sat down and leaned forward, resting her hands on the leather seat between her legs. \u201cThen how does it work?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled a loud, obviously irritated breath. \u201cAfter I bite my prey, I slide my fangs from the wound and drink until sated. When finished, I either lick or touch the wound to heal it. The human goes on their way and I go on mine. The end.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched up her face. \u201cThat\u2019s all? You make it sound so...so impersonal. I thought eating for vampires was supposed to be all sexy and seductive.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders tensed again. \u201cDo you strive to form an emotional connection with every cow you consume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a cheap excuse. I can\u2019t talk to a cow.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWell, I thought I could once. The cow ended up being part of a billboard and it only talked to me because of a bad batch of mushrooms.\u201d When he didn\u2019t appear to find her comment nearly as funny as she did, she moved on. \u201cSo how do you get a human to let you bite them? Do they know you do it? Do you go out on a date, or do you just grab one and chow down?\u201d</p><p>He spun around to face her, his dark eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you want me to tell you, Logan? That I dress up in tight leather pants and prowl the clubs for a beautiful woman? That when I find one, I stalk her from the shadows until the power of my Ancient blood draws her to me? That once it does, because it always does, I take her home and fuck her until she comes so hard she can barely breathe? And in the second before she does, I sink my fangs into her fragile neck? That when her body shudders and she\u2019s lost in the best sensations she\u2019ll ever feel, I taste every single ripple of pleasure coursing through her blood? That I get off on the rich taste of her just as hard as she gets off on me? Is that what you want me to tell you?\u201d</p><p>Logan opened her mouth then closed it; her mind clouded with images of black leather, sweat slicked bodies and tangled satin sheets. Her ears still rang from the way he\u2019d said the first real curse word she\u2019d heard him use, and the deep inflection he put on it. She\u2019d never heard it sound so enticing, so damn inviting.</p><p>Water. She needed lots of cold, so cold it\u2019d turn your insides to ice, kind of water.</p><p>She watched the corners of Kerestyan\u2019s lips rise ever so slightly as his eyes moved over her neck, then down and across her borrowed shirt. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s exactly what you wanted me to tell you.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. So what if her nipples felt like they were going to jump off her chest and slingshot themselves at him? And really, whose fault was it that she\u2019d just added a brand new scent to his pajama pants since she hadn\u2019t had any clean underwear to put on after her bath?</p><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t hers.</p><p>She might have been detached from the world, but she was still a flesh and blood woman, and her brain was still very much attached to every nerve in her body.</p><p>She swallowed the large knot in her throat. \u201cI...well,\u201d she paused when he smiled and glared back at him. \u201cYou said all that on purpose! You\u2019re a bastard. That little rant was unbelievably unnecessary and completely uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>In the space of a single heartbeat, his smile turned dangerous at the edges. \u201cSo was your licking your lips after setting the bottle of blood back on the counter.\u201d He moved towards her, the powerful muscles of his thighs flexing underneath the dark material of his pants. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get it all, you know.\u201d</p><p>Logan raised a hand to wipe her mouth, but jumped when Kerestyan caught her wrist before she could follow through. She stared up into his marbled eyes as he nudged her thighs apart with his own. Her heart slammed against her ribs.</p><p>Oh no, he isn\u2019t. He is...</p><p>He leaned down, lips hovering barely above hers. \u201cWhich part was it, Logan?\u201d The heat from his breath and the moisture on his bottom lip caught and tugged at hers. \u201cWas it the biting that stirred you...or the fucking?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She silently cursed her dependence on oxygen when her lips parted to allow the sharp inhale of air she was sure she\u2019d die without. Her thighs trembled as the strong fingers of his free hand circled the wrist still folded over her chest.</p><p>Good Lord, how was she supposed to breathe with him so close?</p><p>She gasped, her thoughts scattering in a thousand different directions when he pushed her arms behind her, forcing her spine into an arch. Her nipples tightened even more, caught between the soft fabric of her shirt and his hard chest.</p> <p>Flames raced across her skin as he pinned her wrists to the small of her back, then tautly sucked on her upper lip. She swallowed a moan as his warm tongue caressed the sensitive flesh inside. He took his time, teasing her with a half kiss that made her legs shake.</p><p>If this was what he did to the women he ate, she was sure he\u2019d never go hungry.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he went quiet and pinched her bottom lip between his teeth, \u201cit was the fucking.\u201d A deep growl rumbled in his chest when her legs jumped in response to the mind blowing sensation. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s a definite interest in the biting.\u201d</p><p>A traitorous moan, loud and throaty, escaped as he dragged his fangs across her lower lip. Tiny, passion fueled fires erupted inside each cell in her body as those razor sharp tips touched her skin. Her heart pounded a frantic rhythm in her ears. Wetness built in record time between her thighs. She couldn\u2019t stop her eyes from fluttering closed as waves of warmth coursed through her. It was the most pleasurable sensation she\u2019d ever felt. The most erotic moment she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>But the most delicious taste came when his tongue plunged into her mouth, sliding sinuously over hers. He tasted exactly like he smelled. Tangy but sweet. Smoky and earthy. Sexy. The way a man should taste, but more savage somehow.</p> <p>Lost in the tantalizing friction of Kerestyan\u2019s tongue tangling with hers, Logan didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released her wrists until his warm hands pushed between the stool and her bare ass.</p><p>Trying to figure out the exact moment he\u2019d managed to loosen the drawstring became a distant memory as he pulled her forward off the stool. She vaguely felt the satin pool around her knees. The thrust of his tongue, the maddening back and forth motion was all she could focus on as he lifted her up and the pants fell to the floor.</p><p>Wrapping both legs around his hips, she broke from his hungry mouth to moan as he pressed her back against the refrigerator. The cold steel of the doors bit into her skin at the same moment he ground the fabric covered ridge of his hard cock against her.</p><p>Needing to get to his skin, to feel the heat of him against her, she ripped open his shirt, undaunted as the black buttons turned into tiny missiles. He laughed a husky sound as some hit the floor while others pinged off of various appliances.</p><p>She smiled at the sight of his bare chest. Dark hairs dappled his tight, pale skin, tapering to a single line that plunged between a set of rock hard abs, rippling for her viewing pleasure.</p><p>No, he would never go hungry. Not in a million years.</p> <p>His large hands blocked her view a second before he grabbed the hem of her t-shirt, and in one swift motion, tore it right up the front. She gasped as his rough fingers went to work torturing her exposed nipples. Rolling and gently pinching, filling her with a maddening ache she hadn\u2019t felt in a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cIt was only fair,\u201d he laughed as he nipped at her lips.</p><p>She smiled back at him. \u201cIt was your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Clinging to his muscular biceps, she shivered as his thumbs drew slow circles around each erect nipple before he ducked his head and pulled one into his mouth. Hot and wet, his tongue retraced the same path his fingers had blazed. She tipped her head back, giving in to the exquisite tension building inside her as he fanged one taut peak to a nearly painful state, then the other.</p><p>The man definitely knew what he was doing.</p><p>As he trailed a searing line of kisses up to her neck, she slid her hands down his chest, delighting in every dip and curve of lean, sculpted muscle on the way down to the deep grooves between his abs. He had a body to die for, nothing but firm skin and hard lines.</p><p>Logan shivered as Kerestyan\u2019s fangs scraped her throat. Her entire body was on fire, burning hotter everywhere his mouth touched her. His deep moan vibrated against her throat, urging her on as she found the lone button nestled between them.</p><p>After undoing his pants, she wrapped her fingers around the thick base of his cock and smiled. Unless he\u2019d changed his clothes while she slept, he\u2019d been commando since the moment she met him. She stroked the hard, throbbing length of him before he claimed her mouth again. Hot tendrils of excitement wound down her spine. Tightening her grip, she savored the animalistic growl that rumbled its way through his chest, straight into hers.</p> <p>\u201cI want you, Logan,\u201d he breathed against her mouth. He pinned her with those sultry black eyes as his thumbs resumed their assault on her nipples. \u201cI want to taste you.\u201d She moaned as he bit at her lips. \u201cFuck you...feel you come.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. There was that word again, rolling off his talented tongue in a way that made every muscle in her body quiver with excitement.</p><p>Who\u2019d have thought Mr. Prim and Proper would be such a dirty talker?</p><p>She tipped her head to the side as he nibbled his way down to where her neck and shoulder met. \u201cI want you, too. Right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>She stroked him again then rubbed the head of his cock against her swollen clit, reveling in the way he jerked and throbbed from the slick contact, loving how her body pulsed and contracted, silently begging for more.</p><p>She wanted to feel him hard inside her, wanted to writhe against his muscled body and drown in every drop of pleasure they could give each other. She wanted to scream until her voice gave out. Hear him moan as he slammed into her over and over again, until neither of them could move.</p><p>\u201cKerestyan Nelek!\u201d</p><p>Both Logan and Kerestyan froze as an angry voice thundered through the room, rattling everything that wasn\u2019t bolted down.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you treat guests in your home?\u201d</p><p>Logan gave an awkward smile when Kerestyan\u2019s forehead smacked against her shoulder, unblocking her view of the pissed off psychologist standing a good ten feet behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly want, Vouclade?\u201d Kerestyan\u2019s warm breath tickled her breast, but she didn\u2019t dare smile.</p><p>Vouclade held up a syringe filled with a bright orange liquid. \u201cI returned to offer you medication that would assist Logan through the coming days. However, considering your current state of affairs, you must not think her situation is very serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not what I think.\u201d He ended the sentence with a scowl, and she knew because she could feel his lips burning against her skin.</p><p>Vouclade\u2019s eyes narrowed on Kerestyan\u2019s back. \u201cHave the correct conversation with her immediately, Kerestyan, lest I have it for you.\u201d</p><p>Logan shivered as an icy blast of wind tore through the room and yet another vampire somehow related to Kerestyan disappeared into thin air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Logan. If I\u2019d anticipated any kind of interruption, I would have stayed on my side of the kitchen.\u201d There was a tinge of humor in his quiet voice, but he didn\u2019t sound the least bit happy.</p><p>She carefully removed her fingers from around his penis. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She blew out a disgruntled, unfulfilled breath. \u201cBut I suppose you should put me down and tell me whatever it is that pissed him off so bad. Why do I need medicine to help me through the next few days?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he brushed a light kiss across her lips then turned and set her on the stool she\u2019d originally started out on. While a foreign part of her appreciated the soft gesture, the more dominant part of her didn\u2019t like it at all.</p><p>It was too gentle, too personal.</p><p>Sex was sex, hot sex was even better, but the intimacy that single kiss created around them wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>At least, she didn\u2019t think it was.</p><p>When Kerestyan zipped and buttoned his pants then plucked hers from the floor and held them out towards her, Logan slid them back on and tied her shirt closed before settling back on the stool.</p><p>Was her body pleased with the decision? Oh, hell no. But something about the concern etched into the fine lines around his eyes told her she was missing a vital piece of information.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Kerestyan?\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his slightly tussled hair, fangs no longer showing. \u201cYour days of captivity are soon to be over.\u201d</p><p>She sat up a little straighter. \u201cReally? You\u2019re letting me go?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his jaw worked hard. \u201cNo. Your fate is no longer mine to judge. My Father, the man who made me a vampire, will now be doing the honors.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head to the side as mild disappointment, which she refused to acknowledge, settled in her stomach. She wasn\u2019t sure if his father judging her was a bad thing or not, but now it was his strained voice that concerned her. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect it to go well?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d met him, he lowered his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know...but your body has to be free of heroin before I can take you to him. He does not, in any way, approve of self destruction. And that\u2019s exactly how he\u2019ll view your habitual drug use. If I take you to him as you are now, he\u2019ll destroy you and punish me for offending him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Panic tightened every muscle in Logan\u2019s already trembling body. She braced her hands between her legs and gripped the edge of the stool. All she could feel was the fear churning her stomach, the acid burning the back of her throat.</p><p>She\u2019d been through withdrawal once before; and there wasn\u2019t a single moment while in its throes she didn\u2019t believe or feel as though she\u2019d die at any moment.</p><p>The thought of going through it again scared her more than any vampire ever could.</p> <p>She looked up at Kerestyan. \u201cI can\u2019t do it again. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>His face hardened, his eyes almost demanding. \u201cYou\u2019ll die for certain if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She jumped off the stool as rage exploded in her stomach, its fiery shards tearing apart her insides. \u201cWho the hell is your father to decide what I have to do to keep breathing? What the hell makes him so important? What is it with you vampires acting like you\u2019re the only ones with say over my life?\u201d She struggled to suck oxygen into her lungs as the white walls drew closer. \u201cI won\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, I don\u2019t think you understand the gravity of your situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy situation? My situation!\u201d She smacked a hand down on the countertop. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you explain my situation to me? I\u2019m only here because of you.\u201d She jabbed a finger at him. \u201cYou put me in this fucking situation.\u201d</p> <p>Something strange flashed behind his eyes. \u201cI may have helped put you in this situation,\u201d his fangs elongated as he slammed a fist against his chest, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have any more choice in this than you do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that? You\u2019re the Lord of New York, and you don\u2019t have a choice? You killed three vampires without even touching them and you don\u2019t have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I won\u2019t even spin your feeble human mind with how old my Father is. But I\u2019m still a Child in his eyes. I have no choice but to obey him. He created me. The cost of his blood, which I accepted the day he turned me, was to abide by his rules. The only way you\u2019ll live is if I do that very thing.\u201d</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t making any sense. \u201cWhat the hell do his rules have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>He gnashed his teeth together, as if he couldn\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cHis rules dictate I obey the laws the Eldest of my species have set forth. The most important being the Veil. We hide from the humans, Logan. There\u2019s a reason why you\u2019ve lived the majority of your life unaware of vampires. A reason why the human population as a whole doesn\u2019t know we exist.\u201d</p><p>Is that all? She shrugged. \u201cSo what if I know? What the hell do you think I\u2019m going to do, run off and tell everyone? For your information, aside from going to the cops the first time, who literally threw me out of the station \u2013 I\u2019ve never told anyone about anything I saw. Not that they\u2019d believe me if I did.\u201d She closed her eyes as a dull ache pulsed beneath her temples. \u201cYou know what, as much as I don\u2019t like the thought of you poking around my brain, maybe you should just try to make me forget all this. Then we can both go on with our lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple anymore. You know too much about vampires. Manipulating the human mind to forget even a brief encounter with a vampire takes a great deal of precision. To remove and reconstruct what you know, especially now, could very well damage your brain in an irreparable fashion. Your only options at this point are to become a vampire, or a Servio, which is a servant to a vampire. Either way, that involves Nelek blood, which I can\u2019t offer you without my Father\u2019s approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d She opened her eyes and stared hard at him. \u201cWhat do you mean my only options are to become a vampire or a servant? That\u2019s what you meant by exploring other avenues? What if I don\u2019t want to? What if I want my life back?\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her, his pale face a mask of disbelief and anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about what you want. The life you knew ended when I found you in the alley. And to be bluntly honest, it should have ended the moment you learned about vampires. You don\u2019t have any control over what you become, only whether you do. Your life has changed, forever. You need to accept that.\u201d</p><p>Logan stiffened. She\u2019d never felt so frustrated or angry in her entire life. How could he stand there and tell her she didn\u2019t have any control over her own life? How could he expect she\u2019d just accept it?</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He moved to stand in front of her then leaned down so they were eye level. \u201cListen to me,\u201d his breath was cool against her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a breach of the Veil. Vampires, regardless of age, do not openly act in any way that allows humans to learn of our existence. You should have never seen a vampire feed. You should have never witnessed vampires fighting. I killed the three Fledglings in the alley because they broke the Veil. They wore their fangs openly, and you saw them. Not only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the stupid Veil already! I get it.\u201d She pressed the heels of her palms to her temples. \u201cJesus Christ, if seeing vampires was so damn bad, where the hell were you all the other times I saw them chewing on people?\u201d</p><p>When he let out an animalistic snarl, she took a few steps back. \u201cThere are almost a hundred vampires in the city of New York. Could you watch a hundred humans scattered across the city at the same time? Could you make sure every single one of them never ate without your permission? Never did what was in their nature to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe question was meant to be rhetorical, but since it seems to have pissed you off so much, no, I probably couldn\u2019t.\u201d She rested her hands on her hips. \u201cBut I also can\u2019t disappear in a burst of wind or mess with people\u2019s minds. I\u2019m sure if I could, I\u2019d be more than capable of watching a hundred people.\u201d</p><p>His sinister rumble of laughter sent chills down her spine. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as easy as it sounds. The more a vampire uses his or her powers, the more blood they require. The more blood they require, the more they need to feed. The more they feed, the more they risk breaking the Veil. To use the power my blood grants as often as you suggest, I\u2019d be forced to drain five humans a day. Should I wish to spare their lives, I\u2019d have to spend my entire night searching for twenty different vessels. At that rate, I\u2019d never be able to rule a city.\u201d His gaze fell to her lips then lingered on her neck. \u201cAs you so invitingly put it, I\u2019d be too busy chewing on people.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the knot tightening in her throat as he extended to his full height and slowly stalked towards her. His ruined shirt hung open, allowing her to see every ripple of his hard, sculpted abdomen as he drew closer. He looked every bit the dark, deadly predator vampires were rumored to be as he ran his tongue over his fangs.</p><p>And something deep inside her was thrilled by the sight of him...</p><p>No. Don\u2019t look. Logan squeezed her eyes tight. She knew what he was trying to do, and she refused to back up and lose any more ground to him. She shivered when his hot breath touched her ear at the same time the heat from his body invaded her skin.</p><p>Why he was warm one time and cold the next, she didn\u2019t know, but right now it felt like every inch of his hard body was on fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to explain this to you once, so I suggest you listen carefully. I may be powerful, but even I can\u2019t be everywhere at once. Contrary to what you might think, I\u2019m more than capable of guarding against accidents and have been since the night I took this city as my own. But what I can\u2019t control, is someone like you. Someone who\u2019s so detached you wear it in your eyes. You\u2019re not in this situation solely because of me. You\u2019re here right now because the Fledglings in the alley thought you were already a Servio. Why do you think they asked whose Puppet you were? \u2018Puppet\u2019 is the youth\u2019s slang term for a servant.\u201d</p><p>Logan opened her eyes and stepped back. \u201cSo now you think part of this is my fault?\u201d</p><p>An eerie, almost superior smile spanned his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think, Logan. I know.\u201d</p><p>She purposely fisted her hands as the urge to smack the fangs out of his mouth welled up inside her. \u201cHow the hell do you figure?\u201d</p><p>He folded his thick arms over his chest. \u201cOf all the times you stumbled upon a vampire feeding, how many times did you intercede on the human\u2019s behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Why would I?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged a shoulder. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cBecause if some hooker is stupid enough to follow a John down a dark alley for fifty bucks and gets her ass drained dry, she chose to go with him. If a bum gets so drunk he falls down and can\u2019t defend himself, he made the choice. Nobody put a gun to their heads. Everyone else in the world has to face the consequences of their actions. Why should they be any different?\u201d</p><p>He took a few steps back and held his muscular arms out to his sides. \u201cBehold the consequence of your selfish choices. You\u2019re here because of your actions. The same actions, whatever they may be, that burned the distance into your eyes. And now you\u2019re faced with a final choice.\u201d He shifted his gaze to his left palm. \u201cHeroin,\u201d then cast a glance at his right, \u201cor life.\u201d He lowered his arms as the concern from before crept back into his eyes. \u201cI could decide for you. I could manipulate your mind and make you believe the choice to give up heroin is your own, but I meant it when I said I\u2019d give you all the choices I could.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned and studied the machine the bottle of blood had set in. Maybe her selfish choices had led her to this point. But considering that if she wasn\u2019t more concerned about herself than the people around her, she didn\u2019t eat, she felt no compunction to apologize.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sorry for who she\u2019d become, and aside from one action she\u2019d committed at the age of thirteen, she wouldn\u2019t change anything about her life. It was her life, and up until she\u2019d met him, she\u2019d lived it on her own terms. She\u2019d never claimed to be a Saint, never even claimed to be an upright citizen.</p><p>And she never would.</p> <p>Focusing back on Kerestyan, Logan plastered a smile on her face. \u201cSo, let me make sure I understand this right. I have to go through withdrawal so you can take me to your father, who\u2019s going to decide whether I live or die. But even if I do get clean so I can meet him, he might kill me anyway?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, apparently not a fan of her special blend of sarcasm. \u201cHe decides who\u2019s worthy of his blood. Even if it\u2019s the blood in my veins that grants you immortality, it still bears his power, his name. I don\u2019t expect you to understand, but the Nelek name means something to those who matter in the vampiric world. Should you choose to give up your beloved chemicals, you\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he, a vampire cop? Is he some long-lived upstanding member of the D.A.R.E. program?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI just can\u2019t wait to meet him. He sounds like a real straight-laced kind of guy. Tell me, does he have a halo?\u201d</p><p>Something strange charged the air as the darkness nearly eclipsed his eyes. \u201cOur blood is the seat of our power. Would you just hand your most prized possession to a junkie, Logan?\u201d When she didn\u2019t answer right away, he lunged forward and caught her wrist before she had a chance to react. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>She winced as pain rattled down her arm. The answer was glaringly obvious, but something told her he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until he heard her say it. She forced the words out between her teeth, \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He released her as if she was suddenly poisonous. \u201cThen don\u2019t make this situation any more difficult than it already is. This isn\u2019t what I wanted. But I know my Father, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before he demands I bring you to him. I have no doubt he sent Vouclade back to fully induce the withdrawal process.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared up at him, not even sure how to respond to that last comment. Would these creatures let her do anything on her own? \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help to start going through withdrawal. I went through it alone once before, I can do it again.\u201d As another wave of anger boiled up inside her, she stepped around him and headed for the hallway leading to her room.</p><p>But before she reached the archway, she turned around and glared at him again. \u201cYou, your brothers, and your precious Daddy may not think much of me, but my feeble human mind is capable of a lot more than you give me credit for.\u201d</p><p>In the space of a single breath, Kerestyan\u2019s face changed to the same cold stone she first saw in the alley. \u201cI have forty-six brothers and sisters, Logan, and not one is less than five thousand years old. It\u2019s been over six hundred years since my Father has deemed a human worthy enough to even serve a Nelek. I truly hope you are capable of more, because whether I like it or not, that one precious man holds your future in his hands.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cIs she alright?\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan nodded at his sister, Trinity, as he laid the thick cut of steak over the sizzling grill top. \u201cI believe so.\u201d He smiled when she leaned across the counter and sprinkled a pinch of pepper over the meat. \u201cShe\u2019s been sleeping soundly for a little over three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know what happened.\u201d He ground his teeth together. \u201cFrom what Alfred said, Vouclade barely stopped short of telling the entire castle what happened.\u201d</p><p>Trinity rolled her sable eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about your romp against the refrigerator, which you get serious sexy points for, by the way. I\u2019m more interested in what happened after you told her about meeting Dad.\u201d</p><p>He slowly shook his head. Only Trinity would assign something as crass as \u201csexy points\u201d to an adult rendezvous. However, considering she became a Nelek due to her prosperity engaging in the oldest profession known to man, he wasn\u2019t overly surprised.</p><p>He reached out and removed the pepper shaker she was tapping against the counter before refocusing on her question. \u201cI tried to explain the reasons she should give up her habit, but the discussion turned into an argument and she became unstable,\u201d one corner of his mouth rose of its own accord, \u201cmuch like a pit viper.\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s ruby lips curved in a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s not exactly one of the chemicals in Vouclade\u2019s lab, K. Give your little viper a break. She\u2019s still human, and she\u2019s probably scared shitless right now.\u201d She plucked a green apple from the bowl sitting a few inches away and waved it under her nose. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how you felt when Dad took you?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan pulled a pair of silver tongs from the drawer behind him then adjusted the steak. He remembered the day his Father approached him with striking detail, but he\u2019d felt nothing bearing even the slightest resemblance to fear. \u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? I was terrified.\u201d She clucked her tongue just before she rounded the counter, stole the utensil from his hand and bumped him out of the way with an ample hip. \u201cTen thousand years old and you still don\u2019t know how to handle your meat.\u201d</p><p>He moved to take the seat Trinity had so willingly vacated, knowing she would never relinquish her new position without a fight. And truthfully, he\u2019d had enough of fighting with the women in his life for one day. \u201cI assure you, I\u2019m more than adept at handling myself. I just haven\u2019t prepared a proper meal for someone since before you were born.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her long black hair over a shoulder, disbelief clouding her already dark eyes. \u201cI\u2019m six thousand years old, K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she flipped the steak. \u201cHere\u2019s a thought,\u201d a satisfied smile spread across her mouth, \u201cstop sucking on those bottles and maybe you\u2019d have a reason to learn how to cook again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feeding preferences have nothing to do with my ability to prepare a meal.\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel and began opening and closing cabinets. \u201cSure it does. When was the last time you went out into the city and hunted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months ago. What are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpices. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>He shifted on the stool. He had no idea where the spices were, but he wasn\u2019t about to tell her that. She\u2019d never let him live it down. \u201cAlfred set up my kitchen the same as he keeps the one in the castle. Unless Odin has moved something, everything should still be in the correct place.\u201d</p><p>She surveyed the room for a moment then opened the door two down from where she\u2019d been looking. Rows of small, labeled bottles lined the shelves, along with a few that weren\u2019t marked, as well as a number of packets and glass containers.</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d She pulled one of the unmarked bottles from the shelf and sniffed it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the old herbs. I don\u2019t even have some of this stuff, and I actually use it and know where it is.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t just let it go, could you?\u201d</p><p>Trinity flashed a smile over her shoulder before she returned to rummaging through the cabinet. \u201cNot a chance. I\u2019m also not going to let go that you haven\u2019t hunted in six months. You know, most vampires our age hunt at least twice a week. That means your sucking more bottles than Necks. Necks keep you in touch with how the world is evolving. Necks help you stay connected and stop the beast from taking over.\u201d She turned around with three bottles in hand and shook them. \u201cNecks give you a reason to remember how to properly cook a gorgeous strip of New York steak!\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan arched a brow at her animated movements. \u201cI think you\u2019ve spent too much time with Odin.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but it didn\u2019t stop her from perfecting her creation. \u201cI think you should spend more time with Odin. I\u2019m not stupid. I know the only reason you have food in this place is because of him and Alfred. If it wasn\u2019t for them, we both know Logan would starve and wouldn\u2019t have so much as a tissue to wipe her ass with.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened at her insult. Granted, he might have been a little more detached from humanity than Odin, might have adjusted to the modern world at a slower pace, but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d lost sight of human needs. \u201cThat is not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Unless your digestive system magically started working again and you didn\u2019t tell anyone, you would\u2019ve never thought to buy toilet paper. And since I\u2019ve never seen you stick even a piece of gum in your mouth, I know you don\u2019t eat.\u201d When he opened his mouth to defend himself, she raised a hand. \u201cIf anything I just said wasn\u2019t true, you wouldn\u2019t have called Alfred and I wouldn\u2019t have been tapped as a steak and vodka courier.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had him there, but only because the sun was still burning in the sky, and it wasn\u2019t as though he could walk down to the butcher. \u201cThank you, once again, for bringing them. But the reason I don\u2019t eat human food is because I don\u2019t particularly relish having to regurgitate it. I find the whole process rather disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tastes the same coming up as it does going down. Well, unless you forget for a week or two. That\u2019s not pleasant, let me tell you.\u201d She pinned him with one of those feminine looks that said she was onto him. \u201cBut back to the subject you\u2019re trying to avoid, I think spending a little more time with Odin would do you some good. He adores you, K. I\u2019ve never seen him protect anyone the way he does you.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan drew in a deep breath. While he appreciated his brother\u2019s protective instinct, he also wished he\u2019d realize it wasn\u2019t necessary anymore. \u201cIs he awake yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s awake and armed again.\u201d She snickered. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t a happy camper, that\u2019s for sure. I don\u2019t know why he keeps harassing Vouclade. You\u2019d think he\u2019d get tired of losing body parts.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan often wondered the same thing. He\u2019d heard a short summation of the days\u2019 events when he\u2019d requested the steaks from Alfred, but his version of brief was simply that Odin had attacked Vouclade. No more, no less.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened today?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cBetween Vouclade and Odin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Alfred didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201d</p> <p>She flipped the steak once more and set the tongs down. \u201cI guess after Vouclade popped in here and saw your, shall we say \u2018compromising position\u2019, he stormed back into Dad\u2019s chambers in a huff. He was yelling about a breach of Nelek decorum and, well, you know how he gets. But Odin heard him, and to make a long and bloody story short, it ended up in yet another Odin versus Vouclade rumble.\u201d</p><p>He cupped a hand over his eyes. \u201cPlease tell me they weren\u2019t in Father\u2019s chamber when they started fighting.\u201d</p><p>She let out a purely wicked laugh. \u201cOf course they were. V ripped off Odin\u2019s arms. Odin kicked V across the room. Then Dad played referee and sent the bad children to their rooms. V stalked off to his lab under his own power, but Odin wasn\u2019t quite as lucky. He wasn\u2019t down long though, if it makes you feel any better.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan lowered his hand and pushed the salt shaker across the counter, listening to the dull scratching sound. \u201cIt would make me feel better if he\u2019d realize I don\u2019t need him to be my first line of defense anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld habits die hard, K.\u201d He glanced up to see her studying him, but then she turned and pulled a plate down from the cabinet. \u201cI know I\u2019ve said it a hundred times before, but you two really are night and day. Were you like this when you were kids?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve always been the more serious one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan swiveled as Logan\u2019s quiet voice touched his ears. Standing at the edge of the hallway, eyes slightly swollen, she\u2019d dressed in the jeans and long sleeved, navy blue t-shirt Odin had made for her, both of which fit perfectly.</p><p>She tipped her head back and sniffed the air. \u201cPlease tell me there\u2019s another one of those for me. I could smell it from my room and I think I left a trail of drool down the hallway.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan pushed out the stool next to him as Trinity set the plate on the counter. Hopefully Logan would accept his peace offering and the silent apology it was meant to be. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>Delight filled her eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more if you can talk Trinity into cooking them.\u201d</p><p>Trinity set a knife and fork on a napkin then slid it next the plate. She smiled at Logan, her eyes slowly tracing her long, lean frame. \u201cI\u2019m Trinity, Kerestyan\u2019s younger sister. And I\u2019m easy, all you have to do is say please.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan drew in a sharp breath when he felt Logan\u2019s warm hand slide down his arm as she sat on the stool next to him. She smoothed down a wrinkle in the black fabric covering his forearm before she stared at her hand, scrunched up her nose, then withdrew and folded her hands in her lap.</p> <p>Either she didn\u2019t approve of the shirt he\u2019d chosen to replace the one she\u2019d so eagerly ruined, or she was disgruntled by her seemingly absent gesture.</p><p>Whichever reason, she quickly recovered, her green eyes twinkling like a child with an ice cream cone as she returned Trinity\u2019s smile. \u201cDamn, I\u2019d have been willing to get down on my knees and beg if that\u2019s what it took.\u201d</p><p>After setting a glass of ice water in front of the plate, Kerestyan couldn\u2019t help but notice how intently Trinity watched as Logan cut a piece of steak and slowly placed it in her mouth. And when she moaned in obvious appreciation, it was Trinity who shivered.</p><p>Trinity leaned across the counter in front of Logan, the rounds of her breasts spilling over the top of her red lace corset. \u201cIn no way would I be opposed to you dropping to your knees in front of me, and I\u2019d most certainly be willing to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>When Logan arched a brow in mid swallow, Kerestyan felt he should be the one to offer a complete and expedient explanation. \u201cTrinity is bisexual, Logan.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of water then chuckled. \u201cYeah, Kerestyan, I kinda picked up on that when she started staring at my tits the second I stepped into the room.\u201d She grinned as she sliced the rest of the steak into small cubes. \u201cAnd had she not already told me all it takes is please, I might have let her touch one as payment for a baked potato with butter and sour cream.\u201d</p><p>Both Kerestyan and Trinity laughed, but it was Trinity who recovered first. She picked up the apple she\u2019d been sniffing earlier and twisted off the stem. \u201cMy orientation doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>Logan simply shrugged. \u201cNo. I guess I assumed all vampires were bisexual in one way or another.\u201d</p><p>By the way Trinity\u2019s head kicked back, it was obvious she found a great deal of amusement in Logan\u2019s comment. She pointed at him then smacked a hand against the counter. \u201cWhat did you and your brother do to make her think you\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan prepared to respond, but paused when Logan\u2019s fork clanked against her plate and she glared hard at Trinity. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything to make me think that. It only makes sense that a smart vampire wouldn\u2019t care if their blood came from a man or a woman.\u201d She pointed at the apple in Trinity\u2019s hand. \u201cIf the only thing I can eat is apples, and though I might prefer red, all I can find in the store is green \u2013 I \u2019m going to eat the green apple. It\u2019s still an apple.\u201d</p><p>A strange and unexpected sensation of warmth rippled through Kerestyan\u2019s blood. Had Logan just defended him? Unfortunately, his feeling chilled as Trinity\u2019s smile, once derived from simple appreciation of Logan\u2019s human form, faded into something easily two hundred times more dangerous...</p><p>Her exotic eyes glowed with a very dark and very ancient admiration. \u201cYou are definitely one of a kind, Logan. Very, very few humans would see it that way. Most young vampires don\u2019t even see it that way.\u201d</p><p>Logan retrieved her fork and stabbed at another piece of meat. \u201cYeah, well, the longer I\u2019m here the more I hear how inhuman I am.\u201d She smiled in a rather mischievous way and cast him a sideways glance. \u201cHowever, I suppose it\u2019s better than being morally bankrupt.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at her. \u201cI told you, I am not morally bankrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, and I\u2019ll happily admit it to anyone,\u201d Trinity announced. She tilted her head to the side and peered up at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I was born with morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Logan said, motioning to his sister. \u201cAt least she admits it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cTrinity Nelek is hardly a model vampire, unless of course the supermodel is on his or her back, blissfully screaming her name.\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s full lips thinned into a smile. \u201cVery nice, K, your brother would be so very proud of you for that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have much room to talk, Lord Vampire,\u201d Logan teased. You had me half naked and pinned against an appliance, and you don\u2019t even know my last name.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan inhaled a deep, calming breath. If unnecessarily loud and extended laughter could kill a vampire, Trinity would\u2019ve been dead where she stood. But when she stopped abruptly and straightened, her face a mask of concentration, the calm he\u2019d been searching for slipped away. Trinity was speaking with someone telepathically, he could sense it, but only one person made her straighten like that.</p><p>Trinity chewed at her bottom lip. \u201cDid you want another steak, Logan? I need to leave, but I\u2019d be happy to cook another before I go.\u201d At the same time she was speaking to Logan, Kerestyan felt an intrusion in his mind. \u201cK, that was Dad. He\u2019s demanding I return to the castle. He also told me to tell you he expects Logan at his feet in two days time.\u201d</p><p>Panic rolled through Kerestyan in an icy wave. \u201cWhat? Two days? The withdrawal process takes longer than two days! Why the hell didn\u2019t he tell me himself?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson at least a hundred times not to cram my stomach full of food, especially when I haven\u2019t had it regularly for a while. Thanks for making this one though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Do you have any other favorites? Something that makes you drool as much as steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, K. Depending on what all V told him, he\u2019s probably pissed. All I know is I wouldn\u2019t defy him. If you do, even if he thinks she\u2019s a viable candidate for becoming a Servio, or more, he\u2019ll kill her as your punishment. You know he will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill her just as easily if I take her to him with heroin pumping through her veins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not picky. I\u2019m just happy if it\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, I remember those days. And speaking of those days, could I talk to you in private for a minute, please? I\u2019d like to share something with you outside of Kerestyan\u2019s heavy, protective hand.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan sat up straight. \u201cTrinity Nelek! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give her some tips on how to work through withdrawal. Remember, I started this life as an addict. Maybe talking to someone who\u2019s been there will help her. Considering your new time table, even if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, but only because you said please. Where do you want to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me which room he put you up in?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan tried to relax. If there was a subject his sister could be considered a savant in regards to, it was addiction in all forms. \u201cThank you, Trinity. Your willingness to help her means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>When Logan stood up, Trinity offered him a quick smile then followed. He watched as they disappeared around the corner, wondering exactly what she might say. Would her words help, or would they only upset Logan more?</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to get squeaky clean?\u201d</p><p>Logan sat down on the edge of her bed and sighed as Trinity leaned back against the door to close it. \u201cDo I really have a choice?\u201d</p> <p>Trinity reached up to tighten the high ponytail her dark hair spilled out of. \u201cConsidering you\u2019re in Kerestyan\u2019s hands, I imagine you probably do. He\u2019s notorious for giving people he favors choices, which you should know isn\u2019t easy for him.\u201d</p><p>Logan rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like the choices he\u2019s given me are easy ones.\u201d She mimicked Kerestyan\u2019s dramatic hand gestures from earlier. \u201cDie or become a prisoner. Get clean or die. Go meet some old vampire and potentially die. Notice a theme here?\u201d</p><p>Trinity tipped her head back and laughed. \u201cAt least you have a choice. You may\u2019ve been forced into this whole situation, but if you don\u2019t want to try and make the best of it you can always choose death. You wouldn\u2019t be the first.\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned over and grabbed her pack of cigarettes from the night table. \u201cI\u2019m not going to willingly choose death, but the final say isn\u2019t mine. That\u2019s what really pisses me off. This,\u201d she pulled out a cigarette and held it up, \u201cwill most likely kill me one day. It might not, but chances are it will. Not only do I understand the risks associated with smoking, but I accept them.\u201d She popped the cigarette in her mouth, lit it, and then tossed the pack back on the table. \u201cI liken my situation with vampires to being a smoker back in the 1920\u2019s. They didn\u2019t know how bad it was for them. They just died one day because of it.\u201d She took a drag and let the smoke roll out of her mouth. \u201cI could go through all this, even with the best intentions, and end up dead anyway.\u201d</p><p>Trinity arched one of her perfectly shaped brows. \u201cSo just accept it. If you can accept and engage in a habit that can potentially kill you, accept the fact you\u2019ve found yourself in a situation with the same consequences.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook her head. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t choose this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically you did.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you going to tell me it\u2019s my fault I\u2019m here, too?\u201d</p> <p>Trinity tipped her head from side to side, a smile draped across her pouty lips. \u201cYes and no. I look into your eyes and can see you\u2019re just as morally bankrupt as you claim Kerestyan to be. In both cases, it\u2019s a product of your life. You chose your life on the streets, but K didn\u2019t choose to become a vampire. None of us Nelek kids did. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important you recognize K\u2019s giving you all the choices he can. He\u2019s giving you something he never got.\u201d</p><p>She moved to sit on the bed next to Logan. \u201cReverse the situation. If your life depended on keeping a secret, and someone who wasn\u2019t supposed to know discovered your secret, to what lengths would you go to keep them quiet? Would you give them a bunch of choices, or would you just kill them and save yourself the headache? Be honest.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got a point. Logan stared down at the glowing end of her cigarette. Be honest. As much as she\u2019d like to say she\u2019d be willing to give someone choices, if her life was on the line, she\u2019d do whatever it took to save her own ass.</p><p>But in the same breath, it wasn\u2019t like she intended to run off and tell everyone vampires existed. No one would believe her anyway, and even if they did, what the hell could they do to someone like Kerestyan? He disappeared into thin air on a whim. He killed vampires without even moving. Again, she could only imagine what he would do to a human.</p><p>She relinquished her cigarette when Trinity\u2019s fingers closed around it. \u201cI\u2019d kill them and save myself the trouble. But, I\u2019m not going to tell anyone about vampires, so I don\u2019t think the comparison is equal. Your secret Veil isn\u2019t in danger with me.\u201d</p><p>Trinity took a drag then expertly blew out a series of smoke rings. \u201cIt\u2019s the principle, Logan. The only way to secure you won\u2019t tell anyone is to make you a part of it. A human who knows that vampires exist is a threat to my life. It only takes one human to make another believe, and then the snowball effect happens, especially now with TV, the internet and cell phones. How do you think the whole of humanity would react if they found out we exist? And I\u2019m not talking about the Goth kids who\u2019d think it was cool. I\u2019m talking about the ones who\u2019d feel threatened to learn they\u2019re food.\u201d</p><p>Logan took her cigarette when Trinity stood and handed it back to her. She could only imagine how freaked out the nominal population would be. She certainly didn\u2019t like the idea of being food, and chances were no one else would, either.</p><p>However, it still left her with one question.</p><p>She flicked the ashes into the small mouthwash bottle she\u2019d filled with water. \u201cWhat could humans really do to you? I\u2019ve seen vampires fight. Putting one of you against a human isn\u2019t even fair.\u201d</p><p>Trinity gave her a more serious look. \u201cImagine what would happen if even half of the human race united against a common enemy. A lot of the legends are bogus, but sunlight and decapitation can still kill me. How long do you think it\u2019d be before sleeping Fledglings get dragged out into the street at Noon? Before someone like me or Kerestyan get our head blown off in a hail of automatic gunfire? Humanity stood up for itself once before, a long time ago when there weren\u2019t all kinds of modern weapons, and it didn\u2019t end in our favor. That\u2019s how the Veil got started. Even a young vamp is powerful in comparison to a human, but now we\u2019re outnumbered 500,000 to one.\u201d</p><p>Logan inhaled another mouthful of smoke and slowly nodded. The image her mind conjured of a lone vampire standing in a sea of angry humans only drove Trinity\u2019s point home more. In the scenario she\u2019d described, the odds were decidedly in humanity\u2019s favor.</p><p>Well, if nothing else, at least she understood better why Kerestyan had been so adamant about the Veil.</p><p>She looked up at Trinity. \u201cSo what happens to me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get clean,\u201d Trinity said with a wide smile. \u201cThen K takes you to meet my Dad. If you make it through the meeting, which I honestly think you will, you\u2019ll probably end up as a Servio. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s the name for a servant to a vampire, but I don\u2019t really know what it means. Do I get a fancy tattoo or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get a tattoo,\u201d Trinity laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll go through a ritual that makes you a half-breed of sorts. You become immortal, and will stay that way unless your body gets so damaged you can\u2019t heal it. And by damaged I mean, you step out on Broadway and get your ass mowed down by a speeding bus. If someone shoots you in the arm, you\u2019ll be able to concentrate and heal the wound. You pretty much stop aging, you won\u2019t ever get sick gain, and you\u2019d have to eat fast food three times a day for a year to gain a pound. You\u2019ll also be stronger and faster than you are now, and you can go out in the sun as much as you want. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Logan groaned. She knew it sounded too good to be true. \u201cThere\u2019s always a but...\u201d</p><p>Trinity laughed again. \u201cOf course there is. Once you become a Servio, your Master is responsible for you in all ways. Whatever you do or say while you\u2019re interacting with other vampires or Servios comes back on your Master. So, for example, let\u2019s say your Master is me. If you\u2019re here in New York, Kerestyan only has one rule for his city, which is the Veil. If you break it, he doesn\u2019t punish you \u2013 he kicks my ass for not teaching you better. Then I come home and return the favor by kicking the crap out of you. And because you\u2019re a Nelek, not only will I punish you, but Stefan will, too. He doesn\u2019t suffer fools. Trust me. The last person you want to be punished by is my Dad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan cocked her head. \u201cSo, I take it Stefan is your dad?\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s lips thinned in a sheepish smile. \u201cYes. Sorry. His real name is Lord Stefan Nelek. I\u2019ve been calling him Dad for so long I forget about it sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Logan dropped her cigarette into the makeshift ashtray and listened to the hiss it made as it hit the water. The sound rather summed up how she felt at the moment. She hadn\u2019t even done anything to this Stefan vampire and he was already punishing her. \u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t return the caring sentiment. I don\u2019t exactly feel all warm and fuzzy about the vampire I have to get clean just to meet, especially since he happens to be the same one who decides if live or die.\u201d</p> <p>Trinity sighed, long and loud. \u201cI don\u2019t really expect you to. Just keep this in mind, if he was so bad do you think I\u2019d call him Dad? Or that Kerestyan would call him Father? That should really tell you all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>Logan stood and narrowed her eyes on Trinity. She\u2019d called someone dad once too, but in the end, he\u2019d been anything but. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call him. You\u2019re not in my shoes right now, and I\u2019m not in yours. After talking to you, I understand a little better why I can\u2019t go back to my old life. For you, as a vampire, it\u2019s all about your survival. I can respect that, but I don\u2019t have to like the situation your need for survival has put me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I don\u2019t expect you to like what\u2019s happening. I didn\u2019t like being plucked out of my bed one night six thousand years ago and being turned into a vampire, either. Like I said, none of us Nelek kids got a choice when it came to immortality. But each of us makes the best of it, and to this day I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>Logan straightened as Trinity stared into her eyes the way Kerestyan had when they\u2019d first met in the alley. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled in an eerie way that sent a chill straight down Logan\u2019s spine. \u201cThe key to getting through withdrawal, and I know because I\u2019ve been there, is finding the brightest part of your life and holding onto it with everything you have. No matter how much your body hurts, no matter how close you think you are to dying, keep a hold of it and don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p> <p>Logan blinked at her. She needed to stare at her to come up with that? \u201cCould you be any more ambiguous?</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, yes.\u201d She smiled again, which she seemed to do a lot, and then extended her hand, which Logan accepted. \u201cIt was nice to finally meet you. And though I don\u2019t think you need it, good luck. It\u2019ll be nice to have another girl in the family.\u201d</p><p>Logan returned the smile. \u201cThanks for the whole Servio explanation, I appreciate it.\u201d She arched a brow when Trinity released her hand then took a few steps back as a cold breeze wafted across the room. \u201cAre you going to disappear, too?\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s smile turned into a lopsided grin, very reminiscent of Odin. \u201cYes, all the Nelek kids can. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to thank Kerestyan for the steak. I did come all the way from Chicago to drop them off.\u201d She winked. \u201cOrdering dinner from seven hundred miles away just to make a girl happy...he must really like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why...\u201d</p><p>Trinity disappeared in a burst of wind.</p> <p>Bitch. Logan inhaled a deep breath and blew a sigh. It would\u2019ve been a lot easier to go back to the kitchen and face Kerestyan had Trinity kept that last sentence to herself. She liked him, she really did, and he was definitely nice to look at \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have any illusions about what was happening between them.</p><p>She shook her head as she opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Truthfully, they were both a threat to the other\u2019s survival. He lived his life by blending in with humans, and she lived hers\u2019 by staying as far away from them as possible.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Kerestyan looked up from his steaming goblet of blood as Logan walked back into the kitchen. Her green eyes appeared more distant than usual, but he hadn\u2019t heard any screaming, which meant whatever words Trinity had chosen went over far better than the previous discussion about her addiction.</p><p>He picked up the shot glass he\u2019d placed next to the bottle of Vodka she\u2019d requested and tapped it against the table. \u201cYou look like you could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>She gifted him a faint smile before she curled herself into the chair across from him. \u201cThank you for the steak.\u201d</p><p>He mirrored her gesture. \u201cTrinity told you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she twisted the cap from the bottle. \u201cYeah, she said you had it specially delivered from Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, someone once told me Chicago had the best steaks. And I said to myself, because I often talk to myself, that you should have the best steak I could procure. So I called and had them flown in.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew a bit. \u201cOh, really?\u201d She filled the shot glass to the brim. \u201cI heard you sent Trinity on a windy mission spanning 700 miles. Give or take a few.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she tipped her head back and swallowed the clear liquid, admiring the graceful, enticing column of her throat. Remembering what it felt like to run his tongue there, how much he\u2019d enjoyed pulling her body against his.</p><p>How much he enjoyed her.</p><p>\u201cTrinity gave away all my secrets, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Logan blew out a breath and scrunched up her face. \u201cShe might have spilled a few of yours, but she did a pretty good job of sticking to her own. Don\u2019t worry, she didn\u2019t tell me about the teddy bear you sleep with.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cBut I don\u2019t sleep with a teddy bear. I\u2019ve never even owned one, and I don\u2019t sleep but for a few hours once every six to seven months.\u201d</p><p>Her lips finally widened enough to show her white teeth. \u201cI was just checking.\u201d She poured herself another shot, but her perfect smile faded as she stared down at the glass, twisting it between her fingers. \u201cSo tell me about Lord Stefan Nelek. Tell me what you think I need to know to make it through this.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan took a sip of his chosen drink then set the blackened goblet back on the table. \u201cHe\u2019s very hard to explain. I\u2019ve heard him described as an angel twisted with a nightmare, as a tyrant whose mailed fist hides a velvet glove. But in the same breath, I\u2019ve watched him be called a monster, a creature, a relic who should have met the sun long, long ago. Yet I...I call him Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d she asked in a quiet voice.</p><p>He relaxed in his chair. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely difficult question to answer. Love changes when you become a vampire. It takes on a different texture, a richer but far more complicated hue and taste. I respect him. I obey him. I would follow him into battle and die to protect him and what he represents to me. If, to you, that means I love him, then I would say yes, I love my Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you fear him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe fear blooms when you either can\u2019t, or choose not to understand something. And while I may not understand each and every way his Ancient mind functions, I understand him enough to know why it is he does the things he does, and why he lives the way he chooses.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t raise her head. \u201cWhat do I have to do to stop him from killing me?\u201d Her soft voice wavered at the end of the question.</p><p>Kerestyan fisted his hands. He hated hearing the fear in her voice, hated feeling it radiate from her body, but despised the thick scent of it even more.</p><p>He closed his eyes when, for the second time in her presence, the beast inside him unfurled deep in his stomach. The first time he\u2019d felt it shift, it\u2019d done so from the pure desire ebbing in his blood. From the burning need he\u2019d felt to touch her, to taste her skin mixed with the small, crescent shaped smear of blood just above her lips.</p><p>But now it uncoiled in anger, and its focus was no other direction than inward.</p><p>Logan may have been a threat to his better sensibilities, but she was not a danger to the vampire population as a whole.</p><p>Had he left her in the alley where he\u2019d found her, she wouldn\u2019t be terrified now. Had he not allowed curiosity to cloud his judgment, she\u2019d be in whatever building she called home for the night, continuing to keep the immortal secret she\u2019d stumbled upon. She wouldn\u2019t be sitting across from him now with tears swimming in her beautiful eyes, staring through a glass setting atop a table built long before any human had thought to believe in a single entity called God.</p><p>\u201cKerestyan? If you have any advice, I\u2019d really like to hear it.\u201d The desperate note in her voice tore at his insides.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the questions he asks you as honestly as possible, Logan. No matter how much you don\u2019t think he\u2019ll like the answer, or how much you don\u2019t like your own answer. If you lie, he\u2019ll know you are before the words ever pass your lips. That\u2019s all you can do. I wish there was more, I truly do. But due to your human state, honesty is all you have to offer him.\u201d</p><p>She finished her shot and sat up straight. \u201cOkay. Then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>He studied her as she spun the cap on the bottle then unfolded her legs from underneath her; watched closely while she carefully pushed the chair in and began walking back towards the hallway to her room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning forward, Kerestyan rested his elbows on the table. \u201cLogan, can I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and slowly turned to face him. \u201cConsidering how many I\u2019ve asked you, I suppose you deserve one.\u201d The corners of her lips rose slightly, but her smile went no farther.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to make you see the world the way you do?\u201d</p> <p>Silence stung the air as she lowered her eyes to the floor. She stared down at the tiles for a few moments before she turned to give him her profile, a breathtaking masterpiece of haunted distance. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment when you realize all your worst fears have come true. When the fat girl stuffing her face in the corner finally recognizes food gives her the comfort she can\u2019t find in anyone else. When the gorgeous man with the body of a God realizes he changes women like shoes because he\u2019s scared one won\u2019t find enough reason to stay. When you see the world for what it really is, see it for all the horrors the news can\u2019t or won\u2019t report. There\u2019s a moment when you realize and accept that you are the worthless piece of shit your father always said you were, because even a diseased crack-head wouldn\u2019t kill their own sister. It was a moment, Kerestyan, a defining moment...an epiphany of imperfection.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan felt a sting in his chest as tears filled her eyes. The last thing he\u2019d meant to do was conjure a memory that hurt her. He wanted to know more, but he didn\u2019t dare ask. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if my question upset you.\u201d</p><p>She wiped a tear away as it fell on her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t know.\u201d She slowly approached the table and sat down on the edge closest to him, her eyes searching his face. \u201cDo you ever regret what you are?\u201d</p><p>He reached out and took one of her hands in his. Never once, not even by his siblings, had he ever been asked such a question. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say I do. I regret some of the terrible things I\u2019ve done in my past, but I can\u2019t remember a time when I ever felt pity for what I am.\u201d He stilled as she flipped his hand over and traced a warm finger over the faint scar marring his palm. \u201cWhen I was turned, there was no greater honor than being chosen for immortality. Giving up the sun and the fruit of the land was a small price to pay in return for what I was able to do for my family and my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour people?\u201d One corner of her mouth curved up. \u201cYou weren\u2019t named Moses in another life, were you?\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t Moses.\u201d He laced his fingers between hers and pressed a kiss to the back of her hand. \u201cI used the gifts my Father\u2019s blood granted me, my superior speed, strength and resilience, to defend my family and my lands. Back then, vampires didn\u2019t hide from humans as we do now. They knew we existed the way they knew it was morning. We, rightfully or not, were cherished. Some of us were worshiped as Gods for our abilities; others didn\u2019t want the sacrifices or glory.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cSo that\u2019s why Odin is Odin.\u201d</p><p>He studied the back of her hand, admiring the intricate framework of light blue veins beneath her soft, pale skin. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were one of the others.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as bittersweet memories flickered in his mind. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my name scrawled across the pages of history. I fought for what was right, what I believed in. I wore the armor of a knight, in a time when causes were more than empty words and broken promises.\u201d He raised his head when he felt the heat of Logan\u2019s eyes on him.</p><p>Her expression lingered between understanding and puzzlement. \u201cDo you wish you could go back? To those times?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome days I do. Some days I wish I could step into the night and smell clean, crisp air again. Feel a warm breeze on my skin from when the world was fresh and pure, before cars and pollution and smog. But there are other days, mainly during spring and summer, when I walk through this city just after sunset, while the pavement is still hot and I can feel the heat through my shoes. Those days, I marvel at all humanity has accomplished over the last few centuries. Even in its darkest hours, this world still amazes me at times.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, her green eyes shimmered with an emotion he couldn\u2019t quite place. But as quickly as it appeared, it faded. She slowly shook her head. \u201cWe definitely view the world in a different way. I\u2019m not sure I could ever step outside and feel like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she exhaled a fractured breath, \u201cI\u2019ve seen what happens when people think no one\u2019s looking. I\u2019ve seen homeless people killed for no reason. Bums lit on fire by gang members because they think it\u2019s funny.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cI watched a little girl, who couldn\u2019t have been more than six, get shot in her front yard during a drive-by at one o\u2019clock in the morning. I used to ask myself why a kid would be playing outside at that time of night, especially in Brooklyn, but there\u2019s no good answer for it. There\u2019s never a good answer. I think that\u2019s why after a while...I just stopped asking questions.\u201d She sat quiet for a moment before she slipped her hand from his and slid off the table. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she walked away and turned down the hallway to her bedroom. Only once in his life had he felt the way she\u2019d described, as if the world around him couldn\u2019t possibly become any darker, filled with any more hate.</p><p>It was the night he\u2019d stumbled off a blood soaked battlefield, clutching the mortal wound in his side, only to fall at the feet of the man he now called Father. And the first demand he\u2019d made after pulling his bloody wrist from Kerestyan\u2019s mouth, was that Kerestyan remove the armor he died in \u2013 and never put it on again.</p><p>Kerestyan pushed the memory aside as Logan walked back into the room carrying the dirty coat he\u2019d found her in. Tears shined in her eyes as she reached into the pocket then set a worn syringe and a small bag of white powder on the table in front of him.</p><p>She stared down at the table, her green eyes more distant than ever. \u201cI don\u2019t know how after all this time you can still see the world the way you do. But, if there\u2019s even a small chance that someday I could see it like you do, I don\u2019t want to pass it up.\u201d</p> <p>His chest tightened as he gazed up at her beautiful face. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your choice?\u201d</p><p>She slowly nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pretend no one\u2019s looking anymore.\u201d Without another word, no further explanation, she turned and walked back to her room.</p><p>Although his first thought was to follow, Kerestyan listened to his instincts when they whispered that Logan needed to be alone. He didn\u2019t know why, but something deep behind her eyes told him going after her right now wouldn\u2019t help her. And the last thing he wanted was to make the situation any more difficult for her than it was about to become.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Kerestyan slipped inside Logan\u2019s room then carefully closed the door behind him. It\u2019d been seven hours since her haunting admissions in the kitchen. Seven long hours that, for him, had passed at the pace of seven hundred centuries.</p><p>After allowing his eyes a moment to adjust to the dim light, he stared at the bed in the corner, conflicted by two very different but powerful emotions: desire and fear.</p><p>Even with her height, Logan seemed so tiny sprawled across the king size bed. And though it lent plenty of room for her to stretch out, in no way did she appear to be comfortable. Lying on her back, the silver satin sheets twisted around her legs while one arm rested on her abdomen, the other bent above her head. The heavy velvet comforter, kicked into a heap near her feet, had fared better than the six pillows however, only one of which remained on the bed.</p><p>The reason for the faint, salty scent of perspiration hanging in the air became clear as he moved closer. Having stripped off her jeans and t-shirt, which he assumed she\u2019d done since both were strewn across the floor near the side of the bed, small beads of sweat dappled her flushed skin. Her black hair was matted to her forehead and appeared to be just as damp as her black tank top and matching shorts.</p><p>Had it been any other situation, he\u2019d have taken more time to appreciate the scene before him, her long, slender legs, which as his eyes traced the length of them, seemed to never end. How her shorts, even though they appeared to be a few sizes too small, hugged her thin hips and offered an inviting view of her navel. The way the flimsy fabric of her top clung to her small breasts, outlining in perfect detail the hardened state of her nipples.</p><p>Kerestyan forced his eyes away from Logan\u2019s body when the icy sting of the glass in his hand reminded him why he was standing there. She needed to be kept hydrated, needed the essential fluid to endure the hell she\u2019d be subjected to in the coming hours.</p><p>What all that hell entailed, he wasn\u2019t exactly sure. Vouclade, who\u2019d found it necessary to appear once again a few hours after Logan had returned to her room, hadn\u2019t been specific. He\u2019d simply advised in his dry, scientific tone that she receive ample hydration during the torture to come, and for Kerestyan to keep his distance.</p><p>When Kerestyan had inquired as to why distance was necessary, Vouclade, in an exaggerated show of irritation, had adjusted his glasses and growled something about attachments and bonding during stressful experiences, then vanished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kerestyan allowed his eyes to return to the woman resting only a few feet away, noting the shallow and erratic rise and fall of her chest. Something told him that if she hadn\u2019t forged a bond with anyone during the stress that must have been her life thus far, it certainly wasn\u2019t going to happen now.</p><p>And it definitely wouldn\u2019t be with him.</p><p>Bothered by the thought a little more than he expected, he rested a knee on the bed and leaned forward. He gently brushed the damp shards of hair from her forehead and watched as her eyes slowly fluttered open.</p> <p>A smile touched just the corners of her mouth. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>He returned the gesture and absently tucked a shock of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019d profess you were the first to say such a thing to me, but it wouldn\u2019t be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d The words left her lips as a quiet, raspy whisper. She sounded so weak, so far removed from the woman he\u2019d met in the alley almost twenty-four hours ago.</p><p>He stiffened. Had only such small amount of time passed?</p><p>For him, it truly felt like more.</p> <p>He nudged the glass into the hand resting on her abdomen. \u201cI brought you some water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she breathed as her fingers closed around it. \u201cI heard the ice tinking against the glass when you walked in.\u201d She grimaced as she sat up and raised it to her dry lips. \u201cNot very stealthy for an old vampire, are you?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile as her eyes wandered across his bare chest then lingered on his abdomen. \u201cI assure you, when necessity dictates, not only am I able to move unseen but unheard as well.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes made a slow journey back to his. \u201cYou look good in black pajama pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look better without them.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved into a devious grin as she moved to set the empty glass on the nightstand. Unfortunately, her smile faded as she fully extended her arm and it began shaking. Lips drawn into a tight frown, she pulled back and leaned against the lone pillow. \u201cI hate this part.\u201d</p> <p>He started to request an explanation, but stopped when the tremor crept to her other arm, moving slowly until it encompassed her entire body. It wasn\u2019t long before her teeth clicked together, despite the repeated flex of her jaw muscles as she attempted to stave it off. If it weren\u2019t for the trickle of sweat sliding down her cheek, he might have believed she was cold with the way she sucked in deep breaths between her trembling lips.</p><p>She rolled onto her side and hugged her knees to her chest. \u201cI appreciate the water, but you should probably go. You don\u2019t want to see this.\u201d</p><p>He cast a glance to the door then back to her. Why he\u2019d made the movement, he wasn\u2019t sure. He had no intention of leaving her, and deep down he knew it. He couldn\u2019t leave her alone, couldn\u2019t walk away knowing with utter certainty that whether he was in the living room or his own sleeping chamber, she would be the only image in his mind.</p><p>He sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it, or you don\u2019t want me to see it?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIf you want to watch me shake like the owner of a Chinese buffet when two six hundred pound men walk through the doors, by all means, stick around.\u201d</p><p>How could he not smile at that? \u201cYou, my dear, have the most interesting sense of humor I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing.\u201d</p><p>She coughed out a laugh as the muscles in her abdomen tightened and flexed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you approve. Now, would you be so kind as to find something you can use to tie me to the bed?\u201d</p><p>The beast in his stomach shifted in excitement, but he refused it. \u201cNow is hardly the time for those kinds of activities. However, I\u2019d be more than happy to fulfill that request, and more, after you\u2019ve met my Father.\u201d</p> <p>Her face took on a deadly edge. \u201cNo, Kerestyan. I\u2019m serious. I need you to tie my hands to the bed, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, I\u2019m not going to tie you to the bed. You\u2019re in no condition to be bound.\u201d</p><p>She fisted her hands against her chest and squeezed her eyes closed. \u201cYou have to!\u201d She rolled her head from side to side, tears gathering in the corners of her eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t...I\u2019ll scratch until I bleed.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and studied her movements, trying to understand what was happening to her. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it starts to hurt,\u201d she shrieked. \u201cWhen it feels like whatever\u2019s inside me is oozing out, eating my skin. The chewing, the burning...it hurts so much...\u201d she trailed off in a painful wail.</p><p>Kerestyan lunged forward as she dragged her fingernails down her neck. He dropped a knee on either side of her midsection and seized her hands when she tried to repeat the action. Staring down at the bright scarlet trails marring her flesh, he held her wrists while she twisted and writhed beneath him. She cried out as tears spilled from her eyes, as if some invisible enemy was tearing her apart from the inside.</p><p>Chills raced the length of his spine as he listened to her scream. He wasn\u2019t prepared for this, wasn\u2019t ready to see her this way. Not knowing what else to do for her or how to help her, he summoned the one person who\u2019d always been there for him no matter the situation.</p><p>Relief snapped like a thick rubber band in his stomach when a rather perplexed looking Odin appeared next to the bed. He tightened his grip on Logan\u2019s wrists but stared at his brother. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>Odin clamped his hands over his ears. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, she\u2019s loud.\u201d He wrinkled his nose. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding her down.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his black eyes. \u201cI can see that. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what else to do!\u201d Kerestyan heard his voice fill the room, but couldn\u2019t remember a time it had ever sounded so strained, so damn desperate.</p><p>His own shock was reflected in his brother\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going through withdrawal.\u201d He ground his teeth together. \u201cVouclade told me to give her water. He never said anything about this. He never said I\u2019d have to watch her fall apart in front of me!\u201d</p><p>Odin narrowed his eyes, the concern quickly fading from his face. \u201cNeed I remind you, she did this to herself?\u201d He reached out and grabbed her arm just below Kerestyan\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you see those dark blotches?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan considered the small, dark red marks littering Logan\u2019s forearm. But when he didn\u2019t answer immediately, Odin shook her arm.</p><p>\u201cDo you see them? Those are needle tracks, Kerestyan. She asked for this. She asked for it every time she pulled out her lighter and that infamous little spoon, and then shot herself full of heroin. Don\u2019t ask me to feel sorry for her.\u201d He released her arm and stepped back. \u201cRight now, she\u2019s getting exactly what she deserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to feel sorry for her. I\u2019m asking you to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp you what? Help her?\u201d He shook his head and laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for her, aside from binding her hands and locking yourself out of the goddamn room. This is part of withdrawal. And unless Vouclade\u2019s willing to give you something to help ease her symptoms, which we both know he isn\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to accept that there is nothing, absolutely nothing you can do to help her.\u201d</p><p>When Logan stopped thrashing and went limp, the only comfort Kerestyan found was in the rhythmic pounding against the pads of his thumbs and the rapid pace of her breathing. He shifted his grip to hold her hands and locked eyes with Odin. \u201cThere has to be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d He motioned towards her. \u201cAnd when she regains consciousness, it\u2019ll start all over again and probably go on for another three days, if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d He balled his hand into a fist and growled. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? You\u2019re acting like you\u2019ve never seen this before.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan folded Logan\u2019s arms and laid them carefully across her stomach before climbing off the bed. He closed the distance to Odin in two large steps. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to stand on a sidewalk and watch it happen fifty feet away in an alley. It\u2019s one thing to stand in the hall of a keep and know it\u2019s happening in a room above you. But it\u2019s something entirely different to watch it happen in front of you, in your own home, to someone you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo someone you what, Kerestyan?\u201d Odin yelled, his lips curled into a snarl.</p><p>Kerestyan thought better of finishing his thought the way he\u2019d originally intended. \u201cTo someone you forced into the situation.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment before Odin\u2019s glare relaxed. \u201cThe only part of this situation I don\u2019t hold her responsible for is her exposure to our kind. I don\u2019t agree with Vouclade that it\u2019s her fault she learned about vampires. But I do think you\u2019ve been more than amicable to her, Kerestyan. Most Lords would\u2019ve killed her in the alley they found her in. She\u2019d have been just another homeless drug addict found dead in a pool of her own body fluids. And we both know that story wouldn\u2019t even make the local news.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kerestyan growled as his fangs slid into place. \u201cShe deserved more than that when I met her, and she deserves even more now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What the hell is so special about her? Your city\u2019s full of hundreds of humans just like her.\u201d</p><p>He cast a glance back to Logan. Nothing he said, no matter how well he wove the words would make Odin see her in the same light. \u201cThey aren\u2019t like her. I\u2019m not going to stand here and list all of her qualities to someone who doesn\u2019t care. Suffice it to say I\u2019m not the only one interested in her. Father wants her in his chamber in two days time.\u201d</p> <p>Odin\u2019s jaw went slack. \u201cOh shit. That\u2019s not good, Kerestyan. There\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019ll be done with withdrawal by then. You\u2019ll be lucky if she doesn\u2019t puke on his boots.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan frowned. He really didn\u2019t need Odin\u2019s vivid brand of imagery at the moment. \u201cI know what could happen, Odin. And you\u2019re right, I asked Vouclade for help and he refused. He made it very clear that I missed my chance for his assistance.\u201d</p><p>Odin paced back and forth for a few moments. He alternated staring at Logan and mumbling to himself between closing his eyes and concentrating. Then all at once he jumped, whirled around and grabbed Kerestyan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDo you still have all the spices and shit Alfred gave you?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. What was it with his siblings and spices today? \u201cYes. Everything Alfred gave me is exactly where he put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want any chance of helping her, come with me.\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan did as his brother asked and followed him to the kitchen. He watched as Odin picked through different unmarked bottles, opened them and sniffed, put some back in the cabinet then placed others on the counter. He did the same with the packets and canisters.</p><p>\u201cOdin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOpium has been around forever.\u201d He filled a glass with water and began dumping his chosen spices and powders into it. \u201cBack in my warring and whoring days, some of the troops used it as a pain killer. Most of the time either the effects lasted too long or the guys got addicted and couldn\u2019t function without it.\u201d He pulled out a spoon and stirred the noxious brown liquid he\u2019d concocted. \u201cObviously I couldn\u2019t take a bunch of strung out warriors into battle, so the healers used to make this elixir to help purge their bodies and negate the effects. It pretty much speeds up the withdrawal process at the cost of making it ten times worse.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan took the glass when Odin handed it to him. \u201cAre you sure this won\u2019t hurt her?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt won\u2019t do any lasting damage, but for the next 45 to 47 hours she\u2019s gonna feel like her own body is trying to crawl away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I mean is she\u2019s gonna get sick as all hell. And when I say sick, I mean put a towel on the bathroom floor and keep her close to the toilet. She\u2019ll sweat like a hooker in church until her fever spikes, so keep her full of water. If she pukes it up, make her drink more. If she starts scratching, don\u2019t let her. She won\u2019t have any concept of how hard she\u2019s pushing. She\u2019ll scratch her skin off until she\u2019s a bloody mess. And for God\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t care how much she screams and begs, do not get her more heroin, Kerestyan. If you do while that mixture\u2019s in her system, she\u2019ll die instantly. If all goes well, with a little luck and your help, she should come out of the entire withdrawal cycle about two hours before you have to take her to Dad.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stared down into the frothy substance and grimaced. \u201cHow long after she drinks this will the effects start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin five minutes, ten at the absolute most.\u201d He rested a hand on Kerestyan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know it looks bad, but believe it or not, it tastes like a really chalky protein shake.\u201d He pointed towards the hallway. \u201cThe longer you stand here and stare at it, the closer you cut it. I\u2019d suggest you get in there and get started.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan nodded then headed for Logan\u2019s room. For the first time since he\u2019d become an immortal, he didn\u2019t have the luxury of time. Before he reached the hallway, he turned around and looked at his brother. \u201cThank you, Odin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. For the record, I did this for you...not her.\u201d</p><p>With nothing else to say, Kerestyan returned to Logan\u2019s room and placed the homemade potion on the counter in the bathroom. After spreading the comforter from the bed, as well as a few pillows on the bathroom floor, he gathered Logan\u2019s unconscious body in his arms and held her close as he sat down in the middle of the makeshift bed.</p><p>Once he\u2019d situated her between his legs, with one arm wrapped around her waist to keep her upright and the back of her head resting against his shoulder, he reached up and grabbed the glass.</p><p>Again, he stared down into the thick liquid as doubts clouded his mind. What if it didn\u2019t work? What if her modern body didn\u2019t handle it the way Odin\u2019s ancient warriors had? What if Odin had let his obvious disdain for her overshadow what she needed right now? Would he do such a thing knowing their Father had personally requested her presence?</p> <p>If so, the punishment for interfering with his demand would be legendary.</p><p>Drawing in a useless deep breath, Kerestyan blew it out along with all his concerns. Right now, he had to believe Odin had done nothing but attempt to help him.</p><p>He pressed his lips to Logan\u2019s ear. \u201cLogan? Logan, you have to wake up for me. I need you to wake up.\u201d</p><p>It took a few tries, but her eyes slowly blinked open. \u201cKerestyan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we in the bathroom? Did I throw up on your bed?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t vomit on my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She tried to cover her face with her trembling hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t pee, did I?\u201d Her voice was quiet and filled with horror.</p><p>\u201cNo, Logan, you didn\u2019t relieve yourself in my bed, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019d be really embarrassing to pee in such a hot guy\u2019s bed. I know if I was a guy and some chick pissed in my bed, I\u2019d never be able to look at her without thinking, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s the bitch who pissed in my bed. She ruined my satin sheets\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Although the humor was definitely her style, and Kerestyan was more than pleased to hear she thought he was \u201chot\u201d, the way her words rolled and slurred together told him she wasn\u2019t completely aware of what she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. And in his own defense, he felt it was important to know if she\u2019d simply loosened up because of her state, or if she was delirious. \u201cLogan, did you enjoy what happened between us in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>She over exaggerated the nod and when she threw her head back, her skull cracked hard against his clavicle. \u201cOh, yeah. If your little freak of a brother hadn\u2019t shown up when he did, you\u2019d have been screaming Logan Ellis all night long. Well, maybe not all night...but a good fifteen minutes at least.\u201d She reached up and rubbed the back of her head. \u201cMy head hurts. What did you do to me? I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. Had she loosened up? Markedly so. Was she delirious? Not quite. But if nothing else, at least he now knew the last name of the woman he\u2019d more than willingly \u201cpressed against an appliance\u201d.</p><p>And when all was said and done, and she found herself safely returned to his home, he silently promised her he would finish what he\u2019d started.</p><p>\u201cCan I have some water?\u201d</p><p>He raised the glass to her lips. \u201cDrink this for me.\u201d Before he\u2019d even finished asking, she wrapped her fingers around his and began drinking in large, eager gulps.</p><p>She\u2019d nearly swallowed it all before she pushed his hand away. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d He could hear the suction between her cheeks and tongue as she opened and closed her mouth. \u201cIt tastes like... like...chocolate covered ass.\u201d She pushed back against him and flipped over in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m serious, what was it?\u201d</p><p>He set the glass back up on the counter then laid back and turned onto his side, pulling her with him. \u201cIt was a mixture of old ingredients that will help you through the withdrawal process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tasted like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He felt the heated burst of her breath against his throat as she snickered. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not...but I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment further, focused instead on the hollow echo of seconds ticking away in his mind. Silence seemed to still the air around them as he internally counted, knowing at any moment he would lose her to herbs that hadn\u2019t grown in the wild for thousands of years. Spices that now only grew in the mystical gardens nestled in the shadowed courtyards of Nelek castle.</p><p>Kerestyan closed his eyes and waited. Would it take five minutes for the elixir to begin working, or would luck gift them ten?</p><p>By two, he could feel the temperature of her skin rising.</p><p>Luck withdrew its support at three and a half as her body violently seized and convulsed in his arms. She screamed into his chest, her tears burning his skin, and then locked her arms around him with such force that if he\u2019d needed to breathe, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pressed a kiss to the top of her head and tightened his arms around her, dreading the next 48 hours. \u201cI am truly sorry, Logan. More than I\u2019ll ever find the words to say...far more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Logan did her best to remain as calm as possible while consciousness worked at a furious pace to reclaim her. First, she felt her heart pounding at a slow but steady pace, rushing heat through her chilled veins. Next, it was her body and every single muscle she owned throbbing as though she\u2019d just run a marathon, twice. Last, and certainly most disgusting, it was the hairy spider that must\u2019ve crawled into her mouth at some point and woven a sticky web around her tongue.</p><p>But in spite of all that, she had to admit if someone asked her how she felt right now, for the first time in five years she could say she felt good and mean every word of it.</p><p>There was only one possible explanation...</p><p>Withdrawal had killed her.</p><p>And that thought was only reaffirmed when she slowly opened one eye, only to be blinded by bright, white light. That single brilliant pearl of light, surrounded by a thousand shimmering halos was all she could focus on.</p><p>Obviously someone had made a big mistake.</p><p>She should\u2019ve seen flames and heard hundreds of people screaming. There should\u2019ve been little red imps with leathery bat wings dancing around with glasses of ice water and plates of triple chocolate cake.</p><p>She smiled. She should have gone down, not up.</p><p>But as her vision gradually adjusted, it was her theory that died when she realized she was staring at one of the track lights recessed into the white ceiling of the bathroom.</p><p>She closed her eyes and rolled her head to the side, letting her cheek rest against the cold tiles. She should\u2019ve known better. The only way she\u2019d get into heaven, if the place really existed, was if she won a bet against Satan himself.</p><p>All she had to do now was find the freaky bastard.</p><p>She opened her eyes, intent on getting up to find Kerestyan, but relaxed when she realized his handsome face was only inches away. His eyes were closed, and for the first time since she\u2019d met him, she could barely see the thin lines around his eyes. His lips, usually firm and drawn tight, seemed so soft and inviting now. And the dark stubble shadowing his jaw, which she was sure hadn\u2019t been there before, made him look more like a slumbering medieval warrior than the serious Lord Vampire she\u2019d come to know.</p><p>It was as she traced the length of him that she realized just how naked they both were. One of his large arms was bent, serving as a pillow under his head, the other draped over her hip, hand resting at the small of her back. While a sliver of space separated her chest from his, from the waist down there wasn\u2019t a point where their bodies didn\u2019t touch. His long legs mingled with hers, one knee nestled snugly between her thighs.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she noted their intimate position that she really felt him. Before, the contact of his warm skin hadn\u2019t registered in her mind as anything more than an extension of her own. But now she felt every centimeter of his hard body, each sculpted muscle pressed against her, every delicious inch of his bare flesh.</p><p>She trailed her eyes back to his peaceful face. Although she didn\u2019t know how or when they\u2019d ended up in such an interesting position, she vaguely recalled the feel of him behind her and the cold bite of porcelain against her cheek. She remembered the hot sting of water against her back mixed with a hazy image of his intense blue eyes as he held her in the shower, remembered his gentle hands stroking her hair while she cried against his chest.</p><p>But what she did recall, with striking clarity, was the feel of his wet hair in her hands and the strained, almost brittle sound of his voice when she\u2019d begged him to make the pain stop. \u201cI can\u2019t, Logan. But I promise I\u2019ll stay with you. I won\u2019t leave. I won\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d sounded just as scared as she felt.</p><p>Logan reached out and brushed a wisp of still damp hair from Kerestyan\u2019s shadowed cheek, wondering why he\u2019d stayed with her when he should have walked away.</p><p>When the fog of withdrawal had initially begun, she\u2019d heard Odin\u2019s angry voice somewhere in the distance. And deep inside, she agreed with every single word that echoed around her. She deserved every moment of agony, each and every shred of pain she felt. She\u2019d done it to herself, and should\u2019ve been left to endure it alone.</p><p>But the man only a handful of inches away, the moody and sometimes far too serious vampire, had promised he\u2019d stay...and here he was.</p> <p>She leaned closer and let the backs of her fingers scrape against his newly acquired stubble, wondering what it would feel like to be loved by a man like him. What it might feel like to love a man like him.</p><p>What it might feel like to love anything again...</p><p>Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have the chance to consider it for long because her thoughts scattered in a thousand different directions when Kerestyan\u2019s arm tightened around her hip and he pulled her lower body even tighter against his. Pleasure danced down her spine, lighting tiny fires under her nipples as a quiet growl vibrated in his chest and his hand slid from her lower back down to her ass.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath and tried to hold it, even though what she really wanted to do was slip her tongue into his enticing mouth. Of course, it didn\u2019t help at all that she could feel something hardening against the flat of her other hip. Granted, she knew men were capable of getting an erection while they slept, but did it hold true for vampires?</p><p>He\u2019d said he only slept for a few hours every month, but didn\u2019t say when the last time was. Was he sleeping now, or was he just pretending to be?</p><p>She stared at his face, watching for even the slightest twitch as she brushed the pad of her thumb over his nipple. She smiled when it puckered, but even more when not even the corner of his mouth rose.</p><p>Oh, the things she could do to him right now.</p><p>Squeezing her eyes closed tight, she stretched her mind, attempting to fill in the space between drinking the rotten milkshake and now. But all she could find, past what she\u2019d already recalled, were a few blurry memories of lying in Kerestyan\u2019s arms.</p><p>She had no clue how much time had passed. She didn\u2019t know what day it was, what time of day it was, or even if it was day. If it was day, would he sleep until the sun went down? If it was night, could he wake up at any moment?</p><p>In the movies vampires slept like the dead. Nothing woke them up except the sun or getting staked by a crazed hunter. However, he\u2019d already told her the movies had it all wrong. And right now, the only staking she was willing to consider ended in a screaming, panting orgasm for both of them.</p><p>Logan whimpered as her fingers, in blatant defiance of her mind, worked their way down from Kerestyan\u2019s chest, exploring the hard grooves between his abs. She grumbled when they found his navel, followed closely by the thin trail of hair leading to where their bodies touched, and to something far more exciting. Something her fingers wanted to touch again, right now.</p><p>Really, did he have to feel this damn good?</p><p>She pried her hand from his body and covered her face. She\u2019d die if she had to stay here much longer. Not able to move because of the strong grip he had on her ass. Not able to crawl away for the very same reason...and not even able to dip her head enough to suck that hard nipple into her mouth for a little taste.</p><p>As it was, every time she drew a deep breath it moved her body just enough that with the way his hand was positioned low on her left ass cheek, she had to endure the maddening sensation of his fingertips grazing her intimately.</p><p>She stifled a moan by grinding her teeth together when that damn hand, as if queued, squeezed tighter, spreading her just wide enough that she could feel his powerful thigh ripple against her clit. If it wasn\u2019t bad enough that his now rock hard cock throbbed against her hip, she had no doubts that because of one well timed grope, there was a more than ample wet spot on his thigh.</p><p>She dug her fingernails into the sexy cut of muscle just above his hip and jammed her other hand between his face and the arm he used as a pillow. Once she secured a good handful of his silky hair, she shook him. \u201cKerestyan Nelek! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><p>The bastard\u2019s soft, tantalizing lips parted in a most devious grin. \u201cWell good morning, Logan.\u201d His eyes blinked open, two dark orbs of twinkling satisfaction. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit.\u201d She pinched his side harder. \u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d</p><p>He growled, lips curled somewhere between a snarl and a smile, then rolled her flat on her back, pinning her between the cold, hard floor and his hot, hard body. She smiled as he rested his forearms on either side of her head and then shifted his hips to rub the thick head of his cock between her slick lips.</p><p>He nipped at her mouth. \u201cLong enough to enjoy feeling you get wet.\u201d</p><p>She shivered in response to the wildly erotic sensations racing under her skin. Reaching up, she buried her other hand in his hair and tugged him closer, unmoved when his canines elongated to fine, sharp points between his parted lips...but oddly taunted by the way his body tensed. \u201cTell me how long, Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re in a very compromising position and we only have an hour before your meeting with my Father.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She froze and stared up at him. Had that much time really passed? She fought to hold back the unexpected tears stinging her eyes.</p><p>Maybe it was the sudden desperation she felt tightening its icy fingers around the white hot anticipation in her stomach. Maybe it was the way fear of dying intertwined with her desire for the man poised above her.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, it was something much more complicated.</p> <p>But if she\u2019d lost two days of her life, possibly the last two days of her life, she wasn\u2019t about to give up the last hour.</p><p>Logan tightened her fingers in Kerestyan\u2019s hair and pulled him so their lips barely touched. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you kiss me like it\u2019s the last time you...\u201d Hot and demanding, his tongue pushed past her lips, branding her with a fierce possessiveness that sent passion winding around every nerve in her body.</p><p>She met each thrust and caress of his probing tongue with one of her own, wanting nothing more than to remember the taste of him, the way her body tingled and ached from the delectable sensation of his soft lips moving against hers.</p><p>It took no more than her fingernails scraping down his chiseled back to make his chest rumble. No more than the silent invitation of wrapping her legs around his waist before he drove his hips against her, stretching and filling her with his thick, hard cock, all at once.</p><p>When her back arched high, she broke away from his mouth and struggled to suck air into her lungs. Pain twisted with absolute bliss as he pulled out then slammed back into her, again and again, each thrust deeper than the one before.</p> <p>She felt him shift, gasping as more of his weight centered between her legs and his strong fingers gripped her hips. His lips burned against the sensitive skin of her neck. \u201cI love the way you feel, Logan...the way you smell.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his raspy admission. Fisting her hands in his hair, she moaned as he licked and fanged one tight nipple, then the other. No drug was better, no feeling more intense than the wicked, breath stealing friction he created inside her with every fiery scratch of his fangs, every passionate stroke of his cock.</p><p>But she wanted more, wanted every inch he had to give her, needed to feel his body tense and flex as he exploded deep inside her.</p><p>Lowering her hands to his steely biceps, she moaned and tipped her head back. \u201cDeeper. Harder. Harder. Kerestyan!\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan groaned when Logan\u2019s fingernails dug into the backs of his arms, sending lust spiking in his blood. But it was the sight of her head kicked back as she raised her hips to meet him, the sound of her screaming his name that pushed him closer to the edge of madness.</p><p>He stared down at the pale arch of her throat, eyes drawn to the hard, quickening pulse in the delicate hollow. It taunted the beast inside him, beckoned for him to taste her in a way no man ever had, urging him to take her to dizzying heights no human ever could.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t dare bite her.</p><p>No. Not now, not when he knew he\u2019d lose himself in her even more than he already had. He had to stay aware of the time, needed to keep tight reins on the animal stalking inside him.</p><p>Unfortunately, the beasts\u2019 instincts were just as powerful as his desire for the beautiful woman writhing beneath him.</p><p>Leaning forward, he dragged his fangs down that graceful column and pressed his tongue to the hollow of her throat. He growled when he felt her shudder, mesmerized by the rhythmic pounding of her heartbeat in his ears and the rich, bittersweet scent of her blood filling his lungs. Knowing he was tempting more than just fate, he pushed her knees to her chest, locked his hands around her waist then rolled onto his back, pulling her with him.</p><p>He\u2019d seen countless striking images over the course of his existence, but few stirred him the way Logan did when she sat up and spread her knees, resting her feet on the floor. Her half hooded eyes, bottomless pools of emerald fire, sparkled with a reckless, seductive power only she possessed. Her lips, moist and parted, curved with satisfaction while she held the tip of her tongue captive between her teeth.</p><p>He stilled for a moment, rapt as her hands slid down over her breasts, her dusky pink nipples teasing him as they disappeared only to peek from between her splayed fingers. Lowering her hands to rest on his, he smiled as she curled her fingers, tightening his already strong grip on her waist before she rolled her hips forward.</p><p>Kerestyan felt the animal inside roar to life when she cried his name again. Passion exploded with the force of a hurricane in his blood, surging through his veins as he watched his cock fully disappear into her tight, glistening body.</p><p>Logan tried to breathe, tried to think as Kerestyan\u2019s hands pushed her down while his hips thrust up against her. She\u2019d never felt so hot or wet in her entire life. He was so thick, so hard, and so damningly deep inside her, she was sure she would burst at any moment.</p> <p>When he sat up and bit at her lips, his eyes dark and wild, she draped her arms around his neck and rocked her hips faster against him. She needed to release the tension he built inside her, needed to take him with her. Leaning her head back, she tautly pulled her lip from between his teeth and smiled when it audibly popped.</p><p>His gorgeous face mirrored hers just before he shifted his hands, grabbed two handfuls of her ass then slowly lifted her, inch by glorious inch, all the way to the tip of his cock. She moaned between panting out short breaths as he held her there, staring up at her, his chest rumbling against her straining nipples.</p><p>She captured his lips at the same moment he slammed her down on his pulsing cock. She tightened her arms around him and screamed into his mouth as her body shuddered, bursting into an exquisite firestorm of ecstasy. Wave after orgasmic wave tore through her, stole her breath as he pushed even deeper inside her and groaned against her lips. She closed her eyes and whimpered in pure delight as he slowly rocked her hips back and forth, buried in her to the hilt, until he\u2019d wrung every ragged breath from her tired body.</p><p>Kerestyan smiled as Logan shivered one last time and a soft, satisfied moan slipped passed her sweet lips. Hugging her close, he rolled over with her and leaned back on his knees before climbing to his feet.</p><p>They were running out of time.</p><p>He did his best to endure the sensuous way her long legs wrapped around his waist as he moved towards the shower. He tried even harder not to feel her hot breath searing his neck when she rested her cheek against his shoulder.</p><p>But he quickly realized that dismissing anything about the woman was damn near impossible. She\u2019d become so much of a presence in his life in such a short amount of time, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to ignore her.</p><p>After pushing the button to turn the shower on, Kerestyan stepped inside and moved to stand under the spray with Logan still wrapped around him. He felt her body relax as the warm water pelted her back and shoulders, seemingly content to keep him inside her all night long.</p><p>He smiled. Had she woken up a night sooner, he would have gladly indulged her until her voice gave out and she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case.</p><p>He tangled his fingers into her short hair and gently raised her head, surprised at how much seeing her smiling green eyes meant to him. \u201cAs much as I despise saying this, you can\u2019t stay wrapped around me all night.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a dazzling smile before she nipped at his bottom lip. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and fanged her earlobe, savoring the way she gasped and leaned into it. \u201cNo.\u201d He traced the delicate line of her jaw with his tongue then made a slow journey back to her mouth. \u201cWe have to take a shower. We have a very important meeting to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hips between her thighs, sending a burning sliver of lust straight to his cock. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet,\u201d she flicked the tip of her pink tongue against his lips, \u201cI can coax you into another ten minutes of hot, human action, Lord Vampire.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. There was no way he could pass up the challenge flickering behind her eyes. \u201cAnd exactly what do you believe you can say to do that, Miss Ellis?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened when, instead of using words, she tipped her head to the side and sank her teeth into the sensitive flesh where his neck and shoulder met. He shivered as she rolled the skin there, not once, but twice before lifting her head.</p><p>It took his mind a second to form the words. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you bit me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile turned wicked at the edges. \u201cWell, if that didn\u2019t work, I could always do this.\u201d He growled as she wound her fingers into his hair and yanked his head back then sucked and bit her way down his bared throat.</p><p>Darkness glazed his eyes as scarlet shadows danced in his field of vision. The animal inside him unfurled, awash in a dangerous mixture of passion and rage.</p><p>This time, it was his beast that responded as he pressed her against the wall, forced her legs from his waist and pinned her arms above her head. He growled as he pumped into her hard and fast, over and over, reveling in her tight, velvety rings of muscle as they clenched and squeezed his hungry cock.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt anything better.</p><p>Staring down into her eyes, he watched with primal satisfaction as she twisted and writhed against him, breasts thrust against his chest. And when she cried out for her God as she came, he roared his climax then silenced her by drowning in the sultry taste of her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kerestyan regained control of his dark side just as his fangs scraped Logan\u2019s throat. He closed his eyes and slowly pulled back from her neck, all while sternly reminding himself that before he engaged with her again, they needed to have a very serious discussion about a vampire\u2019s beast.</p><p>He released her wrists and opened his eyes, not at all surprised by the dazed expression on her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Logan. If I\u2019d known you intended to use that method of coaxing, I would have advised otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cI take it you approve?\u201d</p><p>She smiled wide. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He carefully separated their bodies and set her on her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly take that breathless admission as a yes.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away on shaky legs and tipped her head back under the water. After pushing her wet hair out of her eyes, she arched a brow at him. \u201cDid you bite me that time?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the droplets cascading down her face, still flushed and pink from their last session, then followed as they fell from her cheeks and slid down her chest, converging between her beautiful breasts.</p> <p>He blinked and raised his eyes when he heard her repeat the question. \u201cNo, Logan.\u201d He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to her forehead, knowing it was a far safer place than her lips. \u201cWhen I bite you, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slid down his body, lingering just below his waist as he slowly backed away. \u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><p>He forced the shifting animal down when she licked her lips before meeting his eyes. \u201cIf I stay here with you, we\u2019ll never make it to the meeting on time. You have five minutes to bathe and get dressed. Meet me in the living room when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan turned and walked away after she nodded and stepped back under the spray. If he watched her naked body any longer, they might never get out of the bathroom.</p><p>He rubbed a hand down his face as he opened the door to his room and made his way over to his closet. Nervousness clawed its way up his spine as he chose his clothes and tossed them on the bed before entering his bathroom.</p><p>Surely his Father would see the raw potential in Logan and allow her to serve the Nelek family, if not become a full member of it. He couldn\u2019t resign her to death, not when Vouclade, the second eldest, had found enough reason to comment on her intellect and superior survival abilities.</p> <p>She deserved, if nothing else, a chance to prove her worth.</p><p>She\u2019ll do fine. Kerestyan nodded ascent to the voice in his mind then quickly showered, dressed in his perennial black button down shirt and black slacks, then made his way to the living room. He stepped out of the kitchen to find Logan sitting on the couch, waiting for him.</p><p>She stood up and grinned as she smoothed the arms of her tight black sweater. \u201cWhat took you so long? Did you need a little extra shower time?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI have more hair to deal with than you do.\u201d</p><p>She actually wagged her eyebrows. \u201cOnly on your head.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and curled a finger around one of her belt loops then tugged her to him. \u201cNow is hardly the time to discuss my personal grooming techniques. Besides, it became rather obvious after our kitchen rendezvous that you indeed found the razor Odin waxed so poetic about.\u201d</p><p>She responded by burying her face in his chest like an ostrich.</p><p>With precious seconds ticking away, Kerestyan wrapped his arms around Logan and concentrated on Nelek castle. It was only after he felt the cold winds begin to swirl around them that he let his thoughts return to the woman shivering in his arms.</p> <p>Under no circumstances would he stand by and allow her to be killed, even if it meant facing the very man who created him so long ago. Because not only had Logan Ellis found a way to survive when the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against her...but she was slowly filling what was once a very dark and very empty place in his Ancient heart.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now, Logan. It\u2019s over, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Logan unburied her face from Kerestyan\u2019s chest and tipped her head back, trying to focus on his wavering image instead of the furious churning of her stomach. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna puke.\u201d</p><p>His lips formed a fuzzy smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have warned you it would last substantially longer than before. It takes a little more time to get from New York to Chicago than it does to get from one side of a city to the other.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from him and swayed before she bent over, head firmly tucked between her knees. \u201cYou definitely should\u2019ve warned me.\u201d She sucked in a series of deep breaths then blew them out, uncaring that her cheeks puffed out like an angry blowfish. She groaned and clutched her cramping abdomen. \u201cOh, God, Kerestyan, you really, really should have warned me.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her back, his strong fingers tracing her spine. \u201cJust breathe and try to focus on something else for a few minutes. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the snow covered sidewalk and gulped more frigid night air. Finding something else to focus on that wouldn\u2019t make her vomit was a lot easier said than done, especially because all she could think about were the possible repercussions the impending meeting would have on her life.</p><p>If she had a life when it was over...</p><p>The thought of dying didn\u2019t make for an effective antacid.</p><p>\u201cShe is gonna puke on Dad\u2019s boots, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Logan cringed when she heard Odin\u2019s loud, almost giddy sounding voice somewhere behind her. He was the last person, mythological legend or not, she had the patience to deal with right now.</p><p>She straightened then slipped behind Kerestyan and leaned back against him. \u201cTell him I\u2019m having menstrual cramps. Tell him I\u2019m PMS-ing. Tell him I\u2019m in love with him and want to have his baby.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders tensed. \u201cWhy would I tell him any of that, most importantly the latter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of shit that makes any sane member of the male species take off running. And they don\u2019t even look back. I\u2019ve seen it, Kerestyan. They\u2019ll practically chew off their own appendages to get away from a diamond or Midol wielding woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bones, if you love me and you\u2019re bleeding...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdin,\u201d Kerestyan growled. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about finishing that sentence. Logan is not bleeding, nor does she love you. She\u2019s simply having a few minor difficulties adjusting to our method of travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Odin\u2019s black eyes peeked at her from around Kerestyan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWould a glass of water help? I can have Alfred bring one out for you.\u201d</p><p>She cast a quick glance down the desolate, tree lined street, feeling a sudden and overwhelming urge to run away as fast as her legs would carry her. \u201cWhy are you being nice to me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cConsidering you\u2019re about two hundred yards away from Satan himself, I thought it would be a polite gesture. But if you\u2019d prefer I antagonize you for what could possibly be your final moments, I\u2019d be happy to oblige. Now, do you want a glass of water or not?\u201d</p><p>Final Moments... She ignored the new flutters in her stomach. If he was trying, as strange as it was, she might as well return the favor. \u201cI don\u2019t think putting anything into my body is a good idea right now, but thank you for the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I hate to be the bearer of bad news and all, but you really shouldn\u2019t keep him waiting. Technically, you\u2019ve only got about three minutes.\u201d</p><p>Logan squeezed Kerestyan\u2019s hand when he laced his fingers between hers and gently pulled her around to face him. He gazed down at her, his blue eyes burning with emotions she couldn\u2019t place. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>She did her best to offer him a confident smile, but ended up shaking her head. \u201cHonestly, no.\u201d She reached up and smoothed the cascade of black hair spilling over his shoulder. \u201cI was just starting to come to terms with being your prisoner, Lord Vampire.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as he brushed the backs of his warm fingers down her cheeks before curling them behind her neck. He pressed his forehead to hers then closed his eyes and inhaled the steam her breath created as it mingled with the cold air.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t move. He just stood there, his soft lips barely touching hers, breathing in her breath as though he needed it as much as she did.</p><p>\u201cOh man, you two aren\u2019t gonna start necking like two horny teenagers, are you?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d met him, Logan felt a surge of relief when Odin\u2019s snide voice interrupted. There was something about the intensity rippling the air around Kerestyan as she gazed up at him, something about the way her skin tingled and leeched the heat from his fingertips that made her feel strange and uncomfortable.</p><p>When he finally smiled, she turned in his arms and locked on Odin. Just because she appreciated his rude but timely comment, that didn\u2019t mean she intended to let it go. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for necking right now.\u201d She swung her hand down and smacked Kerestyan\u2019s muscular thigh before she squeezed extra hard for effect. \u201cI defiled your delicate flower of a little brother before we got here.\u201d When Odin\u2019s nose began the wrinkling process, she rubbed her teeth together and growled, \u201cTwice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Odin made the gag face, complete with tongue rolling out of his mouth before he shook out his arms. But he recovered quickly. \u201cWell, if nothing else, at least the gaps between your ribs make for good handholds.\u201d He turned and sauntered through a gate attached to a white picket fence. \u201cGives a whole new meaning to \u2018ribbed for her pleasure\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Logan tipped her head back against Kerestyan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhere does he come up that shit? And does he ever not have some kind of barbed comeback?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe watches a lot of television. And no, Odin always has to have the last word. You\u2019ll learn that soon enough. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced back at Odin just as he disappeared through the front door of a rather small and unremarkable white house. It looked nice enough, not that it took much to impress her considering where she slept most of the time, but it didn\u2019t bear any resemblance to a castle. And the two huge rottweilers sitting on opposite sides of the snowy front yard, although she was sure did a great job of making salesmen think twice, didn\u2019t exactly fit the whole medieval motif she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>She cocked her head when Kerestyan moved to stand beside her. \u201cI take it when you refer to this as a castle, it\u2019s some kind of inside joke I\u2019m not privy to?\u201d</p><p>The low, evil laugh that rumbled in his chest sent chills dancing up her spine. \u201cSure.\u201d He turned and extended an arm towards the gate. \u201cBy all means, Milady, Lord Nelek awaits you.\u201d</p><p>She started up the bricked path to the gate. \u201cI thought you were Lord Nelek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lord Kerestyan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut your last name is Nelek, so wouldn\u2019t you also be Lord Nelek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As Vouclade would gladly tell you if you asked, there is only one Lord Nelek...and it isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>Logan pushed the gate open and held it for him. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he passed then reached around her hip to pull the gate closed. \u201cIn about five seconds, it\u2019ll make a lot more sense than anything else in your world.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the rottweilers when their ears perked up, hoping like hell they\u2019d stay right where they were. \u201cWhat do you mean in five...\u201d she trailed off as the world around her melted into an amalgamation of vibrant colors, as though she\u2019d just dropped 500 crayons on a hot grill.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck...\u201d It was really all she could muster when the little, innocuous white house fizzled away, replaced by a black monolith of a castle standing roughly a football field away.</p> <p>Obsidian stones loomed high above her, framed by the cloudless night sky and thousands of twinkling stars. Towers rose so tall she had to squint to make out the scarlet banners flapping at the tops, all of which bore the same dragon she\u2019d seen on Odin\u2019s armor.</p><p>Trailing down from the spires, she marveled at all the different levels, stairways, window openings and walkways she could see from so far away. They seemed to go on forever, a dangerous ebony maze lit by nothing but flickering torches and braziers.</p><p>The front door Odin had walked through was actually two black doors. They had to be wide enough at the ground to drive two buses through side by side, but tapered to a sharp point easily three stories high. A set of torches burned on either side, casting thousands of gold and red sparkles through the facets in the stones.</p><p>Logan leaned back into Kerestyan when she felt his hands on her shoulders. She\u2019d never seen anything more foreboding, yet so breathtakingly beautiful in her entire life. This place, this dark and elegant stretch of stone didn\u2019t even touch the image her mind had built.</p><p>When she\u2019d first heard the word castle, she\u2019d immediately thought of grey stones and green, slimy moats. She\u2019d thought of drawbridges and knights on horseback. She\u2019d even pictured one of those little men dressed in bright colors blowing a horn.</p><p>But never in her wildest dreams had she expected this.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even winter here. The breeze was warm against her face, carrying sweet scents and tantalizing fragrances she\u2019d never encountered before. There were trees in full bloom as far as she could see, and the grass was such a rich, brilliant shade of green, it looked more like paint than something nature could produce.</p><p>She shook her head. No, this wasn\u2019t at all what she\u2019d expected.</p> <p>And what she also would\u2019ve never expected, until they moved and she suddenly felt the urge to wet herself, were the two huge dragons sitting where the rottweilers had been. One was a ruddy rust color and the other ashen grey, but both were monstrous with heads the size of small cars.</p><p>Kerestyan must have felt her body tense because before she could even ask, his arms circled her waist and his stubble prickled her cheek. \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t imagining any of this. There truly is a castle and those really are dragons.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a deep breath and tried to slow her racing mind. How? Why? There were so many things she wanted to know, so many questions she wanted to ask, she didn\u2019t even know where to begin.</p><p>He tightened his hold. \u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s so unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>The scratch of his stubble told her he was smiling. \u201cI know. My Father knows we\u2019re here. He says to take as much time as you need to acclimate yourself, he\u2019ll see you when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKerestyan,\u201d she reached up and touched his cheek, eyes locked on the red dragon that appeared to be watching her, \u201chow can all this be here? I mean, is it really here? You said we were going to Chicago. This is not Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just north of Chicago, outside the city limits because Chicago itself is ruled by another Lord. As for how it\u2019s here, that has everything to do with the power of my Father\u2019s blood and the strength of his magics. To any eyes but those of an Ancient vampire, nothing sets on this land but a little white house with a perfect picket fence. However, I assure you it\u2019s really here. It\u2019s just hidden as to not completely rend the Veil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you hide something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe castle is hidden through the use of blood magic. That\u2019s the only explanation I can offer you, Logan. You may know that vampires exist, but there\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know about vampires.\u201d</p><p>She turned in his arms when she caught the note of frustration in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being difficult. It\u2019s just, holy fuck...I was not expecting this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t being difficult. This is just hard to explain. Most Fledglings have at least a basic understanding of the magic in their blood, and even they aren\u2019t aware places like this exist.\u201d He finally smiled. \u201cThink of your current situation like this: You graduated high school with the intent to go into business, but instead of going to college and following the proverbial ladder of success, you accidently met the CEO of a large company who decided to bring you in at the executive level.\u201d</p><p>She considered his words for a moment. \u201cSo I skipped a bunch of menial cubicle jobs that even a new vampire could do and landed myself in the cushy corner office with a vampire who\u2019s older than dirt?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. You\u2019re seeing things right now most vampires never will, and you\u2019re about to meet vampires, my Father mainly, others only hear of in stories. The Nelek name is known throughout Ancient circles, but most Fledglings only come in contact with my younger siblings. And of course myself, but that\u2019s only because I rule a major modern city, packed with younger vampires.\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed her temples. She was more than on board with the whole vampire concept, especially because of where she currently stood, but the sheer amount of information to digest made her head ache. \u201cCan you just draw me a chart or something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with getting you inside the castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works for me.\u201d</p><p>She accepted Kerestyan\u2019s hand when he offered, figuring the dragons would keep their distance if she was somehow attached to a Nelek, and walked with him towards the doors.</p><p>She craned her neck at least a dozen times trying to see different things on the higher levels, but it quickly became obvious that she could look for two days straight and not see even a tenth of everything there was to view.</p><p>Logan turned her attention back to the blackened doors when the muscles in her neck cramped, but jumped when the destination of the smooth cobblestone path changed, leading straight to the golden, glittering eyes of the red dragon.</p><p>She squeezed Kerestyan\u2019s hand and tried not to panic as the beast lumbered forward, but when it stopped only a few feet away and lowered its head to sniff her, she was so busy trying to see she forgot about panicking. Every snout full of air the damn thing drew in sent a tiny tornado spinning around her, and if it wasn\u2019t sucking her hair into its nostrils, it was flattening it all against her face. When the air finally stilled, she brushed her hair out of her eyes and looked up at the creature \u2013 just in time to see a gaping maw full of razor sharp teeth snap closed in front of her face.</p><p>Her entire body went rigid and her heart slammed against her ribs before she let out a scream she was sure could wake the dead. The second she regained control of her limbs, she jumped on Kerestyan\u2019s back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt tried to eat me!\u201d She only meant to say it once, but the same words burst out three times without any real pauses between syllables.</p><p>\u201cNidan!\u201d</p><p>Logan shivered as a voice deeper than Kerestyan\u2019s rang in her ears. She peeked in the direction it came from, expecting to see a huge, burly man, but all she saw was an older gentleman with salt and pepper hair standing outside the doors.</p> <p>He pointed at the dragon. \u201cShe is your Father\u2019s guest. You will treat her with all the respect that honor grants her or I will have Vouclade skin you one scale at a time. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>The dragon nodded, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, snorted what sounded like a snicker on its way back to a worn spot in the grass.</p><p>She unfolded her arms from around Kerestyan\u2019s face and pulled his head back. \u201cThe dragon understands English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNidan is one of my older brothers. Yes, he understands English.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times. This night was making less and less sense by the minute. \u201cYour brother is a dragon?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, moving her hands with him. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t born a dragon, Logan. He\u2019s a vampire who can change into a dragon. It\u2019s a trait unique to the Nelek line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can turn into a dragon?\u201d She smacked her hands against his cheeks. \u201cYou can turn into a dragon but you can\u2019t turn into a wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can turn into a dragon, but it\u2019s a form I rarely wear. And no, I already told you, vampires do not turn into wolves. Werewolves turn into wolves.\u201d He reached up and squeezed her hands, hard. \u201cWould you be so kind as to unwrap your legs from around my chest, please?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. \u201cSorry. I really thought he was trying to eat me. So, how do you turn into a dragon? What color are you? Will you show me some...\u201d she trailed off as Kerestyan loosened her legs then tossed her into the air before he set her back on her feet.</p><p>She grinned up at him. \u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything else you should warn me about before we go inside?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cWhere would you like me to start?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start by introducing this lovely young woman to your dear friend Alfred?\u201d</p><p>Logan turned around when the same voice that scolded the dragon resounded behind her. Now that he was closer, she realized he wasn\u2019t nearly as small as she\u2019d first thought. Granted, he wasn\u2019t much taller than her, but he was still twice as wide. He was also rather handsome in a very regal and distinguished sort of way.</p><p>\u201cAlfred, this is Logan Ellis. Logan, this is Alfred, my Father\u2019s personal Servio.\u201d</p><p>She extended her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Alfred.\u201d</p><p>He caught her off guard when he accepted her hand but brushed a warm kiss across the back of it. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure, Miss Ellis.\u201d He released her hand and motioned towards the evil red dragon. \u201cPlease, accept my apologies for Nidan\u2019s behavior. He found himself grounded a few centuries ago for his inability to follow the rules, and apparently has yet to learn his lesson. You have my word, it will not happen again.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and followed when both men began walking toward the doors again. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I just wasn\u2019t expecting him to snap at me. Then again, since Kerestyan didn\u2019t bother to warn me about anything I might see when I got here, I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting to come face to face with a dragon at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Kerestyan\u2019s defense, sometimes it\u2019s better to gift someone the opportunity to draw their own conclusions from an experience, than it is to detail what they might experience.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t seen it herself, she\u2019d have never believed Kerestyan could puff out his chest so far. \u201cAlfred is a very wise man, Logan. You should listen to every word he says.\u201d</p> <p>She cupped a hand behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was so distracted by your huge chest and colorful peacock tail that I didn\u2019t hear what you said. Could you repeat it for me, please?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and cast a glance to Alfred, who chuckled in response. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed that. Now, imagine what it\u2019s like to be in the same room with her and Odin when they start picking at each other.\u201d</p><p>Logan shot him her best glare. \u201cI\u2019d like to openly state, just for the record, it\u2019s not my fault your walking Tin Can of a brother can\u2019t keep his comments to himself. Besides, he started it when he called me an it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBones!\u201d She stopped walking when the doors, one of which was cracked, burst open in front of them and Odin jumped out flashing an ear to ear grin. \u201cI can\u2019t believe your fragile human mind hasn\u2019t spontaneously combusted yet!\u201d</p><p>She rolled her head towards Alfred. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOdin, you needn\u2019t worry yourself, she is doing just fine. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us, she has an overdue meeting with your Father.\u201d</p><p>Odin\u2019s face sobered almost instantly. His eerie eyes narrowed on her much the way they had the first time she met him. \u201cI want you to know that while I don\u2019t particularly care for the way you ended up here, I really do wish you the best of luck. What you\u2019re about to go through won\u2019t be easy, but if you walk out on your own two feet at the end...you\u2019ll never walk alone again.\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to respond before he wandered off into the courtyard.</p><p>She stared after him for a long moment, wondering not only what he\u2019d meant by the last part of his statement, but whether all vampires were as moody as him and Kerestyan. It seemed like one moment they were laughing and joking, but the next were so intense you either wanted to scream or cry.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Alfred said, \u201che\u2019s getting used to you.\u201d He then extended his arm towards the doorway and bowed his head. \u201cMiss Ellis, I welcome you to Nelek castle.\u201d</p><p>Taking that as a hint to get a move on, she stepped into the main hall with Kerestyan close at her side, and once again lost her ability to speak. The walls here were just as black as the ones outside, only these were adorned with tapestries woven from an array of dark fabrics. The largest, hanging from a railing high above yet another set of closed black doors, had the crimson head of a dragon embroidered into the darkest piece of velvet she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>A thick red carpet cut across the dark marble floor, running from where they stood to the second set of doors. Sculptures and statues were positioned in various places around the huge room, as well as soft chairs and wooden tables, all of which looked to be older than anything she remembered seeing in her history books.</p><p>As she moved to the center of the room, at the gentle but very persistent nudging of Kerestyan, who\u2019d moved to stand behind her, she noted just inside the main doors on both the right and left, there were small archways leading to thin hallways lit by torches. To the sides of the closed set of doors were two large archways, each serving as an opening into wide hallways leading to the main wings of the castle.</p><p>Kerestyan nudged her again. \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth. \u201cI think if you don\u2019t get your knee out of my ass I\u2019m going to smack you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and moved to stand next to her. \u201cMy apologies. Now, what do you really think?\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head back and considered the chandelier made of obsidian glass and dozens of red candles, which cast a warm glow over the room. \u201cI think...it\u2019s absolutely spectacular.\u201d She lowered her eyes to meet his, but the proud expression on his face said everything. \u201cBut something tells me you know that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d his eyes darkened as he slowly slid his tongue across his bottom lip, \u201cand you have no idea how much it pleases me to see you standing here, in a place I will always call home.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples tingled and stiffened, followed closely by heat flaring in her cheeks as she noticed Alfred shift behind Kerestyan. She choked on something invisible and coughed it out. \u201cWell, we should probably get to the meeting, huh?\u201d</p><p>Way to speed up your death just because the hot vampire made eyes at you. She flipped her brain the mental equivalent of the middle finger then smiled at Alfred. \u201cWhich way do I go?\u201d</p><p>He motioned to the set of black doors behind her. \u201cLord Nelek awaits you in his chamber.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Logan turned around and stared up at the ominous doors. Unlike the ones leading into the castle, these were rectangular and made of some kind of blackened metal instead of wood. They also weren\u2019t nearly as tall or wide as the main doors, but for some strange reason felt much larger and much, much darker.</p><p>She slowly approached, pondering how a simple change in material and shape could create such a different energy. Though the wooden doors hadn\u2019t necessarily made her feel happy and welcome, these left her with an odd sense of indifference, as if her presence in front of them meant something and nothing at the same time.</p><p>She stilled when all at once, her body relaxed. Her heart slowed from wild racing back to a steady rhythm, the nervous flutters in her stomach faded away and the nausea completely subsided.</p><p>The feeling the doors filled her with was something she\u2019d felt almost every single day for well over a decade. She felt it when she walked through Manhattan or a dirty alley in Brooklyn. She felt it when she plucked half eaten food from a trashcan or found something fresh behind a restaurant. She felt it when she stole a purse from a stripper loving old lady or lifted the wallet of a business man stumbling down Fifth Avenue in a drunken stupor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d even felt it when she finally accepted vampires were real, and realized there was nothing she could do but try to avoid them.</p><p>Complete and absolute indifference.</p><p>She held her breath as the heat of Kerestyan\u2019s body seared her back. She could only recall three days in recent memory when she hadn\u2019t felt that way, two of which she\u2019d barely been conscious.</p> <p>He was the only reason she\u2019d feared this moment.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t because she loved him, she barely knew him. It wasn\u2019t because she needed him; she was more than content to be alone. It was because after everything he\u2019d done for her, she didn\u2019t want to disappoint him.</p><p>Releasing her breath, Logan reached out to touch the intricate filigree embossing near the seam where the doors met, but just as her fingertips brushed the cold metal, they rattled and swung open from the inside.</p><p>The moment the doors fully parted, she forgot about what she couldn\u2019t feel for Kerestyan, forgot about wishing she\u2019d have met him in another place, another time. All she could focus on was the creature twenty yards in front of her, sitting on a throne made of ivory bones, in the center of a moonlit chamber crawling with shadows.</p><p>Long, midnight hair framed a beautiful, almost alien face with flawless, porcelain skin. High cheekbones cut and angled down into a strong, unforgiving jaw line. Firm, pale lips were drawn tight, offering no shred of discernable emotion.</p> <p>But it was his eyes, or lack thereof, that really chilled her. Two shadowed hollows occupied the space where his eyes should have been, lending the nightmare quality to the twisted angel Kerestyan had described.</p><p>Obsidian armor covered his body from the neck down, but unlike Odin\u2019s, his was made of only blackened metal. The head of a dragon was emblazoned across his chest plate, yet instead of being etched or embossed, it glowed as if it were completely separate from his armor.</p><p>Black stairs led up the stone platform where he sat on his throne, eight to ten feet higher than the rest of the room. Behind him and to the right was a huge, nearly lifelike statue of a giant in full armor, similar in appearance to the man on the throne, but much larger.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she inched through the doorway that she realized one wall of the chamber wasn\u2019t like the others. Where everything in the entire place seemed to be awash in black, the wall to her right was a mash of pinks and reds.</p><p>And the longer she stared at it, the more it appeared to be moving.</p><p>No, no. It didn\u2019t appear to be moving, it was moving.</p> <p>Writhing.</p><p>In the small area she focused on, a pair of brown eyes surfaced and blinked before a set of lips formed, letting out a muffled, pained cry.</p><p>Oh, God no... She reached back and grabbed a handful of Kerestyan\u2019s hair then pulled his head down next to hers. \u201cIs that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was quiet, almost a whisper.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis favorite enemies and rivals. Consisting of vampires, werewolves and...other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t traffic with humans anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Logan gave in to the chill sliding up her spine and shook out her hands. She\u2019d seen a lot of awful things living on the streets of New York, but the most disconcerting part of staring at the wall of undulating muscle, flesh and body parts...was that it wasn\u2019t the worst sight she\u2019d ever witnessed.</p><p>What does that say about you? It wasn\u2019t a question she wanted to know the answer to.</p><p>The sound of metal scraping against stone pulled her attention from the wall and back to the horribly beautiful man sitting in the center of the room. In front of the stairs the marble floor liquefied and rose to form a simple stone chair with arms and a high back.</p><p>She swallowed hard, assuming that was his special way of implying she should get her ass over there. She moved towards him, very much feeling as though she was walking the long hallway to the principal\u2019s office. Only this time, the principal had fangs and full rights to corporal punishment, up to and including death.</p><p>Just as she reached the chair she felt Kerestyan\u2019s hand tighten around her arm. She stopped and watched as he stepped up beside her, every bit the regal and proud man she\u2019d become, if nothing else, rather fond of over the last few days.</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cFather, I present to you Logan Ellis, as you requested. Logan, this is my Father, Lord Stefan Nelek.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at Stefan, who completely ignored her and inclined his head towards Kerestyan. \u201cYou may leave, Kerestyan.\u201d His voice wasn\u2019t like anything she\u2019d ever heard. It was sinister yet oddly enchanting, deep and full of raw, unbridled power.</p><p>Kerestyan stiffened. \u201cBut, Father, I feel I should...\u201d When Stefan raised his mailed hand, Kerestyan fell silent instantly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t request your presence, Child. I requested only hers. Leave my chamber.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for a second, but lowered his head again. \u201cYes, Father.\u201d</p><p>To say the room felt a little empty as Kerestyan\u2019s footfalls faded behind her was a gross understatement. But when the heavy doors slammed closed, she\u2019d never felt more alone in her entire life.</p><p>This was it. She was going to die. Right here.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>When Stefan motioned to the chair, she quietly sat down but immediately wanted to jump out of it. The hard marble bit icy teeth through her jeans, stinging her skin to the brink of numbness.</p><p>\u201cLogan Ellis, owner of knowledge no human should possess. What circumstances do you believe brought you before me this night?\u201d</p><p>She shifted. She wanted to pay complete attention to him, but how could anyone sit in this chair without their butt cheeks freezing together? \u201cYou answered your own question. I know about vampires. I\u2019m not supposed to.\u201d She leaned to the side, trying to keep as much of her behind off the seat as possible. \u201cCan I stand up for this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath and kicked her legs. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t focus when my ass is frostbitten. I know how important this meeting is. Please? I promise I\u2019ll stand still.\u201d</p><p>His face didn\u2019t change at all. \u201cWhy would you promise to stand still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t strike me as the type of guy who likes a lot of movement.\u201d She grabbed the other arm of the chair and leaned towards that side. \u201cCall it a hunch, but when someone surrounds themselves with this much stone, they don\u2019t like things that change. Change position, change texture; change period.\u201d She started to wiggle again, but stopped when she swore the statue\u2019s lip twitched.</p><p>Stefan turned his head to stare up at it. At least she thought he was looking at it...it was kind of hard to tell since he didn\u2019t have eyes! \u201cYou find her entertaining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe reminds me of Odin.\u201d</p><p>She jumped and sat up, spine straight as an arrow. Suddenly, the chair wasn\u2019t the coldest thing in the room anymore. It was the living statue. It was his frigid, powerful voice echoing through the room, crushing down on her entire body, stealing the oxygen from her lungs.</p><p>Even the demonic angel\u2019s voice didn\u2019t hit like that.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Stefan waved a hand and within a few seconds her chair heated to a nice and toasty temperature. \u201cDo you find that more acceptable?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a few mouthfuls of air before she nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d She eyed the statue again before settling back on Stefan. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just do that in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the ages, creatures of any species tend to be more honest when uncomfortable.\u201d He motioned to the wall of living flesh.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look. \u201cI don\u2019t need to sit on a block of ice to feel uncomfortable right now, trust me. That feeling pretty much started when the dragon tried to eat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for Nidan\u2019s behavior. My Children tend to be exactly that sometimes, children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve met Odin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdin disapproves of you. He disapproves even more of his brother\u2019s feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t exactly surprised. \u201cYeah, well, what Odin does or does not approve of, really isn\u2019t my problem. Kerestyan\u2019s more than an adult, and if he does have some kind of feelings for me, it\u2019s really none of Odin\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care for Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth together. What was it with vampires and their obsessive need to tell her how she felt? \u201cLook, I like him, but I\u2019m not going to sit here and profess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes on his hollows. Only one person knew how she felt, and it sure as hell wasn\u2019t him. \u201cI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s your place to tell me how I feel about anything. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to know you. I\u2019ve seen you a thousand times before. Dotan, a divine priest clinging to his failing beliefs because he knows nothing else. Kerestyan, an honorable knight imprisoned inside the very armor which holds and protects him. Odin, a fierce warrior leading droves of men to their death because the rage inside him inspires nothing greater. And Trinity, a beautiful woman wrapped so tight in the fingers of pleasure, she no longer feels because she\u2019s never known pain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood up and pushed a thick, black cloak from his armored shoulders. \u201cI do know you, Logan Elizabeth Ellis.\u201d He raised his arms and held them out to his sides. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by forty-seven versions of you. They may wear different faces, may have been birthed in times long forgotten, but they were all once as you are now.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd exactly what is it you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken. You broke her, and she continues to break you.\u201d</p> <p>Logan stiffened and clutched the arms of the chair. He couldn\u2019t possibly know. She drew in a sharp breath. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKerestyan told you not to lie. However, allow me to reconstruct your memory. You wrenched the wheel as you squinted against the morning sun, praying you could get the car back into the driveway before he woke up from the couch, where he\u2019d passed out, the stench of alcohol clinging to his weak body. You were so concerned about what he would do if he found out; you never saw her step off the sidewalk. But you heard the impact. You heard her scream before her fragile bones crunched beneath the tires, heard the wet, sucking sound of air escaping her lungs as she tried to cry. And then you felt it when you pulled her tiny, lifeless body into your arms. You felt the warm, sticky fluid coat your hands, watched her favorite pink sweater and school bag turn crimson before your disbelieving eyes. You watched Jessica die in your arms, broken. And her memory has broken you every moment since.\u201d</p><p>Logan bit at her lips as hot tears rolled down her cheeks. She didn\u2019t know how he knew, and truthfully, she didn\u2019t care. \u201cAre you finished? Is your scare-the-human routine complete now?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he stretched out a large arm, which disappeared all the way up to his elbow before he pulled it back, revealing a silver disc resting in his open hand. He descended the stairs and gently placed it in her lap. \u201cWould you care to see her?\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the ornate silver frame of the mirror as a thousand different emotions swirled inside her. Hate. Anger. Guilt. The surface shimmered black just before a hazy image faded into view.</p> <p>She fought for control of her voice. \u201cIs she a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When her soul released, she immediately ascended to the Light Realm, which is what you humans refer to as heaven. She existed there, complete and content, reliving her most cherished memories for fourteen years before she reincarnated.\u201d</p><p>Logan watched, silent, as the image in the mirror burst into vivid colors. A girl who looked to be about three years old, dressed in pink pajamas, toddled across a hardwood floor while holding an upside down kitten in her arms. She shook her head when the cat squirmed, her glossy black curls springing around her chubby little face. \u201cMama, Mama, kitty was in my room. Her bite my toes! Hers a bad kitty, a bad, bad kitty.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled in spite of the dull ache throbbing in the center of her chest. \u201cShe always hated cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still does. In a previous life, long, long ago, she was mortally wounded by a tiger. Though her mind may not, her soul remembers. In this life, and every life to come, she will also endure a short but intense fear of automobiles for the very same reason.\u201d</p><p>Logan struggled to breathe under the weight of his words. She stared up at him as her chest tightened. \u201cI scarred her forever?\u201d</p> <p>The mirror disappeared as he reassumed his place on the throne. \u201cYou\u2019re being overly dramatic. You\u2019ve given her an obstacle to overcome, one that will help define who she becomes later in life. Character is not measured by moments of success, Logan Ellis. It is measured by the grace in which you move through adversity. What you\u2019ve given her is yet another chance to grow.\u201d</p><p>Anger coursed through her. \u201cBullshit! You can wrap it in as much philosophic rhetoric as you want, but at the end of the day she\u2019s changed because of what I did to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did to her,\u201d he trailed off in a low rumble of eerie laughter. \u201cWhat is it with humans and guilt? Had you not killed her, she would have lived only to die at the age of sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo she wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she would have.\u201d His voice echoed through the chamber, shaking her chair. \u201cHad she lived beyond the morning of your accident, when you chose to run away at fourteen instead of fifteen, you would have taken her with you. Your pathetic excuse for a father would have then filed the missing persons\u2019 report he never sought for you alone. Within a matter of days you would have both been found, and much to your dismay, returned to him. Shortly thereafter, he would have remanded you to the state, claiming an inability to control you. Jessica would have stayed in his custody, and without you to protect her, your father\u2019s abuse would have escalated. At the age of sixteen, pregnant with his child, she would have died. Her body would have been just as broken, but instead of lying in the driveway, she would have been found at the foot of the staircase in your former home. Tell me, Logan, would you prefer she died in the arms of someone who loved her, or at the hands of someone who should have?\u201d</p><p>Logan slammed her fist against the arm of the chair. \u201cI would have preferred she not die at all!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou humans are such selfish creatures. When will you finally realize you cannot undo the past? If you wish to memorialize your sister, plant a flower. I even offer the Nelek Gardens in which you may do so. However, do not use your sister as an excuse to shorten your life span one needle at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I did!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is exactly what you did. Before this moment, your unconscious mind was trapped in the past, sheltering your waking mind from the truth behind the horrors you\u2019ve committed. I\u2019ve ripped the protective blanket of heroin from you, and under no circumstances will it be returned. You now see that you are everything you believe you are. You are a murderer. You are a thief. You are as worthless as your father said you were. Yet, you are some of those only because you believe those words.\u201d</p><p>Logan surged from the chair. \u201cI am a murderer! I killed her. I did it. It wasn\u2019t someone else. It was me!\u201d She collapsed to her knees and clutched her chest as memories assailed her. \u201cI felt it. I felt her die. I felt her leave me...alone....with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave her freedom from a man who would have abused her further.\u201d</p><p>She rocked forward as a pain she\u2019d never known twisted through her body. \u201cI killed her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a murderer? Yes, you killed your sister. Accidental or otherwise, her body died due to injuries you caused. You cannot undo your actions. They now comprise a dark sliver in your soul, and that will never change. Never. The soul forgets nothing. You must find a way to move beyond it. And that way is in my granting you what most, be they human, vampire or werewolf, never receive. I have gifted you the ability to understand that while you may have killed a flesh and blood body, she remains.\u201d</p><p>Logan squeezed her eyes closed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let us explore what else you\u2019ve done. Are you a thief?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t nearly as hard to answer. \u201cYes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI agree. You take that which does not belong to you. However, allow me to enlighten you of a single precious truth regarding humanity. All humans are thieves. They lay claim to land they do not own. They take from the earth that which is not theirs. With every sun that rises, they rob each other of hope. They purloin each other\u2019s dreams. Humans steal with every fetid breath they take. In my mind, when it comes to being a thief, you are but one of billions.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a breath and opened her eyes as cold fingers closed around her hand. Not metal, not stone, but strong, pale fingers that made her hand look like a child\u2019s.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even heard him move.</p><p>With his assistance, she climbed to her feet and tipped her head back to stare up at him. The hard, unforgiving cut of his face softened slightly, allowing her, if only for a moment, to see why Kerestyan called him Father. Even though he didn\u2019t have eyes, it felt like he was staring straight into her soul.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly believe you are worthless?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together as more tears streamed from her eyes. How was she supposed to answer that? How, after what she\u2019d done to her own sister, could she be anything else?</p><p>And above all else, why was the only thing that really bothered her what she did to Jessica? Shouldn\u2019t she have felt just as bad about being a thief? Shouldn\u2019t she have felt even worse for the striking indifference she felt about everything and everyone around her?</p><p>\u201cThe answer is no,\u201d Stefan\u2019s deep voice was softer now. \u201cYou are a survivor. You are possessing of traits lost on many humans of this age. You see the world for what it is, and with that truth follows knowledge and power. You would have never learned of the existence of vampires had you never run from your childhood home. Every obstacle you faced, every choice you made, prepared you to stand before me this night.</p><p>\u201cUntil this moment, you existed with no home, and no constraints aside from those you placed on yourself. You bent knee to no human. You shunned all that society demanded you conform to. You, alone, chose and accepted responsibility for your path, and that is why you will leave this chamber on your own two feet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was almost afraid to believe it. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind you is a door leading to Vouclade\u2019s laboratory. There he will give you the medical attention your human body needs, as well as prepare you for the ritual of becoming a Nelek Servio. Go now.\u201d</p><p>When he released her hand, Logan turned to find a simple wooden door standing open a few feet away from her chair. She focused on following the spiraling, torch lit staircase as she desperately tried to pull her frayed emotions together.</p> <p>Before she fully rounded the first curve, Stefan\u2019s powerful voice enveloped her. \u201cThis was one of your darkest hours, Logan Ellis, and you should know you moved through it with as much grace and as much strength, as I would expect from any who bear my name. Welcome home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine, Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stopped pacing outside the doors to his Father\u2019s chamber long enough to glare at Alfred. \u201cHow do you know? She\u2019s been in there for fifteen minutes.\u201d He cast a glance back to the blackened doors, icy guilt jacketing the beast in his stomach. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left her. I should have forced the issue.\u201d</p><p>Alfred chuckled. \u201cKerestyan, you need to calm down.\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan spun on his heel to face him. \u201cNo! I don\u2019t. It\u2019s my fault she\u2019s in there.\u201d He raised both arms and pushed his fingers into his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s only human, Alfred. She shouldn\u2019t be in there alone with him. I should have stayed.\u201d</p><p>All the humor drained from Alfred\u2019s face. \u201cHad you argued with your Father in front of her, she wouldn\u2019t still be in there. He would\u2019ve killed her where she stood. You did the best you could for her with the choices available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I, Alfred? I could\u2019ve let her walk out of that alley and made it a point to keep an eye on her. I could\u2019ve attempted to reconstruct her memories instead of subjecting her to all of this. She\u2019s here because I was selfish, because I allowed my curiosity to cloud what was best for her.\u201d</p><p>Alfred rolled up one white sleeve of his button down shirt and shook his head. \u201cI spoke with Vouclade after your Father separated him and Odin. He and I discussed, in length, the extent of Logan\u2019s exposure to vampires. You know, and we both agree, her interaction with our kind was far too frequent to simply be reconstructed. I\u2019m sure you could have attempted, at the risk of leaving her in a catatonic state. Is that what you\u2019d prefer for her?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his arms and fisted his hands. \u201cNo. But it\u2019s better than the possible death she faces in there.\u201d</p><p>Alfred\u2019s green eyes narrowed as he rolled up his other sleeve. \u201cIs it? Think long and hard about what you just said, Kerestyan. Would her life be better lived as a slathering invalid, or not at all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI vote for not at all!\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan turned his attention to Odin, who was exiting the wing leading to the library. \u201cThis has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Odin tucked a bright blue book with gilded silver pages under his arm. \u201cYou need to stop whining. Do you really think she\u2019s not gonna make it through his test? Please. I don\u2019t even like the bitch and I have at least that much faith in her.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stepped forward to stand in front of Odin when the animal in his stomach unfurled and scarlet tinged his vision. \u201cDon\u2019t ever use that word as a means to refer to her again, especially in my presence.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and lightly smacked Kerestyan\u2019s cheek. \u201cScrew you. We\u2019re not in New York. I\u2019ll call her whatever I want while I\u2019m here. There isn\u2019t shit you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan snapped an arm out and knocked down Odin\u2019s hand when he moved to slap him again. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know her. What could she have possibly done to make you despise her so much?\u201d</p><p>Odin stooped to set his book on the floor then extended to his full height, his black eyes narrowed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about you. That\u2019s what the fuck she did to make me not like her. You look at her like she\u2019s the most precious thing in this world. And Logan,\u201d he shook his head and growled, \u201cshe looks at you the way she looks at everything else.\u201d He stomped a heavy boot against the marble floor. \u201cLike she doesn\u2019t give a damn whether you live or die! How the hell can you find that attractive?\u201d</p><p>When Kerestyan caught sight of Alfred in his peripheral, arms folded over his chest, he forced the stalking beast in his stomach down and focused back on his brother. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her the way I do. You haven\u2019t talked with her, haven\u2019t seen the way her eyes light up when she\u2019s happy. You haven\u2019t seen even a shred of the Logan I have.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged an armored shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know her. What I want is for you to grow the fuck up. Good God, you two are so ass backwards it\u2019s not even funny anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stiffened, and for a moment could only stare at the man who happened to be a minute and a half older in human age, but a full year and a half younger in blood. If anyone needed to mature in this equation, it was his brother. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Odin rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to go this way, Kerestyan! If you\u2019re going to fall for a human, isn\u2019t she supposed to be some cute little thing that paints your world in all kinds of rosy colors,\u201d he dramatically clutched his chest, \u201cand then lures your undead soul out of the darkness?\u201d He sighed and feigned a sniffle. \u201cIsn\u2019t she supposed to be some beautiful, caring creature who teaches the brooding old vampire how to love again?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his hand and raked Kerestyan with a disgusted glare. \u201cBut you...you backwards son of a bitch. You have to fall for a girl who\u2019s more apt to piss on your foot than she is to love you. You have to fall for the most detached, disinterested and sarcastic street waif the fucking world has ever seen. The human is supposed to try and save you, Kerestyan, not the other way around!\u201d</p><p>When Alfred\u2019s hearty laughter filled the room before Kerestyan had a chance to respond, he blew out a deep breath and stared at the old man. \u201cWhat is so damn funny?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOdin does have a point. The reversal of roles, although not quite complete, is rather interesting. Of course, that\u2019s simply the opinion of someone who\u2019s been around far longer than both of you, combined.\u201d He stepped forward and clapped Odin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick up your book and join your visitor in the side courtyard? I\u2019d like to speak with your brother in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Al.\u201d Odin retrieved his volume and headed for the main doors. However, he couldn\u2019t quite leave without tossing one last comment over his shoulder, \u201cMaybe you can talk some sense into him.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan considered Alfred as he unrolled his sleeves. \u201cYou knew he was coming, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and buttoned each cuff. \u201cAlthough most of you Children, with the exception of Trinity and her spiked heels, tend to move silently, I\u2019m still in tune with this home in a way none of you will ever be.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan couldn\u2019t argue there. Alfred was only a few years younger than his Father, and even though he was a servant, he was as powerful as Kerestyan. \u201cDid you anticipate we\u2019d end up in a physical altercation?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWhen it comes to Odin, one never knows. Besides, you aren\u2019t exactly your usual calm and collected self, Kerestyan. I\u2019m most pleased you chose not to \u2018throw down\u2019 as your brother would term it. However, I would feel even better if you\u2019d calm yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He turned to face the doors to his Father\u2019s chamber. \u201cNot until I know she\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><p>Alfred sighed behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way down to see Vouclade at this very moment.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan whirled around as relief exploded in his chest then surged through his limbs. \u201cShe is? She made it through his test?\u201d</p><p>When Alfred nodded, Kerestyan closed his eyes and rolled his shoulders, attempting to alleviate the tension knotting his muscles.</p><p>\u201cYour Father wishes to speak with you now.\u201d</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes when Alfred\u2019s words were closely followed by the sound of the doors behind him creaking open. The overwhelming sense of relief he\u2019d felt quickly faded with each crackle of the steel hinges.</p><p>There were only two reasons his Father would desire his presence at this moment. He was either going to be reprimanded for the slight struggle he gave during Logan\u2019s introduction, or for his argument with Odin in the main hall.</p><p>After sucking in a deep, useless breath, Kerestyan squared his shoulders and turned to face the doors. Keeping his eyes on the floor, he strode into the chamber and didn\u2019t stop until he reached the foot of the stairs leading to the throne.</p><p>He leveled his gaze on his Father, whose alabaster skin glowed under the full moonlight. \u201cYou requested me, Father?\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod. \u201cI\u2019ve offered Logan a place as a Nelek Servio. She did well in her first test.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan staved off the urge to grind his teeth. \u201cFirst test?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His Father\u2019s face was stoic as always. \u201cDid you truly believe there would only be one?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan shifted to stand with his arms folded behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for more tests. If you\u2019ve deemed her competent enough to become a Servio, shouldn\u2019t one be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan has the raw potential to be a very powerful and loyal servant. However, due to her minimal and modern education, she needs intensive training and guidance. She must prove her ability to learn and grow before her testing is complete. Should, for some reason, she stagnate or find herself unable to release what America has taught her are her inalienable freedoms, I won\u2019t hesitate to end her life. However, I don\u2019t believe that will be an issue for her.\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan forced himself to ignore the negatives of his Father\u2019s assessment and focused intently on what he could control. \u201cI\u2019m more than capable of educating and training Logan.\u201d</p><p>His Father\u2019s cold laughter boomed through the chamber, bouncing off the stone walls. \u201cYou will have no hand in Logan\u2019s training, Kerestyan. It\u2019s quite obvious you\u2019ve an attachment to her that stretches beyond mild fascination or simple curiosity. I will not extend you an avenue in which to hold the rights of blood over her.\u201d</p><p>Anger burned then immediately cooled in the pit of Kerestyan\u2019s stomach. Had he been standing in front of anyone else, the animal inside him would have seized control of his body and blindly lunged for the man sitting only a few yards away.</p><p>But that same man had sent Kerestyan\u2019s beast retreating into the darkest recesses of his soul time and time again. So now it curled into a slumbering ball, refusing to be roused in his presence, no matter how much rage boiled inside Kerestyan.</p><p>His Father\u2019s stern face reflected his own thoughts. \u201cYou would fight me for Logan?\u201d</p> <p>He lowered his head and considered the striations in the marble floor while his mind and what remained of his heart silently warred. For thousands of years he\u2019d bent knee to only his Father. He\u2019d obeyed every edict, carried out every command. Not once had he questioned his words. Never had he hesitated.</p><p>Never...until now.</p><p>Backwards or not, he cared for Logan in a way that defied human explanation. She filled him with feelings and desires he hadn\u2019t felt in longer than he could remember. He understood her detachment, identified with the emptiness inside her. Although he couldn\u2019t declare absolute love for her, he could fight for the promise he made when she\u2019d clung to him in the shower.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t leave her, he wouldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>Kerestyan raised his head and stared into his Father\u2019s hollowed eyes. \u201cYes. I would fight you for her.\u201d</p><p>He watched as his Father stood and descended the stairs to stand directly in front of him. \u201cThen under no circumstances can you be her Master. You can stand here for as long as you like and try to reason with yourself, Kerestyan. I can almost hear your subconscious mind. You couldn\u2019t possibly. You\u2019ve only know her for a short time. You\u2019ve not seen enough yet. But if you\u2019re willing to fight for her, for whatever it is she represents to you, then as you once told her yourself...in some way, you do love her.\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan stilled as a knot formed and tightened in his throat. Maybe in some non-traditional ways he did. Maybe he just wasn\u2019t fully aware of them yet. But he would never intentionally hurt her. \u201cI would never use my blood against Logan. No matter what, I would never take her choice away.\u201d</p><p>The blackened gauntlets on his Father\u2019s hands retracted before he rested his cold palms on Kerestyan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s a very honorable notion to believe, until you realize her feelings aren\u2019t returned or have faded. The beast desires what it desires, Child, and you will taint the bond between you without realizing you\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>He returned to his throne and sat down. \u201cIf the request was spoken by any of your siblings, you know I wouldn\u2019t consider it further. However, for you, Kerestyan, I will weigh the potential consequences. While I do, I leave you with but one question. If I remand Logan to you, and in a matter of weeks she comes to care for you, perhaps even love you in her own ways, how much time will pass before you question whether her heart arrived at the decision of its own accord?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan turned and headed for the doors leading to the main hall, knowing his Father\u2019s question wasn\u2019t meant to be answered now or verbally. It was meant to make his mind race, meant to make him search the dark, animalistic vestiges of his soul in ways that made his chest ache and tighten.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>If in a matter of weeks Logan came to love him, he would wonder if the decision was her own. It would eat at him each time she smiled with her emerald eyes, every single time her smooth, pale skin touched his. He\u2019d question whether the feelings were truly hers, or if in some twisted way his blood had forced them upon her.</p><p>He fisted his hands, his fingernails burning into his palms. Could he live with himself knowing there was even a slight chance his thoughts and emotions would erode hers away?</p><p>Kerestyan stepped into the main hall feeling worn, as though he\u2019d just fought his way across yet another battlefield. The question he faced now wasn\u2019t whether he could be Logan\u2019s Master and not hate himself, it was if he could ignore the beast-driven urge to challenge whichever sibling she served.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>Logan stared down at her naked body and blinked a few times to make sure she wasn\u2019t hallucinating. Where her clothes had gone, she didn\u2019t know. What she did know was if someone didn\u2019t come get her out of the shiny room the staircase had abruptly ended in, somebody was going to need a doctor to extract her foot from their undead ass.</p><p>It was bad enough the second she\u2019d stepped into the room a stainless steel wall slammed into place, blocking her access to the stairs. But then, oh then, her clothes just fizzled away while some kind of gas sprayed all over her, leaving every inch of her skin stinging and cold as if she\u2019d just been bathed in hand sanitizer.</p><p>The only bright spot, if being trapped in a cage like a wild animal had one, was the hurricane force burst of wind that followed the gas had dried her hair in a matter of seconds.</p><p>She balled up her fists and pounded on the wall in front of her, not even sure which one led to the stairs anymore. Her entire body was covered in goose bumps, her teeth chattered, and she was fairly certain had the box been glass \u2013 she could have used her hardened nipples to cut her way out.</p><p>She covered her eyes when she heard a hiss of air, but peeked between her fingers when the sound was followed by a heavy clunk. After a brief moment of silence, the wall in front of her slid back to reveal Vouclade, freak scientist extraordinaire.</p><p>Lowering her hands, Logan glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s about fucking time. I\u2019m freezing my ass off in here. What the hell was that shit?\u201d</p><p>Vouclade pushed his wire rimmed glasses up on the bridge of his nose and leaned to the side, his long black dreadlocks swinging with the movement. \u201cIt would appear your ass, although not nearly as shapely as it would be had you taken better care of yourself, is completely intact.\u201d</p><p>She eyed his thin frame, covered in black leather with dozens of silver buckles. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have any room to talk about me being skinny, especially when you look like a starved bondage slave.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a perfect but creepy smile. \u201cMaybe I am.\u201d</p><p>Well, what the hell was she supposed to say to that?</p><p>\u201cFor your information, Logan, I was near death when I was turned into a vampire. You have no such excuse. You chose to allow your body to deteriorate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly do it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>He motioned for her to follow before he turned around. \u201cI didn\u2019t start the plague on purpose either, but it didn\u2019t change the outcome.\u201d</p><p>She walked behind him into a large room that looked exactly like a hospital laboratory, complete with pristine white walls and stainless steel tables. Bright fluorescent lights only added to the effect, along with the thick, acrid stench of bleach.</p><p>It took a few seconds before his words caught up with her brain. \u201cYou started the plague?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged on a white lab coat then moved to prepare an exam table. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of an accident.\u201d</p><p>He patted the table. \u201cI agree. Would you lie down, please?\u201d</p><p>She stood there for a minute. Dreadlocks, black leather and buckles, skin just as pale as Kerestyan\u2019s, nothing about this screamed sanitary. He looked like a crazed scientist straight out of a horror movie.</p><p>Logan shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll make you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him when he pulled out the stirrups and adjusted them. \u201cOh, hell no. I\u2019m not getting on that table.\u201d</p><p>His grey eyes narrowed on her. \u201cLay down.\u201d His voice was loud, commanding.</p><p>And just like that, she did. Eyes glazed, she walked right across the clean white floor and did as he commanded. She even put her feet in the stirrups.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she felt him touching her stomach that she snapped back to life. She raised a hand to smack his away, but then remembered how unfavorably Odin had reacted. So she settled for poking him in the side. \u201cThat was rude.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made an evil sound reminiscent of a chuckle. \u201cThat, Logan Ellis, was your first lesson in mental manipulation. When faced with a vampire or Servio older than yourself, it\u2019s better to willingly do what is asked of you than be subject to manipulation.\u201d He continued examining her while he talked, poking and prodding at her like an experiment. \u201cAs an Ancient, when I make a request of a Fledgling, I am far more pleased when they perform without question. If they force me to cavort through their mind, sometimes I get distracted by other things going on in their brain, and then I end up leaving them with more tasks to perform than the one I originally asked for. I blame them for their stupidity. Had they simply done what I asked in the first place, I wouldn\u2019t have a new pawn to play with. Understood?\u201d</p><p>She started to nod but squealed and drew her knees up when he pressed and wiggled the skin under her hip bones. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re ticklish. I shall inform my brother.\u201d His amusement faded as he pressed harder. \u201cYou also have an abnormality in your left ovary. When was the last time you saw a doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I was fifteen. You can just look at someone and make them do whatever you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. However, I don\u2019t have to speak at all. I can plant suggestions in your mind just by looking at you. And once I\u2019ve met you, I no longer need to see you. I can sit here in my lab while you\u2019re in New York and fill your head with all kinds of interesting things. Are you not interested in what may be wrong with your body?\u201d</p><p>Holy crap! \u201cWell, yeah. But learning about getting mind fucked makes for far more interesting conversation. I\u2019m not using my ovaries, and unless you do something crazy to them, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be saving my life anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a truly interesting view of things, Logan. I also find your recovery time from the stress you endured in my Father\u2019s chamber rather remarkable.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about Jessica. It\u2019s not as though I don\u2019t know on some level drugs helped me forget. But I wasn\u2019t really trying to forget...I was just trying to make it through the day. Forgetting was just a side effect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgetting is not an effective coping mechanism. You have to find a way to move past the trauma, an avenue in which to truly deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have dealt with it, Vouclade. But that doesn\u2019t mean when it\u2019s brought up I\u2019m not going to react to it. Isn\u2019t there something in your life you don\u2019t like reliving? Something you wish you hadn\u2019t done?\u201d</p><p>He stilled for a moment. \u201cThere are many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why should it be any different for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI concede your point.\u201d He pulled a pair of latex gloves from under the table and moved to stand between the stirrups. \u201cI need you to relax.\u201d Snap! \u201cThis is the last stage of the physical.\u201d Snap! \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished, I\u2019ll draw blood and we can discuss the state of your body.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. The last thing she thought she\u2019d have to go through after being kidnapped by vampires...was a pelvic exam. But something told her she wasn\u2019t getting out of it. \u201cJust don\u2019t do anything funky, alright?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Like this?\u201d He brushed a gloved finger over her clit.</p><p>She screamed and grabbed the table as an orgasm ripped through her. No warning. No foreplay. It just slammed through her body with the force of a passion fueled freight train. She squeezed her thighs together and tried to catch her breath.</p><p>That was the last thing she\u2019d expected, especially with a single touch.</p><p>Once she regained her bearings, she lifted her head and stared at Vouclade. \u201cHow the hell did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic.\u201d When she arched a brow, he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a master of the human body. Now you\u2019re relaxed and I don\u2019t have to apply ice cold lubrication to perform the exam. However, if you\u2019d prefer I use it, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>She released the edge of the table and raised a hand. \u201cNo, no. That\u2019s fine. Carry on.\u201d She grumbled and scrunched up her face as he carried out the exam.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you engaged in sexual activity?\u201d</p><p>She grinned wide, like she\u2019d just eaten his favorite canary. \u201cAbout fifteen minutes before Kerestyan brought me here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd before that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time you engage with Kerestyan, you need to do so in a more genteel fashion.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched up her face. Aside from pick pocketing, she didn\u2019t really pride herself on doing anything gentle. She raised her head again. \u201cI\u2019m not really a \u2018make love\u2019 kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Now his face mirrored that of a concerned physician. \u201cThat may very well be, but you\u2019ve sustained quite a vaginal laceration, Logan. One that had you not been here, would have caused an infection that could have killed you.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault your brother\u2019s a beast. Besides, I\u2019d like to point out that had he not kidnapped me, I would have never slept with him and there would be no laceration or potential infection. I\u2019d have kept abstaining like a good girl.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious by the way he stood up and spiked his gloves in a silver trash can that he didn\u2019t find the comment nearly as amusing as she did. \u201cYour body is not in good condition, Logan. The only part of you that isn\u2019t suffering from some kind of deficiency is your mouth. And from what Kerestyan told me, it\u2019s only because you have some sort of neurotic obsession with your teeth.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and sat up straight. \u201cIt\u2019s not an obsession.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cDuring the withdrawal process, you asked Kerestyan to brush your teeth no less than twelve times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d She accepted Vouclade\u2019s hand and stepped down off the table. \u201cDid he do it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEvery time.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about hearing that bit of info, let alone what to say. She\u2019d never considered brushing her teeth an intimate activity, but it definitely felt that way upon learning someone else had done it for her.</p><p>\u201cYou disapprove of him fulfilling your requests?\u201d Vouclade asked.</p><p>She shrugged as he led her to a metal chair situated next to a desk with a computer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I think.\u201d When he motioned for her to sit down, she hesitated. \u201cHow cold is this chair?\u201d</p><p>He gave a knowing smile. \u201cIt\u2019s been warmed for you.\u201d</p><p>She rested her hand on it first, smiling when it warmed her fingers. Sitting down, she wiggled and watched him assume his place behind the desk, his fingers flying over the keyboard. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, Doc?\u201d</p><p>He stopped typing and retrieved a syringe from the top desk drawer. \u201cAlthough I can smell the vitamin deficiencies in your blood, Father has requested a complete report. Therefore, we\u2019ll do things the old fashioned way.\u201d</p><p>She flipped her arm over and held it out for him. \u201cSome are easier to draw from than others.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything as his eyes scanned her forearm, but she felt his disgust charge the air between them. \u201cIt just pisses you off, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pushed the needle under her skin. \u201cI surmise, more than anything, it disappoints me. As I said before, you strike me as an extremely intelligent woman. Why you would do this to yourself is beyond me. And at my advanced age and intellect, not understanding the why is difficult to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes there really isn\u2019t a why.\u201d She stared down at the dark scars on her arm. \u201cSometimes you just do things that make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>When the syringe was full, he carefully pulled the needle from her arm and brushed a finger over the small puncture wound, which tingled then closed right before her eyes. He licked the small red smudge from his finger and made a nasty face. \u201cDisgusting.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open for a second. \u201cThanks, Vouclade. That\u2019s gotta be the vampire equivalent of, \u2018yes honey, you do look fat in that dress.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughed that evil sound again. \u201cIt\u2019s an apt comparison. You taste absolutely horrible. However,\u201d he paused to empty the contents of the syringe into a weird machine, which in turn made an odd whirring sound, \u201cit\u2019s now my responsibility to fix your ailing human body. You have a few choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoices are good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this moment, under no circumstances are you physically well enough to become a Servio. I can either administer antibiotics and vitamins, in conjunction with a strict dietary plan that will bring you back to a healthy state within a few weeks, or I can purge and repair your system in a matter of minutes. Which would you prefer?\u201d</p><p>It seemed like an easy choice, but she figured she\u2019d better ask. \u201cIf I take the fast route, what are the drawbacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no drawbacks, aside from leaving you little time to prepare before your life dramatically changes.\u201d</p><p>She took a moment to look around the room. \u201cI\u2019m sitting with a vampire in a laboratory that\u2019s underneath a black castle, hidden from human eyes by some sort of blood magic. And I got here by a crazy means of teleportation, that just thinking about makes me want to vomit, with the guy who kidnapped me because I know vampires exist. How much more dramatic does it get?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled. \u201cAs a Servio, you become immortal, Logan. Unless you incur an extreme amount of damage, along the lines of a grenade exploding in your hand or being run over by a speeding freight train, your body will be capable of healing any wound or disease. You will no longer fall ill. You will have to ingest millions of calories to gain a single pound, and you will age at a markedly decreased rate. You\u2019ll also gain supernatural abilities granted by ingesting your Master\u2019s blood, and will need to be just as aware of the Veil as any vampire.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cTrinity already told me about everything you just said, except the ingesting blood part.\u201d She shivered at the thought. \u201cI was really hoping to avoid that. I think I\u2019d rather have a big, ugly tattoo.\u201d</p><p>He flicked his glasses down on the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou discussed becoming a Servio with Trinity? My sister, Trinity?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she brought Kerestyan the steaks he asked for. She told me I\u2019d probably become a Servio if I made it through the meeting. I asked her what that meant and she gave me a quick rundown of the basics.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cHumor me for a moment. What exactly did Trinity say to you?\u201d</p><p>Logan shifted in her chair. She really didn\u2019t want to disclose every word of what Trinity told her, especially the last part. \u201cYou want to know everything she said?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m only interested in what she said about becoming a Servio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said I\u2019d be immortal, I\u2019d stop aging for the most part, that it\u2019d be really hard to gain weight, get sick or die, and that I\u2019d be stronger and able to move faster than I could as a human. She also said whatever I do comes back on my Master, so if I break any rules, my Master gets in trouble first then passes the punishment down to me. Then she said my punishment would likely be ten times worse because not only would I be punished by my Master, but then Stefan, because he doesn\u2019t suffer fools.\u201d</p><p>Vouclade sat back in his chair, seemingly lost in thought until the machine her blood was in beeped. He turned his attention to the computer monitor. \u201cAs I suspected, your vitamin levels and immune system are severely depressed. And since you already seem to be informed of what it means to be a Servio, I see no reason not to take the shortest route between two points.\u201d</p><p>She shifted again. The strange tugging sensation at the top of her spine said something wasn\u2019t right here. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling something\u2019s going on that I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, shaving a bit off the edge she felt. \u201cYou\u2019ll experience that quite often while you\u2019re here. At this moment, twenty-two of my forty-six siblings are present in the castle. With the amount of telepathy and other magics in use, not to mention the sheer power of said individuals and the fact you are still very much human, you\u2019re going to feel an egregious amount of movement around you. I would advise you pay it as little attention as possible.\u201d</p><p>Logan relaxed a little. Maybe that was the reason, but the tingles just beneath her skin said his explanation was only a part of it. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019ll accept that answer for now, but I think you just fed me a line.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist, Logan. I look for connections in everything, visible or not. Just because I pause doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something you should be concerned with. Now, shall we begin the healing process?\u201d</p><p>She stood when he did. \u201cSure. What do I need to do?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he moved around the desk to stand right in front of her that she realized they were the same height. He pressed his cold palms flat against her abdomen. \u201cStand still. You\u2019re going to feel a warm sensation throughout your body but it will subside in a few minutes. In the mean time, I\u2019d like to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I informed you Kerestyan had brushed your teeth in response to your numerous requests, your heartbeat and body language suggested you found it troublesome. I find it very intriguing that you have no issue being naked in front of me, have little difficulty discussing personal subjects with me, yet learning Kerestyan tended to you when you were in no condition to take care of yourself, upset you. Why?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath. She thought she\u2019d done a good job of dodging this subject. \u201cIt didn\u2019t upset me. I just don\u2019t know how I feel about it. It\u2019s been a long time since someone\u2019s taken care of me in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking care of you now.\u201d</p><p>She stared into his sharp grey eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. You don\u2019t look at me the way he does. You look at me like you\u2019re trying to see through me, like you\u2019re searching for my motivations and all that other psychobabble bullshit. He looks at me like, I don\u2019t know. As if he wants to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnow you?\u201d</p><p>She started to nod but stopped when his eyes narrowed. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been alone for a long time. Not counting the time I was sleeping or half out of my mind, I\u2019ve only known Kerestyan for about ten hours. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved, slow and wide. \u201cYet you know how many hours you\u2019ve spent with him, and you engaged in carnal activities with him.\u201d</p><p>She blamed the overall warming of her body for the flash of heat she felt in her cheeks. \u201cBelieve it or not, Kerestyan\u2019s been the most stable part of my life the last few days. And you should know, just for all that analyzing you\u2019re doing, I didn\u2019t start seeing him as a gorgeous man with a hard body until our dalliance in the kitchen. But when I woke up wrapped around him in the bathroom...like I said, sometimes you do things because they feel good.\u201d</p><p>He made the evil sound again. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised Kerestyan has become a pillar of stability for you. He\u2019s been that way the majority of his existence. But tell me, when was it you stopped seeing him as a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice now, in my presence, you\u2019ve referred to him as a man or a guy, but you directly referred to me as a vampire. I\u2019m wondering why and when you began to draw a distinction, or if perhaps it\u2019s entirely subconscious. Were you thinking of him as a vampire while you were having sex with him?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou want the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt that moment, I really didn\u2019t care. I was thinking he was the sexiest damn thing I\u2019d ever seen, and all I wanted to do was to fuck him hard and fast until we couldn\u2019t move anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart rate is elevating.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never realized how hard it was to laugh while standing still. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Your questions make me remember what we did. Thinking about him makes me hot, Vouclade. At this moment, I can honestly say he\u2019s one of the best looking men I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost vampires are, Logan. Even though I don\u2019t exude the same type of appeal Kerestyan does, and I happen to be shielding you from it right now, if I walked into any nightclub in any city I wouldn\u2019t leave alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me all vampires are hot?\u201d She wagged her brows. \u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m advising that you\u2019ll find any vampire of substantial age attractive. Much the way certain animals have evolved camouflage capabilities to assist in hunting, vampires become more appealing as they age as a means to attract prey. Most Ancient vampires, those who were born thousands of years ago when the average height for a man was five feet, are now six and a half feet tall. Our curse assures our physical bodies adjust to suit the time period, but the damning aspect is that it doesn\u2019t assist our minds. I\u2019m sharing this information with you so that in the future, should you find yourself in the presence of someone who draws you like Kerestyan or my Father; you\u2019ll know you\u2019re dealing with a vampire of advanced age and power.\u201d</p><p>Her mind kicked into overdrive. \u201cYou know, you talk a lot about old vampires, but what about the young ones? Are they all ugly? How are they supposed to compete for food against someone like Kerestyan? It doesn\u2019t sound very fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA young vampire is no less attractive than they were as a human, but in terms of competition, they have to work harder. And nothing, Logan, nothing about being a younger vampire is fair. Since the moment the Eldest began passing their curse, it never has been. It never will be. Kerestyan told me he used a business analogy with you, yes?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m in the cushy corner office for once in my life.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes, you are. Take the same business he described, but imagine what it would be like if you were one of those working in a cubicle. You put in day after day of hard work, but no one above you ever retires. There are no promotions, no advancements, unless of course, you manage to dispose of a supervisor. Could you imagine some of the Fledgling vampires you\u2019ve witnessed in New York challenging someone like my Father, or even Odin for that matter?\u201d</p><p>All she could picture was a thick haze of red and gold. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Kerestyan didn\u2019t even move and the three I ran into in the alley died.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat is what it is to be a Fledgling. However, they wield the power of their blood over humans the way I wield mine over them. This is how it\u2019s been for thousands upon thousands of years. And in two thousand years, those Fledglings you\u2019ve seen in New York this year, the ones who manage to survive, will treat the new vampires of that age the way they were once treated. They\u2019ll manipulate their Fledglings, using them to amass power and prestige while the true Ancients continue to manipulate them. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would anyone want to be a vampire then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost humans aren\u2019t given a choice, Logan. I can count on one hand the vampires I know who sought an avenue to become what they are, and not a single one did so for any reason other than vengeance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. So let me be selfish for just a minute. In this warped circle of dysfunction, because that\u2019s obviously what it is, where do Servios fit in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cServios serve their Masters. In all honestly, the life of a Servio varies greatly pending who they serve. Alfred enjoys a very comfortable life here and is nearly as old as my Father. He maintains the castle and all its inner workings, as well as tending to my Father\u2019s personal affairs. He\u2019s also my Father\u2019s closest friend and even his conscience on occasion. But there are many Servios, of varying ages, who are traded and treated like slaves by their Masters.\u201d</p><p>Logan grimaced. That certainly didn\u2019t make her feel good. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could keep you here for a century recounting stories of the horrors Servios have undergone. Suffice it to say, Servios can be subject to the same atrocities any human could, except endure it for far longer considering their resistance to death. You, no matter which Nelek Child becomes your Master, won\u2019t face such. My Father holds each of us to high standards when it comes to the treatment of our servants. You\u2019ll be trained in our ways and treated with the respect you deserve. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be punished for your mistakes, but we only torture our enemies.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran the length of Logan\u2019s body. The smile that crossed Vouclade\u2019s face as he finished his sentence was inhuman at best, but she wasn\u2019t sure that was the whole reason for the way she felt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He removed his hands from her stomach but caught both of her forearms. \u201cThe healing process is complete. However, I have a request of you.\u201d</p><p>She was almost afraid to ask. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His face took on a more serious countenance. \u201cYour life as nothing more than a street waif is now over. I\u2019m asking that you allow me to remove the final traces of that life.\u201d She glanced down to where his thumbs brushed over the dark blotches on her arms. \u201cYou are more than a drug addict. You are more than sunken eyes, pale skin and colorless lips. You are a beautiful, intelligent woman who sees the world through the eyes of a human, but processes it with the elegant mind of an Elder vampire. You, Logan Ellis, are a rarity in this age, and very much a Nelek.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to take that. \u201cIs there something wrong with the way I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampiric society is very brutal and maligning to someone who possesses obvious weakness. Although I\u2019ve healed the internal damage your life on the streets has done, you still have the look of a street waif. I have no doubt that in New York\u2019s society you will face ridicule, which will only reflect on your Master. I have no intention of changing your features, just adjusting your body to what it would be had you been more able to care for it. It truly is a question of whether you wish to look as you do now, for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes. The concept of eternity was difficult to wrap her mind around. Hell, it was hard to wrap her mind around everything she\u2019d been through in the last three days, let alone forever.</p><p>Vampires. Castles. Dragons.</p><p>Really, what the hell had she gotten herself into?</p><p>\u201cIt appears the decision has been made for you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and stared at Vouclade. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather wishes for your body to be restored completely. He says it is the second step in you realizing you are more than what others believe you are.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cWait, wouldn\u2019t me staying as I am be saying I\u2019m more than what people think I am?\u201d</p><p>He smiled in a most devious way. \u201cNo. If someone were to look at you now, they would expect you have an intricate knowledge of the streets. If I restore you, you become extremely dangerous as no one would believe such.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOoh. I like the sound of that. How long does...\u201d before she was able to finish the question, she felt another tingle, only this time it rippled across her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her arms almost unable to believe her own eyes. The needle tracks were completely gone, as if they\u2019d never been there at all, and instead of a pale, sickly color, her skin was ivory and shimmered in a way she hadn\u2019t seen since...she couldn\u2019t even remember.</p><p>Her mouth all but fell open when she looked down. She cupped and squeezed her breasts. \u201cAre my boobs bigger?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOnly slightly. Your bone structure wasn\u2019t meant for anything more than what you already had. However, in my personal opinion, the more womanly curve of your hips compensate for whatever it is you feel your breasts lack.\u201d</p><p>Logan ran her hands over her body. \u201cI have hips!\u201d She tried to look over her shoulder. \u201cI think I have an ass.\u201d She groped her behind, finding a bit more than she had before. \u201cI do! I have an ass! This is fucked up. How the hell did you do this?\u201d</p><p>He simply smiled again. \u201cI\u2019ve reached an age where the power of my blood allows me to accomplish many things. There\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t do to the human or vampiric body with but a thought or touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me more boobs?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo. I told you I would only return your body to what it would be had you taken better care of it.\u201d He motioned to a door across the room as a new set of clothes appeared in his hand. \u201cBeyond that door your Master awaits you. I suggest you don\u2019t make them wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you look so good! Not that I didn\u2019t approve before, but damn you\u2019re hot!\u201d</p><p>As the door disappeared under her outstretched hand, Logan found herself with the sudden urge to smile and cry at the same time. For some reason she\u2019d believed Kerestyan would be the one sitting in the chair by the crackling fireplace, kicked back like he owned the place.</p><p>But instead, it was Trinity.</p><p>The vampiress swung her feet down from the dark coffee table. \u201cYou expected Kerestyan, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Logan fought against the wide range of emotions swirling inside her. Tears heated and stung the rims of her eyes but she refused to give in. She forced a smile into place. \u201cI guess I just assumed it would be him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be him, Logan.\u201d She motioned to the chair across from her. \u201cIt goes against Nelek decorum.\u201d</p><p>Logan walked over and sank into the soft, maroon leather, silently reminding herself she needed to listen to the forthcoming answer with an open mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s Nelek decorum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA set of rules my Dad\u2019s placed on all his Children. Kerestyan\u2019s interest in you goes beyond...how can I say this? Screw it. Kerestyan has feelings for you, and because of that he can\u2019t be your Master. It\u2019s one rule I happen to agree with whole heartedly.\u201d She leaned back in her chair and laughed. \u201cAnd considering you don\u2019t even know how you feel about him, Kerestyan being your Master wouldn\u2019t be good for you at all.\u201d</p><p>Logan slowly nodded, staring at the table as all her emotions twisted and converged into one. \u201cSo now we\u2019ve moved from telling me how I feel to what is and isn\u2019t good for me.\u201d She raised her head and glared at Trinity. \u201cIn this list of rules you have, does it also state as soon as you grow fangs you become a fucking know-it-all? Does it say as soon as your heart stops beating you get to control everyone around you?\u201d</p><p>Trinity narrowed her tilted eyes. \u201cYou may want to think long and hard about whatever\u2019s running through your mind right now, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind? You\u2019re lucky I can even think straight right now. I think I\u2019ve taken everything that\u2019s happened over the last few days fairly well. I didn\u2019t fight. I didn\u2019t run. My human brain didn\u2019t spontaneously combust, as Odin so lovingly put it. I\u2019ve answered all the questions asked of me, and even accepted when I didn\u2019t think mine were being answered with complete honesty. But everybody has a limit, and I\u2019m damn close to finding mine.\u201d</p><p>Trinity kicked her feet back up on the table. \u201cWhat are you going to do, attack me? I\u2019ll warn you now \u2013 that\u2019s against the rules, too. Nelek Children and Servios are forbidden to attack each other while we\u2019re in the castle, and forbidden to kill each other no matter where we are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Truthfully, attacking her hadn\u2019t even crossed Logan\u2019s mind, but since Trinity brought it up, she leaned forward and rested her elbows on her knees, hands folded. \u201cThen I guess it\u2019s a damn good thing I\u2019m still human right now, huh?\u201d</p><p>Trinity smiled, her black eyes twinkling in the dim lighting. \u201cNice way to skirt the rules. Playing the technicalities is one of my favorites, too. But attacking me isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere except hurt. I like you, which is exactly why I\u2019m sitting here right now, but if you lunge across that table I\u2019m going to kick your skinny ass around this room until you can\u2019t do anything but listen.\u201d</p><p>Logan ground her teeth together. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve done without fail since this whole situation began, it\u2019s listen. Don\u2019t treat me like a child. I don\u2019t care how old you are. At no point in history, ancient or other, has anyone liked being treated as though they\u2019re stupid. I\u2019m no different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll give it to you straight. If you ingest Kerestyan\u2019s blood, which is exactly what you have to do to become his Servio, you\u2019ll never know if what you feel for him is real. The second his blood passes your lips he can control you. Your emotions, your actions, even your mind. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>She fisted her hands as anger coursed through her, but then inhaled a deep breath and blew it out slowly. \u201cThis really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Kerestyan. Am I a little disappointed he\u2019s not the one sitting here? Yes. But this has more to do with being told how I feel and what is or isn\u2019t good or right for me.\u201d She stared straight into Trinity\u2019s perpetual bedroom eyes, hoping it would help drive the intensity behind her words. \u201cI\u2019ll be your Servio, but I will not be your puppet.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou have a lot of nerve.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook her head and settled back in the chair. Was she speaking in another language? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take nerve. It takes understanding yourself and what you\u2019re faced with. I appreciate your willingness to take me on, especially if Kerestyan can\u2019t. At least I know you a little bit. But if this is going to work, you need to know I\u2019m not going to dance for you. I\u2019ll help you during the day. I\u2019ll do the things you ask. But outside of matters directly relating to serving you, I refuse to be told how I feel or what\u2019s good for me. I may have fallen into a world I don\u2019t completely understand, but I still know who I am.\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s red lips parted in a beaming smile. \u201cYou\u2019re such a cold bitch. Is it wrong that makes me like you even more?\u201d</p> <p>Logan cast a glance over Trinity\u2019s tight leather pants and matching corset before considering her perfectly colored face and midnight hair, pulled into a tight ponytail high on her head.</p><p>She looked like the Dominatrix responsible for starving Vouclade.</p><p>Logan smiled at the thought. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly warm and fuzzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s why we\u2019ll get along. Look, I won\u2019t tell you how you should or shouldn\u2019t feel, but in return you need to understand as soon as my blood runs through your body, as bad as it sounds \u2013 you belong to me. I\u2019m responsible for everything you do and say, and while I don\u2019t like exerting emotional or mental control over my Servios, I\u2019ll do it if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Logan did her best to say calm. She really didn\u2019t like the thought of anyone being able to control her emotions, let alone her thoughts. \u201cHow do I know you aren\u2019t going to make me feel things I don\u2019t? You seem to be pretty chummy with Kerestyan. How do I know I won\u2019t find myself in love with him because you \u2018controlled\u2019 me into it?\u201d</p><p>With the way Trinity\u2019s body stiffened, it was obvious Logan had crossed a line she didn\u2019t know existed. Trinity sat up and jammed her finger into the arm of the chair. \u201cFirst of all, I wouldn\u2019t force anyone to love someone against their will. Love isn\u2019t a weapon. My Father is as cold and calculating as a vampire gets, and even he doesn\u2019t use love as a tool, which is exactly why he\u2019s forbidden Kerestyan from being your Master. There are emotions and thoughts that are fair game to be manipulated, and ones that aren\u2019t. Love is one that should never be touched. Don\u2019t you ever question if what you feel around Kerestyan is my doing. Ever!\u201d</p> <p>When Trinity\u2019s bottom lip quivered just before she stood up and stalked off towards the window opening, Logan stood up, not really sure what to do.</p><p>She turned and stared at the spot on the wall where the door had been. Vouclade wasn\u2019t this moody. Stefan didn\u2019t seem to have enough emotion for more than two moods. Hell, even Alfred appeared to be in control of himself.</p><p>She moved to stand next to Trinity. But when Trinity just continued to stare out the window, Logan followed her line of sight down to an image she never would\u2019ve expected. Odin lay on a blanket of lush grass with a big blue book propped open in front of him, next to a little girl who couldn\u2019t have been more than five. She twisted a tiny finger into her curly brown hair and laughed as he pointed to something on the page.</p><p>Logan was almost positive her mind was playing tricks on her this time. She blinked twice before she even thought about asking, \u201cIs he reading a book to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a ghost,\u201d Trinity interjected, her voice quiet and distant. \u201cThe Gianni\u2019s, another powerful family of vampires, live across the street. You might\u2019ve seen their mansion from the sidewalk, but chances are it was hidden from your human eyes. In any event, the power of their blood grants them the ability to traffic with ghosts from the Light and Dark realms. I know my Dad explained a little about the Light realm to you,\u201d she motioned to the odd couple, \u201cbut Emily\u2019s from the Dark realm. You can call it Purgatory, Hell, or whatever you want, but there aren\u2019t flames or imps. It\u2019s a shadow of the living world, where you can see everything but you can\u2019t touch anything. Only tortured souls go there, the ones who are too angry, violent or confused to reincarnate.</p><p>\u201cEmily was murdered in a rather violent fashion back in the 1800\u2019s, somewhere on the Gianni\u2019s property. I don\u2019t know all the specifics, but I do know she believes she\u2019s still very much alive. She comes over at least twice a week and Odin reads to her. He does it without fail, every single time she asks. And in return...she loves him in a way that\u2019s unfathomable to me. I\u2019ve tried so many times, but I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2019ve watched them for hours, and every single time I marvel at them.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I\u2019m telling you all this, since I\u2019m starting to sense your confusion, is because I would never do anything to disrupt what you\u2019re seeing right now. Much like I would never manipulate your feelings for Kerestyan. Love that\u2019s real and freely given rarely finds vampires, Logan, let alone Ancients.\u201d</p><p>She shot Trinity a sideways glare. \u201cI am not in love with Kerestyan. I\u2019ve only known him for three days, most of which I wasn\u2019t even awake.\u201d</p> <p>Trinity leaned back against the edge of the window and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you love Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed a hand down her face. She hated playing word games. \u201cKerestyan doesn\u2019t love me either. He doesn\u2019t know me any better than I know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may not love you yet, but he\u2019s more than on his way.\u201d She broke out in an ear to ear grin. \u201cYou get to him somehow. I\u2019ve never seen him so out of sorts.\u201d She balled up her fist and shook it playfully. \u201cK\u2019s usually stone faced and stoic, a harsh and demanding vampire Lord. But when your skinny ass walks into the room...I don\u2019t think you realize what kind of affect you have on him.\u201d</p><p>Logan squeezed her eyes closed tight then opened them and stared hard at Trinity. \u201cYou know what, why don\u2019t we stick to talking about what I\u2019m going to be doing for you? Kerestyan is more than capable of telling me how he feels. And in the interest of honesty, I\u2019m really not comfortable talking about my relationship with him, or lack thereof, with you...or anyone else for that matter.\u201d</p><p>An unsettling smile spread across her mouth. \u201cFine, I suppose now is as good a time as any to let you know I\u2019ll be basing you back in New York City. You\u2019ll be staying in the castle for a few weeks while I train you on the basics, then I\u2019ll send you back to meet up with one of my Servios who already lives in New York. You\u2019ll be working together on controlling my interests there. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cStaying in New York is fine with me. I\u2019m obviously comfortable there. I know the place inside and out and could probably walk it with my eyes closed. What kind of interests do you have?\u201d</p><p>Trinity made her way back to her chair. \u201cI control a few high end prostitution rings, influence some minor drug trafficking and own a few fetish and bondage clubs. Will being in that type of environment be a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>Logan sat up on the window ledge, enjoying the sensation of the fresh, warm breeze blowing against her back. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to be around the drugs for a while. I got the sense from Stefan he\u2019d put me on his wall if I so much as looked at heroin again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed rather loud. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s never been fond of my love affair with chemicals, either. I\u2019ll keep you away from that end of things until you tell me you\u2019re ready. What about the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkin doesn\u2019t bother me. Neither do kinky people, as long as they keep their hands to themselves. What kind of work will I be doing? You\u2019re not going to turn me into a call girl, are you?\u201d</p><p>Her nose scrunched up. \u201cNo offense, but you aren\u2019t really the call girl type. Granted, you\u2019ve got the legs for it, but the kind of high class girls I run all have...shall we say \u2018certain qualities\u2019, none of which you possess.\u201d</p> <p>Logan arched a brow. Not that she wanted to be a prostitute, but she had to know. \u201cLike what? Vouclade gave me an ass again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to selling yourself than having a great body, Logan. You have to be willing to do things most women aren\u2019t, and you also have to be a great actress. I just don\u2019t see you keeping your mouth shut if some three hundred pound business man tells you to bend over and take it like a good little girl.\u201d</p><p>Logan could almost see the comical scene unfold in her mind. \u201cUh, no. That\u2019s not me. I\u2019d most likely hogtie him with the bed sheets and steal his wallet. Then I might even be inclined to call his wife to come pick him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so mean.\u201d She kicked her feet back up on the coffee table. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why I think you\u2019d be better off starting out in one of my clubs as an assistant manager. Vouclade\u2019s working with a Tech to get all your official documents together.\u201d She ticked her fingers off as she said, \u201cSocial security card, birth certificate, driver\u2019s license. I need to get you back on the map before I can do anything with you. It\u2019s important you have all the necessary documents while you\u2019re still within your human lifespan.\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed a hand across her forehead. Sometimes she felt like these vampires were the ones talking in a foreign language. \u201cVouclade\u2019s working with a Tech? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>Trinity smiled at her and blew out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m not going to drown you with a bunch of history right now because that\u2019s something we can talk about later, but I\u2019ll give you a quick overview.</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning, there were six Original vampires. They, for whatever reason, shared their blood with humans and created Children, and then their Children made more Children and so on and so forth. But all vampires come from a bloodline spawned from one of the Originals, each with their own special magics. Since you\u2019ll be around mainly Fledglings and Servios, memorize these slang terms: Trumps, Thugs, Witches, Techs, Shades and Dolls. Those are the six lines. Fledglings toss the names around the same way they\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Logan, she\u2019s an Ellis\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Logan repeated the words in her head then nodded. \u201cSo which one are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Nelek decorum states you have to be in service for a year before you\u2019re trusted with that knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>She grumbled. \u201cGreat. More rules.\u201d</p><p>Trinity kicked her head back and laughed. \u201cGet used to it. This life comes with a lot of rules and restrictions. And being a Nelek comes with even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So what do the words represent? Is a Tech good with technology?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Think of them as high school stereotypes. Techs are computer geeks. Trumps are preps. Witches are Goths. Thugs are jocks. Dolls are burnouts. Shades are...the only ones who don\u2019t fit into a typical stereotype. The Gianni\u2019s across the street are Shades. Believe it or not, you shouldn\u2019t run into many. Of all the lines, they have the smallest numbers but tend to be the most dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with Shades, got it. So a computer geek is helping Vouclade get all the papers I left at home or didn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Truthfully, it will take hours to explain the lines and reasons behind the names. And get this, the Elders and Ancients use different names for each line. It can be a lot to digest. Not to mention going into Werewolves and Paladins and Harbingers and Celestials. There\u2019s a lot more to the world than just vampires. But luckily for you, I\u2019m old and have a good hold on the world around me. Imagine being a Fledgling who\u2019s Sire is only a hundred years old and doesn\u2019t know the history past the age he lives in.\u201d</p><p>Logan folded her arms over her chest. Between what Vouclade had said earlier and what Trinity was saying now, it sounded like Fledglings really got the shit end of the deal. \u201cI think I\u2019m starting to feel sorry for younger vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She raised a hand and shook her head. \u201cOnce I get you trained and send you off on your own for a few days, you\u2019ll understand why I say that. Every now and then there\u2019s a diamond in the rough, but most of the time they think they\u2019re God\u2019s gift to humanity. I don\u2019t expect you to understand right now, but I promise you will in a few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Logan smiled. Part of her was actually looking forward to having a reason to be out on the streets, even if it was only to do someone else\u2019s dirty work. Which reminded her, \u201cWill I be back out living on the streets or will I be staying with Kerestyan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour days of living on the streets and picking through the trash are over. I\u2019ll be providing you a fully furnished apartment in Soho. If you choose to spend your nights at Kerestyan\u2019s or vice versa, that\u2019s entirely between the two of you. I won\u2019t get involved there unless it interferes with what I need you to take care of or accomplish.\u201d She smiled wide. \u201cIf you\u2019re supposed to be running money and instead you spend the night riding Kerestyan, don\u2019t expect me to be pleased. Besides, he\u2019s still the Lord of New York. He has a lot of things he needs to be doing, too. He has to attend court, monitor his city and his Fledglings, and keep the Veil. Had he not been keeping a personal eye on three of his biggest trouble makers three nights ago, which he doesn\u2019t do often at all, you\u2019d have never met him.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Logan slowly shook her head. It was wild to think if she\u2019d gone another way or been ten minutes earlier or later, she wouldn\u2019t be sitting here right now. She\u2019d be shivering in a wet, dilapidated building or walking the streets scoping out trashcans.</p><p>What a difference a few minutes made.</p><p>She stood up and stretched out her legs. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to think this all happened by chance. I mean, what are the odds I\u2019d be in the same alley as Kerestyan, especially with how many there are in that part of Brooklyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Trinity laughed. \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d Her voice wavered, as if it\u2019d shifted an octave higher.</p><p>Logan straightened and stared at her soon to be Master. \u201cWhy did you say it like that?\u201d</p><p>Trinity looked all around the room. \u201cSay what like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018what are the chances\u2019 like you know something.\u201d She glared when Trinity lowered her eyes. \u201cDo you know something, Trinity? Was there more at work than just chance? Did Kerestyan know I\u2019d be in that alley?\u201d</p><p>Trinity quickly made eye contact again. \u201cOf course not. Kerestyan wouldn\u2019t do anything like that, it\u2019s not his style. I\u2019m sure he was just as surprised to find you in that alley as you were him. In fact, I\u2019m willing to put money on it.\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned back against the window ledge. Something still didn\u2019t sit right, but she chose to let it go for the moment. It wasn\u2019t as though she could force Trinity to talk, at least, not yet. \u201cWhen are we going to do this Servio thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night. Father asked you be given a night and day to peruse the castle as a human. It\u2019s not something that happens often. I think he\u2019s interested in how you see it. I can\u2019t remember the last time we had a human running around.\u201d She tipped her head to the side. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t remember ever having a human running around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cWe\u2019ve had werewolves and ghosts, but not a regular human. I guess you\u2019re a first.\u201d Her smile faded into a snarl as she smacked a hand against her ear. \u201cOkay, you have to leave.\u201d She motioned to the wall and a door appeared. \u201cIf Kerestyan screams in my mind one more time, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Logan opened her mouth to ask, but stopped when she remembered Vouclade mentioning telepathy. \u201cWhat\u2019s he yelling about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou! He wants me to let you out. He says I\u2019ve kept you to myself long enough and he needs to make sure you\u2019re alive. He needs to see you with his own eyes. Of course, he doesn\u2019t know what Vouclade did to your sexy little ass.\u201d Her covetous grin returned as her eyes moved over Logan\u2019s body. \u201cI bet you a grand he pops a serious hard on as soon as you step through that door. And I bet you ten, he tries to screw you against the wall.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have any money. Besides, something tells me you have an inside line on this one.\u201d</p><p>Trinity stood, and with both arms made a grand sweeping motion towards the door. \u201cGo! Make him scream out loud so he stops bothering me. Consider it your first real test as my Servio. Don\u2019t let me down!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 15</p><p>When Logan stepped through the doorway into another torch lit room, she didn\u2019t have a chance to do anything but brace her hands against Kerestyan\u2019s hard chest before he buried his tongue in her mouth. His palms warmed her cheeks as he held her face steady, stealing her breath with every devouring lash, every sensuous slide of his tongue. Her nipples tightened instantly. Hot shivers raced down her spine then burst across her skin, raising goose bumps in their wake.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized his hands moved until she felt him squeeze her ass and her feet left the floor. A flurry of sensations whipped through her as he pressed her back against the wall and pushed between her thighs. Her body tingled everywhere he touched her, responding to him in a way it hadn\u2019t before. She broke from his mouth and gasped for air as the hard ridge of his cock dug into her belly.</p> <p>She so owed Trinity a thousand dollars.</p><p>He stared down at her through intense blue eyes as she brushed her fingertips over his lips. She wasn\u2019t sure if the healing had affected her sensitivity somehow or if his kiss was just that incredible, but she swore her heart would pound through her ribcage at any moment.</p><p>If this was now his standard greeting, she needed to leave and come back more often.</p><p>He nipped at her fingers before his lips parted in a lazy, sexy smile. \u201cHello.\u201d He dipped his head and nuzzled into her neck, his stubble prickling her skin. \u201cYou smell different. Sweeter.\u201d His fangs scraped her throat, causing her legs to tremble around him. \u201cMore delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVouclade,\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>His heated lips curved against her skin. \u201cMy name is Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, still working to catch the breath he\u2019d stolen. As if she\u2019d ever mistake him for Vouclade. \u201cNo. Vouclade healed me. My blood\u2019s clean. No more drugs. He fixed my body, too.\u201d She shivered as his warm fingers slid up her lower back, his thumbs grazing her tight nipples as he pushed her shirt over her breasts.</p><p>He raised his head and stared at her. The flickering torches cast shadows across his gorgeous face, reflecting golden sparkles in his eyes. His hot breath scorched her lips. \u201cYou were just as beautiful before.\u201d</p><p>Logan squirmed as her mind struggled to process his comment amid the devastating assault his thumbs waged on her nipples. How could he take her from hot to strangely uncomfortable in such little time?</p><p>She squeezed his hips tight between her thighs. \u201cCan I ask a favor?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back slightly, blue eyes sharp and thoughtful. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you not say things like that to me?\u201d</p><p>His brows furrowed. \u201cYou\u2019d prefer I not compliment you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it probably sounds stupid, but every time you refer to me or to a part of me as beautiful, it makes me feel weird. I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m not sure I ever will.\u201d</p><p>His enticing lips curved into a slow, devilish smile. \u201cYou are so amazingly complicated.\u201d</p><p>She smacked a hand over his mouth. Did he not hear her? \u201cI don\u2019t walk around comparing rainbows to how I feel about you, so don\u2019t do it to me. You can tell me you want to fuck me, lick me, taste me, but you\u2019re not allowed to get poetic about it. No beautiful, no amazing, no...whatever else you manage to come up with. That\u2019s my only rule. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She barely caught herself when he pushed her legs from his waist and stepped back, dark eyes alight with something between confusion and anger. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re asking me to treat you as nothing more than a common whore. I refuse. How could you ask that of me?\u201d</p><p>She yanked her shirt down. What was it with this family and their mood swings? \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking for. And just for the record, you didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble saying those words when we were rolling around on your bathroom floor. What? It\u2019s okay to treat me like a whore when you\u2019re fucking me, but not now? What the hell?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look any more offended if she\u2019d tried. \u201cYou just told me I can\u2019t compliment you unless I\u2019m referring to touching you. That\u2019s the way a man treats a whore, Logan, not a woman he cares for. I can stand across the room and tell you I want to fuck you, but not that I think you\u2019re beautiful?\u201d He turned and stalked over to a large chair near the end of a huge, four poster bed. He sank into the dark blue velvet then glared at her. \u201cI refuse to treat you that way. If you can\u2019t accept that,\u201d he raised a pointed finger, \u201cthere\u2019s the door.\u201d</p> <p>She studied his stern face. Not only did he appear to be very serious, but at the moment he also bore a striking resemblance to Stefan, sitting there brooding in his chosen chair. Only his pale skin and gorgeous features radiated a purely seductive power over her, a sinful, unholy attraction that made her knees weaken.</p><p>Look who\u2019s waxing poetic now. She pushed the sarcastic voice from her mind. There was a difference between reacting to someone because they were hot, and because you genuinely felt something for them. Without a doubt she was attracted to the man, every nerve in her body practically sizzled whenever he touched her...</p><p>She just wasn\u2019t sure about the feelings part.</p><p>Unfortunately, that thought, combined with the hurt tinge in his eyes, caused a specific question to resurface in her mind. And although the dominant part of her didn\u2019t want to hear his answer, a small part of her needed to know.</p><p>She moved to stand in front of his chair. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>A long, oxygen thieving, heart pounding moment of silence stretched between them before he finally nodded. \u201cIn some ways, I do.\u201d</p><p>Shock dug icy fingers into her chest and squeezed her heart. That wasn\u2019t the answer she\u2019d been hoping for. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand across his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d</p><p>She took a step away from him as panic twisted inside her. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ten thousand years old, Logan.\u201d His voice was quiet but strained. \u201cFor as much as I enjoy the modern age, I\u2019ve spent a long time watching history and humanity repeat itself. Since the inception of the Veil, I\u2019ve personally seen maybe a hundred humans who\u2019ve learned of our existence. Some fought; some begged for mercy at my feet, others committed suicide or drove themselves insane with the knowledge, and four in the last decade have asked me to turn them. But never, until I met you, had one looked at me with such little regard. Never had I been treated as though I was just another commoner, another person among the many on the street. It makes me wonder, why? What have you lived that makes you so different? What triumphs? What tragedies? Why are you the way you are?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSo, it\u2019s just because I\u2019m different?\u201d</p><p>He shot up from the chair in a surge of flexing muscle. \u201cNo! It\u2019s not just because you\u2019re different. It\u2019s because after thousands of years of watching the same events happen over and over again \u2013 few humans draw my notice anymore, let alone my curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me!\u201d She jabbed a finger into the center of his chest. \u201cIf you\u2019d just give me a normal answer this would go a lot faster.\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked overtime as he glared down at her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t like anyone, anything! I don\u2019t know all the answers when I look at you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s frustrating yet strangely exciting. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve felt excitement?\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the obvious and very satisfying bulge straining against the zipper of his black slacks. \u201cYou\u2019re excited right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you!\u201d He growled, balled up his fists then splayed his fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the last time I got an erection from simply touching a woman. But seeing your face, the thought of caressing your bare skin, running my tongue across your lips, your neck...sets me on edge. I don\u2019t think you understand what that means to someone like me.\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath, trying to disregard the way each body part he mentioned tingled and warmed as if it were voice activated. \u201cDon\u2019t you have sex with the women you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have sex as a means to cover my feeding so I don\u2019t have to manipulate memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you obviously get excited then, too.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed those dark eyes and stalked towards her, fangs clearly visible between his parted lips. \u201cIt\u2019s been well over a thousand years since I found a woman, human or other, attractive enough to gain an erection without forcing it upon myself.\u201d</p><p>The closer he came to her, even as she tried to back away, the more her heart raced with the same excitement he\u2019d described. \u201cThat\u2019s not my fault. I can\u2019t help it you find me attractive for some God forsaken reason. I almost wish you\u2019d have used me as food like your brother wanted.\u201d</p><p>He laughed an evil sound when she turned before he could back her into yet another wall. \u201cIf it\u2019s my prey you wish to be, allow me to grant your request.\u201d His eyes snapped with blue fire a second before the room plunged into absolute darkness.</p><p>Logan stopped dead in her tracks. Damn him! She couldn\u2019t see anything, not even her own hand as she raised it in front of her face. Her heart pounded in her ears as she frantically tried to recall the layout of the sizable room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There wasn\u2019t much to it. A huge bed, a night table on either side, a single chair near the foot and a large armoire on the wall to her right...or was it her left? Shit! It\u2019d been on her right before she\u2019d turned to avoid being cornered. It should be in front of her now.</p><p>The door! It should\u2019ve been just a few steps behind her, but Lord only knew if that door even existed now. Kerestyan and his brood seemed to have an odd fascination for rooms with no doors, save the one\u2019s they created. But she swore there was another door next to the one she\u2019d entered through. Or was it on the wall opposite the armoire?</p><p>She fisted her hands as she took a small step back and her shoulders came into direct contact with cold, unforgiving stone. There shouldn\u2019t be a wall behind her!</p> <p>\u201cKerestyan! Turn the fucking lights back on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His deep voice echoed all around her, raising chills across her skin.</p><p>Every hair on the back of her neck stood on end as she tried to extend her senses over the room. But she couldn\u2019t feel the damn room! All she could sense, with every fiber of her body, was him. He was everywhere. His smoky, tangy scent flooded her nostrils, filled her lungs.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the vampire you want, then it\u2019s the Ancient you shall have.\u201d Rough and damningly seductive, his words rolled across her skin in a palpable wave. \u201cBut you should know,\u201d a whisper of cool air caressed her left ear, \u201cthe beast craves you every bit as much as the man,\u201d then her right.</p><p>And in that moment, she knew exactly where Kerestyan was. He\u2019d made only one move after the lights went out.</p> <p>He was the cold stone wall that shouldn\u2019t be behind her.</p><p>She shivered as his hands slid inside the neck of her t-shirt and his breath stung her ear. \u201cInstinct is all the beast has, Logan.\u201d His cold fingers curled and in one swift motion, he tore her shirt in half. \u201cEmotion...the only truth it knows.\u201d His warming fingers pinched her tight nipples. \u201cRage.\u201d He nipped then tautly rolled her earlobe between his teeth. \u201cPassion.\u201d He delivered a hot, shivery lick to the nape of her neck. \u201cLust.\u201d He dragged the tips of his fangs across her shoulder. \u201cBut one feeling stirs the beast in a way nothing else can.\u201d</p><p>Logan felt her feet leave the floor a second before her entire world spun. She fell back, sinking deep into a soft mattress as Kerestyan\u2019s heavy body crashed down on top of her. He pinned her wrists above her head, grinding his agile hips against hers as he punished her with a harsh, demanding kiss. The kind of possessive, all consuming kiss that made her whole body scream for more. She met each thrust, every wild swirl of his tongue with the same fervor, exploring each crevice, every soft, delicious inch of the flesh inside his mouth. She savored the rich, masculine taste of him, a heady mixture of rage and desire.</p><p>By the time he broke away to bite at her swollen lips, she was so wet and so ready for him, her jeans clung to her inner thighs.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you smell,\u201d he growled between sharp, teasing nips. \u201cThe feel of your body under me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pants,\u201d she breathed. \u201cGet rid of them.\u201d</p> <p>His deep laugh filled her ears as a single torch flickered to life above the bed. He stared down at her, his eyes an incredible mixture of onyx and sapphire, his lips parted in a wicked grin that showed off the razor\u2019s edge of his fangs.</p><p>Wow. She\u2019d been more than ready for him before, but the sight of him poised above her like a dark and deadly predator made her clit throb, her heart pound.</p><p>He brought her wrists together above her head and clamped a large hand around both before reaching down between them. Her stomach dipped, trembling with anticipation as he popped the button and pulled down her zipper.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She licked at his hovering lips. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He silenced her with another hard kiss before he leaned back on his knees and smiled at her. In less than a minute, the remainder of her clothing had become one with the floor and he\u2019d flipped her over on her hands and knees in front of him.</p><p>Logan grabbed two handfuls of black velvet as Kerestyan\u2019s strong hands closed around her hips, his fingers digging into her skin. He teased her with his hard cock, taunting her as he pushed the thick head between her slick lips only to pull back right before he rubbed her clit. He held her steady, resisting each time she pushed back against him. But just when she thought she\u2019d die from the sensual torture, he slowly pushed inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God...\u201d She squeezed her eyes closed. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Right there.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little more. \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d His voice was ragged, wanting.</p> <p>Before she could answer, he drove himself inside her. She gasped at the exquisite sensation of him filling her, stretching her wide. There was no pain this time, only sinful pleasure as he pulled out then slammed back into her. He moaned with her each time she thrust her ass back against him. Every time she met his hard, passionate stroke with one of her own.</p><p>She kicked her head back as her muscles began to tighten. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d She felt one of his hands slide up her spine before he tangled his fingers into her hair. \u201cOh, God, Kerestyan...\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back against his chest, using his own knees to spread her legs wide as his other arm circled her waist. His lips burned her ear. \u201cI love the way you feel, Logan. Hot. Tight. Wet.\u201d</p><p>She let out a deep moan as he tipped her head to the side. He drove his thick cock into her faster and faster, harder and harder, until she thought she\u2019d die from the dizzying rhythm.</p><p>\u201cKerestyan!\u201d</p><p>His fangs scraped her exposed neck just before she felt them sink into her skin. The intense pinch of pain was nothing compared to the white-hot bliss that coated every nerve in her trembling body. Orgasm after shattering orgasm tore through her, intensified by the slow rocking motion of his hips against hers.</p><p>Time and space ceased to exist. Kerestyan was all she knew, all she ever wanted to feel...all she cared about.</p><p>Kerestyan fell into the full throes of ecstasy as Logan\u2019s blood filled his mouth. Laced with orgasmic pleasure, the sweetest of all flavors, he savored the hot, rich liquid as it flowed over his tongue. He sucked at her soft skin, careful not to lose a single drop of the precious fluid. He\u2019d never tasted anything better, never wanted to taste anything else. Her life essence filled him with a sense of peace, a feeling of contentment he hadn\u2019t known in centuries.</p><p>Her heartbeat pounded in his ears as her body shuddered, clenching and squeezing his cock. He climaxed with her each time, pulsing hot and thick inside her. He held her tight as he slid in and out of her tight, wet body, reveling in the feel of her skin, the sound of her satisfied moans as they filled the air around them.</p><p>He swirled his tongue over her wound then stared down at her neck. Traces of his feast glowed bright crimson against her pale skin, and the animal inside him roared at the sight. It wanted more, but he knew better. If he took too much of her blood at once, he\u2019d leave her tired and woozy, and that wasn\u2019t what he wanted.</p><p>Under no circumstances was he finished with her.</p><p>He licked at her neck, gliding his fangs over her soft, succulent skin. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a contented sigh. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely spectacular. You?\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her neck then untangled his fingers from her hair. \u201cI would concur with your sentiment.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled free of his hold then moved to lie on the bed in front of him, her thighs resting on either side of where he still knelt. \u201cThat was incredible.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down into her half hooded eyes, darkened with lust. What a memory the sight of her made. Her pale skin flushed to an enticing shade of pink, her lips swollen from their kisses, her nipples tight and puckered. \u201cI would tell you I think you\u2019re incredible, but I believe that\u2019s how we found ourselves in this position...which you apparently don\u2019t approve of.\u201d</p><p>Wickedness spread across her lips. \u201cOh, I approve of the position we\u2019re in right now.\u201d She trailed a hand down between her breasts, then over her stomach and lower still. \u201cSo tell me, Lord Vampire,\u201d she moaned as she spread herself for him to see, then rubbed a finger over her engorged clitoris. \u201cHow interested are you in tasting all of me? When you\u2019re finished, can I return the favor?\u201d She wet her lips in a timeless invitation. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say something about tying me to the bed?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan growled as the animal in his stomach shifted again.</p><p>Apparently, she wasn\u2019t done with him either.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cWake up sleepyhead!\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s mind crawled out of a dreamy haze and immediately went to work on processing the excited voice, followed by the sensation of someone dropping sloppy, wet kisses on her right cheek. She opened her eyes to find a steel blue pair staring back at her, set perfectly into the huge head of a black wolf. A head that cocked from side to side for a moment before a warm, pink tongue licked a stripe across the bridge of her nose.</p><p>Well, so much for dangerous. She rolled onto her back then sat up, watching as the wolf jumped onto the bed and sat down next to her in the space Kerestyan had occupied when she\u2019d fallen asleep. She wasn\u2019t sure if she should be more concerned that Kerestyan wasn\u2019t in bed, or that the wolf was so large it sat taller than she did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wiped the saliva from her nose with the back of her hand as she eyed the creature. \u201cWere you talking to me?\u201d</p><p>The wolf shook its head back and forth.</p><p>Had she been sitting anywhere else in the world she might\u2019ve had trouble believing what she saw. However, considering she was surrounded by vampires, dragons and walls of writhing body parts, she gave in rather quickly. \u201cYou can understand me?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>She reached up and patted his head, surprised by the soft, silky texture of his fur. \u201cDo you know where Kerestyan went?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and nosed the blankets above her crotch then straightened and stared at her, tongue hanging out of his large mouth.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sure if Kerestyan was there I\u2019d know.\u201d She laughed out loud, remembering exactly what she and Kerestyan had done the night before. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>She looked up when she heard Trinity\u2019s loud laugh and the torches at the other end of the room lit themselves. \u201cKerestyan had to go back home and deal with some unruly children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Trinity nodded as she stepped through the one doorway that\u2019d been there last night, a big smile across her face. \u201cYeah, he just has to do his job.\u201d She motioned behind her. \u201cI put some shampoo and soaps in there more befitting a female.\u201d She inclined her head towards the large armoire as she approached the end of the bed and leaned against the left post. \u201cI also brought you some jeans and shirts to fit your new, shapely body.\u201d She blew a raspberry at the wolf. \u201cAnd I see you\u2019ve been properly introduced to the illustrious Mr. Syn.\u201d</p><p>Logan scrunched up her nose when the wolf licked a slobbery trail up her cheek. At least she\u2019d been correct when she\u2019d designated the wolf\u2019s gender as male. \u201cYeah, I thought he was the one telling me to wake up at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a few hundred more years and he might just be able to.\u201d She pointed at Logan\u2019s lap. \u201cBy the way, he was trying to tell you Kerestyan went home.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked down at the blankets covering her lower half and chuckled as understanding struck. \u201cI get it, like home base. Very smart, kind of crude, but smart none the less.\u201d</p><p>Trinity plopped down on the edge of the bed. \u201cSyn spends a lot of time with Odin, so you can probably imagine all the wonderful things he\u2019s been taught.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s the teacher?\u201d Logan laughed. She reached up and rubbed both of Syn\u2019s ears, to which he responded by flopping his heavy black body across her lap. \u201cDid you show Odin how to fall off the couch without hurting himself when he tries to lick his balls?\u201d She took the way he wiggled on his back and nipped playfully at her hands as the canine version of yes.</p><p>Trinity tautly slapped his large chest, filling the room with a chorus of hollow thuds and happy panting. \u201cWow, he really likes you. I haven\u2019t seen him like this for a long time.\u201d She caught his snout between her hands and kissed his nose. \u201cWhat is it, Syn? Why do you like Logan so much?\u201d</p><p>He rolled out of Logan\u2019s lap and rubbed the top of his head all over the pillows next to her. Then, without warning, he lunged at Trinity, who shrieked as she fell off the bed onto the floor with a heavy thud.</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t do anything but laugh as he bit down on one of Trinity\u2019s boots then shook her leg until he\u2019d pulled it off, sending a silver dagger skittering across the stone floor. Syn, with the dagger firmly between his teeth, jumped back up on the bed next to her and sat back down.</p><p>She was still laughing when Trinity picked herself up off the floor, grabbed her boot then reassumed her place on the bed. \u201cWell, that was unexpected.\u201d She slid her shoe back on before she pushed at Syn, who gently rested his jaw on top Logan\u2019s head.</p><p>Trinity wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He responded with a noise somewhere between a growl and a yelp then flopped back into Logan\u2019s lap. He nudged his head under her hand and let out what sounded like a sigh.</p><p>Logan scratched the beast\u2019s humongous head and looked over at Trinity. \u201cWhat the hell was all that? Were you going to kill me or something?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed as she retrieved her blade from Syn\u2019s mouth and slid it back in her boot. \u201cNo. Apparently Kerestyan told him to protect you, and he intends to do that very thing.\u201d When Syn barked, Trinity leaned forward and patted his massive paw. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do your Master proud.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared between Syn and Trinity. \u201cHe\u2019s Kerestyan\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSyn is a Servio, too. He\u2019s, damn,\u201d she peered up at the ceiling through narrowed eyes, \u201che has to be at least nine hundred years old now. Unfortunately, the city of New York has strict laws about wolves as pets, so when K took over he had to leave him here. He\u2019s usually with Odin but it would appear he\u2019s been given a duty. I hope you didn\u2019t want to go anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>Logan considered the monstrous lump of fur in her lap. She\u2019d never had a pet before, and she had to admit, even though it was probably only the silky black fur, he did remind her a little of Kerestyan.</p><p>She ran her finger over the velvety fuzz just above his nose. \u201cAre you going to follow me everywhere I go?\u201d When he nodded and licked her fingers, she smiled at him. \u201cI bet you get tired of me really fast.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and stared down at her through steely blue eyes that were unbelievably expressive for a dog. He whined a sad note then licked her chest just above her left breast before resting his head on her shoulder.</p><p>Without her even asking the question, Trinity answered. \u201cHe says you\u2019re in Kerestyan\u2019s heart, so you\u2019re in his, too.\u201d</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to that. With the realization she\u2019d made last night in regards to her feelings for Kerestyan, she felt like she should be able to smile and accept the words for what they were...but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>At least, not yet anyway.</p><p>She wound her fingers back into Syn\u2019s soft fur and focused her attention on Trinity. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan? Do I get to go wander around the castle now?\u201d</p><p>Trinity shook her head, her ponytail swinging wildly with the movement. \u201cNope. I talked to Dad earlier and we\u2019re going to skip the wandering part and go right into training. I figure you\u2019d probably like to get back to New York as soon as possible, so I\u2019ll tour you around the castle during the parts where it\u2019s a lot of me talking and you listening. That sound good to you?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. Getting her feet back on familiar ground sounded more than good to her. Not to mention who that ground lead back to. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Trinity reached out and shook Syn\u2019s tail. \u201cMr. Syn, would you be so kind as to go tell Alfred that Logan and I will take our breakfast in the courtyard, please?\u201d</p><p>He jumped up and looked between Trinity and the door, and then snapped his jaws together a few times.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou can eat with us, too. We\u2019ll meet you out there.\u201d</p><p>Syn jumped off the bed and bolted towards the wall across the room, but just before he would have clobbered himself against the stones a doorway appeared.</p><p>Logan cocked her head and stared at Trinity. \u201cThe wolf can make his own doors, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he can. And look,\u201d she motioned to the opening, \u201che even left it there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but what happens if I\u2019m in here alone and I want to get something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, the chances of Syn not being at your side are slim to none. He\u2019s about as loyal to Kerestyan as Odin is.\u201d She stood up and walked over to the armoire. \u201cSecond, if for some reason he isn\u2019t with you, a door will appear. Consider the castle a living extension of my Dad, it knows what you want and need as much as he does.\u201d She tossed a pair of jeans and a dark green t-shirt on the bed, followed by a bra, underwear, socks and a white pair of tennis shoes. \u201cAnd if for some reason a door doesn\u2019t appear, then you don\u2019t really need whatever it is you think you do.\u201d</p><p>Logan eyed the clothes. \u201cI take it you want me to get dressed?\u201d</p><p>Trinity folded her arms over her ample chest, which was propped up by a light blue corset, and then shot her a playful glare. \u201cNot yet. I want you to get your naked ass out of bed and come over here so I can turn you into a Servio. Then you can get dressed and we\u2019ll go eat the best pancakes and sausage you\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>Logan arched a brow. \u201cYou realize that isn\u2019t hard to accomplish, right? Unless, of course, they\u2019re made of New York trash, because then they won\u2019t taste any different than the pancakes I usually eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Alfred did make them out of garbage, they\u2019d be the best damn garbage cakes you\u2019ve ever tasted. Now, are you going to keep stalling, or can we do this so at least one of us can eat the greatest pancakes the world has ever known?\u201d</p><p>Busted. Logan flipped back the covers and stood up. \u201cCan I have one last meal first?\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s mouth dropped open, her face a study in disgusted jealousy. \u201cWhat the hell did Kerestyan do to you last night?\u201d She gasped rather loud. \u201cOh my God! Are those his fingerprints?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan cast a glance down her body and grinned, even as heat flared in her cheeks. On both flats of her hips there were four distinct bruises in the shape of a semi circle. And she was willing to bet, though she couldn\u2019t see them for herself, there were two more just above her ass.</p><p>But, oh, how she\u2019d enjoyed earning every single one of them.</p><p>\u201cDid he bite you?\u201d Trinity asked, sounding a tinge appalled.</p> <p>Logan looked up, grin still firmly in place. \u201cHe taught me a lesson about the cravings of the beast. And yes...there was definitely some biting.\u201d</p><p>Trinity clucked her tongue in rapid fire bursts. \u201cWell,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cat least you know how it feels to be a Neck.\u201d</p><p>Logan frowned at her. She didn\u2019t like the sound of that at all. \u201cWhat the hell is a Neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA slang term for a human a vampire feeds from.\u201d Her red lips parted in a wry grin. \u201cI bet you understand why most don\u2019t fight now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. She\u2019d gladly be Kerestyan\u2019s Neck anytime he asked, as long as he kept the poetry to an absolute minimum. \u201cYeah, you could say that. It makes all kinds of sense now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlright, enough with the girl talk.\u201d She curled her index finger at Logan, wielding the age old gesture like a professional. \u201cIt\u2019s time you become mine.\u201d A flash of concentration lit her face before her fangs elongated.</p><p>A small ripple of nausea rolled through Logan\u2019s stomach as Trinity bit her wrist, and with another focused look, blood welled up in the puncture wounds. If this were the movies, she\u2019d kick her head back now and let out a really bad laugh.</p><p>Luckily, although Logan thought she was more than capable, Trinity spared her the dramatics.</p><p>It\u2019s now or never. Logan drew in a deep breath and slowly moved towards the Dominatrix, who would soon become her Master.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Logan,\u201d she whined like a five year old. \u201cI\u2019ll be as old as Kerestyan by the time you get over here. I\u2019ll tell you what, just close your eyes and open your mouth, okay?\u201d</p><p>Logan did exactly that. She closed her eyes, opened her mouth and stood there waiting. Yes, she was being difficult. Yes, she was being a chicken. She\u2019d even agree that after living on the street for as long as she had, blood was not the worst tasting fluid in the world.</p> <p>However, even for as detached as she knew she was...the concept of drinking someone else\u2019s blood was still foreign and disgusting. She remembered health class. Diseases lived in the blood. She knew Trinity couldn\u2019t have any viruses due to the whole healing factor Vouclade said she\u2019d have herself, but still...</p><p>She squeezed her eyes tighter as Trinity\u2019s warm wrist touched her lips. The hot fluid filled her mouth in a gush, sliding down her throat with the same cold burn of alcohol. But the taste...the sweet taste wasn\u2019t anything like what came from the bottle. There was only a slight metallic tang, a small coppery hue.</p><p>Trinity\u2019s quiet voice, chanting in a language Logan didn\u2019t understand, echoed in her mind as a feverish sensation coursed through her veins. She felt a surge of power, as if the introduction of Trinity\u2019s blood into her system unlocked some long lost magic that\u2019d always been inside her. But at the same time, something dark and heavy curled deep into the pit of her stomach and made itself at home.</p><p>She opened her eyes when she felt Trinity\u2019s wrist leave her lips. Part of her was glad the experience was over, but another part, a strange and angry part, wanted to grab Trinity\u2019s bloody wrist and keep drinking.</p><p>Trinity licked her wrist, an action that shoved an unexpected spear of envy straight through Logan\u2019s gut. \u201cGive it a minute. Take a few deep breaths and let everything, for lack of a better word, marinate.\u201d</p><p>Logan followed her advice and drew in a series of deep breaths then slowly blew them out. After a few minutes, the room took on a brighter tone, filled with new and vibrant colors she\u2019d never noticed before. Her body felt strong and agile, her mind, sharp and focused.</p><p>\u201cFeels pretty good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Trinity asked.</p><p>She nodded but stared hard at Trinity. Odin had said something about a monster in his stomach. Did she have one now, too? \u201cWhat the hell is in my stomach?\u201d</p> <p>Trinity smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a discussion for a different day.\u201d She pointed at the bed. \u201cGet dressed. Then we\u2019ll go have breakfast and talk about the physical limitations of being a Servio.\u201d</p><p>Logan quickly dressed then turned around and nodded at Trinity. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and shook her head. \u201cThat was unnaturally fast.\u201d</p><p>Logan brushed off the sleeve of her t-shirt and laughed. \u201cI used to hide and wait for guests to check-out of motel rooms so I could sneak in and take a shower before the maids came around. I learned to dress and undress pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>She obliged Trinity\u2019s request and followed through the doorway Syn had made. After winding through a few hallways filled with paintings and tapestries, Trinity pushed open a set of plain wooden doors and held them open until Logan passed.</p><p>Stepping out into the warm night air had never been such a welcomed feeling for Logan. The whisper of leaves rustling in the wind filled her ears, while the same floral scents from before filled her nostrils.</p><p>She smiled as Trinity walked her over to a table set with plates and silverware. She could only imagine this was what the world looked like thousands of years ago and completely understood why Kerestyan admitted he missed it at times.</p><p>If she was him, she would, too.</p><p>She moved to take the seat across from Trinity. \u201cSo is it always night time here?\u201d</p><p>Trinity unfolded a white linen napkin and dropped it in her lap. \u201cAlways. Outside of the castle walls the sun is rising right now. Dad doesn\u2019t like the big ball of fire in the sky so he blocks it out. He\u2019s never been a fan of not being able to walk through his home at any given moment just because a star doesn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>She cracked a grin. \u201cA man\u2019s home is his castle.\u201d She relaxed back in her chair as her features sobered a bit. \u201cSo here\u2019s how it goes. The blood I feed you is what sustains your \u2018life\u2019 and power as a Servio. As soon as my blood passes your lips, it bonds to yours, since you obviously can\u2019t have more blood in your system than your body can hold. Right now, all of your blood is charged from the power of mine. But every time you call on your blood to perform feats of magic, be it running fast or picking up a car, some of my power dissolves.\u201d</p><p>Trinity picked up the glass sitting in front of her plate. \u201cBecause you seem to be a fan of comparisons, think of your body right now as a full glass of purified water. Now, let\u2019s say you decide to get up, walk into my Dad\u2019s throne room and punch him in the eye. Naturally, you\u2019re going to call on the power of your blood for speed so you can run away, right?\u201d</p><p>Logan shook her head. Had Trinity lost her mind? \u201cHell no. First, I\u2019m going to pull my fist out of the man\u2019s eye socket and apologize. Then I\u2019m going to smack myself as hard as I possibly can, and ask myself what the hell I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Trinity\u2019s loud laugh echoed all around them. \u201cOkay. But the point is, you call on your blood for speed, and even though the glass remains full the purity drops.\u201d She set the glass down. \u201cIf you ever get to a point where you\u2019ve used up all the power in your blood, you\u2019ll grow fangs and only have twelve hours to feed from me, or a vampire older than me, or you die.\u201d</p><p>Logan took a deep breath. Well that was a damn good thing to know. \u201cDo I get a warning or something when I\u2019m running low?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll be teaching you how to recognize over the next few weeks. The only real warning you get is when your fangs grow. Now, depending on how strong the bond is between us, if you pop fangs I might be able to feel it. Then, of course, I\u2019ll come get you and feed you. Try not to worry about running out of power though, because it rarely happens unless you get severely injured or just aren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any intention of stepping out in front of a Greyhound or playing Hot Potato with grenades, so I think I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be.\u201d She snickered. \u201cI mean you\u2019ll be safe, not playing with grenades. But that leads right into the next topic. Healing. If you sustain a fatal wound or internal injuries, even if you\u2019re unconscious, your body will automatically begin to heal them. If for some reason you catch a disease, the same happens. I\u2019ll be teaching you how to heal other injuries during the course of your training.\u201d She folded her hands in her lap. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s it. In regards to your physical condition anyway.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. So far, it all sounded relatively straight forward. \u201cSo then, what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>Trinity shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat breakfast, then probably wander around the castle and talk about what vampires do all night. I\u2019ll teach you about politics, how to play the favor game, how to survive in general, and how to keep yourself ahead of the competition. To be honest, the last part should be pretty easy for you considering your former lifestyle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan couldn\u2019t disagree with that. Part of successfully living on the street was keeping track of which restaurants dumped their trash when, because a well informed veteran could pick a Dumpster clean in less than a minute. Knowing which buildings were vacant but still had utilities, how often the police or gangs patrolled a neighborhood, and who called an alley their turf meant the difference between life and death.</p><p>And something deep inside told her, although the Veil raised the stakes a little higher, life as a vampire or Servio wasn\u2019t much of a departure from the life she already knew.</p><p>Logan pushed her thoughts aside and returned her attention to Trinity. \u201cWhat comes after the politics?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s really no formula, Logan. One subject just kinda leads into the next, and the next, and the next...until we cover everything. Don\u2019t worry, in two weeks time you\u2019ll be fully trained and back in New York.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure, much to your very feigned dismay, some hot guy named Kerestyan will be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>New York City</p><p>Manhattan, Upper East Side</p><p>\u201cI miss the days when your kind lived openly. You were so much easier to hunt and kill back then.\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan chuckled as Raze, his hand chosen Head of Enforcement, stretched her long, denim clad legs across the glass coffee table situated between them. \u201cI\u2019ve only been absent a few days. Is the situation really that bad?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, sprigs of vibrantly colored hair jutting from her high ponytail in all directions. \u201cYour new Fledglings are reckless, Kerestyan. They push so close to the bounds of the Veil it\u2019s only a matter of time before one of them screws up, big time.\u201d Her pale pink lips curled into a scowl as golden flecks shimmered in the air around her. \u201cAnd they\u2019re so God damned mouthy. They have no respect for my position as your Lead Enforcer, and I\u2019m willing to bet the entirety of the salary you pay me that the brainless twits don\u2019t even know what I am. Sometimes it takes everything I have not to slaughter them where they stand.\u201d</p><p>He shifted in the overstuffed chair as the animal inside him shrank back ever so slightly. Now he knew why Raze had invaded his mind shortly before sunrise, requesting a meeting as soon as possible.</p><p>Her aura only sparkled like the sun when she was angry, and she only took her God\u2019s name in vain when she wanted to rend a supernatural creature limb from limb. Some unlucky vampire must\u2019ve dug themselves firmly under her skin in his short absence.</p><p>Truthfully, Kerestyan was just glad it wasn\u2019t him.</p><p>Although she\u2019d be a more than apt opponent when it came to crossing steel, she lacked the age and experience to keep up with a vampire as old as him. He eyed the sheathed Creator Blade lying on the cushion next to her. Of course, there was the tricky matter of not being able to heal any wounds made by her weapon.</p> <p>He watched her closely as she turned a bright pink coffee mug in her sun kissed hands then blew away the steam rising from the dark liquid. As a Paladin, and an old one at that, she\u2019d been born with the holy fire to defend humanity from vampires and werewolves. However, walking in the light and blessings of her God had also bestowed upon her immortality, without restriction. No matter how much damage she incurred, she wouldn\u2019t die until the day He saw fit to allow her that peace.</p><p>Kerestyan cringed internally. At least if a day ever came when he couldn\u2019t bear to watch the world any longer, he could walk into the sunrise and be done with it. But to not have any say in her future, to not have a choice...he couldn\u2019t imagine how trapped she must feel.</p><p>Is that how Logan feels? He stiffened at the thought. He truly hoped Logan didn\u2019t feel trapped by him. He\u2019d attempted to give her every choice possible in terms of her future.</p><p>Well, except for last night. He smiled to himself. The only reason he\u2019d given her no choice then, was because she\u2019d left him with none. The woman drove him absolutely insane. If she wasn\u2019t yelling at him, she was screaming under him. And if she wasn\u2019t staring at him through haunted, distant green eyes, she was setting him ablaze with heated emerald glances and playful smiles.</p><p>Whether he was allowed to voice it or not, Logan was amazing.</p><p>The insistent clicking of Raze\u2019s shiny black fingernails against the ceramic mug pulled Kerestyan\u2019s attention back to the present. He cleared his throat and offered an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My mind drifted off.\u201d He motioned around her. \u201cWhat happened to upset you?\u201d</p><p>She arched a pierced brow. \u201cYou mean, who pissed me off?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast night I caught Craig Anderson wearing his fangs openly again at Fetish. He\u2019s worn them so often, humans have begun asking questions when he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan rolled his eyes. With his execution of the three Fledglings who\u2019d trapped Logan in her alley, Craig had, no doubt, ascended to leader of the wayward group. \u201cIs he feeding openly as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he chewing Necks in the middle of the stage? Not quite. But he\u2019s pushing the shadowed corners exception a little too hard for my tastes.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together. While he didn\u2019t blame Raze for doing her job, and certainly understood her frustration, the idea he\u2019d left Logan to talk about a low born whelp sent the animal stalking in his gut. \u201cThen either kill him or drag him to Court for judgment.\u201d</p><p>Raze tipped her head to the side and pinned him with her unnaturally violet eyes. \u201cDid you just snap at me and give me rights to kill one of your vampires?\u201d She kicked her feet down and leaned forward to set her mug on the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you lately? You old school execute Tom, Dick and Harry. You don\u2019t answer your phone for two days. You leave the city without telling me. Then you force me to break through Lord Evil\u2019s barrier to contact you mentally, both of which you know I despise with a passion. I want some answers.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThose weren\u2019t their names. And please, Raze, much as I\u2019ve asked you a dozen times before, don\u2019t refer to my Father as Lord Evil. I understand you don\u2019t care for each other but your feud has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead now.\u201d She flashed a bright but sinister smile. \u201cAnd by they, I mean the three troublemakers and your moldy Sire, who probably hasn\u2019t breathed for any reason other than to ruin someone\u2019s life in more years than I care to count.\u201d She inhaled a deep breath, which he was sure she needed after her diatribe. \u201cBut I digress. I don\u2019t care what their names are, were, will never be again. I want to know what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, Dick and Harry, as you so lovingly referred to them, died because they were fighting in a Brooklyn alley, in plain sight of a human woman. Then, when she asked them to stop so she could pass, instead of calling you for sanitation assistance, they were so caught up in the beast\u2019s fury they asked if she was a Puppet.\u201d</p><p>Raze threw her head back and let out a husky laugh. \u201cSee what I mean? They\u2019re so stupid.\u201d The amusement quickly faded from her graceful features. \u201cWhy did you take her to him,\u201d she sneered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll assume by the tone of your derision, you mean my Father. I took her to him because she\u2019d been exposed to vampires for an extended period of time. Her memories were too vivid and numerous to erase or rearrange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have me kill an Innocent?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t play that card on me, Leech. You know damn well that\u2019s not what I\u2019d have you do, but I also understand sometimes it\u2019s necessary. If the whole of humanity were to learn supernaturals exist, it would only make protecting them that much more difficult.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan snapped his mouth closed. What was it with the women in his life spouting off all manner of offensive comments as of late? \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just called me a Leech. If it means that much to you, I apologize I didn\u2019t call to let you know I\u2019d be out of contact for a few days, but time was of the essence.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just feeling out of sorts over this whole Craig thing.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWait. What do you mean time was of the essence?\u201d</p><p>He drew in then exhaled a deep breath. \u201cLogan, the woman in question, was placed under time constraints by my Father. I needed to assist her through the withdrawal process before I could take her to him, which is why I wasn\u2019t answering my phone. Honestly, I left it in my bed chamber without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>She stood and held a flattened hand below her right ear. \u201cLogan? Are you talking about the dark haired heroine junkie who\u2019s about this tall? The one with the cold green eyes that just scream she\u2019s seen too much?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan leaned forward. \u201cThat would be a fitting description. How do you know her?\u201d</p><p>Raze lowered her hand, hesitation flickering behind her lavender eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve run into her a couple times in Brooklyn. She\u2019s been on the streets for a long time. Did Stefan turn her?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what concerned him more. The fact that Raze seemed to know Logan; or that she actually called his Father by his given name. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. Logan\u2019s been remanded to Trinity, as her Servio. Why do you ask?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you so interested?\u201d Her usually whisky voice rose an octave.</p><p>Kerestyan stood up and stepped over the coffee table. \u201cI happen to care a great deal for Logan, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so interested.\u201d Without thinking, he let his eyes burn into hers, but gnashed his teeth when the golden Paladin haze glittered around her, blocking him from accessing her mind. \u201cWhat do you know, Raze?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicked to the blade resting at the end of the couch before she met his stare again. \u201cWhat do I know? I know I\u2019m not getting involved in anything with your Father\u2019s bloody signature all over it. That\u2019s what I know.\u201d She jammed a claw into the middle of his chest. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you ever do that shit to me again. I\u2019ll forgive you this time because I can see that blasphemous beast stalking behind your eyes. But don\u2019t you ever try to read me with your cursed magics again.\u201d</p> <p>He watched, rage simmering in his blood as Raze dropped down on the couch. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact she liked to blame everything bad happening in the world on his Father, he\u2019d put more stock in her words. However, their hatred for each other had bloomed thousands of years ago when his Father still called Naples, Italy home, and had only grown through the ages.</p><p>Kerestyan returned to his chair and sat down. Whether she despised his Father or not, he knew he owed her an apology for his thoughtless action. \u201cI apologize for attempting to read your mind, especially in your own home. It goes against everything I was taught, and I truly am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She set the blade across her lap and picked at the frayed golden strands braided around the sheath. \u201cI accept your apology. No harm, no foul.\u201d She chewed at her bottom lip for a moment before offering him a faint smile. \u201cI like you, Kerestyan, you know I do. You and Odin are the only Nelek\u2019s I\u2019d ever consider working with. But I told you when you asked me to be your Enforcer that I wouldn\u2019t get involved in anything my gut told me was part of a Nelek game. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s exactly how this feels.\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head to one side then the other, stretching out the tight muscles in his neck. Part of the reason he\u2019d chosen Raze as his Lead Enforcer was because of her gut feelings. The Paladin\u2019s propensity to be correct was uncanny.</p><p>He stared into her eyes, hoping she would answer his question. \u201cCan you at least share why you feel that way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could...but I won\u2019t. If I do, that puts me right in the mix and I\u2019m just not gonna go there. If I were you, I\u2019d go back to the Castle of Doom and talk to your Daddy.\u201d</p><p>If it were only that simple. He slowly shook his head. \u201cI was only allowed to stay with Logan until sunrise, which given the time difference between New York and Chicago, was about fifteen minutes ago. I can\u2019t return to the castle until her training is complete.\u201d The corner of his mouth rose of its own accord. \u201cI\u2019ve been banned.\u201d</p><p>Raze giggled a purely feminine sound and burst into a wide smile. \u201cYou must really like her if you\u2019re not allowed to be around her. How long do you think her training will be? Is she coming back to New York when it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He wouldn\u2019t stand for anything less. \u201cYes, she\u2019ll be returning. Trinity asked my permission to station Logan here and I granted the request. As for how long her training will last, Trinity, even for all her idiosyncrasies, is still rather thorough. I expect to see Logan in two weeks, maybe three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to say, Kerestyan, I\u2019m a little surprised.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged a bronzed shoulder then adjusted the strap of her white tank top. \u201cI always pegged you as a lover of the curvy, voluptuous blond types. You know, the sexy chick with intense blue eyes and an ass to die for. Logan doesn\u2019t even come close to fitting that bill. I would think she\u2019s more Odin\u2019s style.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan couldn\u2019t help but laugh, loudly. If Raze had the pleasure of watching Logan and his brother in childish action, he was sure she\u2019d change her mind. \u201cLogan and Odin don\u2019t get along, at all. I\u2019m certain they\u2019d rather strangle each other than have a friendly conversation.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched up her nose. \u201cReally? I figured trying to crack her cold, icy demeanor would be right up his alley.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOh, well. So much for my holy powers of precognition,\u201d she smacked a hand against the couch, \u201cwhich brings me back to the original reason I wanted to talk to you. What would you like me to do about Craig and his gang? As much as I hate to admit, they haven\u2019t breached the Veil, yet. So by your own law, I don\u2019t have any right to kill them, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I to infer you\u2019re simply biding your time until you have ample reason to slay them?\u201d</p><p>Her face sobered. \u201cNo, no, Lord Kerestyan. Of course not.\u201d She leaned forward and grinned as she motioned between them. \u201cBut between me and that sliver of you that isn\u2019t the Lord of New York, I can\u2019t wait to rip their heads off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they irritate you that much?\u201d</p><p>She relaxed and stared off at something behind him, her eyes clouded with a weariness he knew all too well. \u201cSome of your Fledglings have a lot of potential. I won\u2019t ever deny that. They treat everyone around them, even the humans, with respect and dignity. But this new gang,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching them on and off for the last couple months and they\u2019re just abusive. They gorge themselves on blood and have damn near killed a vessel on a couple occasions. They lord their powers over the humans, messing with their minds to make them perform stupid, demeaning tricks. They make me sick.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan inhaled a calming breath. He didn\u2019t approve of the way some Fledglings treated the humans of New York City, but at the end of the day, he had no choice but to remind himself the modern world was a completely different place than it was when he was turned. Honor and integrity were prized in his day. Even in death, valor and virtue were paramount.</p> <p>Now, it seemed the opposite was considered and accepted as normal.</p><p>As much as he wanted to agree with Raze, he couldn\u2019t in good conscience. His species, by its very existence was innately abusive to humans. And in a time when even humans fought and killed each other for no more than a pair of running shoes, he couldn\u2019t forbid his Fledglings from engaging in any activity, degrading to humans or not, unless it threatened the Veil.</p><p>He caught Raze\u2019s wandering eyes. Unfortunately, her honesty only brought another problem to the already difficult situation. \u201cIf you witness Craig or one of his followers kill a vessel during feeding, in a situation which doesn\u2019t rend the Veil, will you be able to stay your hand?\u201d</p><p>She held his probing gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Kerestyan. I honestly don\u2019t know. If it were anyone but them, I know in my heart I could. To be as dramatic as possible, I feel the urge to rain down righteous fire damn near every time I see them. But, thus far, I\u2019ve refrained. I promised you I\u2019d only cull those who upset the balance or were hideously violent. And, as much as I hate to admit, these ten vampires are punks, who couldn\u2019t upset the balance of the eight million humans in your city if they tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think you should keep your distance for a time. Have your team keep an eye on Craig and his pack. If they commit any action that breaches the Veil, contact me immediately.\u201d He stood up and rolled his shoulders. \u201cI hold court in nine days. I\u2019ll address the treatment of the humans and my displeasure at learning there are those among my residents who\u2019ve been abusive in their dealings. If all goes well, Craig will make a fool of himself during the meeting and in return find his brethren rather unsympathetic to his cause. Perhaps when those Fledglings who do hold power in the city turn their backs on him and his group, they\u2019ll end up with no where safe to sleep and seek their fortune elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Raze chuckled and flashed an evil smile. \u201cYou\u2019re such an iron fisted tyrant. How do you live with yourself?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan laughed. There was only room for one tyrant in his family. \u201cI\u2019ll agree to strict and sometimes unyielding, but I\u2019m no tyrant. I have one rule, and if the Fledglings can\u2019t abide by something as simple as the Veil, their life is forfeit. I refuse to allow my very existence to be put in jeopardy because an ill begotten child can\u2019t clean up after themselves.\u201d</p><p>She patted the blade still resting across her thighs. \u201cI\u2019m with you. I just don\u2019t discriminate based on age. I\u2019m equal opportunity.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll be at my home or the Estate. I\u2019ll also make sure I have my phone with me since I know how much you adore speaking via telepathy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, yeah. It makes me wet just thinking about it.\u201d She smiled then blew him a kiss. \u201cBy the way, I hope everything works out for you and Logan. Leech or not, you do a damn fine job of keeping this city running smooth. You deserve to go home to someone who makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Raze.\u201d</p><p>When she waved, Kerestyan returned the gesture then closed his eyes. He concentrated on his penthouse, but as the cold winds began to swirl, he found himself wondering if maybe there wasn\u2019t a shred of truth to Raze\u2019s paranoid words. What if his Father did know more about Logan\u2019s situation than he let on? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if she was just another piece on the immortal chessboard?</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Day 4 of Servio Training</p> <p>Nelek Castle</p><p>Logan shrieked like a five year old who\u2019d angered a swarm of killer bees as Trinity chased her across the polished wood floor of the training room. She didn\u2019t care if she sounded like a schoolyard sissy. The bitch had been trying to punch her for the last five minutes, and under no circumstances did she think becoming one with Superwhore\u2019s fist was pertinent to her survival as a Servio.</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d Trinity\u2019s exasperated voice echoed through the expansive room, bouncing off the plain white walls. \u201cStop running. You need to learn how to fight. You can\u2019t live in New York City without knowing how to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>Logan glanced up at the wall of mirrors across from her, only to see Trinity gaining on her. \u201cBullshit! I\u2019ve lived there all my life and I never got attacked. Not even by another homeless person. This is crap. I didn\u2019t sign on for getting my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I promise I won\u2019t punch you. Just stop running.\u201d</p> <p>She slowed when Trinity\u2019s reflection stopped pursuing her, but turned around and kept moving backwards. \u201cSomething tells me not to trust you.\u201d</p><p>Trinity rolled her black eyes. \u201cIf I really wanted to catch you, I\u2019d call on my blood for speed and mow your ass down. You\u2019re four days old. Do you really think you can get the drop on me?\u201d She didn\u2019t leave time for an answer. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s a very important reason why I need to hit you.\u201d</p><p>Logan huffed out a breath and picked up the pace. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just promise you weren\u2019t going to hit me?\u201d</p><p>She flashed a wicked smile. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll keep my promise. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Before Logan could even reconcile the flash of black leather and tanned skin, pain exploded in her stomach and she found herself with a perfectly unblemished view of the ceiling. She squeezed her eyes closed and rolled onto her side, clutching her white cotton t-shirt to her abdomen.</p><p>It was a damn good thing she hadn\u2019t eaten dinner.</p> <p>\u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t punch you,\u201d Trinity laughed somewhere close by. \u201cI never said I wouldn\u2019t kick you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch,\u201d Logan groaned. She should have known to listen to Trinity\u2019s exact words. They\u2019d spent the last three days discussing vampire society and politics, and how the words a vampire or Servio chose could mean the difference between great success on an endeavor and abysmal failure.</p><p>She\u2019d had no idea vampires were such ruthless, selfish, backstabbing bastards. The meanest, most corrupt CEO in the world didn\u2019t have shit on a well-trained vampire. And the sharpest lawyer in New York couldn\u2019t find as many loopholes in a set of rules as one motivated member of the undead race. The sheer amount of power a single vampire could wield over an entire city was startling.</p><p>If anything, she\u2019d fallen asleep last night rather content in her choice to give up drugs and learn about what really went on around her all those nights she\u2019d spent on the street.</p><p>Logan grimaced as another wave of nausea washed over her. Of course, right now she didn\u2019t really appreciate the knowledge.</p><p>She sat up and opened her eyes for no reason other than to glare at Trinity. \u201cWhat the hell did you kick me for?\u201d</p><p>Trinity frowned. \u201cBecause we\u2019re at the point where I need to teach you about the beast, and usually the best way to get the little monster riled is through inflicting pain. But it doesn\u2019t seem to work on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Logan coughed. \u201cIt just hurts and makes me want to puke.\u201d</p> <p>Trinity extended a manicured hand. \u201cCome on, get up you sissy.\u201d</p><p>Logan knocked her hand away and crawled to her feet on her own. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked before you decided to obliterate my spleen, I\u2019d have told you Odin and Kerestyan already explained a little bit about the beast to me.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cWell, if anyone would know, it\u2019d be them. What all did they say?\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed a hand over her upset stomach. \u201cOdin said it\u2019s the predatory side of a vampire that craves blood, power, and loves watching humans do things they shouldn\u2019t. Kerestyan said the beast is pure instinct and only knows emotion.\u201d</p><p>Trinity nodded. \u201cThat pretty much sums it up. It\u2019s different for every vampire, and even more so for Servios. Your beast will never be as pronounced as mine, but it lives in the blood, and since you have vampiric blood in your body you get to have one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like it\u2019s a present.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThe beast isn\u2019t bad.\u201d She tipped her head from side to side. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not all bad. If a vampire gets too much stimulation, be it from extreme emotions or injury, or sometimes even blood, the beast takes over and they attack and try to eat everyone around them. The younger a vampire is, the harder it is for them to control the beast, but the older a vampire is the more destruction they can cause.</p><p>\u201cServios are the same, it just takes a lot more provocation to get their monster riled. Oh, and anytime you hear a supernatural say monster, animal, predator, goblin, or pretty much any word like that, they\u2019re referring to the beast.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled as the image of a little green goblin flashed in her mind. She could almost see it ripping out of her chest like some kind of alien and chasing people down the street with a Spork. \u201cI think I\u2019ll call it the goblin.\u201d When Trinity frowned, Logan rolled her eyes. She\u2019d seen that particular look a lot over the last three days, too. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d She raised her hands in mock surrender. \u201cThis is another serious piece of information and I need to treat it that way. I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I know your detached ass finds some of this funny, and it\u2019s okay, as long as you understand this life isn\u2019t always fun and games. I know Odin and I make it seem that way, but we\u2019ve adapted really well to the modern world. Not all vampires and Servios have.\u201d She motioned around them. \u201cSome of us get stuck in a time period we really liked and refuse to let go. I love my Dad, I really do, but he\u2019s a prime example of someone who won\u2019t take well to your humor about parts of our condition that have literally toppled entire empires.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at her. She couldn\u2019t be serious. \u201cToppled empires?\u201d</p><p>She nodded rather sharply. \u201cAncient history, and not the kind you read about in a schoolbook some human wrote, but the kind I was there to see with my own eyes...is chock full of disasters caused by a vampire who lost themselves to the beast. Rome fell at the hands of an Ancient Warrior, which is the old term for a Thug, who went to sleep for two hundred years then woke up and got so pissed about how the city had changed in his absence, he flipped his lid and destroyed it. You don\u2019t even wanna know how many humans died under his fangs.\u201d</p><p>Logan lowered her eyes and studied where the black fabric of her running pants covered the top of her tennis shoe. For the first time since her training had begun, she felt kind of small and a little stupid. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. I just want to make sure you understand, much like your life on the street, immortality isn\u2019t all roses. I\u2019ve practically stuffed you full of information over the last few days, and you\u2019ve done a really good job absorbing it all, even when you\u2019re laughing so hard water shoots out your nose.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook her head and smiled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault you decided to use the phrase \u2018testosterone driven penile fever\u2019 to explain why Kerestyan\u2019s body is cold one minute and hot the next. If you\u2019d just said some of his human body functions kick back in when he\u2019s aroused, the water would\u2019ve never gotten into a position where it could shoot out my nostrils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you asked,\u201d Trinity laughed. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you had a clear understanding of what was going on. Like I said, any vampire worth their salt can will their heart to beat and make their body warm back up to 98.6. Doing so uses a lot of the blood\u2019s power, but it\u2019s a great way to keep the Veil intact. Look at it this way, if you make Kerestyan so hot that the beast does it for him, he can just grab your ass whenever he needs to have a heartbeat and save himself the blood.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned her back to Trinity when heat flamed in her cheeks. While she wasn\u2019t at all ashamed of anything she\u2019d done with Kerestyan, being teased about their exploits was still new for her. Hell, having someone to do those kinds of dirty things with, let alone someone around her long enough to tease her about them, was strange in its own right.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Are you blushing? I didn\u2019t think it was possible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Trinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Logan. Don\u2019t close up on me,\u201d her voice was more serious now. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with missing Kerestyan. I know it\u2019s foreign to you, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. If we\u2019re lucky, it happens to the best of us.\u201d</p><p>Logan slowly turned around. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. It feels wrong, like it\u2019s not me.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest as an odd sensation tingled through her. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s some other person inside me, and I don\u2019t know who she is or what the hell she wants from me. I can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop trying.\u201d Trinity offered a reassuring smile. \u201cYou\u2019re immortal now. You have all the time in the world to learn about who you really are. Nine times out of ten, over the next few months, you\u2019re gonna learn a lot of things about yourself you didn\u2019t know before. Believe it or not, that\u2019s one of the good sides of the beast.\u201d She tapped her stomach with a flattened hand. \u201cYour goblin will let you know what\u2019s good for you. You just have to decide if you listen.\u201d</p><p>The clatter of heavy footsteps and rhythmic clicking filled the air as Logan opened her mouth to respond. She snapped it shut and watched as Syn burst through the doorway leading back to the main hall with Odin hot on his heels.</p><p>\u201cSyn! Get your ass back here!\u201d</p> <p>She nearly fell over as the wolf skidded to halt next to her then pushed between her legs as if he were a horse. He pinned his ears back as Odin approached, displaying every sharp tooth he owned as a menacing growl vibrated against her legs.</p><p>She glared at Odin. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>Odin looked absolutely appalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t do shit. I was trying to keep him out of the training room since I knew Trin was doing some combat with you, but the bastard won\u2019t listen.\u201d He pointed down at Syn. \u201cI\u2019m telling Kerestyan you\u2019re being difficult. And I swear to Christ, the next time you boost a bone from Dad\u2019s chair, I\u2019m gonna let him skin you.\u201d</p><p>Syn snapped his massive jaws together and growled again.</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Odin could paint the greatest picture with just a few crude words. So vivid and so damn funny, she was sure if he wasn\u2019t such an asshole they might actually get along.</p> <p>Might.</p><p>She reached down and scratched Syn\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Syn. I won\u2019t let the Greek God of War hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorse!\u201d Odin boomed. He stabbed a finger in her direction. \u201cI told you, Greek\u2019s are pussies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Trinity yelled. \u201cI\u2019m Greek.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, but there wasn\u2019t a shred of sincerity anywhere to be found. \u201cSorry. But I\u2019m right and you know it. All those columns everywhere, it\u2019s like they were compensating for what wasn\u2019t in their pants.\u201d He clapped his hands together. \u201cSo what are we learning about? Do I need to take the mangy mutt elsewhere?\u201d</p><p>Trinity rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not even worth arguing with you.\u201d She shook her head in the same manner Logan often did when faced with Odin. \u201cLogan and I were discussing the beast.\u201d</p> <p>Logan finally stopped laughing. \u201cThe goblin.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his fingers and pointed at her in the shape of a gun. \u201cGotcha. Did you freak out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She backed away from Syn, who was still between her legs, then moved to stand next to him. \u201cTrinity kicked me in the stomach, but all that did was make me feel sick.\u201d</p><p>He cast a devilish glance to Trinity. \u201cWant me to give it a shot? I bet I can get her to go.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared between them. \u201cDo I really need to \u2018go\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know what it feels like when the beast takes over,\u201d Trinity advised. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s different for everyone. If you know how the beast affects you and what kind of sensations it causes, then you can try to stave it off. The last thing I want is for you to be on the street in New York when it happens the first time. If you lose control and break the Veil,\u201d she paused to whistle, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see K put in that kind of situation.\u201d</p><p>Logan stiffened at her words. She didn\u2019t want to see Kerestyan put in that situation any more than she wanted to be in the situation. \u201cOkay,\u201d she looked over at Odin, \u201chave at it.\u201d</p><p>He laced the fingers of both hands together then pushed back on them, filling the quiet air with a series of cracks. \u201cThis might just be therapeutic. You ready?\u201d</p> <p>She drew a deep, fortifying breath. \u201cNot really, but I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at Syn. \u201cGo over to Trinity. This is for Logan\u2019s betterment and will only help Kerestyan. You stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Syn let out a long whine but lumbered over to Trinity, who\u2019d moved to stand about ten feet away, and then plopped down next to her feet.</p><p>Logan stood still as Odin began to circle her, like he was some wild bird of prey and she was nothing more than an injured field mouse.</p><p>His lips curled into a snarl as he passed in front of her for the third time. \u201cYou\u2019re a dirty street waif who isn\u2019t worth the skin you\u2019re printed on. You\u2019re selfish. Detached. Disinterested. You\u2019ve probably walked away or stood by and watched as some innocent person got hurt or abused, and chances are, you didn\u2019t feel a damn thing while it was happening.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow at this feeble attempt. \u201cYou might want to try harder. Being called names doesn\u2019t bother me, and considering how long I lived on the street, your last dig is a given.\u201d</p><p>The malicious smile that spread across his lips was unsettling at best. \u201cI\u2019m just getting warmed up.\u201d He walked around her again, and then stopped to stare into her eyes. \u201cMy brother, the only man I would go to war for and protect with every cell in my undead body, the man who\u2019s given you more choices than he was ever given, deserves better than you. He deserves someone who knows what honor is, someone who understands what it means to believe in something with all their heart.\u201d Disgust set into his familiar features. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a heart.\u201d</p><p>Logan steadied herself as an odd shifting sensation spread behind her belly button. She clenched her jaw tight and stared right back into his blacked out eyes. His words stung like a thousand dirty needles, but she refused to let it show. She should\u2019ve known this was the tactic he\u2019d use, but under no circumstances would she give him that victory.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what love is,\u201d he spat at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t even recognize the purest of all emotions. Kerestyan looks at you as though you\u2019re the most precious treasure in this world. And you,\u201d he paused to look her over, \u201cyou stare at him through your cold, dead eyes, as if he\u2019s just another drug to you.\u201d</p><p>She forced the words through her teeth, \u201cKerestyan is not my drug.\u201d</p><p>He sneered. \u201cYes he is. You use him for what he can make you feel, and then you discard him as though he\u2019s nothing more than a used syringe.\u201d</p><p>Logan winced as fire erupted in her blood. Crimson fell over the room like a sheer curtain. Shadows danced like obsidian flames around Odin, taunting, beckoning her to strike out.</p><p>Reaching out with both arms, she shoved him back. \u201cI would never discard him. You don\u2019t know how I feel about him.\u201d As the sound of his laughter reached her ears, the dark essence building inside her grew larger, filling her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you lie there like an icy statue in his arms, and he feels it. Kerestyan feels your indifference and it tears him apart every single time. Does knowing you fill him with pain make you happy? Do you get some kind of sick pleasure out of knowing you can bring an Ancient to his knees? If one of his enemies comes knocking on your door, will you lure him into your arms so they can hold the blade to his throat? Or will you do it yourself? How long will it be before Kerestyan dies because of you?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes closed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to him!\u201d She struggled for a breath, but the air felt too thin, too light to sustain her.</p><p>\u201cYour words are nothing but lies from the lips of a woman who can\u2019t even be honest with herself. Lies,\u201d the hiss of his cold breath stung her cheek. \u201cMy brother loves you...and we both know what you do to people who love you.\u201d</p><p>The moment his last words broke over her, something in Logan changed. She felt the stranger inside her burst to life, felt the odd sensation of someone stepping into her, as if her body, her skin, was nothing more than a coat.</p><p>Her mind raced at the same frantic pace as her heart. Memories flashed behind her eyes as though she was staring through the windows of a speeding subway car. Her greatest moments of happiness merged with her darkest nightmares. Whispered voices from her past and present came from all directions, converging into a deafening scream before all but one fell silent.</p><p>\u201cKerestyan, an honorable knight imprisoned inside the very armor which holds and protects him.Odin, a fierce warrior leading droves of men to their death because the rage inside him inspires nothing greater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no better.\u201d Logan heard the words leave her own mouth, but her voice was twisted, filled with a quiet rage. She opened her eyes and stared up at Odin through the scarlet fog. \u201cHow many times did you lead your own brother into a battle that could have killed him? How many nights did he lie broken on a bloody battlefield because of you?\u201d She narrowed her eyes on him. \u201cIs it me who doesn\u2019t deserve Kerestyan\u2019s love, or is it you?\u201d</p><p>A glassy haze claimed Odin\u2019s black eyes.</p><p>In the space of a single heartbeat, the stranger who\u2019d taken control of Logan dissipated, leaving her with only one instruction. RUN!</p><p>She took off like a gunshot, heading for the doorway to the main hall as an angry, thundering roar shook the floor beneath her. She heard Trinity scream the same warning her mind had given just as she broke past the doors and into the hall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fear like she\u2019d never felt before coursed through her body, pushing her legs faster and faster until the stone walls of the hallway were nothing but dark blurs.</p><p>Without giving it a second thought, for better or worse, she cut right and pushed through the blackened doors then flew across the black marble. She ran up the stairs, and didn\u2019t stop moving until all she could see was the wall of ivory bones that made up the back of Stefan\u2019s throne.</p><p>She sucked in mouthful after mouthful of cold air, attempting to catch her breath as the muscles in her legs throbbed a spiteful rhythm.</p> <p>\u201cI assume you now understand what you perceived to be a stranger inside you, is in fact your beast?\u201d Stefan asked. His usually serious voice was filled with no small hint of amusement.</p><p>Stupid goblin has a death wish. \u201cYeah, I got that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide, Logan. In his current state, Odin will not follow you here.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve argued she wasn\u2019t hiding, but considering her crouched position...yeah. She stood up and shook out her legs as pain burned the muscles in her thighs. Stepping around the throne, she smiled as the sound of happy panting touched her ears. She turned her head to find Syn sitting at the bottom of the stairs, his big, pink tongue hanging out the side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Stefan said as he plucked a large bone from the side of his chair then tossed it down to Syn. \u201cYou\u2019ve successfully completed the third part of your testing.\u201d</p> <p>She arched a brow. Mostly because of what he\u2019d said, but partly because of the way Syn\u2019s bushy tail swished back and forth as he chewed on what was probably someone\u2019s thigh at one point.</p><p>She focused her complete attention back on Stefan\u2019s hollows. \u201cI\u2019m being tested?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThere are four parts. Part one was you realizing in order to progress, you had to regress, and in turn release the vice withholding your success. Part two was your acceptance and understanding of why your physical body needed to reflect the new life you\u2019ve embraced. Part three,\u201d the corners of his mouth raised a bit, \u201cwas becoming one with your true self, and learning the beast is not a separate entity, but a reflection of baser truths and desires.\u201d</p><p>Logan sighed. She couldn\u2019t argue with anything he\u2019d said, but she wasn\u2019t exactly pleased to learn she was jumping through invisible hoops.</p><p>At least he told you. That creature doesn\u2019t owe you any explanations. She stiffened at hearing the new voice in her mind. No longer twisted and angry, the voice sounded more like hers, but with a slightly sharper edge.</p><p>Stefan\u2019s faint smile lengthened. \u201cWhen the beast is calm, always carefully consider the words she chooses to speak. Even when she\u2019s enraged, take comfort in knowing she still speaks a version of the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Logan smiled at him. Although Stefan was more than a little scary, especially because of his lack of eyes, there was something about the calm delivery of his words that made it hard not to listen...and something even more compelling about the wisdom behind them.</p><p>She considered him for a moment, her smile still in place. \u201cSo, what\u2019s part four?\u201d</p><p>He gave a warm but equally as unsettling chuckle. \u201cEnlightenment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. However, I will tell you that your mother was nearly correct. Diamond strands cocoon every being in this world, including a creature such as myself. Yet the question is not, where do the threads lead you? The question is, who do your strings lead back to?\u201d</p><p>Logan shivered as a chill slid over her and goose bumps rose through her skin. \u201cLet\u2019s not go there. I\u2019m still reeling from learning how duped the humans are. How many unwitting CEO\u2019s are in the pockets of vampires, and just how many politicians are backing plays they think are their own, but aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He actually laughed a rather loud and hearty sound. \u201cPerhaps in time you\u2019ll be more prepared to discuss such topics.\u201d He turned his head away from her a little as his jaw hardened back to that line of unforgiving stone. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She followed his line of view to the left edge of the expansive platform the throne sat on, just in time to see Syn, who stood next to a black pedestal with a large chessboard sitting atop it, lowering his hiked back leg.</p> <p>Stefan extended a large, metal covered arm and pointed at the doors. \u201cGo outside.\u201d</p><p>She tried to stave it off when Syn snorted in their direction then trotted off towards the huge black doors, but she couldn\u2019t. \u201cOf all the problems for someone like you to have,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought house training would be one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d his deep grumble reverberated in her chest. \u201cOdin, and that damn wolf, will be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>It took a good two minutes for Logan to stop laughing. She wiped the tears from her eyes and cast a glance back over to the chessboard. Now that she wasn\u2019t distracted by the sight of Syn preparing to defile it, she noted one spot on the board cast a subtle red glow.</p><p>She started down the steps, but stopped and turned back towards Stefan. \u201cCan I go look?\u201d When he nodded his permission, she continued down the stairs and made her way to the side of the board.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she stood right next to the pedestal that she realized the pieces were intricately carved to look like different people. Most were fashioned from obsidian glass or ivory, but the two with the scarlet light shimmering around them were unbelievably lifelike in color.</p><p>A tall, platinum blond woman wearing a red cat suit stood on a squared base made of ivory, and a shorter woman with dark hair and Spanish features stood in jeans and t-shirt on a circular obsidian base.</p><p>Unlike all of the other pieces on the board, the blond and brunette shared the same black marble space.</p><p>Logan shifted her gaze back to Stefan. \u201cWhy are there two in the same square?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are in play, competing for the space.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow at him as the goblin in her belly curled into a warm little ball, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, let out what felt like a strangely contented purr.</p><p>Stefan descended the staircase and in a few powerful strides moved to stand at her side. \u201cAre you familiar with chess?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She\u2019d spent time on sunny days at different parks in New York watching people play on the worn, washed out boards. Some of the homeless were known for being Master chess players, but she wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI know the basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules are very similar to the game of strategy you were familiar with as a human. However,\u201d he plucked the Spanish woman from the board and handed her to Logan, \u201cmy pawns have far more to lose than a space.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared down at the piece in her hand. \u201cYou play with people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI present supernatural creatures with obstacles,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMy opponent and I arrange the circumstances, but in the end, the pawns choose their own path. Their decisions and the consequences of their actions determine the amount of time they grace the board.\u201d He motioned to the ivory likeness of a man dressed in robes. \u201cLucien, my gentle yet misguided brethren, has stood proud on this board for thousands of years.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the dry knot forming in her throat. She remembered Vouclade telling her how old vampires manipulated young vampires, but she couldn\u2019t imagine someone who\u2019d been on the board for \u2018thousands of years\u2019 being considered a young vampire.</p><p>But then again, Vouclade was twice as old as Kerestyan, and Stefan was probably a lot older than Vouclade.</p><p>She stared between the Spanish woman and the other people on the board. \u201cDo they know? I mean, I\u2019m sure they all know about manipulation...but do they know you actually have them on a board, like a real game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do. However, she,\u201d he removed the Spanish woman resting in Logan\u2019s palm and placed her back in the shared space, \u201cdoes not. She is but a Fledgling, and far too young to know the Nelek name.\u201d A proud smile crossed his face. \u201cBut I have great faith in her, much as I do in you. She\u2019s faced adversity, but where you chose to embrace the darkness inside you, she clings to her humanity, wielding her refusal to accept the beast as a weapon to regain all she\u2019s lost.\u201d</p><p>Logan gave the board a long, hard look before she focused back on him. \u201cDo my strings lead back to you like theirs do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned and made his way back to his chair, stopping only to retrieve Syn\u2019s forgotten bone before he climbed the stairs and sat down. \u201cI stopped manipulating the circumstances of humans long ago. To mimic Odin\u2019s very modern and crude manner of speech, it\u2019s just not fair.\u201d His face hardened again as a chorus of laughter drifted into the stone chamber. With a sharp swipe of his mailed hand, the chessboard and pedestal vanished. \u201cDrake, what brings you to my home this evening?\u201d</p><p>Logan wheeled around as the laughter lightened. Trinity, looking a little worse for wear, Odin, whose eyes weren\u2019t glassy anymore, and a large, mountain of a man with long dark hair and golden skin, walked across the floor and stopped at the foot of Stefan\u2019s stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man she assumed was Drake flashed a wide grin just as lopsided as Odin\u2019s. \u201cI popped in to see if Odin wanted to get a drink with me, but the fucker was all crazy eyed and he punched me. I wanna know what you\u2019re gonna do about it?\u201d He clutched a hand to his massive chest. \u201cHe\u2019s offended me greatly.\u201d</p><p>Stefan\u2019s face softened, rather remarkably. \u201cThank you for not ending my Child where he stood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Odin laughed as he smacked the back of Drake\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll get no reparations from the old man. He\u2019s stingy as all hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you showed up, Drake,\u201d Trinity said, casting a glance over Odin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I could hold him any longer.\u201d She shot Stefan a playful glare. \u201cThanks, Dad. Your favorite almost tore my arm off.\u201d</p><p>The faint clank of metal against metal sounded as Stefan shrugged. \u201cI was engaged with Logan. We were discussing the beast and Odin\u2019s successful failure in regards to provoking hers. However, if nothing else, I believe both of you are now painfully aware of how much you have in common, including your concern for Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>When Odin gave Logan the come hither finger, she hesitated. She agreed with Stefan, it was more obvious than ever that Kerestyan meant something to both of them, but she wasn\u2019t about to walk right into the arms of the enemy.</p><p>\u201cChrist, woman, I just wanted to tell you I\u2019m sorry. The whole point was to get you pissed off so you could meet your beast.\u201d He raised an arm and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d fire back and get to meet mine.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a small smile. She could go the rest of her life without meeting his again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you flipped out. I wasn\u2019t trying to make you...it just...happened. It was like all of a sudden I knew exactly what to say.\u201d</p> <p>Odin sighed. \u201cThat you did. I just wish I could\u2019ve gotten you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did succumb to her beast,\u201d Stefan interjected. \u201cBut due to her nature, as she is not a physically combative person, her attack was fueled by her keen perceptions and discerning mental acumen.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled and pointed at Odin. \u201cYeah, what he said.\u201d</p><p>Another chorus of laughter erupted in the chamber.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Drake said, looking up at Stefan. \u201cI just stopped by to say hi. It\u2019d be rude to come into your home and not acknowledge your presence.\u201d He stepped over to Logan and extended a huge hand, attached to a muscular arm littered with tattoos and jagged scars. \u201cLogan, I\u2019m Drake. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. Keep up the good work.\u201d He winked one of his bright, sapphire blue eyes. \u201cKeep getting under Odin\u2019s skin, the bastard needs it. I\u2019d stay and get to know you a little better, but I need beer.\u201d He let go of her hand and turned to face Odin. \u201cYou coming or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p> <p>Drake dropped a kiss on Trinity\u2019s cheek, saluted Stefan, waved at her, and then walked away with Odin closely behind him.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to get some dinner with me?\u201d Trinity asked. She wagged her eyebrows and sang the words, \u201cAlfred is making lasagna.\u201d</p><p>Logan rubbed a hand over her stomach when it growled at the mention of food. Alfred was a hell of a good cook, and the man was determined to add five pounds to her frame before her training was over. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Trinity nodded before she turned and headed for the doors.</p><p>Logan shifted her gaze back to Stefan once Trinity\u2019s footfalls faded. \u201cWhy did you take away the board when they came in? Is it a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to any who bear the Nelek name.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want Drake to see it?\u201d</p><p>His face took on a dark and very serious countenance. \u201cOnce again, while each of us may be surrounded by diamond threads, I assure you not a single one of Drake Black\u2019s strings lead back to me...nor will they ever.\u201d When he punctuated his sentence by waving her towards the doors, Logan vacated his chamber without another word.</p> <p>The whole \u201cstrings\u201d concept made her uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t like the thought of being manipulated at every turn, especially by someone who most likely had their own best interests in mind. But the thought left her, and the goblin in her belly, with one pressing question...</p><p>Who the hell did her strings lead back to?</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>The Estate</p><p>New York City</p><p>Manhattan, Midtown</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan scowled down at Craig, who simply shrugged his leather clad shoulder in response to Raze\u2019s question. \u201cA member of this city, in good standing, claims you killed two of her Servios last night. I suggest you find your tongue.\u201d</p><p>Craig pushed his shaggy blond hair out of his eyes and shrugged again. \u201cShe don\u2019t have no proof it was me. Besides, it ain\u2019t against your rules to kill a Puppet.\u201d He sat forward in his chair and made a strange backwards nodding gesture. \u201cDid somebody get it on camera? Cell phone video? Anybody call the cops? Was the Veil broke?\u201d He sat back. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan drew in a breath, calling forth as much patience as he possibly could. In situations like this he agreed with Vouclade\u2019s comments about the ignorance of Fledglings, especially those turned in the last decade. And the watery, metallic tang rolling off of Craig\u2019s skin told him the Child wasn\u2019t more than a few years old.</p><p>\u201cYour idiotic exploits have the humans asking questions, Craig!\u201d Raze shrieked. \u201cHalf the God damn patron\u2019s at Fetish think you\u2019ve had porcelain fangs permanently affixed to your disgusting little face. You may not have broken the Veil last night when you waxed Stacey\u2019s Servios, but in my opinion, you break it every single time you walk out your front door with your fangs openly showing!\u201d</p><p>Craig rolled his eyes and sneered at her. \u201cWhen was the last time you was down at the clubs? I ain\u2019t the only one sportin\u2019 fangs. The humans wear \u2018em, too. You gonna starting charging them with breakin\u2019 the Veil? You an your crazy hair gonna make \u2018em take \u2018em out?\u201d He blew out a loud breath through the side of his mouth. \u201cPuh-leeze.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan slammed his hand down on the table in front of Craig. \u201cEnough with the street slang!\u201d He stepped around the table and sat down opposite the irritating youth. \u201cYou aren\u2019t from the streets. You were born in Manhattan, into a rather affluent family. You received the best education money could buy. You can speak proper English.\u201d</p><p>Disgust twisted with disbelief on Craig\u2019s narrow face. \u201cAlright, you want proper English,\u201d he sat up straight and pulled at the lapels of his black biker jacket, \u201cI\u2019ll give you proper English. The only rule you\u2019ve instituted in this city is the Veil. Even if I did kill Stacey\u2019s Puppets, which I don\u2019t admit to doing, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d He narrowed his eyes. \u201cThey weren\u2019t the first Puppets to get killed by a vampire in this city. It\u2019s happened before.\u201d He motioned to Raze. \u201cYou didn\u2019t send your colorful Head of Enforcement out to kill or question Stacey when she killed one of my people. So why am I here?\u201d</p><p>Raze smacked him in the back of the head with her sheathed blade. \u201cYou\u2019re here because you\u2019re a fucking idiot.\u201d Her violet eyes landed on Kerestyan, but her words echoed in his mind. \u201cCan I just kill him? Please? I\u2019m using telepathy...that has to show you just how bad I want to run my sword through his stupid ass.\u201d</p><p>As much as Kerestyan wanted to let her, and as difficult as it was to deny he wanted to do the very same, he had no choice but to give the answer. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as much as I hate to admit, he\u2019s correct. Neither of us lifted a finger when his servant was killed, as I have no rules concerning the destruction of vampires or Servios. If we take action against him, it will be seen by the youth as heavy handed and unjustified.\u201d</p><p>Craig cleared his throat rather loudly. \u201cI know you two are talking with your minds. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little rude in front of a guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? You know damn well it\u2019s just a matter of time before the little ass-hat breaks the Veil. How much slack are you going to give him?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan smiled at Craig, who may have sensed the use of telepathy but had no idea what was being said. \u201cAs much as it takes for the Child to hang himself. Then his death will be justified, within my laws, and you\u2019re welcome to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling at me?\u201d Craig turned and looked behind him at the French doors then back to Kerestyan. \u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m pretty or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to wait until he actually breaks the Veil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kerestyan raised an eyebrow for Craig\u2019s benefit. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are you smiling at me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Kerestyan?\u201d Raze smacked Craig with her blade again. \u201cDon\u2019t curse at the Lord of New York. Show some damn respect, Leechling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Craig bared his fangs at her and hissed, as though he\u2019d seen far too many modern movies. \u201cIf you hit me with that thing again, I\u2019m going to respect the hell out of you.\u201d He snapped his teeth together. \u201cLay off, Angel.\u201d</p><p>Raze stiffened and stared down at Craig as golden flecks burst around her, knocking him and his chair over. \u201cYou know what I am?\u201d She drew her blade and leveled it at him. \u201cYou know what I am, and you dare tempt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaze, don\u2019t you dare make an action against him. Under no circumstances do I wish to demean your authority in front of him, but I will if you force my hand.\u201d</p> <p>Craig crawled to his feet and took a few steps back, his lips curled. \u201cI know what you are. Like Lord Kerestyan said, I received a good education...and not just in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour education obviously wasn\u2019t thorough enough.\u201d She lowered her blade and slid it back into the scabbard. \u201cI suggest you go back to your Sire and request more training.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stood placed himself between the young vampire and the very angry Paladin. \u201cCraig, I suggest you mind your future actions. Making enemies with the Head of Enforcement is never a wise decision.\u201d</p><p>He leaned to the side and glared at Raze again before he laughed. \u201cIn this city it is. She can\u2019t do anything unless I break the only rule.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan growled as the beast uncoiled and his fangs broke free. \u201cConsidering her words carry more weight in this city than yours, should she come to me and admit she ended your life because she witnessed you feeding in plain view at Fetish, I will believe her.\u201d</p> <p>Fangs gone, Craig rolled his shoulders and attempted to hide the fear ebbing from his body. \u201cSo it\u2019s gonna be like that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been like that for ages!\u201d Kerestyan roared. \u201cPerhaps you should tuck your tail and run back to your weigh-blooded Sire. You were obviously absent the night she chose to teach the intricacies of vampiric politics.\u201d He raised an arm and pointed at the doors. \u201cLeave my sight.\u201d</p><p>To the Fledglings credit, he did exactly as instructed.</p><p>Kerestyan returned to his chair and sank into the dark leather. \u201cWhy do they do that? Why can\u2019t they just behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to tell myself it\u2019s because they don\u2019t know any better,\u201d Raze offered as she walked over and righted Craig\u2019s overturned chair. \u201cBut I think it has more to do with the fact that this new breed of modern Fledgling just doesn\u2019t care. They think they\u2019re the top of the food chain. They seem to forget their Sire\u2019s all came from somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He motioned to the door again. \u201cHe has enough education to know you exist.\u201d</p> <p>She dropped into the chair across from him. \u201cI know. He caught me off guard for a second there.\u201d She tilted her head and twisted her fingers around a neon blue spike of hair. \u201cBut I suppose, as much as I\u2019d like to think otherwise, most vampires, even the dumb ones, pass on to their Children that Paladins exist.\u201d She flashed an evil smile. \u201cAfter all, we do live to kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does Vouclade, but I don\u2019t hear his name echoing through the hallowed halls of courts the world over.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, her whisky voice filling the large room. \u201cThat\u2019s because Vookie doesn\u2019t let anyone, regardless of age, live long enough to share.\u201d</p><p>As he joined her in laughter, Kerestyan felt his fangs retract. \u201cSo what exactly would you like to do with Craig?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed in a disapproving manner. \u201cForget him for a minute, what am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Fangs. What the hell is up with you?\u201d She kicked her unnecessarily bright, lime green boots onto the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quick to go primal all week. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He considered her five inch spike heels for a moment, which he was sure not only doubled as a weapon but put her only inches from standing as tall as he did. \u201cYou have a very strange array of footwear.\u201d</p> <p>She wiggled herself straight and smoothed the front of her black t-shirt, which had the German words \u201cDas Ich\u201d scrawled across it in letters the same color as her boots. \u201cAnd you\u2019re really bad at changing the subject.\u201d She bounced her right leg on top of her left as she beamed a prying smile. \u201cIs it Logan? Is she why you\u2019ve been all pissy? Do you miss her? Do you looooove her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Raze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. No old style \u2018hold your tongue, wench\u2019? You must have it bad if you\u2019re going to modern dialect. You only do that when you don\u2019t think before you talk, which isn\u2019t often, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand down his face. Considering that ordering Raze away rarely worked, which she\u2019d proven by dragging Craig to his feet even though he\u2019d asked her to keep her distance, he thought it best to answer her childish question. \u201cYes, if you must know, I find myself missing Logan. However, from what Trinity tells me, she\u2019s doing very well and is even excelling in her training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\u2019m sure just tickles your naughty bits,\u201d she playfully growled.</p><p>Truthfully, knowing Logan was far surpassing even his Father\u2019s expectations tickled Kerestyan in more than the places Raze had mentioned. The knowledge filled him with such a strong sense of pride and contentment, he found his beast quick to lash out any time those feelings were disturbed.</p><p>He also found it difficult to believe Logan had only been gone a week, and even more difficult to accept he cared so much for a woman he\u2019d only known for the span of ten days.</p><p>Don\u2019t question the past, revel in the future. Kerestyan smiled at the thought. How many times had his mind whispered those words? He\u2019d heard the quiet whisper the night he became a vampire and had heeded the same wisdom ever since.</p><p>All he could do was hope Logan wanted a place in his future. Trinity mentioned during her brief report that Logan had admitted to missing him, but had also shared the feeling was foreign and she didn\u2019t appreciate it very much.</p><p>He\u2019d give the woman two hundred years if that\u2019s what it took for her to realize she cared about him as much as he cared for her. Immortality, while he\u2019d never claim it was a perfect existence, offered all within its dark tendrils the luxury of time.</p><p>And considering his advanced age, not only did he intend to be around for another ten thousand years, but he had every intention of dragging Logan right along with him, even if she kicked and screamed the entire way.</p><p>The insistent snap of Raze\u2019s fingers brought Kerestyan back to the present. \u201cEarth to Space Leech. Does it tickle you or not?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan frowned. Such odd names she seemed to pluck out of thin air. \u201cYes, it pleases me. It also sounds as though Trinity intends to release her in a few days time.\u201d</p><p>Her lavender eyes opened wide. \u201cReally? Damn, she must be doing well then. If there\u2019s one thing I know about your Daddy, he doesn\u2019t let anyone out of the Walls of Dread until they\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan nodded at her compliment with a dash of insult. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinct reason why no Paladin blade has ever tasted Nelek blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pick at me,\u201d she warned. She circled her head with a finger, pointing out the golden halo still shimmering around her body. \u201cYou know damn well if I was born in the same generation as Lord Evil, I\u2019d skewer him.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even bother correcting her on his Father\u2019s name this time. \u201cTruthfully, I\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow, which boasted yet another new piercing. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBecause then you\u2019d be a threat to me, and in good conscience I couldn\u2019t allow you to work here, which means you wouldn\u2019t have the money to put so many holes in your body.\u201d</p><p>She patted the blade resting in her lap. \u201cI can put a hole in your body if you\u2019d like. Or perhaps you\u2019d like me to carve Logan\u2019s name into your chest?\u201d She licked her finger and made a hissing noise as she touched her own chest. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be a sexy way to show her you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d much prefer should you need to use that blade on anyone, it be Craig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only I could.\u201d She sighed a wistful note. \u201cAs tempting as your scenario sounded, you know I won\u2019t lie to kill him. The minute I start pulling those kinds of treacherous, backstabbing maneuvers, I become no better than your kind.\u201d She raised a hand and bowed her colorful head. \u201cNo offense, Lord Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d He stared past her at the French doors leading to the dark streets of New York City. His city. If there was one trait every vampire seemed to acquire upon being turned, it was the capacity for treachery in some form.</p><p>He turned his attention back to Raze. \u201cHave your team keep an eye on Craig and his group. I have an odd feeling it\u2019s only a matter of time until he commits to some kind of purposeful action we won\u2019t be able to ignore.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Day 9 of Servio Training</p><p>Nelek Castle</p><p>\u201cWhat are the rules?\u201d</p><p>Logan ducked Trinity\u2019s leg as it came at her face. \u201cNo attacking each other in the castle. No killing each other period.\u201d She jumped back to avoid a leather clad knee to the gut. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything that interferes with or compromises a Nelek\u2019s influence or control over a person or a city. Love and loved ones are never to be used as weapons.\u201d She smiled as she leaned back just as Trinity\u2019s fist whizzed by her face. \u201cAnd the unspoken but most important rule, carry Midol to counteract the moodiest of the Nelek Children.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trinity ceased her assault and smiled wide. \u201cVery, very nice. At least you have the defense part of combat down. Now, follow me.\u201d</p><p>Logan did as instructed when Trinity turned and headed for the doors leading to the main hall. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the enchanting Nelek library. I have one last morsel of information to feed you before I release you back into the wild.\u201d</p> <p>Logan stopped and stared at Trinity\u2019s lace covered back. The vampiress had better not be messing with her. \u201cYou\u2019re sending me back to New York? Today? Or is this a morsel that takes three days to explain?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cYes, today, but you\u2019ll only get there slower if you don\u2019t move your feet.\u201d She snapped her fingers over her shoulder. \u201cChop, chop, my little servant.\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t help but smile. The excitement coursing through every cell in her body made it easy to catch up with Trinity\u2019s long strides. \u201cYou\u2019re not playing a joke on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped, sounding almost offended. \u201cI know how hard you\u2019ve been working and I know exactly why. I\u2019m not about to dangle Kerestyan in front of you like a carrot. See number four on the rules of Nelek Decorum.\u201d</p><p>Logan rolled her eyes. \u201cI care about him. I\u2019m not ready to start tossing around the L-word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou call the warm feeling in your chest right now whatever makes you comfortable and I\u2019ll call it what it really is. In the meantime, I need your brain focused on what I\u2019m about to show you, got it?\u201d</p><p>She ignored Trinity\u2019s reference to knowing how she felt, which she didn\u2019t, and nodded. She\u2019d pay attention to whatever the Dominatrix wanted as long as it put her on a train back to New York. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as the clicking of claws against stone filled the air as they passed Stefan\u2019s chamber. Only a few seconds passed before she felt a cold nose and warm tongue nuzzle into her hand.</p><p>Unless she was in combat training, Syn had maintained his position at her side, day and night. He\u2019d even found it necessary to sleep next to her in Kerestyan\u2019s bed and snuggle up against her as if he were trying to fill his Master\u2019s shoes.</p><p>She reached out and scratched the top of his head. He also snored like a banshee and had a bad habit of rolling over on her, which she hoped weren\u2019t traits he and Kerestyan shared.</p><p>Well, at least the snoring part. If Kerestyan wanted to roll over on top of her, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d put up much of a fight.</p> <p>While she couldn\u2019t claim to love the man, over the last week she\u2019d come to accept she cared about him. And for her, the realization had been rather difficult considering she hadn\u2019t cared about anyone but herself for a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cHere we go!\u201d Trinity exclaimed as she pushed open two heavy wooden doors. \u201cThis is the most complete library of information about supernatural creatures, our societies, and true history that the world has ever known. Or not known, depending on who you are.\u201d</p><p>As Logan stepped into the room, her mouth gaped open. She\u2019d expected a lot of books when Trinity said library, but nothing like this. Twice the size of a football field and easily three stories tall, the room was wall to wall books. And for what didn\u2019t fit on the walls, free standing shelves created a maze at either end of the huge room, breaking only for the dozen tables and chairs positioned in the center.</p><p>She followed Trinity through the twists and turns leading to the far right wall where the bookshelves in the center separated to allow space for a mural. A dozen panels roughly six feet by two feet hung in a row, and while each was painted with a different scene, together they created what appeared to be a timeline.</p><p>Trinity stopped in front of the first panel on the left then spun on her heel. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think you need to know this, but Dad holds strong to the notion you have to know your past before you can find your future. So, keeping in mind I\u2019m only doing this because he insisted, pay attention. I\u2019m gonna move fast, okay?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. Fast worked for her. She was certain there was a lot to learn from the paintings, but the tingles still racing inside her wanted to get back to New York as quickly as possible. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Trinity pointed to the blurry, golden image of what appeared to be a man. \u201cThis is Aligon, the being most humans worship as God, Allah, Buddha or whatever name each religion uses. Much as they believe, he created the earth. He\u2019s a Celestial, which is a heavenly body comprised of the purest magics in the universe.\u201d</p><p>She splayed her index and middle fingers between two figures, a young man and a young woman, who both stood in front of Aligon. Long hair flowed past the woman\u2019s shoulders, painted in every earth tone Logan had ever seen. She wore a blue robe as bright as the sky, and her strikingly beautiful face was drawn in a smile.</p> <p>The man\u2019s hair was long as well, but was pitch black and framed a glowing white face. Dressed in black robes, his eyes were an odd silvery color and his lips formed an angry line.</p><p>\u201cThis is Semeliel, Aligon\u2019s daughter, and Levanael, his son. They\u2019re twins. The opposite kind as you can probably see, and they\u2019re very important to this story.\u201d</p><p>Trinity stepped over to the next panel, which depicted Aligon setting the earth in his children\u2019s outstretched hands. \u201cAligon gave the world to his kids as a gift then told them to use their magics to make it reflect the best of themselves. Semeliel gave the world the sun and flowers and trees and all the good stuff. Levanael gave the world the moon and created mountains and fire and ice and all the not so good stuff. When the kids were finished messing with things, Aligon was so happy, he created humans to inhabit the earth his brats had done so well with.\u201d She stared over at the next panel then huffed out an irritated breath. \u201cScrew it.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t have much choice but to follow when the obviously peeved vampiress snatched up her arm and dragged her back so they could see the entire mural. \u201cI take it you don\u2019t like giving this lesson?\u201d</p><p>Trinity shook her head and released Logan\u2019s elbow. \u201cNo,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cThis story pisses me off every time someone brings it up.\u201d She clapped her hands. \u201cSo for the rest of it, we\u2019re gonna rock the Cliff Note\u2019s version. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>When Logan nodded, Trinity crossed her arms over her chest and gave the mural a disgusted glare. \u201cOnce humans got dropped into the mix, the twins couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. They kept adding little perks here and there. Like Sem, who gave the humans animals to live with. But Lev didn\u2019t like the way the humans loved his sister\u2019s animals, so he gave man the desire to kill animals for food, clothing and whatever else they could do with the pieces. At that point, Sem got ultra pissed and banished her brother from the world when her sun was in the sky, to which Lev responded by casting her out when his moon was in the sky.</p><p>\u201cEverything was fine until a group of human farmers got mad when bad weather ruined their crops. So,\u201d she rolled her eyes then stared up at the ceiling, \u201cthey looked up at the sky and said, \u2018Why the hell do you hate us?\u2019 Lev heard their cries and, lo and behold, six farmers ended up at his feet. They promised to worship him if he gave them some of his magic, so he accepted the deal, named his new followers the Children of Shadow, and then sent them back to their human tribe where they wreaked havoc on their hunter rivals.</p><p>\u201cSix hunters turned around a little later and committed the same stupid action the farmers did. They stared up at the sky and said, \u2018What the fuck?\u2019 Only this time Sem heard them, then did the same thing her brother had done. She packed their little bodies full of magic, named her followers the Children of Dawn,\u201d she finally stopped looking at the ceiling and shook one of her fists, \u201cand then sent her hunters back to unite the tribe. Can you guess what happened?\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed out loud. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see where this was leading. \u201cUm, they stared a war?\u201d</p><p>Trinity nodded rather emphatically. \u201cFuck yes, they did. The tribe split into three factions. Children of Dawn, Children of Shadow, and all the humans who refused to take sides were called Innocents. Now,\u201d she ran over to the fifth panel, which depicted Semeliel standing with her six chosen on one side and Levanael standing with his six on the other, then pointed to one follower on each side, \u201cthese two, who picked opposite sides...were married!\u201d She flicked the follower standing on Semeliel\u2019s side. \u201cAnd this chick was pregnant!\u201d She returned to Logan and smiled. \u201cRemember that little tidbit. It\u2019ll be important at the end of my rant.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded at her. \u201cI got it. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So, where were we?\u201d Trinity sucked in a deep breath. \u201cOh, yeah, the tribe is at war. Basically, there are conflicting reports on which twin acted first, but I was taught it was Levanael who struck the first blow. He was so livid his followers hadn\u2019t conquered the whole of the tribe that he cursed the Children of Dawn to become half-kin to the beasts they loved so much. Semeliel turned around and cursed her brother\u2019s followers to be forever denied the sun. Lev responded by cursing Sem\u2019s kids to always fight with each other the way animals do, and then Sem removed Lev\u2019s kids ability to subsist off of anything the land provided, including animals.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trinity took a step back and grinned wide. \u201cBut here\u2019s where Lev kind of edges his sister out, in my opinion. Instead of tossing back another curse at her followers, he gifts his own with fangs. Why, you ask?\u201d She batted her long eyelashes. \u201cSo his children can drink the blood of the Innocents and his sister\u2019s followers. Very smart, if you ask me...and such a vampire style maneuver. But anyway, Sem came back and cursed Lev\u2019s children to live for eternity and be sterile. Then Lev gives his kids the ability to pass their magics onto others through rituals of blood, and also makes it so their blood and magics grow more powerful with age. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s when the curses stopped and Semeliel finally gave her own kids a perk. She decided that her sun would be deadly to Levanael\u2019s followers, and if the flow of energy between the brain and the body was interrupted on a Child of Shadow, she\u2019d pull them from the immortal coil. So there you have it, vampires and werewolves.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared between the wall and Trinity. \u201cWow. That\u2019s a hell of a Cliff Note\u2019s version.\u201d</p><p>Trinity flashed another grin. \u201cYeah, but now we get to the good part.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. By this point, the twins were so pissed off at each other and screaming so loud, they got their daddy\u2019s attention. Aligon looked down at the world and was so disgusted by the position his brats had put the Innocents in, being caught between two damned races and all, that he pulled the twins out of the world and lectured them for literally eons. During which,\u201d she brushed the backs of her fingers up her chest then rolled her hand forward, \u201che bestowed Paladins upon humanity.</p><p>\u201cOnce a generation, a human is born with the righteous fire burning inside them to defend the Innocents. They\u2019re blessed with shreds of Aligon\u2019s magic, and are the only true immortals because they don\u2019t die unless Aligon says so. Trust me, we\u2019ve tried to kill Zealot Paladins and they just don\u2019t die. But luckily, most Paladins follow the way of Balance, which means instead of killing any supernatural creature they come across, they watch and judge each individual based on their actions. Just remember, Zealots are bad, Balance is good.\u201d</p><p>Logan drew a deep breath. \u201cZealots bad, Balance good. I got it.\u201d</p><p>Trinity inhaled an even larger breath than before. \u201cSo basically it ends like this: While Aligon had the twins out of the world, with the help of his Paladins humanity rose up and pushed vampires and werewolves to the fringes of society. And that mass destruction led to the inception of the Veil, which was roughly seven thousand years ago. Now we all hide from the humans, carrying out the twin\u2019s rivalry every single night, and every single day. But remember the pregnant chick I pointed out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Trinity walked over to the last panel, which showed the form of a large man whose face was mostly covered by shadows, and gazed up at it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long ago Aligon created the world. I don\u2019t know for sure how old the Original six vampires are, or even who they are. But I know that no more than a few months passed between Semeliel adopting her followers and when the curses were levied, because he,\u201d she reached out and traced a finger over the man\u2019s darkened face, \u201cwas born as both a vampire and a werewolf. Legend states that Aligon named him the Equilibrium, and then gifted him the power to destroy both cursed races and the twins who damned him to his fate, with nothing more than a thought.\u201d She finished the last sentence in a quiet voice, brimming with different emotions.</p><p>Logan joined Trinity and stared up at the rendering. The longer she studied his shadowed features, the more the man in the painting resembled the large beer lover who\u2019d introduced himself as Drake.</p><p>She cast a sideways glance to Trinity. \u201cDoes this picture make you sad or something?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWerewolves have a beast, too, which means this poor guy has two animals inside him. And since werewolves and vampires hate each other with an innate passion, I can only imagine no matter what he puts off, he\u2019s constantly at war with himself.\u201d She backed away from the wall. \u201cHe\u2019s part of the reason why I hate this story so much. The vampire side of me hates knowing there\u2019s someone out there who can end my life with such ease. I\u2019ve worked hard to get where I am, to live as long as I have and adapt so well to the modern world.\u201d She tipped her head to the side and gave a faint, sad smile. \u201cBut the woman in me still feels for the guy. He was born with a thirst for blood and the desire to kill anything that isn\u2019t natural. Considering half of him is undead, and that ain\u2019t natural...I think you see my point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cHe looks a little bit like Drake.\u201d</p> <p>Trinity whirled around and began winding back through the maze of shelves. \u201cHe does, doesn\u2019t he. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t push. She nodded ascent to the voice in her mind then hurried to catch up with the moody Nelek Child. She followed her back to the middle of the room where Syn sat atop one of the large oak tables, happily panting away.</p><p>Logan walked over to him and ruffled the silky fur covering his head. \u201cI have one last question, Trinity.\u201d</p><p>Trinity crossed her arms over her chest and arched a tentative brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the twins? You said vampires and werewolves carry out their rivalry, but where are they? Are they still outside the world?\u201d</p><p>Trinity puffed out a breath, looking more than a little relieved. \u201cOnce the Paladins cleaned house, Aligon put the twins back in the world and bound them to it. They don\u2019t have near as much power anymore and can only use the little they do have when their \u2018sphere\u2019 is in the sky. They can\u2019t talk to each other, they can\u2019t see each other, and if you believe the stories, they can\u2019t even talk to Aligon anymore. Nobody knows who they are, and if they do they aren\u2019t talking...so life goes on.\u201d She cast a glance to the door. \u201cAre you ready for your life to go on?\u201d</p><p>Logan eagerly nodded. \u201cLet me go get my stuff.\u201d</p><p>Trinity raised a hand as Logan started to turn towards the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to. Odin moved your clothes this afternoon. All you have left to do,\u201d she shifted her gaze to the lump of black fur on the table, \u201cis say goodbye to your shadow.\u201d</p> <p>Logan smiled as Syn stood up, licked her cheek, and then rested his heavy head on her shoulder. Truthfully, she would miss the supersized fuzz ball. Even though he\u2019d been given an assignment, and one he\u2019d performed dutifully, he\u2019d become more of a friend than a bodyguard. He listened intently anytime she needed to vent about how strange the beast made her feel, he nodded along as though he knew exactly how she felt, but was more than happy to bark or knock her off the bed when he disagreed.</p><p>She reached up and smoothed the fur down his back. \u201cI\u2019ll make Kerestyan come visit you more often, I promise.\u201d She gently tapped her finger against his cold nose. \u201cDon\u2019t teach Odin any more bad habits, and don\u2019t piss on anything in Stefan\u2019s chamber.\u201d</p><p>Syn nodded and licked her cheek again before he nosed her towards Trinity. He barked one last time then jumped off the table and trotted out the door.</p><p>Logan stared after him for a moment. Never, not even in her wildest dreams, did she ever think she\u2019d be abducted by vampires and walk out in the end as an immortal whose best friend was a wolf.</p><p>But then, she supposed it was better than picking through trash and spending every single day alone.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Trinity said as she curled a finger at Logan then extended her hand. \u201cI have to be touching you to take you on the windy rollercoaster ride. Fasten your seatbelt and hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>Logan grimaced. \u201cYou people need to invest in cars.\u201d She moved to stand next to Trinity and reluctantly took her hand. \u201cThis windy brand of teleportation makes me sick every time.\u201d</p><p>Trinity made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a snort. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t bother you as much anymore. Your blood has a natural affinity for \u2018windy teleportation\u2019 now. Just think, in a few hundred years you\u2019ll be able to concentrate on any place in the world and go there in record time. The only stipulation is that it has to be a place you\u2019ve been before.\u201d</p><p>Logan closed her eyes and groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but this is the only place outside of New York I\u2019ve ever been. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be teleporting myself to Tahiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Logan, you should really get out more.\u201d</p><p>When the wind picked up around them and the floor dropped out beneath her feet, Logan realized one very important truth about Trinity Nelek: She was only right half of the time.</p><p>The only feeling that wasn\u2019t the same about the last the trip she\u2019d made between Chicago and New York, aside from the fact she didn\u2019t have two strong arms around her, was that the bile from her stomach stayed in her stomach.</p><p>She still felt nauseous. Her abdomen still cramped and twitched. And she still felt the same strange sensation of being sucked into icy oblivion.</p><p>She gulped a mouthful of lavender scented air when the hard texture of a floor rose up to meet her feet. She waved both hands at her face, promising with every frantic swish she would use the money Trinity paid her for her service to buy a damn car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next time she had to go to Chicago, her ass would be pulling up to the little white house guarded by rottweilers in a shiny metal box (as Odin liked to call them) stamped with Ford or Buick.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to your new apartment.\u201d</p><p>Logan opened her eyes to see Trinity\u2019s smiling face, standing in the middle of a living room very reminiscent of the one in Kerestyan\u2019s penthouse only much smaller. It had the same couch, same television, and even the same style tables with bright green plants setting atop them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a two bedroom, one of which I had turned into an office for you, but I think all the furnishings suit you. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive. Just functional, comfortable and meant to be used. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Logan walked over to the couch and sank into the supple leather. \u201cI think...\u201d She swept her gaze over the room, realizing for the first time since she was fifteen, she had a place to call her own. Not a boarded up warehouse. Not an abandoned building crawling with rats and insects. Not even a beautifully dark castle filled with Ancient relics, some of which talked and others that didn\u2019t. But a place where a thirty year old woman could start over, could leave her past behind and find her own future. \u201cIt\u2019s almost perfect.\u201d</p><p>Trinity flashed a mischievous smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact he has to attend Court in an hour and a half, I would\u2019ve draped Kerestyan\u2019s naked ass across the couch for you myself. However, something told me if I dropped you on him before Court, the Lord of New York would miss his own meeting.\u201d</p><p>Logan chuckled at that. At least they were on the same page, although she would\u2019ve been more than happy just to sit down and talk with Kerestyan for a little while. \u201cWhen do I get to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get to see him at Court, but you\u2019ll get to talk to him afterwards. Remember the directions I gave you from here to the estate in Midtown?\u201d</p> <p>She chuckled. \u201cYou mean the same estate that someone cleverly named, the Estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one, you little smartass. Anyway, Lawrence should be stopping by,\u201d she cast a glance to a large, wrought iron clock hanging on the wall, \u201cin about fifteen minutes. You\u2019ll have about an hour to chat and get to know each other, and then he\u2019ll take you to Kerestyan\u2019s Court.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, even though mild disappointment settled in her stomach. Lawrence was one of Trinity\u2019s oldest Servios, and from what she\u2019d been told, the guy she\u2019d be working with to maintain Trinity\u2019s businesses in the city. However, he wasn\u2019t the man she wanted to spend the next hour talking to.</p><p>She reluctantly forced a smile across her face and tried to banish Kerestyan from her mind, at least for a little while. \u201cIs there anything else I need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlfred stocked your kitchen and bathrooms, which you have two of. The keys to your apartment, an envelope containing all your legal documents plus five grand in cash, and your new cell phone with mine, Alfred and Lawrence\u2019s numbers preprogrammed, are out on the kitchen counter.\u201d She motioned over her shoulder to the hallway behind her with a puzzled look on her face. \u201cAnd I guess Vouclade also sent some thirty different toothbrushes for you and a bunch of toothpaste?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s all about, but I assume it\u2019s some kind of inside joke between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>Logan tipped her head back against the cool leather and laughed. Only Vouclade would be so evil. \u201cYeah, you could say that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave that between you two. I guess the only thing left is to let you know you need to meet up with Lawrence at Fetish tomorrow night, no later than 9:00 PM. He\u2019ll get you acquainted with the staff, and then start teaching you the ropes of managing one of New York City\u2019s most popular nightclubs.\u201d There was no small amount of conceit in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Is he picking me up here?\u201d</p><p>She flashed that grin again. \u201cNo. I told him you\u2019d meet him at the club. I have this odd feeling you won\u2019t be sleeping in your own bed tonight.\u201d</p><p>Logan shivered as a tingle of anticipation worked through her. \u201cNot if I\u2019m lucky.\u201d</p><p>Trinity blinked and kept her eyes closed for a moment. \u201cOn that note, I think I\u2019ll go let Kerestyan, your luv-aire, know you\u2019re back in town. I\u2019ll stop in at the club tomorrow night and check on you. Good luck at Court.\u201d She brandished a pointed index finger. \u201cPay close attention to what Kerestyan has to say to his residents, and more than anything, watch how the Fledglings react to him and each other. I think you\u2019ll learn pretty quickly why someone like Vouclade has such a rough time with the youth. I\u2019m also willing to bet you\u2019ll be just as appalled.\u201d</p><p>Logan refused to take that bet because she was fairly sure Trinity was right. She stood up and smiled at her favorite Dominatrix. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. And thank you for everything, Trinity. I wouldn\u2019t be here right now if it wasn\u2019t for you and I want you to know I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said as a breeze cut through the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been everything I expected...and more.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at the empty space where Trinity had been and smiled. In less than two hours she\u2019d be standing in front of the man who\u2019d chosen \u201clife\u201d for her before she\u2019d made the decision herself.</p> <p>What would she say? What would he say?</p><p>Nervousness crawled up her spine. It\u2019d taken almost a week to realize she cared for him, but what if something had changed for him during that time? What if she saw him again and the goblin in her belly disapproved?</p><p>Stop. He\u2019s good, I can tell. She chuckled out loud. Great. Her beast was quoting lines from Disney movies. How messed up was that?</p><p>She\u2019d have taken more time to consider the irony, but a loud knock brought her thoughts to a screeching halt.</p><p>Logan walked across the room to her front door. No doubt, Lawrence stood outside, and all she could do was hope they had something in common. Otherwise, life as a Servio would be rough. She\u2019d rather be on the street than attached to someone she didn\u2019t get along with.</p><p>She inhaled the deepest breath possible and pulled open the door, revealing a man with long blonde hair, who stood only a few inches shorter than her. Dressed in a white button down shirt and khaki slacks, his light brown eyes and hard features seemed vaguely familiar, but it wasn\u2019t until he beamed a bright white smile that realization struck.</p><p>His two top teeth were chipped at the bottom.</p><p>Logan blew out the breath she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Larry? Holy shit! You look so...clean.\u201d And he did, he looked nothing like the man who\u2019d sold her heroin for the last three years. And had it not been for his teeth, she\u2019d have never believed they were the same person.</p><p>Larry let out a laugh in a voice much deeper than she\u2019d ever heard him use. \u201cI could say the same about you.\u201d He motioned past her. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d She stepped back and gave him room to pass. \u201cWow. This is crazy. Your hair isn\u2019t brown and greasy.\u201d She slowly shook her head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Trinity just say Larry?\u201d</p><p>He turned around. \u201cProbably because you wouldn\u2019t have believed it was me when you looked through the peephole.\u201d When she smiled, so did he. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even look, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She stared at the white metal door and wrinkled her nose before she pushed it closed. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly used to having a door yet.\u201d She offered him a seat on the couch, and then sat down in the dark grey chair across from him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. I came to take the newest Nelek Servio to her first Court. And I must say,\u201d he looked her up and down from beneath a single raised brow, an appraisal that didn\u2019t make her skin crawl nearly as bad this time, \u201cthe newest is looking pretty good.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed the bottom of her black sweater over the waist of her jeans. \u201cThanks. I don\u2019t feel too bad either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. Congratulations on getting clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She relaxed back into the chair and shook her head again. \u201cWhy the hell do you stand on the corner down in Brooklyn and sell drugs?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his blond head back and laughed. \u201cBecause believe it or not, I hear everything when I work down there as Larry. I know who\u2019s doing what, with who and why. Most of the Fledglings and Servios in the city haven\u2019t put Larry and Lawrence together yet, which only works to my advantage. I\u2019m respected by day as Lawrence, but I\u2019m informed when I\u2019m a dope dealer named Larry by night. Besides, being down there doesn\u2019t bother me. Not everyone I sell to is a bad person; they\u2019re just addicted to some chemical that helps them get through their day. It\u2019s not my place to judge them.\u201d</p><p>Logan tilted her head. \u201cIs that what you thought about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never really considered you a hardcore addict. Most of the people I served, I saw at least once a day. You came on Wednesday and Sunday like clockwork. If anything, I\u2019d say you were dedicated, not addicted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grinned wide. \u201cWhat a nice way to put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he thumped a hand against the arm of the couch, \u201cI know a good apple when I see one. I just wish it hadn\u2019t taken Trinity so long to claim you. I told her about you a few months ago, but her nice immortal ass likes to take her time.\u201d</p><p>Logan stiffened as his last sentence fully wrapped around her. The goblin in her stomach surged to life for the first time since Odin had berated her, and felt like it was roller skating on razor blades, shredding her insides to ribbons. \u201cYou told Trinity about me a few months ago?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a good addition. You always seemed too smart to be a street urchin.\u201d He sighed. \u201cBesides, I had a feeling you\u2019d started to suspect vampires were real. But it wasn\u2019t like I could just come out and ask. If I did and was wrong, I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for breaking the Veil or having to kill you to cover the breach.\u201d He straightened the collar of his shirt. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t mad I told her about you, Logan. You know how important the Veil is now, and I figured if everything went well you\u2019d end up in a better place.\u201d</p><p>Stay calm... \u201cI\u2019m not mad that you told her about me. I guess I\u2019m just a bit confused.\u201d She rubbed the back of her neck as heat spread through her body. \u201cThe night you saw me with Kerestyan, you obviously knew who he was, so why\u2019d you ask if he was my boyfriend? Why didn\u2019t you just go talk to him?\u201d</p><p>He crinkled his nose. \u201cKerestyan and I don\u2019t get along very well. Plus, Trinity told me the day before everything went down that she\u2019d asked him to retrieve you for her. I just assumed that\u2019s what he was doing.\u201d He cracked a big grin. \u201cI called her when we finished up our deal to let her know he had you, and she couldn\u2019t have been happier. But, so was I. Like I said, I wondered why she took so long to move on you.\u201d</p><p>Logan inhaled a slow, deep breath. If Kerestyan had been part of Trinity\u2019s plan all along, she\u2019d kick his fangs so far back in his head his brother would feel it.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t make any sense. Why would he have been so concerned she wouldn\u2019t make it past Stefan if Trinity had already gotten permission? And why would Trinity have been so insistent that Kerestyan didn\u2019t know Logan was in the alley that night?</p> <p>Was she covering for Kerestyan? But if she was, why did he threaten to kill her first?</p><p>Vampires and their stupid fucking mind games. She rubbed a finger in small circles over her right temple. Well, at least that thought was purely her own.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and gave Larry her best smile. She needed to play this just right or it could backfire in her face. \u201cWell, since you were nice enough to save me from being homeless for another fifteen years, did Trinity tell you about what happened after I saw you that night? Did she keep you apprised of my situation at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hit me via telepathy later that day and said she cooked you a steak. She said you guys talked about being a Servio and you took the info about as well as she expected.\u201d</p><p>Damn, everything he said so far was true...</p> <p>She shifted and stared blindly at the lamp setting on the table next to her. \u201cI think the worst part was going through the whole withdrawal process just so I could meet Stefan. I wasn\u2019t happy at all. Get clean so the man doesn\u2019t kill me on sight, but he might kill me later anyway...not odds I particularly cared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard the whole situation was pretty hard on you,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to laugh at you,\u201d he raised a hand and offered an apologetic look. \u201cI know it\u2019s not funny, but Trinity said she had to hold you over the toilet for a good hour while you gave back the steak she made for you.\u201d</p><p>That lying bitch. Logan looked over at the clock. She still had an hour before Court started, which meant if she hit the subway station a couple blocks away she had a good chance of getting to Kerestyan\u2019s penthouse in Manhattan before he left.</p><p>She was willing to bet everything she owned that Kerestyan didn\u2019t know what his sister had done. Otherwise Trinity would\u2019ve never needed to lie to Larry about helping Logan through withdrawal. And considering she had obviously manipulated the circumstances surrounding her and Kerestyan\u2019s \u201cchance\u201d meeting in the alley, he deserved to know he\u2019d been played for a fool as hard as she had.</p><p>Logan focused back on Larry, Lawrence, whatever the hell his name was. \u201cI know you\u2019re supposed to take me to Court, but Trinity told me how to get to the Estate. Would it be alright if I met you there?\u201d She stood and stretched her arms above her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a quick trip to Manhattan before I dive head first into vampire politics.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a set of keys from his pocket and dangled them in the air. \u201cWould you like a ride? After all, there are certain perks to being a Servio. I don\u2019t mind being your chauffer for the evening.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve accepted his offer, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could trust him. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I think I\u2019ll pass. It may sound funny and a little stupid, but I actually started to miss a few places in this city while I was training. I think walking the cracked sidewalks and jumping over potholes might be just what the Vouclade ordered.\u201d</p><p>Larry stood up and laughed. \u201cI\u2019d offer to keep you company, but I rather enjoy the modern convenience of a vehicle.\u201d He tapped the face of his watch. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re at the Estate by Midnight or before. You don\u2019t want to be late on your first day. Everyone will turn and look at you as soon as the doors open. And even though the vampires here are all young, you don\u2019t want to give them a reason to stare at you any longer than necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d She walked over to the door and opened it. \u201cI won\u2019t be late. If there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s how to get around the streets of New York.\u201d She waited for Larry to pass before she stepped out onto the landing of a thin stairway and pulled the door closed. \u201cWhere did you park?\u201d</p><p>He started down the stairs. \u201cOut in the lot behind the building. You haven\u2019t seen this place before tonight, have you?\u201d</p><p>She followed his lead, wishing he\u2019d move a lot faster. \u201cNo. I know where I am though, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he pushed open the heavy metal door leading to the street. \u201cI won\u2019t. I figure if you\u2019ve made it on the street for this long, your sense of direction works just fine.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out onto the sidewalk and once again did her best to smile at him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in an hour.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod before he turned left and began walking away. \u201cRemember,\u201d he tossed over his shoulder, \u201cdon\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to disappear around the corner before she cut right and broke into a full run. The cold February air bit through the single layer of her sweater, but she didn\u2019t care. She needed to get to Kerestyan and tell him what Trinity had done.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been everything I expected...and more.\u201d</p><p>Logan growled as Trinity\u2019s voice echoed in her mind, flooding her veins with anger. Between Vouclade\u2019s reaction upon learning Trinity had explained to her what being a Servio meant, and Trinity\u2019s own high pitched comment concerning the chances of Logan running into Kerestyan in the alley that night, she should have known something was going on.</p><p>You did know...you just didn\u2019t know what to look for. She pushed her legs faster, but not so hard she risked the Veil. How fitting the training Trinity had given her was exactly what helped her uncover her dirty little secret.</p><p>As far as Logan was concerned, her strings lead straight back to Trinity Nelek. All she needed to figure out now was how many times the bitch had pulled them.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s baaaack!\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan jumped and sat up when Trinity\u2019s unexpected voice cut through the silence of his bed chamber. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She stood at the foot of his bed, her cherry red lips parted in a smile, black eyes dancing with excitement. \u201cLogan. I just dropped her off at her new apartment in Soho. She\u2019ll be making her debut on Lawrence\u2019s arm at your monthly Court. And I should warn you, she can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Kerestyan couldn\u2019t do anything but stiffen and blink. Had Trinity lost what was left of her sex crazed mind? \u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019ll be at Court? Why would you do that to me? How could you do that to her?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cWhat? I thought you\u2019d be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have been happy had you brought her here first.\u201d He threw back the heavy, velvet comforter and climbed out of bed. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to her at Court! If I so much as gaze at her for a little too long every vampire in the goddamn city will know I favor her. She\u2019ll become nothing more than a target. What the hell were you thinking? And Lawrence,\u201d he raked a hand through his hair, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake...why would you put her back with the man who supplied her drugs? A man you know I\u2019m not fond of?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, as if his concerns had absolutely no merit. \u201cLogan isn\u2019t going back to a life of drugs, Kerestyan. We both know that. And Lawrence happens to have a great head on his shoulders and will be able to teach Logan all she needs to know about the politics of New York. As for your Court, the Fledglings are so busy trying to gain your favor, most of them won\u2019t even notice her. You need to calm down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo not tell me what I need to do. I\u2019m your Elder, and you are standing in my home.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, which only served to send his beast stalking. \u201cYou known damn well had I brought her here first neither of you would\u2019ve made it to Court. Besides, did you ever think maybe she needs a little time to collect herself? She didn\u2019t know she was coming back today until about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his hands at his sides. \u201cIf it\u2019s time she needs to collect herself, why are you sending her to Court?\u201d</p> <p>Trinity tipped her head back and stared at the ceiling, as if the answer to his question could be found amongst the white paint. \u201cBecause she\u2019s a Servio.\u201d She lowered her head and stared hard at him. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a perfect opportunity for her to see nearly every Fledgling in your city. You know, the ones who\u2019ll try to use and abuse her to get what they want. Going to Court her first night back gives her a chance to memorize every face in the room before she gets sucked into youthful politics and games. Don\u2019t you think she deserves any head start I can give her?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan drew a calming breath. \u201cI concede your reasoning. However, you should\u2019ve brought her here first. You should\u2019ve allowed us, at the very least, a chance to talk before enduring a situation where we\u2019ll be forced to ignore each other.\u201d He narrowed his eyes on his sister. \u201cYou did explain to her the rules of Court, yes? She knows I have no choice but to treat her as I would any other resident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Kerestyan, Logan is well aware of Courtly conduct. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t put any thought into this. Relax. You\u2019ll get to have her in your bed soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy interest in Logan goes far beyond what happens between us in the bedroom! How dare you assume my only interest in her is sexual.\u201d He closed the space between them in a single stride. \u201cHow dare you stand in my home, in my city, and treat me with such disrespect. Treat her with such disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you question me about the choices I\u2019ve made for my Servio.\u201d She flipped her hair over her shoulder. \u201cI think you forget, at the end of the day, she\u2019s mine...not yours. And if you keep pushing the issue, I can pack her schedule full of so many meetings and so many errands she won\u2019t have time to play with the Lord.\u201d</p> <p>He straightened as crimson washed over the room. \u201cYou will not keep her from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Her lips parted in a challenging smile. \u201cAre you attempting to compromise my control over my servant?\u201d She clucked her tongue at him. \u201cDad will not look kindly on your breach of Nelek Decorum.\u201d</p><p>She is your lesser. It took everything Kerestyan had, every shred of self control he possessed, not to free the animal raging inside him. \u201cLeave my home and do not return this night.\u201d</p><p>Trinity laughed as wind whipped across the room. \u201cI\u2019ll leave, but if I even think you\u2019ve done something to sway my servant from me, I won\u2019t hesitate to tell Dad. And you know damn well the rules are in my favor on this one.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan gnashed his teeth together when Trinity disappeared. Never, in all the time they\u2019d known each other, had he ever felt such an overwhelming urge to strike her. To stand over her with his fangs bared and remind her she was, and would forever be, four thousand years his lesser.</p><p>His sister had always had a penchant for playing the rules as close to the line as she possibly could, but to stand before him and threaten to keep Logan from him...</p> <p>He pushed the thought from his mind as he cast a glance to the clock on his night table. In little more than an hour he was due in Court. Perhaps the smiling green eyes of a certain woman in the crowd would return the control he\u2019d slowly lost during the last nine days.</p><p>Kerestyan nodded to himself before he walked over to his armoire and chose his clothes for the night. Seeing Logan again would go a long way towards soothing the savage beast who craved her return as much as he did.</p><p>He smiled as he laid his clothes across the bed and headed for the shower. So would an hour of peace and quiet without someone younger than him screaming about politics, injustices or rules. Honestly, he\u2019d had his fill over the last two weeks, and wasn\u2019t sure he could stay his hand any longer.</p><p>Logan braced a hand on the turn-style blocking her entrance to the subway platform then kicked her legs over the dull silver bars. She landed with a familiar ease and took off in a paced run again, ignoring the angry shouts of a weeble-wobble security guard, who didn\u2019t even bother to stand up from his seat. She smiled as the ring of a nightstick smacking against the metal leg of a folding chair faded behind her.</p><p>Immortal or not, some things never changed.</p><p>She rushed down the worn stairs two at a time, refusing to slow down until she reached the platform she needed to be on. Leaning back against one of the dirty columns plastered with flyers, she closed her eyes and worked to pull oxygen into her lungs.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d felt so much motivation to run without stopping, Trinity had been trying to punch her. Strangely enough, she felt the same then as she did now. Only the hard kick to the gut she\u2019d received for her efforts then paled in comparison to the stabbing sensation that burned in the center of her back now.</p><p>She rubbed her palms over her cold cheeks. She should have listened to her instincts when they\u2019d urged her not to trust the lying bitch. The only difference was that while Trinity had promised not to punch her, she\u2019d never promised not to manipulate her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m responsible for everything you do and say, and while I don\u2019t like exerting emotional or mental control over my Servios, I\u2019ll do it if I have to.\u201d</p><p>Listen to the words. Logan lowered her arms and swung her fists back into the cinderblock column behind her. Oh, she\u2019d made it clear she didn\u2019t like using mental or emotional control but that didn\u2019t mean she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She opened her eyes and stared down at the stained concrete floor. Trinity had made quite a show of convincing her she\u2019d never manipulate an emotion as precious as love. But what if she\u2019d lied about that, too? What if she\u2019d silently channeled thoughts through the bond they supposedly shared as Master and Servio?</p><p>What if the feelings she had for Kerestyan weren\u2019t her own?</p><p>It was yet another question in her life she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d like the answer to.</p><p>Logan groaned as her own thoughts were drowned out by a chorus of loud, obnoxious laughter. She watched as a group of men sauntered across the platform and stopped to stand about ten feet away near the next column. Dressed like Bikers, they hooted and hollered at a middle-age woman walking by, and two of the leather clad idiots even had the balls to grab her ass, and more, before she broke free and hurried away.</p><p>Logan shook her head as more laughter filled the chilly air. She\u2019d committed some actions in her time on the streets that kept her moral compass firmly in the grey, but she\u2019d never invaded anyone\u2019s personal space for longer than it took to relieve them of their money.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes as one of the Bikers met her disapproving stare through a curtain of shaggy, blond hair. He appeared to appraise her for a minute before he turned and whispered something to one of his bald buddies. He snapped his fingers then pointed at his friends coat and made the \u201cgimme\u201d motion with his hand.</p><p>Logan stiffened as the guy reached into his coat. She hadn\u2019t survived on the streets of New York this long to get shanked in a subway station on a decent end of town. She wasn\u2019t leaving the world like that, and if for some reason fate dealt her that card this time around, she\u2019d take every single one of their punk asses with her for the trouble.</p><p>When Baldy produced a cell phone, a surge of relief splashed over her. Unfortunately, concern recoated her nerves as the blond flipped open the phone, punched a few buttons and then stared over at her again. He cast a glance back to the phone, to her, the phone, then back to her yet again before he flashed a fanged smile.</p><p>Great. She\u2019d been back for less than an hour and had already gained the attention of another vampire...and a stupid one at that.</p><p>She extended to her full height when he approached and stopped no more than two feet away. If nothing else, maybe forcing him to look up a few inches would make him think twice. \u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is you,\u201d he laughed. He held up the phone, screen facing him. \u201cHow\u2019d you manage to get out alive when they got dusted?\u201d</p><p>She glared down at him. \u201cGet out of what alive?\u201d</p><p>He flipped the phone around and held it in front of her face. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>The same heart Odin said she didn\u2019t have; sank all the way to Logan\u2019s toes. On the little smudged screen, beaming in grainy but vivid color was a picture of her and Kerestyan standing outside the convenience store the night he\u2019d found her.</p><p>\u201cMy Techy friend Frank says this pic was snapped a few minutes after two of our peeps got dusted in an alley by his Lordship.\u201d He lowered the phone and leaned forward to sniff the air around her. \u201cHow the fuck did you get out alive? Your Puppet ass was just as much of a breach as they was. Right, Frank?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s entire body tensed as his group moved to form a semi-circle behind him. She scanned each one of their unblinking faces then swallowed the knot forming in her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were ten of them...and only one of her.</p><p>The owner of the phone gave her a hard look before he nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s the Puppet who was in the alley with \u2018em before King-K showed up. She walked out with King-K, our boys didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. King-K? These punks really did have respect issues. But issues aside, she needed to diffuse this situation as fast as possible. \u201cLook, whatever you think you might know, is wrong. I wasn\u2019t a Puppet in the alley,\u201d she motioned to the cell phone in Shaggy\u2019s hand, \u201cor when that picture was taken. I was just like everyone else in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Shaggy tossed the phone back to Frank then shook the hair from his eyes. \u201cWell you ain\u2019t like everyone else now, are ya? You wanna tell me what happened to my friends?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. Was it a trick question? \u201cThey died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked as the circle tightened behind him.</p><p>The goblin in her belly shifted as the one emotion she didn\u2019t particularly care for churned hot in her stomach. Only now her fear twisted into a haze of sickened anger. \u201cBecause your idiot friends were stupid enough to fight in an alley, in plain sight of a human while Lord Kerestyan watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bitch thinks \u2018cause she\u2019s a Puppet now she knows a thing or two.\u201d He tipped his head back and laughed before sniffing at her again. \u201cSmells old to me. What happened? Did he take pity on your trashy little ass and pump you fulla his blood?\u201d He looked her up and down then grinned in a leering way that made her skin crawl. \u201cOr\u2019d you make his dead dick hard and get yo\u2019 sweet ass pumped fulla somethin\u2019 else?\u201d The circle finished his sentence with a round of unified laughter.</p> <p>Logan didn\u2019t even flinch when a taller blond pushed his large body into the foot of space between her and Shaggy. He stood in front of her, his blue eyes dulled by a distance she knew all too well herself.</p><p>She stood still as he forcefully palmed her breasts and rubbed his cracked lips over her left earlobe. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no rules against havin\u2019 some fun with a Puppet. Did your Massa tell you that?\u201d He traced the slimy tip of his tongue around the curve of her ear before he slid it inside. \u201cI\u2019ll put it in every hole you got, and pop one every time you scream.\u201d</p><p>Logan relaxed as an image of him being added to the writhing wall in Stefan\u2019s chamber flashed in her mind. While she didn\u2019t have that option readily available, she\u2019d settle for one of her own making.</p><p>Mind the Veil. She smiled as a familiar vibration shook the column behind her and the pop and squeal of air brakes drowned out the group\u2019s amused laughter. \u201cYou promise?\u201d she asked as she reached down and grabbed the crotch of his baggy jeans. \u201cTell me something, do you take as good as you give?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head and stared at her, his eyes half glazed. \u201cI only take.\u201d</p><p>She closed her free hand around his right biceps as the tunnel to her left filled with light. Three. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Two. \u201cBecause I only give.\u201d One.</p> <p>With every shred of strength she possessed, fueled even more by the powerful blood coursing through her veins, Logan tightened her grip and threw him into the side of the passing train. He slammed into two of the vampires who\u2019d closed the circle on that side, taking them with him as he flew back into the windows hard enough to crack the glass.</p><p>She immediately turned right and bolted for the stairs leading up to the street, but ran headfirst into a wall of snarling vampires. Fists and boots came from all directions. Pain exploded behind her eyes in a brilliant flash of white light that surged through her limbs. Frigid concrete bit into her face as they wrestled her to the ground. The heat and taste of her own blood coated her lips.</p><p>Blinded by pain, she refused to give in. She punched and kicked as the cold bodies twisted around her. Scratched every inch of skin she could get her hands on, screamed as loud as her lungs would allow, until her mouth filled with a coppery flavor she knew all too well.</p><p>Logan squeezed her eyes closed as a heavy boot cracked against her temple. When she felt all the weight lift off her, she rolled onto her side and let out a spiteful, gurgled laugh.</p><p>The odds hadn\u2019t been in her favor from the beginning, but there weren\u2019t many times in her life when they had.</p><p>Why should now be any different?</p><p>\u201cThe Lord takes one of mine,\u201d Shaggy growled close to her ear, \u201cI take one of his.\u201d She winced as his hand closed around her face, his cold fingers digging deep into her cheeks. He lifted her head up. \u201cYou shoulda played nice, Bitch.\u201d She coughed and sputtered when he slammed her head back against the concrete. \u201cYou shoulda played nice.\u201d</p><p>Nelek\u2019s don\u2019t play nice... Her own laughter was the last sound Logan heard before the darkness claimed her.</p> <p>Chapter 22</p><p>Kerestyan sat in his black leather chair, eyes glued to the ornate French doors of his meeting home, waiting for them to open again. With only two minutes left before the Grandfather clock in the hall chimed in the arrival of Midnight, Logan was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Neither were Lawrence, nor Craig and his pack for that matter.</p><p>A tingle slipped down his Ancient spine as he shifted and nearly a hundred pairs of youthful eyes followed the movement in unison. His concern and anticipation hung heavy in the air, reflected in the way each Fledgling peered up at him as though they were a scolded puppy, waiting for the rolled up newspaper to drop.</p><p>If his sister removed Logan from the city without telling him, she\u2019d taste the full fury of his displeasure from the back of his hand.</p><p>Kerestyan surged to his feet as a tall, thin figure appeared outside the frosted glass of the doors. His heart clenched of its own accord, filling his ears with a very slow, natural rhythm he hadn\u2019t heard or felt since the day he died. He stared straight ahead, tension tightening every muscle as the silver handles turned.</p><p>The figure had to be Logan. There was no one else it could be.</p><p>With no small amount of force, the doors burst open and Raze charged into the foyer. Worry etched deep into her features, she inclined her head toward his personal office. \u201cNow,\u201d she mouthed. She flicked her wrist, opening the door without touching it.</p><p>Kerestyan\u2019s entire body went numb as he strode across the room and through the doorway behind her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d His fangs broke free before he could finish the question. When she slammed the door closed without answering, and then her golden Paladin barrier flared around him, his beast pushed to the surface. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The roar was deafening, even in his own ears.</p><p>\u201cCraig has Logan.\u201d</p><p>The white-hot flash of rage he felt as her words formed was nothing compared the abrupt and painful seize of his slowly beating heart. Scarlet flames licked the ceiling. Thick bands of obsidian shadow swallowed the floor.</p><p>He slammed his fists against the glittering barrier; roaring again as the animal inside him took complete control. He threw his head back as razor sharp scales pushed through his skin, stinging with the fury of a thousand poisoned arrows. The cracking of bone and muscle filled his ears as his wings tried to form but were confined by the barrier. Blinding agony twisted down his spine as the space around him grew smaller.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d A familiar voice boomed in the distance. \u201cWhat the hell happened? Did you put him...drop that damn thing! He can\u2019t shift in there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let him shift in here! He\u2019ll kill everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the fucking barrier, NOW!\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan felt his beast hesitate as the barrier dissolved and two powerful arms wrapped around him like a vice. \u201cCome back, Kerestyan. Whatever it is, we\u2019ll fix it. I\u2019ll fix it. I promise you.\u201d It was the desperate, pleading tone of his brother\u2019s voice that lightened the crimson haze all around him.</p><p>He pushed out of Odin\u2019s hold and closed his eyes as he struggled with the beast inside him. He had to regain control, needed to focus all the rage burning in his blood. Slowly, his half formed wings retracted and the scales sank back into his skin. His bones, which had distended and dislocated, ached as if he\u2019d died all over again.</p><p>\u201cWould somebody tell me what happened?\u201d Odin yelled.</p><p>\u201cCraig has Logan,\u201d Kerestyan growled. He closed his eyes and forced his beast down again as the words reverberated in his mind. He should have killed the Fledgling when he had the chance. Should have rent the flesh from his bones and created his own wall of displeasure.</p><p>\u201cRaze,\u201d Odin barked. \u201cHe needs to be healed. It\u2019ll take too much blood for him to do it on his own. Then he really will go out there and eat all those kids.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but her voice was strained. \u201cOh, I am so going to meet my maker for this.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stiffened as her warm hands pushed under his shirt and slid up to rest on his bare chest. She no more than splayed her fingers before a warm sensation rushed through his body, sizzling in his blood. His beast shrank back instantly, recoiling from the righteous magic burning under her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWow! That was fast.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan opened his eyes and glared down at the Paladin. \u201cWhere is she, Raze?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cringed as she pulled her hands from under his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she threw her hands up between them, \u201cbut let me explain why before you or your brother hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it quick,\u201d Kerestyan snapped. It took every vestige of control he possessed to stop the room from turning red again. And truthfully, he grew tired of attempting to keep his beast at bay.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Raze breathed. \u201cI had Jared watching Craig\u2019s pack while I tended a Veil breach in Central Park. He said they attacked a really tall Servio down on a subway platform in Soho then hopped a train with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he know she was a Servio?\u201d Odin blurted out in a rush. \u201cAre you sure it was Logan?\u201d</p> <p>Raze nodded. \u201cJared said the blood on the platform smelled old, so I flashed in and took a look. It was definitely a Servio who belongs to your family. I know what you guys smell like. Jared said he watched Craig and his people get on the train with her, and then he jumped in the car ahead of them. By the time he walked to the back window, Frank, Craig and Logan had disappeared. The rest of the pack got off in pairs, at four different stops, and all went different directions. He followed the last pair, but lost them when they hit the alleys in Brooklyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t Jared help her?\u201d Odin yelled. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan ground his teeth together and stared at Odin. \u201cFrank is a Watcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great.\u201d He threw both arms in the air. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a Tech running around using his blood to make people invisible...which means the two fuck-heads could\u2019ve gotten off the train with Logan at any stop.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan focused back on Raze. \u201cHow long ago was the attack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThirty minutes, tops. I came here as soon as I realized it was Logan. Jared has the rest of the team checking all the places Craig\u2019s known to sleep, but so far they haven\u2019t found signs of him or Logan.\u201d She pressed her lips together as tears filled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have more information for you, Kerestyan, I really am. I feel like I let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Odin bellowed. \u201cJared let him the fuck down. He could\u2019ve helped Logan the second they started attacking her. What the fuck is wrong with him? Is he stupid?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan shook his head then stepped over and pulled Raze into his arms. \u201cJared\u2019s a Fledgling, Odin. If he\u2019d have gotten involved, it wouldn\u2019t have helped Logan. The fight would have only escalated. And then Logan, and the Veil, would\u2019ve been torn to shreds. He did the right thing.\u201d He caught Raze\u2019s chin and tipped her head up. \u201cAnd so did you.\u201d He released his hold and tried to offer her a reassuring smile before he moved to pull the blade down from the wall behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Kerestyan?\u201d Raze asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to find the woman I love.\u201d He pulled the Ancient blade from the scabbard and tested the weight. \u201cThen, I\u2019m going to kill all of Craig\u2019s friends.\u201d He sheathed the blade and drew a deep breath. \u201cAnd for the finale, I intend to stand back and watch as Craig becomes the newest decoration in my Father\u2019s chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah! I don\u2019t even know who Craig is, but I\u2019m so going with you. Want me to call Vouclade? I bet he can find the little fucker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo Vouclade!\u201d Kerestyan turned to glare at Odin. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to find her any faster than we can, and as soon as he finds out what happened to her he\u2019ll go straight to Father. And while my beast would like nothing more right now than to watch him scourge every Fledgling in this city, that is not my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for the culling of the ranks,\u201d Odin said as his well used blade appeared in his hand. \u201cBut screw this trying to find her shit. I\u2019m just gonna tap on her brain, wake her up if she isn\u2019t already, and ask her if she knows where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raze interjected. \u201cCraig sensed when Kerestyan and I were using telepathy the other day. If he can sense mine, he can definitely sense yours. No one in his group, including him, is old enough to sustain a mind link. If Craig senses one go off, he\u2019ll kill Logan the minute it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Odin asked. \u201cWhen the hell did you become a Fledgling behavior expert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I started killing Leeches for a living,\u201d she offered with a vicious smile. \u201cI know because if I was him, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d do. The first piece of information she\u2019s going give up, aside from her condition, is her location. Craig\u2019s ignorant, but he\u2019s not stupid. If he senses telepathy he\u2019s going to kill her then skip town and let his pack take the heat.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan tightened his grip on his blade and stared at Raze. \u201cCraig won\u2019t be going anywhere when I\u2019m finished with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKerestyan,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cThere has to be another way. I don\u2019t agree with what Craig and his people did, but you and Captain Black Eyes can\u2019t go running around the city with swords strapped to your backs.\u201d</p><p>Odin\u2019s laughter filled the room. \u201cThis is our way, Raze. Haven\u2019t you figured that out yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! This is Stefan\u2019s way.\u201d She glared at Kerestyan as gold rippled the air around her. \u201cYou\u2019re better than this. I accepted your offer because you promised you\u2019d run a fair and just city. You promised you\u2019d give the Fledglings a place where they wouldn\u2019t be trampled under the boots of Ancients. That\u2019s what you said you wanted.\u201d She motioned between him and Odin. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what this is! At its core, Craig kidnapped a Servio. You don\u2019t have any rules against kidnapping or killing servants.\u201d She motioned to the door behind him. \u201cYou sat out there three days ago and let him go for committing the same action you\u2019re about to kill him for. How is that fair? Just because it affects you now, you want to change the rules?\u201d</p><p>She raised her hands and backed away. \u201cI refuse to be a part of this. You\u2019re better than this, both of you. This \u2018kill all who oppose or offend\u2019 mentality is exactly how your Father earned his reputation as the Butcher of Naples. Are you sure you want to follow in those footsteps?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan closed his eyes as his beast went to war with his heart and conscience. Those weren\u2019t the footsteps he wanted to follow in. He didn\u2019t want to be an iron-fisted tyrant. He wanted to be a fair Lord. He wanted to give the Fledglings a place where they didn\u2019t have to fear being trampled under the feet of veritable Blood Gods. He wanted to watch his city grow and thrive.</p><p>But not at the cost of the woman he loved.</p><p>There would always be another city. But there would never be another woman who stirred him the way Logan did. No woman whose distant green eyes he craved to fill with happiness, even if it was only when she gazed up at him. No woman who sauntered up to him with challenge lighting her beautiful features, and then fought to the last no matter the odds.</p><p>Kerestyan dropped his blade on the desk and stared down at it. He fisted his hands as yet another function that ceased the day he died flared back to life. Tears heated and burned the rims of his eyes. \u201cWhat would you have me do, Raze? Stand here and allow Logan to die? Should I drop down on my knees and pray for your God to save her? The God who stood by and let his own Children toss around the curses that made me what I am?\u201d He shoved the sword off his desk and glared at her. \u201cI stopped believing in your God the day he turned his back on his own creation. But I will not turn my back on Logan. My city created her and I will save her...no matter what it costs me.\u201d He turned to face Odin. \u201cGet Vouclade.\u201d</p><p>Odin considered him for a long moment then slowly shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He walked around and turned on the two lamps in the office that weren\u2019t already on. \u201cIs the closet over in the corner dark?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan narrowed his eyes. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your heartfelt rant gave me an idea better than Vouclade. Raze is right. You\u2019re not Dad. Logan means as much to you as this city does, and I see that now. I heard it in your words. We can get her back without a bunch of innocent kids dying.\u201d He moved to stand next to Kerestyan. \u201cI promised you I\u2019d fix this and I meant it.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan sensed the use of telepathy but before he could ask who Odin contacted, the closet door burst open and Drake Black stepped out.</p><p>Odin immediately pointed and laughed. \u201cI got you again.\u201d</p><p>Drake looked behind him then shook his head. \u201cDude, the whole Drake coming out of the closet routine is getting old. Get some new material.\u201d</p><p>When Kerestyan cast a sideways glare at his brother, Odin simply shrugged. \u201cWhat? I think it\u2019s funny.\u201d He motioned to Drake. \u201cHe came out of the closet, get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Drake groaned. \u201cEverybody gets it. Now what the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember meeting Logan when you popped in the other day?\u201d</p><p>Drake nodded. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d He cracked his signature lopsided grin. \u201cDoes she want a night of Drake style fun?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stiffened. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a night with you. She\u2019s mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drake wrinkled his nose. \u201cI thought she was Trinity\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Odin laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s Trinity\u2019s servant, but she\u2019s Kerestyan\u2019s woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my bad. Sorry, Kerestyan.\u201d He waved a pointed finger back in Kerestyan\u2019s direction. \u201cYou just keep your beastie over there. Odin\u2019s I can deal with. The whole shifting right into a dragon and burning villagers...that\u2019s a little creepy, even for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you,\u201d Odin said. \u201cOne of Kerestyan\u2019s Fledglings beat up Logan and kidnapped her. Would you be willing to go get her for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Where\u2019s she at?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan closed his eyes and shook his head. Although Odin always meant well, sometimes he didn\u2019t think situations through. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. If we did, I would\u2019ve traveled the wind and retrieved her myself.\u201d</p><p>Drake reached up and scratched the back of his head. \u201cWell, do you know why the Fledgling took her?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan slid his gaze over to Raze. That was a very good question, and one he hadn\u2019t considered. \u201cWhy did Craig take Logan? How would he even know about her?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it was random. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about the why right now guys, we can figure that out later,\u201d Odin said. He clapped his hands and grinned up at Drake. \u201cDrake, my man, can\u2019t you teleport straight to a person you\u2019ve met instead of a place you\u2019ve already been like the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>Drake let out a hearty laugh. \u201cWhy, yes, yes I can.\u201d He motioned between himself and Odin. \u201cI\u2019m with you. Forgive me for the momentary brain fart. Work\u2019s been a real bitch lately. I haven\u2019t gotten much sleep.\u201d He smiled again. \u201cI\u2019ll go get her without the benefit of a formal contract, but you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan nodded at him. \u201cNo matter the cost, I\u2019ll pay it.\u201d</p><p>Drake turned and headed back towards the closet. \u201cGive me ten minutes. I\u2019d take you with me,\u201d he added over his shoulder, \u201cbut something tells me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Raze shrieked. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Craig snatched Logan only to dump her somewhere then take off. I, as the protector of humanity, cannot have a huge dragon flying around New York City spitting fire all over the place. And I think we all know that\u2019s exactly what will happen if Kerestyan so much as sees Craig\u2019s stupid face.\u201d She pinned Kerestyan with her unnatural eyes. \u201cFor once in your life, you\u2019re going to have to let someone else be the knight in shining armor.\u201d</p> <p>As much as he wanted to, and his beast wanted to, Kerestyan couldn\u2019t argue her logic. If he laid eyes on Craig before Logan was safely in his arms again, he would lose control. Then the city, all of its inhabitants, as well as the Veil, would be in grave danger.</p><p>\u201cIf you had let me finish,\u201d Drake said as he stepped into the closet. \u201cI was going to say, but something tells me it\u2019s not a good idea. It goes back to the whole people running around on fire theory.\u201d</p><p>When the door clicked into place, Kerestyan turned to his brother. Perhaps he\u2019d been wrong to believe he couldn\u2019t benefit from Odin\u2019s guidance anymore. \u201cThank you. I would\u2019ve never thought to ask Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Most people never do unless they want someone dead. I don\u2019t care what the rumors say, Drake\u2019s good people.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan moved to stand in front of the closet and folded his arms behind his back. For the fourth time since he\u2019d met Logan, time was his enemy. However, he was willing to wager the next ten minutes...would be the longest ten minutes he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Logan winced as she opened her eyes and pain wrapped burning fingers around her skull. Although the lights in the room were dim, she squinted against them anyway, wishing someone would plunge her back into the darkness.</p><p>In the darkness her body didn\u2019t ache, her ears didn\u2019t ring...and the only person standing around her was Kerestyan. No words passed between his soft lips. He just stood there next to her, proud and regal, as if somehow he always had been.</p><p>She only wished he was here with her now.</p> <p>She sucked in a sharp breath and groaned as angry shouts cut through the chiming bells in her ears. As the words became more than loud, unintelligible growls, the fog clouding her eyes lifted, revealing all ten of her attackers standing around what appeared to be a rather nice living room.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t standing. She sat on a hard wooden chair, her upright position only maintained by the chains wrapped around her shoulders and chest, binding her to the tall ladder back. And they weren\u2019t even cool, menacing chains; they were the thin, silver links used to keep a small dog in his yard. She scrunched up her face at the offense, realizing how stupid the action was the minute the cartilage forming the bridge of her nose crunched.</p><p>The bastards had broken her nose. And, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, the orbit of her left eye, a handful of ribs, a few fingers, her right arm...and her left leg.</p><p>She knew her body had already gone to work healing her internal injuries because her mouth wasn\u2019t full of blood anymore, but she didn\u2019t dare expend any more power than she involuntarily had. The last thing she wanted was to grow fangs and put herself on a twelve hour timetable with death.</p><p>Honestly, she\u2019d had more than her share of deadlines over the last two weeks. All of which, strangely enough, seemed to shove her towards the sickle wielding Grim Reaper himself.</p><p>She looked up from her restraints as Frank\u2019s angry voice filled her throbbing ears. \u201cI don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 think this is a good idea any more, Craig. The bitch is awake. She\u2019s gonna tell him where we are! He\u2019s gonna kill all of us.\u201d</p><p>If only. If it were that easy to use telepathy, which she wasn\u2019t nearly old enough to do yet, she\u2019d have done it back in the subway and saved herself the disrespect of being bound to a chair with doggie chains.</p><p>Craig, or Shaggy as she preferred, flipped Frank the New York one-finger salute. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna tell him anything. And if she does,\u201d he tapped a finger against his temple, \u201cI\u2019ll know. Calm the fuck down.\u201d He turned and smiled at her. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna tell us where his Lordship sleeps.\u201d</p><p>Even though it hurt in ways she couldn\u2019t begin to find words for, Logan laughed the most amused sound she could muster. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell you what I ate for breakfast, let alone where Kerestyan sleeps. Go fuck yourself, Shaggy.\u201d She inclined her pounding head towards the tall, slimy-tongued blond, who stood only a few feet away. \u201cAnd take Scooby Doo with you.\u201d</p><p>Heavy applause and hearty laughter thundered through the room, causing the bell symphony to perform a frantic encore in Logan\u2019s ears. She squeezed her eyes closed tight, trying to stave off the tide of nausea rising inside her.</p><p>\u201cNow that was a great line,\u201d a deep voice laughed.</p><p>Logan opened her eyes just in time to see Drake step out of a dark doorway across from where she sat. Half of his face scrunched up as he sucked a breath through his teeth. \u201cWow. They really did a number on you.\u201d</p><p>Relief pounded a fast rhythm through every inch of Logan\u2019s broken body. She had no clue how Drake had found her, no idea how he\u2019d stepped out of a dark room, but she\u2019d buy him as much beer as he could possibly drink if he took her back to Kerestyan.</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him those exact words but stopped when she realized the room had gone silent. Disbelief and horror marked ten wide-eyed faces. Ten mouths gaped open, forty limbs trembled, and if their bodies still worked, she was sure ten pairs of pants would have turned dark yellow right in front of her very sober eyes.</p><p>When Logan slid her gaze back to Drake, he flashed a lopsided grin. \u201cThey all know who I am, and they also know what that means. You see,\u201d he crossed his scarred arms over his chest and scanned the room, \u201cI have a bit of a reputation in New York, among other places, for killing supernatural creatures the \u2018powers that be\u2019 don\u2019t believe deserve to live any more. But someone thinks our fair Logan here...definitely deserves to keep breathing. So unless I hear any objections, I\u2019m gonna take her, and we\u2019re gonna leave.\u201d He paused for no more than three seconds. \u201cNo?\u201d He laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>With nothing more than the wave of Drake\u2019s large hand, the chains binding Logan to the chair fell, tinkling against the hardwood floor. She fought to stay upright and did her best to smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the save.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d He took a step forward, but stopped short when the tip of a blade punched through his neck, barely to the left of his Adam\u2019s apple. A red glow flashed behind his blue eyes as every shadow in the room gained some kind of tangible substance. The black patches under the chairs and furniture writhed and mottled, reminding her instantly of Stefan\u2019s wall.</p><p>Drake raised a finger and stared down at it for a second before he pushed the blade out the way it came in. He turned around to face Shaggy, whose eyes were glued to the boot knife lying on the floor. \u201cYou must be the brains of this operation.\u201d He cast a glance over his shoulder at her. \u201cThis the leader?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, watching as the wound in his neck disappeared under a shimmer of bronzed skin. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who did all the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>All at once, the shadows in the room came to life and wrapped around Craig, muffling his terrified screams.</p> <p>\u201cOh, you think that\u2019s bad?\u201d Drake laughed at the dark cocoon. \u201cWait till you see where they take you.\u201d He turned around and smiled at her again as the shadows vanished behind him. \u201cLet\u2019s try this again.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered as he gently scooped her up, and then carefully adjusted her over his arms so her head could rest against his shoulder. \u201cCan you take me to Kerestyan?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cConsidering he\u2019s the guy who\u2019s gonna put my house in Chicago on a Budweiser route, nothing would make me happier.\u201d He turned and walked towards the dark room he\u2019d entered through but paused and gave the nine Fledglings one last look. \u201cNone of you saw this. You never saw Logan, you never saw me, and you aren\u2019t sure what happened to Craig. He said he was going out for some Necks, but never came back. New York doesn\u2019t seem to be the place for you. You need a change of scenery. Atlanta sounds good. You\u2019ll leave first thing tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Logan tipped her head back to look up at Drake. \u201cThat\u2019s how mental manipulation is done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Well, I didn\u2019t have to say the words out loud. I did that for your benefit, so you could hear with your own ears why they won\u2019t be coming after you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNot a problem. Close your eyes, keep them open. Whichever you choose \u2013 it\u2019s about to get dark.\u201d</p><p>She opted to keep her eyes open as Drake stepped through the doorway and her world plunged into darkness yet again. Staring straight ahead, she watched as the shadows cracked like a door, opening to a handsome face and an incredible pair of blue eyes.</p><p>There was no better sight than Kerestyan\u2019s gorgeous smile. No better feel than his strong arms as they wrapped tight around her broken body. She buried her face into the side of his neck as tears stung her eyes. She\u2019d been waiting for this moment, but hadn\u2019t realized just how much she needed him until now.</p><p>There was nothing to wax poetic about.</p><p>No poems about love wrote themselves in her mind.</p> <p>She needed him the way she needed oxygen. No more, no less.</p><p>His warm lips seared her ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t the one who saved you, but we didn\u2019t know where you were. I thought I lost you...\u201d</p><p>Even though ever fiber of her body protested the movement, she leaned back and smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She tilted her head and brushed her lips across his. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was either.\u201d</p><p>His chest rumbled against hers, making her body ache in an entirely different way before he pressed a kiss to her lips. A soft, breath stealing kiss that wrapped a warm, fuzzy blanket around the animal inside her and for the first time in a long time, made her feel whole.</p><p>\u201cBreak it up you horny teenagers. Bones needs her bones fixed.\u201d</p><p>When Odin\u2019s happy voice filled the air and Kerestyan broke from her mouth, Logan coughed out a laugh. He always seemed to interrupt at the precise moment something good was happening. \u201cWe were having a moment, Odin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll write Kodak about it tomorrow,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cKerestyan, lie her on the desk, alone. Raze, do your voodoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so going to Hell,\u201d a whisky, feminine voice laughed.</p> <p>Logan smiled as Kerestyan gently placed her on top of what she assumed was the desk Odin mentioned, then sat down next to her but refused to relinquish her hand. \u201cNot very good at following directions, are you, Lord Vampire?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cNot when they come from my brother.\u201d</p><p>What if they come from his sister? Anger shot through Logan\u2019s veins in response to the thought just as a woman with crazy colored hair and purple eyes appeared next to Kerestyan.</p><p>\u201cHi, Logan. I\u2019m Raze, Kerestyan\u2019s Head of Enforcement. Don\u2019t mind me,\u201d she slipped her warm hands under Logan\u2019s sweater, \u201cI\u2019m just going to heal you. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d Before she even finished the sentence, a spire of heat shot through Logan\u2019s body, leaving her feeling not only good, but a little tingly.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Logan breathed. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>Raze laughed rather loud. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what Odin said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! That doesn\u2019t make me sound very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucking priceless. The next time you make my big ass walk out of a closet, don\u2019t be surprised if I hand you a bottle of little blue pills.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the closet and little blue pill comment, which she had to admit were funny, Logan focused on Kerestyan. \u201cWe need to talk about Trinity. Did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he growled. \u201cI forgot to inform her. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll do it now.\u201d</p><p>Logan jumped off the desk and glared at him. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t you tell your lying bitch of a sister anything. Larry told her about me months ago, Kerestyan. She even told him she held me over the toilet while I puked my way through withdrawal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe what?\u201d Kerestyan and Odin barked, in unison.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how she did it,\u201d Logan said. \u201cBut she set us up so we\u2019d be in the alley at the same time. I also think she had something to do with Shaggy and his cronies kicking my ass. He had a picture on his cell phone of us standing outside the convenience store the night we met. Well, not his cell phone,\u201d she corrected. \u201cIt belonged to some guy named Frank.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan rounded the desk and moved to stand in front of her, his face pale twisted with more anger than she\u2019d ever seen. He took both of her hands in his. \u201cAre you confident in the words you speak?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m more than confident. I don\u2019t think Larry realized what he was saying, but as soon as he mentioned Trinity helping me through withdrawal everything started to add up. That\u2019s why I was down in the subway. I was on my way here to tell you what she\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait and come with Larry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t going to your penthouse, he was on his way to the Estate.\u201d</p><p>He looked as confused as she felt. \u201cWe\u2019re in my office at the Estate right now, Logan. Larry never arrived for Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She cast a glance around the large room, which looked no different than what she\u2019d expect to find in his penthouse. \u201cI thought we were in one of the other rooms in your home.\u201d She eyed the dark mahogany desk and black leather chairs. \u201cWhen you find a style you like, you really stick with it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God you are such a Nelek already,\u201d Raze laughed. \u201cThe woman\u2019s in the middle of a crisis and she stops to make an offhanded comment about her surroundings.\u201d She shook her head and blinked a few times. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be the blood, which is exactly why I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d She jabbed a polished black fingernail in Kerestyan\u2019s direction, which Logan immediately wanted to tear off. \u201cI told you this had Lord Evil\u2019s bloody signature all over it. Next time, listen to me.\u201d Then, without the wind\u2019s assistance, she disappeared.</p><p>Logan stared at the now empty space. \u201cCan everybody in this room disappear but me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Drake said with a smile. \u201cIt was a pleasure saving you, Logan, but I\u2019m gonna check out. I have to go to Detroit in the morning and kill some people. Good luck all.\u201d He exited stage closet.</p><p>She gazed back up at Kerestyan, whose blue eyes were narrowed and thoughtful. She could almost see the wheels turning in his mind. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you two,\u201d Odin laughed, \u201cbut I\u2019m gonna go kick me some six thousand year old Nelek ass.\u201d He frowned as a gust of cold wind whipped across the room. \u201cKerestyan, is that yours?\u201d His blacked out eyes went wide. \u201cOh shit!\u201d</p><p>Less than a second later, the icy winds of oblivion claimed her and Kerestyan, too.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, all of you.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan bowed his head as his Father\u2019s amused voice echoed through the stone chamber. He\u2019d fully expected to appear here, knowing the moment Odin asked if the winds were his, they were being summoned home.</p><p>Truthfully, he wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>Raze had been right all along. Logan\u2019s situation most certainly bore his Father\u2019s signature. Kerestyan just wasn\u2019t sure how elegantly the name had been written. The chances of Logan being a pawn on the immortal chessboard were slim at best. Never, in all the years of his existence, had he witnessed a match involving a human.</p><p>Vampires, werewolves and Paladins, yes.</p><p>But never a human.</p><p>Kerestyan smiled as Logan\u2019s small, warm hand curled around his in a tender gesture that made his chest tighten. He turned his head to where she stood on his left and gazed down into her emerald eyes. While the distance hadn\u2019t faded, something soft flickered deep behind them each time she stared up at him. He wouldn\u2019t be so bold as to call what he saw love, but it was more than they had before her training began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps the old adage was true. Perhaps absence did make the heart grow fonder.</p><p>It certainly had in his case.</p><p>He cast a glance over the eerily silent room. Trinity and Lawrence stood roughly ten feet to his right. Trinity, her perfectly colored face showing no sign of emotion, stared up at their Father as if she simply waited for the punishment to begin.</p> <p>Which if Kerestyan had his way, not only would it start, but it would continue for a very, very long time. And if Logan remained her servant after the punishment was handed down, she would be the only one allowed to tend Trinity\u2019s influence in his city.</p><p>Lawrence appeared slightly confused, but glared at Trinity, disgust drawing his features tight. From what Logan had said, it didn\u2019t sound as though Lawrence was fully aware of Trinity\u2019s plan, which would only be to his benefit in his Father\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Odin lay on the floor in an unconscious heap next to his Father\u2019s throne. No doubt, his brother had broken Nelek Decorum and lunged for Trinity the moment he appeared. Kerestyan couldn\u2019t help but to smile as Odin\u2019s leg twitched. It certainly wasn\u2019t the first time his brother had found himself in a position as such, and if history was a good judge of the future, which Kerestyan knew it was, it wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>He focused his attention back on his Father when he turned his head and locked his hollowed gaze on Trinity. Displeasure rippled the air around them, and Kerestyan could feel the weight of it coursing through his own blood, even though he sensed the malice wasn\u2019t directed at him.</p><p>He stiffened when he caught sight of Logan leaning forward in his peripheral. She appeared to be following his Father\u2019s line of sight, which he knew was correct the moment her eyes narrowed and she released his hand. He\u2019d never seen her look so angry, not even while she\u2019d relayed what Trinity had done to her.</p> <p>To both of them.</p><p>He started to reach out and stop her when she drew a deep breath and stepped around him, but stopped himself. Above all else, she\u2019d been the one most affected by Trinity\u2019s deceit. And while he was absolutely furious, he knew better than to address Trinity or even glare at her too long in front of his Father.</p><p>This was Court. His Father\u2019s hallowed Court. And no one, save the man on the throne, was to speak or commit to action before he gave permission. However, he also made no move to intercede in whatever action Logan sought to carry out.</p><p>Kerestyan watched as Logan moved to stand in front of Trinity, who still hadn\u2019t broken her stare on their Father. Logan seemed to appraise her for a moment, then balled up her fist, drew back and punched Trinity in the left eye.</p><p>It took every shred of self control Kerestyan possessed not to burst out laughing as Trinity scrunched up her face and smacked a hand over her eye. \u201cOh my God! I can\u2019t believe you punched me!\u201d</p><p>The look of sudden surprise on Logan\u2019s face said she couldn\u2019t quite believe she had, either. Fortunately, it quickly faded and she returned to glaring at his sister. \u201cI should have never trusted you! You set me up. You set Kerestyan up. You lying bitch! Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLogan,\u201d his Father\u2019s voice echoed through the chamber, reverberating off the dark stone walls. \u201cI will allow you that single breach of Nelek Decorum. Return to Kerestyan\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s body stiffened for a moment, but then she did exactly as instructed. She gifted Kerestyan a wry smile as she passed and retook her place on his left. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me. I couldn\u2019t resist. She deserved it.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan chuckled then leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek. \u201cI won\u2019t disagree with you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as her enchanting smile faded. \u201cA little bit.\u201d She leaned forward and stared at his sister again. \u201cI\u2019d feel even better if she answered my fucking question!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrinity Nelek, stand at my feet and face your brother and Elder, Kerestyan Nelek, Lord of New York, diplomat of the Nelek family.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan straightened as Trinity stepped up a few stairs then turned to face him. She folded her arms over her chest and glared at him as though he was the one who\u2019d put her in the situation.</p><p>\u201cKerestyan, I grant you permission to speak freely. You need not hold your tongue, Child.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan offered a curt nod in respect to his Father, then returned Trinity\u2019s disgusted glare with one of his own. \u201cMy only question is, why? You had no reason to go behind my back in such a deceitful manner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had every reason!\u201d she yelled. \u201cLogan was a human resident of your city, which meant she belonged to you. If I\u2019d come to you and told you I was looking to make her a Servio, you would\u2019ve gone and watched her yourself. Then instead of falling in love with her, you\u2019d have taken her as your own servant. You can\u2019t tell me you wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan pushed his beast down when it rose inside him. As much as what Trinity did to Logan offended him in ways he couldn\u2019t begin to find the words to explain, there was a much larger issue it appeared his sister had forgotten. \u201cAccording to Lawrence, who may correct me if I\u2019m wrong, he told you about Logan months ago. My feelings for her aside for a moment, you allowed a human who had knowledge of our existence to roam the streets of my city. You were taught better. I would kill a Fledgling for such an offense!\u201d</p><p>He stiffened as a new realization struck him with the intensity of a lightning bolt. He narrowed his eyes on Trinity again. \u201cExactly how did you arrange for Logan to meet me in the alley?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged a bare shoulder. \u201cLawrence told me her schedule.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan inhaled a deep breath. He only had so much patience and dealing with Trinity quickly eroded it away. \u201cDo not play word games, Trinity. How did you arrange for me to meet Logan in the alley?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and switched the position her arms. \u201cI knew you were already having trouble with the three Fledglings, so I manipulated their minds to make them fight in a bunch of different alleys for a few months. I knew if Raze saw them enough, she\u2019d run and tell you like a good little girl, and then eventually you\u2019d watch them yourself. All I did from there was leave them with a suggestion to fight in Logan\u2019s alley every Wednesday and Sunday around three o\u2019clock in the morning. Then I sat back and waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put them in a position to die, just to get to me?\u201d Logan screamed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kerestyan growled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she did, and they died by my hand.\u201d</p><p>Trinity snorted and rolled her sable eyes. \u201cOh, please. They still broke the Veil. She was human and she saw them fighting with their fangs out. End of story. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t manipulated Fledglings, Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan couldn\u2019t argue with her point. He\u2019d manipulated Fledglings countless times through the ages, even causing death on rare occasion. He\u2019d been in Trinity\u2019s shoes before, not standing in front of his Father as they were now, but the Ancient behind the strings of a Fledgling.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat would you have done if I\u2019d killed Logan, Trinity? What would you have done if she didn\u2019t pass Father\u2019s tests?\u201d</p><p>She had the nerve to laugh. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t kill her. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d fall for her as fast as you did, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t kill her. I\u2019ve known you for six thousand years, K. I didn\u2019t need to watch her for very long before I realized you\u2019d like her, and that was all I needed to make sure she didn\u2019t end up as your servant. That\u2019s also how I knew she\u2019s everything Dad looks for in a potential Child or Servio. There was no way he\u2019d pass her up.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan frowned. \u201cHow did you know she\u2019d become your servant? What if she went to Vouclade or Odin? What if Father had taken her as his own?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again. \u201cI didn\u2019t. But I knew if you liked her the way I thought you would, you\u2019d want her to stay close.\u201d She motioned to herself. \u201cI\u2019m the only one with ties to New York other than you. Look, K, it wasn\u2019t some grand scheme against you. I took a chance. I figured with our similar backgrounds, she\u2019d make a great servant.\u201d She cast a glance to Logan then back to him. \u201cAnd I was right.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped forward and jabbed a trembling finger in Trinity\u2019s direction. \u201cDid you manipulate Craig and his cronies to attack me?\u201d</p><p>Trinity shook her head immediately, which was the only action that saved Kerestyan from lunging forward and finding himself next to Odin. \u201cHell no, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she snapped. \u201cDad told me what happened. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. I\u2019ve never had any dealings with Craig or the other Fledglings in his group.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s beautiful face twisted with rage. \u201cHow the hell are we supposed to believe that? How am I supposed to believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrinity was not party to your incident in the subway, Logan,\u201d his Father advised. \u201cThe circumstances behind Craig learning of your existence were purely coincidental in nature. Watchers, regardless of age, have always engaged in their namesake. Frank did no more than what is expected from members of his family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kerestyan leaned forward and laced his fingers between Logan\u2019s then gently pulled her back to his side. He could feel the anger ebbing from her body, but the last situation he wanted to deal with was his Father punishing her for misconduct.</p><p>She squeezed his hand before her green eyes narrowed back on Trinity. \u201cSo did you do anything else? Did I find out about vampires because of you? Have you manipulated any of my thoughts or emotions?\u201d</p><p>Trinity closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t make you find out about vampires, you did that all on your own. And like I told you before, I would never manipulate your feelings for K. What you guys have is real. Aside from my plan that got you together, I didn\u2019t have anything else to do with it. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry, but at the same time...I\u2019m not. You two are good together.\u201d</p> <p>Logan squeezed Kerestyan\u2019s hand again as her blood cooled from Trinity\u2019s words. As much as she wanted to punch the bitch again, if it wasn\u2019t for Trinity, she would\u2019ve never met Kerestyan. And she could tell by the softer look on his face, he was thinking the same thing.</p><p>She wanted to be mad, wanted to keep screaming, but at the end of the day, she was back in New York with the man she cared about. Although it would be a long time before she trusted Trinity with anything more than an apple, she still had to make a life for herself as a Servio.</p><p>\u201cI have no more questions for Trinity,\u201d Kerestyan said as he looked up at Stefan. \u201cDo with her as you see fit.\u201d</p><p>Stefan gave a single, clipped nod. \u201cTrinity, your punishment for breaking the Veil, as well as my Decorum, will begin when the sun rises. Vouclade will retrieve you when he has finished preparations. You may return to your chambers. Take Lawrence with you, I will address him at a later time.\u201d</p><p>Trinity, looking scared and scolded, bowed her head to Stefan before she turned and quickly made her way towards the doors with Larry in tow.</p> <p>Logan almost felt bad for her...almost.</p><p>The clank of metal on metal sounded, drawing her attention back to Stefan as he shifted on his throne. \u201cCongratulations, Logan Ellis, you have successfully completed the last segment of your testing. Do you feel enlightened?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou knew the whole time, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He stood and descended the stairs. \u201cOf course. The only flaw in Trinity\u2019s carefully constructed plan was in not manipulating Lawrence\u2019s memory of you. Had she done so, I would have allowed her the victory. However, much as Kerestyan extends choices, Trinity has never found it acceptable to use such powers on those she favors.\u201d</p><p>Logan arched a brow when he stopped in front of her. \u201cShe won\u2019t manipulate Larry\u2019s memory but she\u2019ll hang three Fledglings out to dry?\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips rose slightly. \u201cYou say potato, I say welcome to immortality. Their strings led back to her, as did yours. You still have your life, they do not. Perhaps if they had been more concerned for their own existence, they would have never found themselves in a position to be moved as pawns. Consider their death the consequence of their ill chosen actions.\u201d He cocked his head, which she\u2019d never see him do before. \u201cWhich reminds me,\u201d he reached into nothing and pulled out a bruised and beaten Shaggy, \u201cwhat would you like me to do with this? It arrived wrapped in shadows, tied to resemble a bow.\u201d</p> <p>Logan couldn\u2019t help but laugh when Kerestyan growled and nearly squeezed off her hand. He cast a glance to the wall then back to Stefan. \u201cHe is yours to do with as you wish.\u201d</p><p>Stefan held Shaggy out towards her. \u201cWhat say you?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the broken body for a few moments. \u201cI feel like I should have this huge moment of inspiration where I suddenly realize the error of my selfish ways, and then look up at you and tell you he deserves another chance...but I\u2019m not really feeling that. I\u2019m all for him going on the wall of people parts.\u201d</p><p>Stefan let out an evil chuckle as Craig\u2019s body floated through the air then melted into the wall. \u201cSpoken like a true Nelek.\u201d He moved to stand in front of Kerestyan. \u201cI have considered the request you made when we last spoke, Kerestyan, and find myself agreeable.\u201d</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t sure what Kerestyan had requested, but with the way his body stiffened and his eyes slowly narrowed, she could only assume Stefan\u2019s response wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d hoped for. \u201cI won\u2019t risk tainting the bond,\u201d he said, his voice strained. He lowered his head, and for the first time since she\u2019d met him, a sense of defeat charged the air around him, as if he\u2019d just lost something important. \u201cAs much as it pains me, the risk outweighs the reward for her.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cFor who? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Stefan stepped back in front on her. \u201cI had a suspicion when we first spoke, due to your detached nature, it would be nearly impossible for you to establish a reciprocal bond with your Master. Meaning, while your Master is able to sense you, you cannot be influenced in return. Vouclade and I discussed the matter in length, and after a series of mystical tests performed on the blood he acquired during your physical examination, we concur my initial suspicion is accurate. Would it please you to become Kerestyan\u2019s Servio?\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t have a chance to answer, because before her brain could process the extent of Stefan\u2019s words, Kerestyan\u2019s tongue plunged into her mouth. She moaned at the unexpected taste of him, at the exquisite sensation of his soft lips, hot and demanding, moving against hers. She returned his passion and more as she tangled her fingers into his hair.</p> <p>He broke from her mouth and looked down at her, his incredible blue eyes streaked with obsidian. \u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed against her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand. I don\u2019t expect to hear you say the same. But if you say yes, I promise you\u2019ll never regret the choice.\u201d</p><p>Logan considered Kerestyan\u2019s handsome face for a long moment. She knew she couldn\u2019t return his words with the same sincerity, but her heart told her, given time...he would be the only man she ever said them to. \u201cYes, Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a devious grin, his razor sharp fangs taunting her from between his firm lips. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m allowed to say I think you\u2019re beautiful?\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his bottom lip. \u201cNo, Kerestyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Odin\u2019s sleepy voice interrupted, again. \u201cSince the man just stood there and told you he loved you, the least you could do is pay him a compliment or something. As his brother, I know I\u2019d feel better hearing one.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and smiled at Kerestyan. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head from side to side. \u201cI could listen.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. If he wanted rainbows compared to how she felt about him, she would grant his request. \u201cRed is the color my blood flows for you. Orange is the color of the morning sky I can\u2019t see with you. Yellow is the color of the sun whose ass I\u2019d kick for you...if it had one. Green is the color\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d Kerestyan laughed. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Three months later...</p><p>Kerestyan stood on the back porch of his new home, watching as the woman he loved more than life itself was smothered by a mound of black fur. She squealed and squirmed as Syn licked her face, and then let out a loud oomph! when he flopped over on top of her.</p><p>Although her dark outlook on the world hadn\u2019t changed, and she still couldn\u2019t see it the way he did, not a day went by that she didn\u2019t try. She hadn\u2019t done anything drastic like join one of the many Goodwill groups that called New York home, but her desire to leave her street life behind shone in her actions.</p><p>Kerestyan smiled. He\u2019d almost fallen over the night they walked to the butcher shop to procure the steak she enjoyed so much, and instead of running off with the purse an elderly woman dropped as they passed, Logan picked up the bag and handed it back to her.</p><p>She even earned a crisp one-dollar bill and a litany of thanks for her trouble.</p><p>Granted, she let loose with a string of curses once the old woman was out of earshot, ranting about grandmothers and their obsessive need to stuff dollars in G-strings, but when all was said and done, she gifted him the most beautiful smile and used her reward to buy him the first chocolate bar he\u2019d ever eaten.</p><p>\u201cYuck! Not in the mouth, Syn. How many damn times do I have to tell you your tongue does not go in my mouth?\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan stepped off the porch and smiled at the warm blades of lush grass cushioning his bare feet as he moved to take Syn\u2019s place. He knelt beside Logan and grinned at her closed eyes while she wiped the back of her hand across her lips.</p><p>He followed her hand with his tongue then slipped it into her mouth, savoring the soft, sweet taste of her and the instant warming effect she had on his Ancient body. There was no better taste to him, save the hot, rich texture of her blood as she writhed in ecstasy beneath him.</p><p>\u201cOw, das mot Smm.\u201d</p><p>Logan moaned as Syn\u2019s weight was replaced by the man who\u2019d become the only addiction she\u2019d ever refuse to give up. Kerestyan was as vital to her life as the air she breathed, and she was certain if the day ever came when she was forced to give him up, more than just her physical body would suffer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled as Kerestyan broke from her mouth and trailed a line of searing kisses across her jaw line before lowering his assault to her throat. She tangled her fingers into his hair and blew out a deep, contented sigh.</p><p>Unfortunately, all the movement got her was a tongue that belonged to a member of the cainine species.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Syn! Just because he does it doesn\u2019t mean you get to!\u201d</p> <p>Kerestyan\u2019s chest rumbled with laughter, vibrating her already puckered nipples and making her wish he\u2019d left his pajama pants in the house. She slipped her hands from his hair, down his bare sides then pinched the sexy cuts of muscle above his hips.</p><p>She huffed out a breath when Syn interrupted by licking a stripe across her forehead. \u201cI think Syn needs a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Kerestyan raised his head and pinned her with his incredible blue eyes. \u201cIf we get him a mate, not only will we have to housebreak another wolf, but it\u2019ll only be a matter of months before we have puppies running loose everywhere.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as wide as she possibly could. \u201cWe\u2019ll be parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His eyes narrowed playfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll be grandparents. And considering your belief that all grandmothers visit strip clubs, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to explain to my beast why I\u2019m allowing you to stuff money down other men\u2019s G-strings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in any other man\u2019s G-string. In fact,\u201d she slipped her hands down the back of his pants and squeezed his tight, bare ass. \u201cI prefer my man commando.\u201d</p><p>He nipped at her bottom lip. \u201cIn that case, we can search for a she-wolf as soon as I\u2019m finished with you.\u201d</p><p>Logan squealed as he stood then scooped her into his strong arms, as if she weighed no more than a feather. She brushed the backs of her fingers across the stubble shadowing his cheek and shivered as the goblin in her belly purred.</p><p>Kerestyan Nelek, the moody man and sometimes far too serious vampire, may not have been able to reconnect her to the world she knew, but he\u2019d rekindled her belief in two emotions she thought she\u2019d never feel again.</p><p>Hope...and love. </p> </body></html>"]
