I slumped to the floor, my hand over my cheek. I pressed my fingers gingerly over the spot where it seemed my skin was on fire, wincing when I touched broken skin and wetness that surely indicated blood.</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know when to fucking quit, do you bitch?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth automatically to deny...to ask what I\u2019d done now, but I should have known better.</p> <p>Before a sound had even passed my lips, he was swinging, screaming, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I have to tell you! Are you ever gonna learn, you stupid little cunt? God damn, I should have strangled you last time and saved myself the fucking trouble of going through this again!\u201d</p><p>I squeezed my eyes tightly shut; I didn\u2019t want to see the blows that were coming. I could feel the wetness of blood begin to trickle down my cheek, and my eyes were starting to swell. A scream wrenched from my throat as the toe of his boot connected with my tender ribs, then my arm as I instinctively wrapped it around my body for some kind of protection.</p><p>But the abuse just kept coming in rapid succession. I tried to crawl away to no avail; he only followed, punching and kicking while I tried my damndest to protect my head and the other vital parts of my body.</p><p>I sobbed in pain, writhing on the floor while he stood over me, spittle flying from his lips as he yelled, screamed, and raged at me for whatever transgression I\u2019d committed this time...and as the blows continued to rain down on my abused body, I slipped inside myself, floating away where I couldn\u2019t feel it anymore, where he couldn\u2019t touch me anymore.</p><p>The words of the lullaby my mom used to sing me tumbled through my mind and I sang them tunelessly in my head, letting them carry me further into the darkness that soothed me, brought me relief...</p> <p>The moon is shining brightly</p><p>Over top your wee-bit head</p><p>So rest your eyes my little girl</p><p>As Momma tucks you into bed</p><p>Off to sleep now, off to dream</p><p>Snuggle in and hug me tight</p> <p>I love you always and forever</p><p>Go to sleep, my girl, goodnight.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>\u201cI kissed Brandon.\u201d</p><p>The words exploded from my mouth, followed by a whispered apology, before I could even think about stopping them. Horrified, I clapped my hand over my lips, squeezing my eyes shut as I imagined Allie\u2019s fist meeting my face. That was so not how I envisioned finally getting this off my chest.</p><p>When nothing but silence met my comment, I risked peeking over at her. She was standing beside me, her hands frozen over the flaps of the box we were unpacking that had just come into her store. She stood like that for just a second before she smoothed her hands down her swollen stomach and nodded decisively.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I was going to ask you why there was some kind of tension between you two. Guess I don\u2019t have to do that now, huh?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled wryly, the corner of her mouth tilting up in a half-smile.</p> <p>My heart stopped, but my face crumpled and my mouth started running of its own volition.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t have any excuse, really, Allie. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so completely sorry, and I really never meant for it to happen. We were just on that road trip and I got drunk one night when I was feeling sorry for myself and...I just kissed him.\u201d I threw my hands up, shaking my head as I felt tears threaten.</p><p>Soft, small hands cupped my cheeks and brought my face around. My eyes clashed with the big, bright blue ones of my future sister-in-law.</p><p>She sighed, her thumbs gently wiping away the tears that had just started to fall. \u201cChloe, don\u2019t cry. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Brandon and I were done at that point. I\u2019m marrying your brother, and I\u2019m having your nephew. I\u2019m not mad...I won\u2019t lie to you and say it doesn\u2019t hurt a little...but I\u2019m not mad.\u201d</p><p>The tears began flowing faster down my cheeks. How could I have done this to the amazing person standing in front of me? How could I have hurt the person who has done so much for me ever since I showed up unannounced and buried under a mountain of personal baggage?</p><p>A sob bubbled out from my chest and I choked it back, not wanting to break down completely. I didn\u2019t deserve to break down in front of Allie...she was the one who was hurt. I deserved nothing more than an ass kicking.</p><p>Allie groaned and pulled me into her arms, hugging me tightly and the dam broke. She just held me tighter, letting me cry on her shoulder, literally. And as shitty as it was for me to do, I let her do it, and I cried. Hard.</p><p>When the storm of sobs had finally slowed, she pushed me back and looked me over as I stood there, struggling to catch my breath and wipe my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I think that this is a perfect time to just close up shop, head over to your house, and have some special sundaes.\u201d She paused, rubbing her belly again before shaking her head and smiling as she said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re gonna have a special sundae and I\u2019m just gonna eat the frozen yogurt.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a watery smile and nodded. We shut down the store and headed to Allie\u2019s, er, my house. It was still so weird to say my house, and even weirder to hear Allie say it, too, especially because not too long ago, it was Allie\u2019s house. I guess I\u2019m even more flabbergasted at the generosity of Allie...I mean, I had nowhere to stay when I showed up on Luke and Emma\u2019s doorstep, looking for my brother. I knew he was building a house and I could always crash with him, that went without saying. Instead, I ended up at Allie\u2019s house in her spare room, and when she moved into Jackson\u2019s house, she\u2019d handed me a piece of paper that turned out to be the deed to her house. I tried to refuse, but...I finally gave in and took it for what it was worth; a chance to start over fresh on my own two feet, which is exactly what I came here for. I just didn\u2019t expect it to happen so quickly.</p><p>I left L.A. a broken and battered mess, running to the little town of Phillus, Ohio where my brother had decided to relocate. Initially, he\u2019d come to see his best friends, Luke and Brandon, but one look at Allie and his mind was made up. He bought land, started building a house, and now he and Allie are engaged and expecting my little nephew in a little over two months. Of course, their story was a little more complicated than that, but...you get the idea.</p><p>Half an hour later we were sitting on my couch after a slight detour to the store to grab special sundae items. The first time they\u2019d handed me one, I was a little skeptical. Strawberry daiquiri wine cooler over strawberry frozen yogurt? Yeah, not a combination I ever really thought would be good. But lemme tell ya, it is yummy!</p><p>I took another bite of my sundae and laughed at the yearning, pathetic look Allie shot my bowl as she spooned up her own bite of boozeless fro yo. She scowled as she shoveled it into her mouth on a huff.</p><p>We ate in silence for a minute before Allie broke it on a sigh. \u201cLook. I know I said it hurt earlier when you told me you kissed Brandon. It\u2019s true...it does hurt. But I have no right to be mad at you, and like I said, I\u2019m not mad at you. Brandon made his choice to walk away from what we had, and I made the choice to let him. I gave up, didn\u2019t fight for him, and do you know why?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my own eyes beginning to brim with tears as they started falling from hers.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fight for him because I realized that, deep down, I knew the love I had for Jackson was so much deeper than the love I have for Brandon. But I\u2019m selfish, I guess, because if he hadn\u2019t walked away, I would have kept him with me, and honestly, that would have probably ruined us...someone would have ended up unhappy and, in the end, we wouldn\u2019t even have the friendship that we do. I couldn\u2019t bear that. Besides Emma, he\u2019s my best friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She paused for breath and to wipe away the tears falling unchecked down her cheeks. \u201cI was so jealous of you, Chloe, when you showed up. Brandon was always running to help you, sleeping in your bed. You knew it...I mean, hell, you apologized every five fucking seconds. And I think my jealousy stemmed from the fact that you guys were close...you\u2019ve known each other and been friends for years. Not only that, but...you\u2019re fucking gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>She laughed and I just shook my head at her. She held her hand up when I would have voiced my protest, and I shut up, allowing her to continue.</p><p>\u201cIn the long run, Brandon did what was best for him, and for me and Jackson, too. And yes, God, it still hurts and I\u2019m still so pissed off at him at times, so much that I just want to throat punch him! But, again, he did do what was best. For all of us. Regardless, I love him, and I always will. He\u2019ll always hold a special place in my heart, and the woman who finally lands him is just gonna have to deal with it, because I\u2019m not letting go of his friendship. I can\u2019t. Trust me, I\u2019ve went back and forth about this whole thing many times since he walked away. Emma was ready to castrate him because of it; she kept saying that he had made such a big deal about making it work and everything...and then just left it all behind when things got hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, he didn\u2019t!\u201d I interjected loudly, shocking both myself and Allie.</p><p>She quirked her eyebrows at me and cocked her head. \u201cWell, yeah, Chloe, he kinda did,\u201d Allie said softly.</p><p>I shook my head, still unsure as to why I was forcing the issue, but...I just couldn\u2019t let her think differently. Unable to stop, my mouth opened and the words poured out, memories overtaking me...</p><p>My sixth shot of tequila went down way smoother than the first five for some reason. Giggling, I slammed the glass back on the bar and turned to Brandon, who was brooding beside me. \u201cSo...Mr. Serious. What the fuck is your deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he growled, turning his head towards me with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cI said, What. The. Fuck. Is. Your. Deal?\u201d I enunciated each word slowly, pausing for emphasis between each of them. And then I had to ruin it with a stupid little giggle again.</p><p>He rolled his eyes at me and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk, and I have no idea what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and motioned the bartender for another shot. He nodded in acknowledgement and I turned back to Brandon.</p><p>\u201cI may be feeling pretty good right now, but damnit! I deserve it!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled beside me. \u201cAnd why is that, sunshine?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him, shocked at the fact that he\u2019d used the nickname he\u2019d given me back when we were younger. He hadn\u2019t used it in years...but then again, I really hadn\u2019t seen him in years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject, which I will allow at the moment. But we WILL revisit that issue. Anyway, I deserve it because I\u2019m starting over. I\u2019m leavin\u2019 behind the stupid, weak, broken me that let that mother fucker beat on me like a punk ass bitch! That\u2019s why!\u201d</p><p>I crowed the last words, the drunk crowd around me throwing up their hands with their drinks in them and cheering me on. I grinned at Brandon and raised my own glass, the seventh shot of tequila that the bartender had finally placed in front of me with a shake of his head, and then threw it back, swallowing down the smooth but fiery liquid like it was water.</p><p>Brandon just shook his head at me and smirked. \u201cHmm...tequila brings out the sailor in you, huh? You\u2019re gonna regret that in the morning, sunshine. You\u2019re done now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him from side to side, making sure to punctuate my response to his order with a nice, juvenile, \u201cNu-uh!\u201d</p><p>He sighed and turned away briefly, only looking at me when I spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI may be getting drunk...\u201d I cut off as I shook my head, the alcohol definitely starting to fuzzy up my brain. \u201cOr AM drunk...but I want to know what\u2019s up with you. You\u2019re so damned moody and this was your idea, might I remind you.\u201d</p><p>I huffed and signaled the bartender for another, growling at Brandon when he waved at the bartender and shook his head no. I nodded at the bartender, signaling again for another shot. When he ignored me and listened to Brandon, who overrode me once more and shook his head no, I couldn\u2019t help but growl at him and then stumbled off my bar stool, intending to head back to the hotel.</p><p>I heard him holler at me to wait and, in a reflexive move, threw my hand up at him without stopping. Okay, so maybe I didn\u2019t throw my hand up...maybe it was more of a one-finger salute...and not a nice one, either.</p><p>I heard laughter all around me and grinned, high-fiving the woman to my left that hollered, \u2018Right on, sister!\u2019 as I paused at the door, suddenly remembering that I didn\u2019t pay my tab.</p> <p>A delicious, lust-inducing scent washed over me and I felt the press of a hot, hard chest against my back right before I heard Brandon growl, \u201cI paid the tab; keep walking.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to argue and ignore him. I really did, but the fuzziness in my head decided at that moment to affect my balance and I stumbled, catching myself clumsily on the door as it swung open with my weight.</p><p>\u201cJesus...\u201d Brandon bit out behind me before he wrapped his arm around my waist and hauled me against his side. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have had that many shots, Chloe. Especially since we\u2019re heading back home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help my childish words, blurting out, \u201cWell you drank a bunch of beer!\u201d My tone was petulant, and I found myself stomping my foot and pulling away from him, stumbling once more.</p><p>I heard him curse under his breath before my world turned upside down as he scooped me up and threw me over his shoulder to continue the walk back to the hotel. I wiggled and shouted at him to put me down but he ignored me, slapping my ass smartly once and growling at me to be still. I finally complied, bracing my elbow against his back and propping my chin up on my hand like I didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Hell, if he wanted to break his back carrying me the whole way, far be it for me to dissuade him.</p><p>He walked in silence for a bit and then I heard him mutter, \u201cYeah, I had a few beers, got a little buzz, but I know when to quit. Unlike SOME people I know.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have had so much but the memories of everything just overwhelmed me. Silence reigned once more until we got back to the hotel, and even as I fumbled in my back pocket awkwardly to fish out my room key. He took it from my hand and let us into the room, dumping me gently on the bed. I sat up on the edge of it and looked up at him as he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay for a while? Please?\u201d I asked, not ready at all to be alone. I could feel panic creeping around the edges of my consciousness, memories threatening to overtake me now that loneliness was imminent.</p><p>He regarded me solemnly before he nodded, sitting down beside me. I leaned my head on his shoulder and mumbled, \u201cThank you. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad I could help. That\u2019s what friends are for, right?\u201d He smiled down at me and nudged me with his shoulder. \u201cI should thank you, though. You know, for not really pushing me for answers.\u201d He laughed shortly and amended his words. \u201cFor not pushing me more than you have tonight.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and lifted my head to look at him, my laughter dying as I asked, \u201cWhy did you do it, though? I mean, I know you just keep saying that it was the right thing to do because Allie and Jackson love each other so much more and deeper and all that shit, but...she told me you guys made such a big deal of it working out. It makes no sense that you walked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He blew out a breath and got up, pacing the room in front of me. \u201cLook. I\u2019m a selfish bastard. I knew going in to the whole deal that one day it was going to end up like this. I already knew that I would have to walk away...but I did it anyway, I got involved regardless, knowing how it was going to turn out. Hell, I\u2019ve not had the greatest track record when it comes to relationships and women, but I see what Luke has with Emma and I want that! You know?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to interject, closing it without saying anything when he continued.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I think I would have ended up resenting the closeness that Allie and Jackson have. And I shouldn\u2019t have to resent anything, especially if we are all three supposed to be making it work. I would have hated myself if I had stayed and things went south...and then I\u2019d have nothing, not even their friendship.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me. \u201cDoes that make sense, or am I just a complete and total asshole?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I think you did what was best for you.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other for a minute before he blew out a breath and said, \u201cYou know, I take back my thanks, by the way. Nosy little witch...\u201d</p><p>I gasped in exaggerated affront and reached up to smack him playfully. He dodged my limp-wristed smack, jumping off the bed and laughing when my momentum toppled me over on the mattress.</p><p>With a groan, I pushed myself up and glared at Brandon, who was still standing about four feet away, chuckling softly. I couldn\u2019t hold my glare and ended up smiling at him until he came and sat beside me again.</p><p>\u201cSo you ready to talk about your deal, yet?\u201d he asked me quietly.</p> <p>I shook my head quickly. No one really knew the whole story except Jackson, and he really didn\u2019t even know the whole thing. I\u2019d left out some choice details that I wasn\u2019t even ready to discuss with myself, let alone anyone else.</p><p>Brandon inclined his head and said, \u201cOkay...that\u2019s fine. But you know you can talk to me, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He patted me on the shoulder and stood, stretching his arms over his head. \u201cGet some sleep, Chloe. And take some Tylenol before you do so you won\u2019t have such a nasty hangover in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I stood and nodded again, yawning and then grinning up at Brandon when he laughed at me. I swatted at him and, unsteady as I was, I lost my balance and fell into him with a muffled \u2018oompf\u2019 when my nose connected with the hardness of his chest.</p><p>I felt the vibration of his laughter against my face and pushed back to look up at him. As soon as I did, our eyes locked and my breath caught, a strange headiness taking over my senses, awareness prickling over every inch of my body. In slow motion, almost like I was watching myself outside my body, I reached up and caught the back of Brandon\u2019s neck, pulling his head down and crushing my lips to his.</p> <p>I felt him hesitate and, not sure just what the hell I was doing, I sucked his bottom lip between my lips, nibbling at it before sweeping my tongue along the seam, moaning when he instinctively opened, letting me inside.</p><p>I kissed him like I was starving, a small cry wrenching from my throat when his hands came up and framed my face, and then I was lost as he took control of the kiss, drowning me in ecstasy. Lost in the moment, I moved my hands down his sides and fumbled with his shirt, pulling it up and sliding my hands along the hot, taut flesh of his stomach. His hands left my face and grasped my hips, pulling me flush against his body, the hardness of his length prodding the softness of my belly.</p><p>That\u2019s when I froze, when reality came crashing into me with the force of a runaway train. I tore my mouth from his and pushed away from him with a whimper.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m so sorry...we can\u2019t...oh, God!\u201d I cried.</p><p>He looked at me and I could see the emotions warring over his face...lust, guilt, remorse, and...something else that I couldn\u2019t define.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brandon. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. Just...I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>With that, I turned and made my way into the bathroom, completely sobered by the moment. After I closed the door behind me, I heard the door close behind Brandon as he left my room, headed for his.</p><p>In the morning, we headed for home, the tension so thick between us you could cut it with a knife. And it hadn\u2019t ever gone away.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>I stared up at the ceiling in the almost-darkness of my bedroom, the soft glow of the night-light that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to get rid of just yet casting shadows around the room. My mind was racing, words tumbling over and over in my head.</p><p>I\u2019d told Allie everything about that night. About the whole trip, actually, not leaving anything out. She never punched me like I\u2019d expected; instead, she\u2019d completely floored me more than she already had before I\u2019d spilled all the details.</p><p>She\u2019d finally pounded it into my head (she thought...I still felt like shit even though I knew she was technically right) that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and then she\u2019d cried and laughed and even admitted that she\u2019d been jealous of me, but that she couldn\u2019t ever really find a reason why.</p><p>I\u2019d promptly told her that she obviously was wrong, fretting over it again, which earned me a growl and quick slap upside my head. Who knew pregnant women were so abusive?! But the words she\u2019d uttered next are the ones that are still running through my mind. She\u2019d hesitated a bit, choosing them carefully, maybe. I don\u2019t know. Honestly, I was still shocked by them.</p><p>\u201cChloe...have things...changed for you when it comes to Brandon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, you guys have been friends for so long and then there was that kiss...I just wondered if maybe the things that you might have felt for him before have evolved.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, unwilling to even think like that. \u201cNo.\u201d My voice was firm...or so I thought. All she did was give me a curious little smile.</p><p>The conversation had finally wound down after that and we\u2019d been talking about other things and watching Allie\u2019s belly move when the baby had hiccups. Out of the blue, she had turned to me, her eyes wide and sparkling.</p><p>\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, what was the kiss? I know he\u2019s a good kisser, so that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about hotness factor...toe-curler?\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cAllie! No! No way, no how am I talking about that with you! I\u2019m still not over the fact that you aren\u2019t pissed to the tits at me for even kissing him to begin with, so...\u201d I broke off, still shaking my head vehemently, denying her question.</p><p>Allie sighed and patted my thigh. \u201cChloe, seriously. I\u2019m your friend, and soon to be sister-in-law. Take my advice and get over it. So there\u2019s a little history between me and Brandon...who cares? I\u2019m telling you that everything is fine and that you need to get your cute little ass out there and decide if that kiss was good enough to change things between the two of you. I think you\u2019d be good for him. And he\u2019d be good for you. So spill it, woman! Toe-curler or just ehh?\u201d</p><p>I threw back my head on a groan, knowing that, Allie being Allie, she wouldn\u2019t stop until she got her answer. \u201cTen-toe curler with a side of panty-melter and a half,\u201d I sighed out in resignation.</p><p>When I looked at her again, she was smiling that same curious little smile and just staring at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cTime to shake things up, girlie,\u201d she said mysteriously.</p><p>On a sigh, I shook my head to clear it and rolled out of bed, padding to the kitchen to get a drink. Obviously there was just too much going on in my head for me to even try to sleep, especially because I couldn\u2019t get Allie\u2019s advice to quit looping endlessly like one of those little gif thingys that everyone is so fond of using these days.</p><p>I leaned against the counter, sipping at an ice cold bottle of water, still thinking about everything Allie had said. The last words she said to me definitely had the wheels spinning in my head, wondering just what she had in mind. I mean, on a good day she\u2019s devious enough on her own, but now she\u2019s pregnant and has all those extra hormones surging through her...God only knows what the hell she had up her sleeve.</p> <p>My cell phone rang on the counter and I jumped, the sound startling me in the silence. I picked it up, glancing at the clock on the wall to see that it was after midnight. Dread pooled in the pit of my stomach. Calls this late at night are rarely good...</p><p>Without looking at the name, I answered. \u201cHello?\u201d I said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cHey...uh...it\u2019s Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, umm...hi?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and said, \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s late, but I just got done at the shop. I had some late night appointments, people that made arrangements with me because they didn\u2019t have time earlier, and...uh, your house is closer than mine and I\u2019m exhausted. Can I just crash there in the spare bedroom tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Huh. That came out of left field. I pressed my hand to my stomach, cursing the butterflies that had taken wing the second his voice came through the phone, and stuttered, \u201cY...yeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, thanks!\u201d he replied and the phone went silent in my hand.</p><p>I laid my phone down on the counter and jumped again, letting out a little squeak when the doorbell rang. Seriously? What the hell did he do, call me from driveway? I headed into the living room and opened the door.</p><p>Brandon pushed past me and shut the door behind him, locking it and turning the deadbolt before facing me and scolding, \u201cYou didn\u2019t even check to make sure it was me before you opened it. It\u2019s after midnight, Chloe, and you\u2019re here by yourself. You should know better!\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to defend myself but closed it again immediately because he was right.</p><p>He paused for a minute and looked at me closer. I was standing there in a pair of short shorts and a tank top with no bra, my standard pajamas, and I knew my hair was a mess from tossing and turning. He cleared his throat. \u201cYou are alone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and walked away from him to curl up on the couch.</p><p>He followed, collapsing into the recliner, sighing before he sat forward to take his boots off, then slouched back into the recliner again before he said, \u201cOkay. So I lied. Nah, I didn\u2019t really lie, but I didn\u2019t tell the whole truth. I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 beat and your place is closer, but honestly?\u201d</p><p>He paused and looked over at me. I cocked my head and nodded, silently urging him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted a break from the lovefest I live with. Jesus, Luke already knocked her up and I swear they fuck like rabbits now, worse than they did before!\u201d</p><p>Laughter burst from my lips, sounding loud in the silence, but I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>He smiled wryly at me and shook his head. \u201cYeah, you laugh, but you don\u2019t have to hear him try to pound her through the floor.\u201d He groaned, thumping his head back into the chair. \u201cI just need to get my own place, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I made a non-committal noise in my throat and shrugged. A huge yawn caught me off guard and I glanced at him sheepishly when he chuckled.</p><p>We looked at each other for a minute before I jumped up and asked in a rush, \u201cDo you want anything to drink? Or do you need anything to sleep in? I think I have a pair of basketball shorts that I stole from Jackson a few years ago...\u201d I broke off on another yawn. Wtf? I couldn\u2019t sleep for shit before he called and now I\u2019m ready to pass out?!</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cSure, that\u2019d be great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I turned and retreated to my bedroom, finding the shorts in the back of my dresser. They were a little wrinkled, but hey, he was only sleeping in them. I made my way back into the living room, tossing the shorts at him as I turned to go to the kitchen to get him something to drink, pausing only long enough to ask what he wanted.</p><p>After grabbing a bottle of cold water from the fridge, I handed it to him and bent to grab his boots, moving them to the tile by the doorway. He made a garbled sound behind me and I rolled my eyes again where he couldn\u2019t see me, sure that he was laughing at the fact I couldn\u2019t leave his boots in the middle of the floor. I\u2019m slightly OCD, so what?</p><p>I glanced at him as I bent to put his boots down again, shocked to see that he was definitely not laughing. In fact, his eyes seemed to be glued to my...Oh, shit! I straightened quickly, tugging down my shorts that I\u2019m pretty sure had given him quite the view when I bent over.</p><p>\u201cI...uh...\u201d I stuttered, trying to think of something to say but coming up blank.</p><p>I blinked in fascination as Brandon shifted, the tight front of his jeans looking decidedly tighter. I heard him make another noise in his throat, this one seeming born out of desperation as he shot forward in the recliner, shielding his lap by resting his arms on his knees.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I tried again, still at a loss, the butterflies battering my insides back in full force, but stopped when he jerked his head side to side, a cutting movement that had coldness quickly replacing the warmth that had started to seep through me.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, Chloe. I\u2019m sorry for waking you up, but thanks for letting me crash. You\u2019re a great friend...\u201d he said distractedly, his words trailing off as he realized what he was saying. I could almost hear him swallow hard, like he wanted to take back the words immediately after he said them.</p><p>And just like that, the awkwardness and tension was back. I sighed, nodding half-heartedly at him before I made my way down the hall. I heard him mutter and then curse softly and my heart broke just a little bit more at the fact that we can\u2019t even talk to each other anymore, that things had changed so drastically between us. All because I couldn\u2019t keep my stupid, drunk lips to myself.</p><p>I shut my bedroom door quietly, the soft click echoing with finality, and curled up in my bed, praying that sleep would come quickly...but I should have known better.</p><p>Morning came after what seemed like six days of tossing and turning in my bed that suddenly felt like a stone-cold slab of concrete. I shuffled into the bathroom and groaned at the sight of the dark circles under my eyes; hell, you could go on vacation with the bags under there, too.</p><p>I turned away from the mirror and grabbed my robe before making my way into the kitchen, intent on getting some caffeine in my system by way of my best friend, Kuerig. Ten minutes later, I was tucked into a chair on the back porch, sipping English toffee cappuccino and enjoying the sunny Saturday morning.</p><p>The door to the spare bedroom was still closed when I\u2019d walked by and I resisted the temptation to peek in. And by resist, I mean like, seriously had to force myself to keep going and not touch the door.</p><p>Shit...what the hell was wrong with me that I can\u2019t quit thinking of him all of a sudden? It was a kiss, just ONE kiss and now...ugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad, can it, sunshine?\u201d</p><p>I jumped and let out a squeak as Brandon\u2019s gravelly, deep voice broke the silence surrounding me, small drops of my cappuccino sloshing over the rim of my mug and spattering my hand. Cursing under my breath, I shook the burning liquid off my skin and glared at him.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSorry. Forgot you were so jumpy...\u201d His words trailed off on a huge, jaw-cracking yawn. He stretched, his arms reaching up high as he arched his back, causing his shirt to ride up and reveal a perfectly delicious expanse of taut, tattooed and tanned skin and the beginning of that hot-as-sin \u201cv\u201d peeking out of the top of his low-slung basketball shorts. No sign of boxers or briefs...so did that mean...?</p><p>\u201cChloe!\u201d Brandon sounded exasperated and a little desperate, like he\u2019d been calling my name for a minute.</p> <p>I jerked my gaze up to meet his face, feeling the scalding heat of embarrassment rise over my cheeks because I\u2019d been caught staring, and staring hard.</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah? What\u2019s up?\u201d I stuttered, trying to smooth over the moment and doing a really shitty job of it.</p><p>He smirked and asked, \u201cWanna go get some breakfast? I just talked to Luke and he and Emma are going to go down to Cracker Barrel because she\u2019s craving pecan pancakes again.\u201d His smile turned genuine and his fondness for his sister-in-law was evident.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I answered, getting to my feet. \u201cJust let me get ready.\u201d</p><p>I moved to walk past him and he grabbed my arm, peering into my face intently. \u201cHey,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAre you still having nightmares? You look like you haven\u2019t slept in a week, sunshine.\u201d</p> <p>A shiver made its way down my spine at the intimate tone of his voice, and the fact that he called me sunshine again. I know the old nickname shouldn\u2019t make the butterflies go crazy in my stomach again, but it\u2019d been so long since he\u2019d called me that, with the exception of when we were in California, I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d My voice was husky, soft, and- to my ears- entirely too telling. Shaking him off, I moved past him and made a beeline for the safety of my bedroom, glancing back only once to see him staring after me.</p><p>An hour later, I was laughing so hard I was crying, listening to Luke bemoan the fact that Emma was turning out to be the stereotypical pregnant woman.</p><p>\u201cYou laugh like it\u2019s funny,\u201d Luke groaned, shaking his head. He shot a pained look to his wife, who was sitting there with a shit-eating grin on her face, rubbing her protruding belly affectionately.</p><p>\u201cAwww, Daddy is being mean, isn\u2019t he, jelly-bean?\u201d Emma cooed to her stomach before shooting Luke a loving look, her eyes sparkling with happiness and adoration.</p><p>Luke smiled back at her and winked before he continued his list of her transgressions. \u201cShe woke me up two nights ago at two a.m. saying that she needed some chocolate-peanut butter ice cream. I tried to tell her that we didn\u2019t have any, which only got me yelled at. She said she knew we didn\u2019t have any, that\u2019s why I had to go to Meijer\u2019s and get it. At two in the morning! And then last night it was nachos from Taco Bell at eleven!\u201d</p> <p>Brandon slapped him on the back and said, \u201cWell, at least it was only eleven instead of two again, brother.\u201d</p><p>Luke just rolled his eyes, grinned, and then started asking Brandon something about the inventory list at the shop.</p><p>With the guys engrossed in their own conversation, Emma turned to me, a sly smile creeping across her face.</p><p>\u201cSooooo...\u201d she began, drawing the word out dramatically.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord...what?\u201d I asked her warily.</p><p>She leaned in closer and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what?\u201d I whispered back, thoroughly confused.</p><p>She rolled her eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019m in on the plan with Allie!\u201d she whispered back, although her whisper was more of a low voice.</p> <p>I shot a panicked look across the table at the guys, breathing a sigh of relief when I noted that they were still engrossed in their own conversation and not even looking our way, before I managed to growl through clenched teeth, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? You know what? Not here, not now. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Emma just shrugged and winked at me, grinning happily around the restaurant like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. It truly warmed my heart to see her like this, positively glowing and radiating happiness...and, if I\u2019m being honest with myself, a little saddened by it, as well. I mean, that\u2019s exactly what I want for myself but do I ever think I\u2019ll have it? Not likely. That fuckwad Greg pretty much ruined that.</p><p>I shook my head to clear my thoughts and tuned back into Emma, who had her phone to her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo, pregnancy brain, you twit. I totally forgot!\u201d She groaned and then laughed at something whoever she was talking to said. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know how I spaced on that, but I\u2019ll be rectifying that situation post haste, gov\u2019nah,\u201d she ended in a horrible fake British accent.</p><p>\u201cAlright...okay...alright...I said okay, geez, Allie!\u201d She listened for a few more seconds before ending the call with, \u201cKay, bye,\u201d and then whirled on me, that sly smile back on her face.</p><p>I looked at her with a mix of dread and curiosity, knowing she was about to either ask me something or tell me something that she and Allie had just discussed. And lemme tell ya, I wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>\u201cBrandon spent the night at your place last night, huh?\u201d She went back to whispering, thank God, but I still glanced at the guys before I answered her.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did Allie know?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Chloe, do you think Brandon thought of staying at your house last night by himself?\u201d Emma scoffed.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Allie both knew he was coming to my house after midnight last night?\u201d I asked, my eyes narrowing in suspicion.</p><p>Emma chortled with glee and then answered, \u201cHe waited until late? Dumbass...what if you\u2019d been asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, seriously, what the hell is going on?\u201d I cringed when I realized that I had spoken out loud and now had the undivided attention of all the occupants at the table, and even some at a couple tables around us.</p><p>I could feel the heat rising in my face as I glared at Emma, who was unable to restrain her laughter.</p><p>\u201cIs this a private joke, or can we get in on it?\u201d Brandon asked, his tone very mild, though curious.</p><p>\u201cNothing! So, how was your breakfast? Was it good?\u201d Yeah, I totally suck at diversion conversation, can ya tell?</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cWell, you ready to go home?\u201d Brandon asked a little while later, after we\u2019d finished eating and walked out to the parking lot with Emma and Luke.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered, giving Emma a hug, and nodding when she whispered in my ear, \u201cWe\u2019ll finish that conversation later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Luke stepped up and gave me a hug, too, and we all went our separate ways. We rode back to my house in silence, the tension building between us again. I laid my head against the window, so sick of feeling this way, being so awkward around him. It\u2019d never been like that between us before and I regretted the fact that I ever kissed him, even as my thighs clenched with heat at the memory of his lips on mine.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>His words broke through my thoughts and I jerked my head up, nodding at him but not looking his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All of a sudden, he pulled over to the side of the road and slammed his hands against the steering wheel, making me jump.</p><p>\u201cChloe, I can\u2019t take this shit anymore! I want my friend back, damnit!\u201d he roared, his words and the tone of his voice making me shrink back in my seat and eye him warily.</p><p>He took a deep breath and ran his hands roughly over his face before looking over at me again. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean to yell, but Jesus, there\u2019s only so much I can take! You and I can\u2019t be in the same room together anymore without the tension being so thick you can cut it with a knife. Unless there\u2019s other people around, and then we manage to act normal...sort of. So we kissed...big fucking deal! It shouldn\u2019t ruin our friendship...I won\u2019t let it ruin it. Can we go back to the way we used to be? Please?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, his eyes pleading with me, and all I could do was nod. Just nod like a dumbass, even though it felt like I\u2019d just taken a sledgehammer to the gut. I don\u2019t even know why it felt like that, honestly, because there was nothing more between us, just a misplaced case of hero worship or flat out lust on my part.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded sharply and pulled back out onto the street. We were both silent until we got to my house and he dropped me off, waving and smiling jovially at me as he pulled away, but even I could see that it was a bit forced.</p><p>Like a sad sap, I stood in the driveway and watched his truck get smaller and smaller in the distance, until anger at myself took over. Christ...get a grip, sorry ass, I told myself. Shaking my head, I sighed and went inside, determined to find something to do to occupy my Saturday, since Allie had told me to take the day off.</p><p>With my conversation with Allie running on a loop through my head, I cleaned and organized every inch of my house ruthlessly, attacking every task with fervor until the only thing left was to sweep the kitchen tile and the tile in the foyer. Since it was such a nice day, I opened up the windows and blasted my iPod, dancing around as I cleaned.</p><p>I grabbed the broom just as I\u2019ve Got You Covered by Sugar and the Hi Lows began playing, the smooth tones taking me over as I swept and danced along, singing the words at the top of my lungs. Not thirty seconds into the song, I quit pretending to sweep and just danced around with the broom, still singing, lost in the lyrics.</p><p>I dipped the broom, came up, and spun around, shrieking in surprise when I collided nose first into a hard male chest. My eyes traveled up until they clashed with the stormy, blue-grey eyes of Brandon, who was grinning down at me. Without a beat, he grabbed the broom out of my hand and tossed it away, pulling me into his arms and dancing me around the kitchen.</p> <p>Unable to resist, I followed his lead, my knees getting weak when he began to sing the words softly by my ear, pulling me even closer. A shuddering breath left my lips as I melted into him, letting myself just feel for once, even though I knew I could never have more. He shifted me in his arms and I looked up, my pulse racing when I saw that he was looking down at me, all trace of playfulness gone.</p><p>I felt his breath hitch, felt the air charge suddenly with desire, and wondered if I was hallucinating. But no...I wasn\u2019t, to my utter surprise.</p><p>With a muttered curse, Brandon leaned forward and captured my lips in a searing kiss, stealing my breath and lifting me up in his arms at the same time, which was a good thing as my knees buckled.</p><p>He ate at my mouth, biting, sucking, and licking...taking the kiss deeper and deeper until my head was swimming and I couldn\u2019t tell which way was up. After what seemed like an eternity, he pulled back, placing a soft kiss on the tip of my nose. I kept my eyes closed, unwilling to open them and break this wonderful moment.</p><p>Brandon broke the silence on a sigh. \u201cI was afraid of that...\u201d he murmured thickly.</p><p>Blinking, I stared up at him in confusion before I pushed against his chest and moved away, putting some distance between us, trying to catch my breath and gather my wits.</p> <p>\u201cI...\u201d I paused, trying to find my words. \u201cBrandon, I\u2019m so confused. You left me here an hour ago, giving me this pretty little speech about how it was no big deal that we kissed and you want to be friends.\u201d I threw my hands up in the air. \u201cFriends don\u2019t show up unannounced at friends\u2019 houses and kiss the living shit out of them!\u201d</p><p>He let out a groan and wiped his hands over his face. \u201cI know!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI know that, but then I felt like an ass for the way I left things, forcing you to agree to our friendship, but you don\u2019t want to be my friend, do you?\u201d He shook his head, answering himself. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t because I\u2019m an asshole and I took advantage of you when you were drunk. I shouldn\u2019t have led you on that night in the hotel...\u201d</p><p>He broke off and moved over to where I stood, clinging to the kitchen counter as I tried to ground myself just a little bit. \u201cI just had to know if it was a fluke, Chloe. If it was a fluke that I felt the whole world light on fire when your lips touched mine when we were in L.A.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed thickly, emotion clogging my throat. \u201cBut...you didn\u2019t take advantage of me, Brandon. In fact, I took advantage of YOU!\u201d I exclaimed, feeling the mortification take me over again. \u201cAnd I DO want to be your friend...we\u2019ve been friends for years and I don\u2019t want anything to change that,\u201d I said softly, regret and a tinge of fear coloring my words.</p><p>His face softened a bit before his brow furrowed again. \u201cNo.\u201d He was shaking his head emphatically. \u201cNo, no you didn\u2019t take advantage of me, Chloe. I didn\u2019t stop you right away, I took the kiss deeper. I kissed you back! God, I fucking kissed you back. You tasted like sunshine and tequila, and I wanted nothing more than to throw you on the bed and bury myself between those tight little thighs of yours.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Totally did not see that one coming.</p><p>\u201cWell, holy shit, cowboy, why don\u2019t you tell her how you really feel?\u201d</p><p>I jumped and shrieked again, which seemed to be the theme of the day since everyone had decided to show up unannounced and scare the living hell out of me.</p> <p>Leah stood in the kitchen doorway, leaning against the doorframe with an avid expression. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t let me stop this conversation...I\u2019m dying to hear what else you have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah...\u201d I said on a groan, closing my eyes and tipping my head back.</p><p>She threw her hands up and said, \u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019m just gonna go wait on the back porch and let you finish your talk. But then, I\u2019m kidnapping you for the day because you\u2019re going to the fight with me tonight.\u201d She whirled around and disappeared, heading back to the porch, I guess.</p><p>Brandon and I both were silent for a moment, staring after her before we both began to speak, each talking over the other. We both stopped and started again, and then laughed. I held up my hand and he nodded, giving me the go ahead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. You\u2019ve thrown me for a total loop right now...but I still don\u2019t understand why you came back here today and kissed me. Why, Brandon? Especially after that speech you gave me in the truck...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had to know, like I said, if it was a fluke. Chloe, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but...I\u2019m scared as fuck right now that I\u2019m about to screw shit up. I shouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal out of wanting to stay friends earlier, but for shit\u2019s sake, I am so tired of the tension whenever we\u2019re together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He brought his hand up and cupped my cheek gently before he grabbed my arms and pulled me up against him, chest to chest, our breath mingling as he dipped his head close to mine. \u201cYou still taste like sunshine and I should just walk away, but damnit, woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...Allie...\u201d The words fell off my lips before I could hold them back.</p><p>He froze, every muscle in his body tensing. I could feel him fighting back the myriad emotions that had to be weaving through every inch of him at the moment and I felt like even more of a bitch for causing it.</p><p>After a moment, he dropped his hands, blew out a deep breath, and moved away to lean against the counter by the sink. I started to apologize but stopped when he shook his head at me.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, okay? Listen up because I\u2019m really tired of people throwing her up in my face. Allie and I, and Emma too, incidentally, talked about this just the other day. In fact, it was after she\u2019d been over here with you when you broke down and told her about the kiss.\u201d</p><p>I gasped but didn\u2019t say a word, letting him continue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Chloe. I\u2019m not mad. It\u2019s best that it\u2019s out in the open anyway, especially because Allie and I are so close. She came to me to let me know that she\u2019d been set straight about a couple things, so I guess I should thank you. Anyway, there was nothing between Allie and I when we kissed. You know that, Chloe, even though I know you also feel like you betrayed a friend. And I\u2019m pretty sure you felt like you betrayed not only a friend, but our friendship and your brother. Right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Brandon moved toward me and motioned to the kitchen table. We each took a seat, settling in to continue the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cLook. I walked away from the situation with Allie because I\u2019m selfish, like I told you. I want that special love that Emma and Luke have, that Allie and Jacks have...and Allie and I? We loved each other, sure, maybe were even a little in love. But that love was nothing, and I mean NOTHING, close to what she has with Jackson. How fair would it have been to them to stick it out and maybe end up resenting them, or even them resenting me? It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to them, at all, or to me. I don\u2019t deserve anything less, and yes, I said that I wanted it to work because I did! I didn\u2019t walk away just on a whim, you\u2019ve got to know that!\u201d</p><p>His face was earnest and, even if I didn\u2019t know already that he was telling the truth, I would know now, would believe him whole-heartedly.</p><p>\u201cI was going to talk to them both and then Jacks got into that awful fucking accident and things just were spiraling out of control. I was so scared that we were going to lose him, and she kept pushing me away...and then I overheard Allie pouring her heart out to him, trying to get him to wake up, and she blurted out that she was pregnant and...well, you know the rest. Jacks woke up and I realized that, while she wasn\u2019t really trying to push me away, the truth was staring us all in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Brandon, but it just...I mean, you both made it look like it was so easy to do. Like neither one of you were willing to fight for it. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but...\u201d I shrugged, not entirely comfortable talking about this with him, but figuring if he was laying it out, might as well go all in.</p><p>Brandon shook his head. \u201cNo, Chloe, it was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve done in my life. I can honestly say that, but I can\u2019t regret it. I don\u2019t regret it, because Allie is happier than ever, and she and I are closer than ever. As friends. And she and I are okay, we\u2019re completely and totally fine. And if people don\u2019t like it, if they can\u2019t understand that, well, we do and that\u2019s all that matters. Right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not really sure what to say, where to go from here.</p> <p>His face softened again. \u201cWe\u2019re good, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again; there\u2019s nothing else I could say, was there?</p><p>He slapped his hands down on the table, saying, \u201cOh, yeah. Why the hell was your door unlocked?\u201d</p><p>I straightened, immediately going on the defense. \u201cIt was not!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI know. I used my key that I never gave back. And Leah has a key, too, I\u2019m assuming?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. He nodded back at me and slammed his hands down on the table once more. \u201cNow. We\u2019ve got that out of the way. Sooo...\u201d He drew the word out, waggling his eyebrows exaggeratedly at me before he said, \u201cWanna make out?\u201d</p><p>The question caught me off guard so badly that I couldn\u2019t help but crack up, laughing even harder when he pretended to be affronted, slapping his hand across his chest and drawing his head back in mock horror. And just like that, the tension broke and I knew, whatever happened, we were going to be fine, too.</p><p>At least I was hoping so.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p><p>I walked out onto the back porch where Leah was waiting, giving her a sheepish grin when she crossed her arms and pouted, glaring at me from where she lay on the lounger she\u2019d dragged over into the sun.</p><p>She and I had gotten closer and closer during the time I\u2019d been here, hanging out together just as much as I did with Allie and Emma. She was younger than me, but that didn\u2019t matter. She was so fun to be around and she just...got me. She knew when to push me and when to let me be. Quite frankly, she\u2019d become my best friend.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about fucking time! Holy hell, I aged a year waiting on your ass! Do you realize it\u2019s already two o\u2019clock now?\u201d she asked, whining. The effect was broken when she swung around, jumped to her feet, and attacked me, questions flying a mile a minute at me. \u201cOh, my God! Are you gonna fuck him? He kissed you again? Are you dating now? What did he say? What happened after I came outside? Are you gonna get ready now? Is he still here? Where\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>Oy. I grabbed her arms, holding her still and forcing her to look at me instead of jumping around like a Chihuahua on crack. \u201cCalm your hyper ass down, slick! One question at a time!\u201d Yeesh!</p><p>She waved a hand at me impatiently, gritting out, \u201cJust fucking spill! We don\u2019t have time for questions anymore. Tell me while you\u2019re getting ready!\u201d She slapped my hands away and yanked my arm almost out of the socket as she pulled me into the house and to my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, sorry it took so long, but I guess it needed to happen sometime and he decided it was today. I can\u2019t believe that you actually waited out here for so long. Where are we going, anyway?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou said something about a fight?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI just laid in the sun. It was kinda nice and relaxing and I didn\u2019t feel like going home just to come back and steal you later.\u201d Then she grinned wickedly. \u201cAnyway, remember when Calland called and asked if anyone wanted to go to the fight with him? Well, he lined up the tickets really early, so it\u2019s FINALLY time to go! Whoo hoo! Get to watch hot guys beat the shit out of each other...what\u2019s better than that?\u201d Leah crowed, rubbing her hands together and licking her lips crazily.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, you blood thirsty violence whore, a lot is better than that to my mind. Why do I have to come?\u201d Yeah, I whined a little bit, but UFC stuff really isn\u2019t my forte. I was not very excited to go, but I wouldn\u2019t make her go alone. \u201cAnd why the hell are you here so early when I know the fight can\u2019t be until later tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Calland invited that girl he was seeing, what\u2019s her name...uh...Katie or something? She lasted longer than most of them but on game night when she got handsy in front of everyone kinda ruined it for my brother, so he\u2019s got an extra ticket and I told him I wanted it for you. And because I was bored and I figured that we\u2019d get dolled up, get some food, get some drinks and then go. That\u2019s why, now GET READY!\u201d she shouted, rooting through my closet and throwing clothes at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she said as an afterthought, \u201cWhat happened with Brandon? Did he leave or is he lurking around here somewhere?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHe left and I\u2019m not getting into this with you right now.\u201d I took the clothes she tossed me and went into the bathroom to get dressed.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I was standing in front of the mirror, turning side to side, trying to decide if I could bear to wear what she\u2019d given me. It used to be one of my favorites before...just before. I hadn\u2019t worn it in a long time. It\u2019s not that it looked bad on me; in fact, quite the opposite. The last time I\u2019d worn it, the short yet tasteful teal blue shorts were a little baggy, and the flowy, sheer, black key-hole racerback tank was extra baggy. Now, since I\u2019d gained a little \u2018happy\u2019 weight, as I called it, it fit perfectly and looked pretty damned good, if I do say so myself.</p><p>The shorts covered enough of my long legs and I paired the tank with a plain black tank underneath to preserve my modesty, among other things. Things I don\u2019t talk about.</p> <p>I felt good, looking at myself, which is something that hadn\u2019t happened in a long time. Looks-wise, I was the polar opposite of my brother, Jackson. He had the dark hair and deep brown eyes of my father, while I took more after my mother. Size eight, 5\u20196\u201d, hazel eyes, long blonde hair, and built pretty generously in the boob department, but not overly so, you could say I was passably pretty. Some would say I\u2019m beautiful, but I\u2019ve never been one to really put stock into my looks.</p><p>I turned sideways again, took a deep breath, and shook myself out of my stupor, deciding that it was time to quit hiding. I tied my hair into a messy knot at the nape of my neck and did my makeup, a little of my favorite perfume and I moved out of the safety of the bathroom.</p><p>Leah glanced up, muttering a faint \u2018finally\u2019, gave pause for only a moment, raising one eyebrow but saying nothing. I appreciated that more than she could ever know, especially because I\u2019ve never really dressed up to go out since I moved here. Yeah, I dressed up for special occasions, but not like, dressed up dressed up, you know, for going out. You know what I mean.</p><p>\u201cAlright. So, let\u2019s swing by my house so I can change, then we\u2019ll head to Griff\u2019s for dinner, a pre-fight cocktail, then we\u2019ll head to the arena to watch the buff-daddy\u2019s get to it. Cool? Cool! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Leah cheered the last part, her perkiness making me giggle.</p><p>Time flew by, and I was having fun. Seriously, though, it\u2019s hard not to have fun when you\u2019re with Leah. She\u2019s so bubbly, sweet, and genuine, and then she\u2019s crazy, zany, and wild, too. Definitely never a dull moment with her and I was so happy that she and I had become so close.</p> <p>Pre-fight cocktails turned into pre-fight happy hour, so we were pretty thankful Calland decided to pick us up from Leah\u2019s house and take us to Griff\u2019s. And pretty thankful he was our unwitting DD. He\u2019s a nice guy...unless you\u2019re his sister or his sister\u2019s best friend, apparently. So maybe I should watch out?? Hmm...</p><p>Now we were halfway through the fight, our buzzes had pretty much worn off, and Leah was still drooling over some guy she\u2019d bumped into, literally, when we were headed to our seats. Not gonna lie, I had totally drooled, too. Seriously hot. Tattoos...mmm. He\u2019d winked at her, steadied her, and walked away, leaving her completely dazed and confused in the middle of the aisle, halfway to our seats. I say she\u2019s still drooling over him because, turns out, his seat was about three rows down in front of us and about two seats to the right.</p><p>The next round started with a roar from the crowd and I turned my attention back to the cage, cringing as blood flew in an arc as a well-placed blow lanced open the brow of one of the fighters. Calland was jumping up and down beside me, shouting and hollering, and even Leah had abandoned her hottie watching to join in the cheering.</p><p>A large, obviously drunk guy in the row behind me started yelling obscenities, throwing himself forward as he swung his arms around, the beer in one hand spilling over and soaking my back, while his other connected solidly with my shoulder, shoving me forward. I gasped, the pain shocking and instant as I flailed, grabbing for Calland\u2019s arm to stop myself from falling over the seats in front of me.</p><p>Calland caught me easily, and as soon as I had my balance, he rounded on the guy, his voice menacing, even over all the yelling all around us. \u201cHEY! Watch what the fuck you\u2019re doing, asshole!\u201d</p><p>Drunk Guy\u2019s face turned a mottled red and he dropped his beer, not that there was much left. Most of it was running down my spine. \u201cWho the fuck are you, talkin\u2019 to me like that?\u201d he roared.</p> <p>\u201cYou just spilled your beer all over her,\u201d Calland shouted, pointing to me, \u201cand then hit her and knocked her over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 do anything to her, pansy-ass mother fucker, so why don\u2019t you take your little bitch there and get the fuck outta here!\u201d Spit was flying from Drunk Guy\u2019s mouth as he yelled at Calland and I ducked, trying to avoid being caught in the crossfire.</p><p>I froze as Calland tensed, a deceptive calm moving over his face. I knew that look, knew things were about to head south at a fast pace. I moved close to his side, placing my hand against his chest and murmuring, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>He gently shrugged me off, patting me on the shoulder and then moving me quickly aside to grab Leah, who\u2019d chosen that moment to launch herself at Drunk Guy, screeching and spitting venomous words at him like a she-cat from hell. His face was turning redder and redder and Calland looked like he was having a difficult time controlling his sister without hurting her.</p><p>\u201cHEY!\u201d</p><p>The shout drew our attention enough to break the moment for just a second, which was enough time to allow Hottie to reach over and snatch Leah from Calland\u2019s arms, then turn on his heel and move through the crowded aisles away from us.</p><p>Panic washed over Calland\u2019s face as he grabbed my arm, hollering at me, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d as he scrambled to follow the stranger who\u2019d just taken his sister, forgetting all about Drunk Guy who was still blustering over Leah\u2019s attack, forgetting about the fight in the cage in the center of the arena, forgetting about everything but getting to his sister.</p><p>We made it to the lobby, drawing up short when we saw Leah leaning against the wall beside the exit, laughing and chatting animatedly with Hottie. Calland shook his head and stalked over, relief and distrust warring on his face.</p> <p>\u201cCalland! Chloe! Meet Ian.\u201d She gave us a grin as she waved her hand between us in introduction, taking a second to mouth Oh my God!, fan herself, and wink at me while Calland and Ian shook hands.</p><p>\u201cMan, I looked back just in time to see Leah jump at the big guy behind you and couldn\u2019t help it. I saw you struggling to hold her and didn\u2019t even think about anything but getting her out of there so you could get things calmed down...sorry, man. I know I freaked you out a little bit but I was just trying to help,\u201d Ian said, his smooth, dark honeyed voice sending shivers down even my spine.</p><p>I glanced at Leah out of the corner of my eye and had to fight a grin as she practically melted into a soppy, drooly mess at Ian\u2019s feet.</p><p>Calland shook his head and grinned as he slapped Ian on the back. \u201cI definitely was freaking out for a second, but hey, thanks, man! She\u2019s kinda high-strung,\u201d he said in a pseudo whisper, shaking his thumb at Leah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leah glowered at Calland for a second and then turned her mega-watt smile on Ian. \u201cWell, since we obviously are done watching the fight, whatcha say we move this to the bar? My pre-fight cocktails have worn off and I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, looking at Calland since he was our DD. He shrugged and looked at Ian, asking, \u201cYou wanna join us? We could head back to Griff\u2019s if you want.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave Leah an appraising look and nodded. \u201cYeah, Griff\u2019s is fine. I\u2019ll meet you there so I have my car.\u201d With that, he winked and headed out the door.</p><p>Leah stuck her lip out and pouted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even ask if I wanted a ride!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shut it, Leah. Like I would let you ride with him anyway. You just met the dude and the way you were drooling over him, you\u2019d be spread out in the backseat screaming \u2018take me, I\u2019m yours\u2019 in a heartbeat!\u201d</p><p>I reached out and smacked Calland\u2019s shoulder, glaring at him while he pretended to shrink away from me. The effect was ruined by his uncontrollable laughter, though. And mine...seriously, the little falsetto voice he just used killed me. Leah just ignored him and shook her head in exasperation. Guess she\u2019s pretty used to him after 25 years.</p><p>We left the arena and piled into the truck, me flopping into the backseat while Leah commandeered the front seat and Calland\u2019s radio, much to his dismay.</p><p>For the third time, Calland smacked Leah\u2019s hand away when she changed the channel on his satellite radio to the 90\u2019s channel and Aqua\u2019s Barbie Girl began blaring obnoxiously through the car. He growled in disgust and hit a button on the steering wheel, nodding when Enter Sandman by Metallica took over the speakers.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but bob my head along with the song, mouthing the words and grinning when Calland caught my eye in the review mirror, winking at me with approval. Leah tried to act aggravated with the music, but I saw her hand tapping out the beat, as well. Towards the end of the song, Calland turned it down almost all the way suddenly and yelled out, \u201cGO!\u201d to Leah.</p> <p>She threw her head back and yelled back, \u201cEnter Sandman, Metallica, Black Label!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Calland hollered back, turning the radio back up while I looked at them like they were crazy.</p><p>Leah took pity on me, turned down the music again, and looked back at me while she explained, \u201cCalland had this thing where he thought it was absolutely imperative that Emma and I know how to identify all the songs, and the albums, of Metallica, which is one of his most favorite bands of all time. And of course, we had to know some Pantera, too, as well as a lot of others. Emma remembers more than I do most of the time, but I don\u2019t do so bad myself after all these years.\u201d She grinned over at her brother with fondness and it made my heart ache a little bit.</p><p>Jackson and I were that close once. And then I started hanging out more with my friends, being a typical boy crazy teenager, and we drifted apart. I pulled away a lot more, too, when I started dating Greg. No one knew about him at first...or really even now. God, do I regret so much.</p><p>The slamming of the truck door pulled me from my reverie and I looked up to see Calland and Leah staring at me through the window, waving at me to come on. I got out and Leah glanced at me in concern but I just smiled and shrugged her off.</p><p>We walked into Griff\u2019s and, miracle of miracles, were able to nab the table dubbed \u2018our table\u2019 by our group, which gave us primo positioning. Calland asked what we wanted and bellied up to the bar through the crowd to get us drinks while we scanned the bar for Ian. I noticed him as he just walked through the door and nudged Leah with my elbow, canting my head in his direction and laughing when she squealed under her breath and clutched my thigh under the table.</p> <p>I winced and pushed her hand away, laughing at her and then raising my hand to catch his attention. He noticed me and smiled, but his face broke into a grin when he saw Leah sitting beside me. He sauntered over and I knew then that I was pretty much losing my best friend for the evening when she bolted from the booth and met him halfway, dragging him onto the dance floor as the band started playing a cover of Angel Eyes by The Jeff Healy Band.</p><p>Oh, well, at least Calland would keep me comp- never mind. Looks like I wouldn\u2019t be getting my drink anytime soon either, since he was engrossed in conversation with a pretty redhead at the bar.</p><p>I sighed and planted my chin on my hand, swaying to the music as I sat there silently by myself. A shiver went down my spine as a deep, velvet voice filled my ear, lips brushing the delicate skin as they whispered, \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and met the stormy gaze of Brandon. He stood up from where he had leaned down to whisper to me and held out his hand. I took it, letting him pull me onto the dance floor, not far from where Leah was dancing with Ian, both of them grinning at each other as they talked while they danced, their arms wrapped around each other like they\u2019d been together for years.</p><p>She glanced my way and I saw her jaw drop and her eyes widen comically as she watched Brandon swing me around and pull me close. I couldn\u2019t do anything but smile wryly and shrug before I wrapped my arms around his neck and moved with him.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak for a bit, just danced together. Finally I pulled slightly away and looked up at him. And when I say looked up, I mean up. At 6\u20193\u201d, he towered over my measly 5\u20196\u201d, and...he\u2019s fucking H.O.T. Seriously, sex-on-a-stick, panty-wetting, hell, panty-dropping, fiiiiine. Smokey grey-blue eyes, close cropped dark hair, a smile that drops me to my knees, and tattoos...mmmmm...all over his gorgeous hard body.</p><p>\u201cWanna take a picture, sunshine? It\u2019ll last longer.\u201d</p><p>I blinked and ducked my head, flushing once again in embarrassment from being caught staring. Again. Geez.</p> <p>He chuckled and pulled me a little closer in, still swaying in circles as the music changed, being replaced by another slow song. This time it was With or Without You by U2.</p><p>I glanced up at him and looked away, staring out over all the other couples dancing as I asked, \u201cSo, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cMet a couple friends down here for a beer after we closed up the shop today. What are you doing here? I saw you come in with Leah and Calland. Out having a good time tonight?\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to shrug. Our heads were angled close so we could speak over the music as we danced. \u201cI went with them to the UFC fight thingy like Leah asked me to this morning. So you worked today?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, I told Luke I would handle everything when I got there since we didn\u2019t have too many booked for the day and T.J. was there with us. So he went home to his crazy woman and the furry fiends.\u201d</p><p>I paused. \u201cWho\u2019s T.J.?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a new guy we had come in. Got a helluva portfolio and I met him at the convention out in L.A. We kept in touch and he called a couple weeks ago, said he was needing a change of pace and wanted to come visit. Good guy. Think he\u2019s got some baggage, though.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cWait, I didn\u2019t think the fight was even over yet. Why did you guys leave?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and grinned impishly, lifting one shoulder in a half-shrug of answer.</p><p>He sighed and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Before I got a chance to reply, a voice broke in, asking smoothly, \u201cMay I cut in?\u201d</p><p>I looked over into the grinning face of Ian, who was holding his hand out while standing there half-bent at the waist like an old-fashioned butler. There was something so disarming and genuine about him, I couldn\u2019t help but smile and nod, taking his hand easily and moving away from Brandon, who had gone completely still the minute I let go of him. As soon as I reached up to put my hands on Ian\u2019s shoulders, I saw Leah grab Brandon and try to get him to dance, but it wasn\u2019t happening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged her off and took a step in my direction, but then Ian glanced up and recognition flared in his eyes as he realized who I\u2019d been dancing with, apparently.</p><p>He let go of me and smiled, greeting Brandon with a \u2018Hey!\u2019 as they clasped hands and did the whole one-shoulder-man-hug thing. Brandon grinned back at him and Leah and I both looked at each other with confusion as we realized we were now standing still like morons in the middle of the floor while our dance partners ignored us.</p><p>Leah jerked her head toward the table and turned to go sit down. I followed, leaving the guys on the floor. Calland was standing beside the table looking out toward the crowded dance floor. We stopped beside him and realized that the red-head from the bar was standing with him.</p><p>\u201cHey, there you guys are. Your drinks are on the table and I swear I saw Brandon here somewhere. Do you think you guys could get a ride home from him tonight?\u201d He winked at us and I laughed as Leah gave a pretend shudder of disgust in return.</p> <p>\u201cYou whore,\u201d she muttered under her breath and then grinned at him when he laughed unashamedly.</p><p>Brandon broke in behind us. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get them home. Or we will...however it works out.\u201d</p><p>We all turned and noticed Ian standing with him. Leah moved toward Ian, and honestly, I don\u2019t think she even realized she did it. It\u2019s like they just gravitated toward each other and it was cute. Seriously cute.</p><p>Calland glanced between Ian and Brandon in surprise. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p><p>Brandon shook his head in affirmation, then said, \u201cYeah, how do you think he got all that awesome-ass ink?\u201d</p> <p>Calland inclined his head in acknowledgment. \u201cSweet. Alright then, I\u2019m gonna take Tiffany and get out of here, then.\u201d</p><p>Brandon broke in before Calland could leave. \u201cWait, so how do you know Ian?\u201d He addressed the question to Calland, but he looked at all of us for the answer.</p><p>\u201cThis drunk guy at the fight was getting pretty rowdy, spilled his beer all over Chloe, and then when we were standing, he basically clocked her pretty good and almost knocked her down. So then my sister decided she was going to jump the big bastard and Ian stepped in.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Ian, giving him a crooked grin and said, \u201cBy the way, thanks again, man, for helping out and getting Rocky out of there before she could hurt herself. Or anyone else.\u201d He grinned at his sister who pouted and punched him in the arm.</p><p>Ian grinned back, thumped Calland on the back and said, \u201cNo problem.\u201d He glanced at Leah from the corner of his eye and continued. \u201cI have a feeling that I\u2019ll probably see you again.\u201d</p><p>Awww. How sweet was that? Leah looked up at him with a shy smile, and I felt my lips stretching into a wide smile as she blushed for the first time in like...well, ever. I swear that girl has no shame. It was absolutely adorable to see her smitten. There was no other word for it, and I was getting the feeling that it might be mutual.</p> <p>I waved to Calland as he left and scooted inside the booth, moving further over when Brandon slid in beside me, pushing his thigh against mine. I moved over even more to put some distance between us and, thankfully or regretfully, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I should feel, he didn\u2019t move towards me anymore. Leah and Ian slid in across from us and, even though Brandon was a little quieter than normal, the next couple of hours were full of good food, good drinks, and good company. And a definite budding romance...</p><p>It was late when we finally left the bar, and neither one of us spoke as Brandon started his truck and pulled away.</p><p>\u201cThanks for giving me a ride home.\u201d</p><p>My words were quiet, barely breaking the silence filling the truck. It was just he and I because, surprise, surprise, Leah had gotten a ride from Ian. He had asked her if he could drop her off and she had accepted before the words were totally even out of his mouth. Brandon had vouched for him, so I wasn\u2019t too worried about her getting in the car with him and everything, even though they\u2019d just met tonight.</p><p>It made my heart ache, just a little, seeing that instant attraction, that bond being forged right in front of me between them. It was bittersweet, but I was happy for Leah. She deserved to find someone that made her feel special and loved. I could only hope that it was the beginning of a very good thing for her.</p><p>Brandon jerked his chin, I guess in acknowledgment of my thanks, but he didn\u2019t say a word, not even when he pulled into my driveway and shut off his truck.</p><p>We sat in silence, but for the first time in a long while, it wasn\u2019t awkward. At least not much. I was sort of at a loss, to be honest. Not a word had been spoken about this morning - about the kiss or anything else.</p><p>The kiss. Oh, God. My thighs clenched as the memory of his lips on mine once again flashed through my mind, the sweet heat of his mouth, the nip of his perfect, white teeth, the slow thrust and curl of his tongue tangling with mine...</p> <p>A shuddering breath left my lips, seeming to echo in the silence surrounding us as we sat in the darkness. All of a sudden, his closeness was too much and too little, all at the same time. I needed to get out of there, and fast, before I climbed over the console and attacked him like a lust-crazed psychopath. Or was it sociopath? Ugh.</p><p>I reached for the door handle but my mouth decided to become animated on its own and I blurted out, \u201cDo you want to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah. Sure.\u201d He paused. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to get out of the vehicle, tugging my keys from my purse and fumbling at the lock until he took them from my hand and unlocked the door smoothly and quickly, smirking at me. The glow from the moon bathed his face in shadows, sharpening the angles of it until they stood out in stark relief, making him look even sexier and...dangerous.</p><p>My breath caught and my stomach dropped, but I still had no idea where we stood, and I was beginning to think I never would.</p><p>We still didn\u2019t speak as we went inside, parting ways at the door to the spare bedroom when he went in and shut the door behind him. I continued on to my room, stripped down and fell onto the bed without bothering to put any clothes on, suddenly worn out.</p><p>I laid in the darkness, my eyes feeling heavy. My last thought before the dark swept me under was relief that maybe I\u2019d actually get some sleep tonight...</p><p>With a shaking hand, I combed my long blonde locks, staring at myself in the mirror. My eyes were dark, haunted and huge in the gaunt face of the stranger looking back at me. I closed my eyes, disgusted with myself. How the hell did I get like this? How did this happen? My God I\u2019m so fucking pathetic.</p><p>I started as the door slammed downstairs, panic flooding through me as I realized I wasn\u2019t in the kitchen, standing at the counter where I was supposed to be. Disgust with myself turned to terror as I ran, tripping down the stairs and twisting my ankle in my haste but not caring. The pain of that would fade quickly beneath the onslaught of my \u2018punishment.\u2019</p><p>Limping into the kitchen, I gripped the edge of the counter and waited, head down, eyes shut. I knew what was coming...I just didn\u2019t want to see it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. The first blow came quietly and quickly in the form of a well-placed kick directly to the ankle I\u2019d just twisted. I bit my tongue to hold back my cries, agony flashing through me in a red hot haze as I grappled to keep hold of the counter and not fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAh, gonna play the silent strong type today, huh, honey? Is that what this is? Can\u2019t be where you\u2019re supposed to be, bitch, and now you want to play games with me? I\u2019ll make you fucking cry, you little cunt. Let me hear you!\u201d Greg roared, kicking out at my ankle again as the open palm of his hand met my cheek, causing my head to jerk violently to the side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I managed to stay on my feet somehow, but I couldn\u2019t control my scream as he punched me in the face. It was enough to make my nose bleed, the warm wetness trailing over my lips and dripping off my chin, but somehow I knew that he hadn\u2019t broken it. Not yet, at least.</p><p>I tried to contain my sobs as I sank to my knees, unable to stand the pain rolling through my ankle any longer, though the pain in my face was a close second. And then...Oh, God. No...</p><p>Immediately, I realized my mistake.</p><p>The sound of a belt being loosened and then whipped through belt loops made me whimper, the sound lost in the hateful words spewing from Greg\u2019s lips.</p> <p>\u201cSince you\u2019re down there, whore, open wide. I\u2019m gonna enjoy seeing you bleed while I fuck that nasty little mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>I felt his fingers tangle viciously in my hair, jerking my head back. I screamed and he thrust forward with his hips...</p><p>\u201cCHLOE! Jesus, sunshine, please open your eyes, wake up!\u201d</p><p>I could hear Brandon, his words loud and tinged with fear and desperation as I fought to free myself from my dream. I could feel the bitterness of remembered pain echoing along my body, every inch of me shaking and shuddering, my chests heaving as I gasped for breath.</p><p>I sat up, my eyes clashing with his stormy gaze, realizing that he had me by the shoulders, his grip almost edging on bruising. As soon as our eyes met he jerked me forward into his arms, crushing me to his chest and holding me tight, murmuring into my hair, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just a nightmare, baby, alright? You\u2019re safe, sunshine, I\u2019m here...\u201d</p> <p>I shivered again, shaking off the vestiges of the dream...the memories...and snuggled deeper into him, letting him soothe me, soaking the heat of him into my chilled flesh.</p><p>We stayed like that for a while, Brandon rocking me gently as he murmured reassurances and smoothed his hand down my back.</p><p>When my breathing had calmed and the tears I hadn\u2019t realized were coursing down my face had dried, he asked softly, \u201cAre you okay? Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and settled even closer before I answered. \u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s just...just a nightmare. Like before.\u201d</p><p>I felt him shake his head, his chin brushing the top of my head as he did so. \u201cNo, Chloe, that wasn\u2019t a nightmare like before. This one was worse than any I\u2019ve ever heard you have before. You were screaming like someone was...like you were being hurt. Badly.\u201d His voice shook as he forced the words out.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut, not wanting to have this conversation, but knowing he wasn\u2019t going to let me off so easily.</p> <p>\u201cI...just...remember when I came here?\u201d I asked, quietly.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, though I could tell he wasn\u2019t satisfied with my answer when he tensed against me.</p><p>Without thinking, seeking only to soothe him like he did me, I pressed my lips to his chest, kissing the words inked across his heart. The firm, heated feel of his skin against my lips sent a thrill through me, settling in my stomach as the butterflies awoke once again.</p><p>He made a rough sound in his throat and I moved, pressing my lips to his bare skin again, this time tasting him with the tip of my tongue, earning another throaty growl. Lust rushed through me and I shifted, pressing myself against him as I worked small, nipping kisses up his throat and across his jaw until I reached the corner of his mouth. A soft, breathy sigh left my lips as he turned and our mouths met in a gentle, hesitant kiss.</p><p>His hand came up to cup my shoulder before sliding down my back until it gripped my hip, his fingers sinking into the soft, bare flesh there.</p><p>Just like that, clarity hit. And it hit both of us like a white hot bolt of lightning.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Brandon growled as he pushed away from me, jumping off the bed as I scrambled to grab my blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re naked!\u201d he yelled, accusingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my room, in my bed!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you in and you weren\u2019t complaining just a minute ago!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d he yelled back.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019re wearing much either, Goddamnit!\u201d I yelled even louder.</p><p>He glanced down at himself, shouting another heartfelt \u2018FUCK\u2019 as he realized he didn\u2019t have anything on but a pair of tight, dark grey boxer briefs that did nothing to hide the hard length of his erection.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help what he does!\u201d he roared at me, palming himself through his shorts to try and adjust things so it wasn\u2019t so noticeable. Not that it helped. At all.</p><p>We glared at each other silently for a minute before the absurdity of the situation struck me and I started giggling. I giggled louder as he scowled even harder at me, and then outright belly laughed when his lips twitched and his scowl started to slip.</p><p>He finally gave up trying to hold onto his glare and laughed with me until we were both breathless, grinning at each other like lunatics. No doubt, anyone who saw us at that moment would seriously question our sanity, especially with him standing in nothing but boxer briefs and a raging erection (no, it hadn\u2019t gone down at all) and me naked in the bed clutching a blanket to my chest.</p><p>As we continued to stare at each other, our grins started to fade. Brandon shifted and turned away from me, trying for belated modesty, as he cleared his throat and asked gruffly, \u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered softly.</p><p>He nodded once and gave me an appraising look before he turned and left the room, gently closing the door behind him.</p><p>Sighing, I slid back down in my bed and willed myself to find sleep again...preferably without the nightmares this time.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The rest of my weekend was unimpressive. I called Leah to check on her but got no response other than a text letting me know that she was alright and would call me soon. I called my brother, but he and Allie sounded preoccupied, and I didn\u2019t even bother calling Emma. I hadn\u2019t heard from Brandon, either, so all in all, it was a pretty boring Sunday. Monday and Tuesday were more of the same, although I did stay pretty busy at work with Allie.</p><p>The beeping of my phone woke me up on Wednesday morning. I rolled over and grabbed for it, yawning as I noted a text from Allie.</p><p>Hey, woman! I know you aren\u2019t supposed to come into the store until noon today, but I forgot about my doctor\u2019s appointment at 10:00. Could you come in early? Please? You love me!</p><p>I chuckled at her perkiness; no way in hell could I be that perky in the morning. I needed coffee first. I got up and shuffled into the kitchen to make a cup, texting her back as I went: Sure. No prob. Just let me pink my coffee and I\u2019ll be on my way.</p><p>My phone beeped again just as my coffee got done brewing. I took a sip as I looked at it, immediately spraying the scalding hot fluid all over the counter as I read her reply and double checked what I had texted her.</p><p>Pink your coffee? What is that, tea-bagging for women?</p><p>I groaned as I replied: Damn autocorrect! I meant DRINK my coffee. But good one!</p><p>Her reply was immediate. I know, right? Can you imagine what that would look like, though? I mean, it\u2019s bad enough when you think of a man tea-bagging, but...</p><p>Oh, Lord. Mental image I so did not need. I shook my head as I typed: Yeah, thanks. That\u2019s an image I didn\u2019t want stuck in my head this early in the morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least you weren\u2019t actually tea-bagged. Have you ever been tea-bagged?</p><p>I groaned even louder this time, replying: O.M.G. Seriously...I\u2019m done.</p><p>I laid my phone down after receiving that last reply from her, cleaned up my coffee mess, and went to get ready, intending to ignore my phone and any other crude questions Allie may come up with.</p><p>I let my mind wander while I showered and it immediately went back to Saturday night when Brandon had busted into my room to wake me up. My belly immediately dipped, desire flooding my veins as I remembered the very impressive length of him outlined under his boxer briefs. And then the kiss...and the feel of his fingers digging into my hips. Oh, God, to feel him doing that while he thrust into me!</p> <p>Ugh! On a growl, I slapped the water off and toweled off vigorously, cursing myself for getting all worked up before stomping to my room to get dressed.</p><p>Three hours later, I was working on pricing some new stuff Allie had gotten in when the bells chimed on the door. I glanced up and smiled as Allie\u2019s Nanny came through the door, an old farmer\u2019s hat smashed down on her head and a pair of ratty overalls on over a t-shirt, with the pant legs rolled up.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my lily-girl?\u201d she asked in her gravelly voice, coming over and kissing me on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe had a doctor\u2019s appointment today, Nanny. She\u2019ll be in later. Did you need something?\u201d</p><p>In the months I\u2019d been working at the store, Nanny (on pain of being slapped silly, I\u2019d been told to call her Nanny, too) had taken to stopping by even more frequently now that Allie was pregnant. From what I\u2019ve been told, she\u2019d also started stopping by Skin Deep to see Emma, too, and everyone there was getting a big kick out of her. How could you not, though? You never know what you\u2019re gonna get...one minute she\u2019s a happy little bird, and the next, Tank is on the loose!</p> <p>Nanny shrugged and meandered over toward the lingerie section, trying to look nonchalant. I pretended not to see, as usual, as I listened to her. \u201cNope. Just got bored piddle-fucking around in the garden, so I thought I\u2019d come see my girls.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. As soon as she said \u2018fuck,\u2019 my mind immediately whispered the same thing Allie\u2019s whole family does every time they hear her. \u2018Aaaawww...Nanny said fuck!\u2019</p><p>She snorted and I moved a little so I could see her better. She\u2019d picked up a vintage teddy of champagne lace and was holding it up to her bony little chest. She shook her head and muttered, \u201cWho wears white anymore? Bunch of damn sluts running around. Need some black lace...now that\u2019s sexy!\u201d</p><p>Yikes.</p><p>I cleared my throat and asked her, \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppy?\u201d</p><p>She moved away from the lingerie toward the romance book rack, a guilty pleasure she shared with her daughter and granddaughter both, though neither she nor Allie\u2019s mom would admit it. Allie, on the other hand, didn\u2019t care who knew that she read them.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cHe got all hot and bothered by me in my gardening getup and then exhausted himself with the wheelbarrow.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSo you working in the garden made him work, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me like I was crazy. \u201cLord, child, no! You know, the wheelbarrow, where I put my hands down and he lifts me up and wraps my legs around his waist upside down and...\u201d She started motioning with her arms and hips.</p><p>\u201cNanny! Look at the time! I have to get the inventory done!\u201d I yelled, trying to cut her off before I ended up needing to scour my ears with bleach any more than I already did.</p><p>She peered down at her wristwatch and sighed. \u201cHmpfh. I guess I\u2019ve left Daisy sitting out there long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...Allie\u2019s mom is in the car?\u201d I asked, trying to keep the incredulity out of my voice.</p><p>The door chimed again and Allie\u2019s mom walked in, Brandon following behind.</p><p>What the...what?</p> <p>\u201cHooey!\u201d Nanny crowed. \u201cThere\u2019s my hot body! You decide you wanna try this ol\u2019 filly, yet?\u201d she asked him, winking and waggling her eyebrows at him crazily.</p><p>He laughed, tactfully ignoring her offer, and grabbed her up into a hug, jumping when she pinched his ass as he moved away. Allie\u2019s mom, Daisy, shook her head and rolled her eyes at her mom\u2019s behavior.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you ready to go? I thought you just needed to come in and get something Allie was holding for you?\u201d She looked around. \u201cWhere is my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Nanny interjected, explaining what I\u2019d already told her. Daisy looked confused. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s appointment today. She doesn\u2019t go until next week on Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>Aaaaand now I\u2019m suspicious.</p><p>I just shrugged it off and hugged them both goodbye, laughing again as Brandon masterfully evaded Nanny\u2019s grabby claws and hugged her before they left.</p><p>Once the bell chimed their departure, Brandon turned to me and said, \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do this. I have to be back at the shop by two, but you have me until then.\u201d</p><p>Huh? I stared at him, completely lost.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAllie called and said she needed me to come down and move some boxes for you. She had to run into the city with Jacks for something...but you said she had a doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d</p><p>I nodded very slowly as he cocked his head, confusion now becoming clear on his face.</p><p>\u201cUh, so do you have boxes that need moved?\u201d he asked, cautiously. I could see that he was starting to work things out a little bit.</p><p>I shook my head. He groaned.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve been set up,\u201d he said on a sigh.</p><p>I looked at him helplessly, shrugging one shoulder. What could I say?</p><p>His phone rang in his pocket, breaking the silence stretching between us. He dug it out and answered. \u201cHello? Yes, Allie.\u201d A pause. \u201cNo, I...okay. Yeah, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll ask, I guess.\u201d He paused once more, listening intently, and then must have decided to interject. \u201cHey, Allie. While I\u2019ve got you on the phone, why the hell did you say Chloe needed help--\u201d He turned to look at me, shock written across his face.</p><p>\u201cShe hung up on me. She literally made noises like her phone was cutting out, told me her phone was breaking up, and hung up on me! That little...\u201d</p><p>I moved away from him, grabbing a stack of books to add to the rack. \u201cI guess you can go on back to the shop, then. I\u2019m sorry about...\u201d I gestured vaguely before continuing, \u201call of this. I don\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I will go back. Shit was weird today, right? Not just me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTotally weird. Not just you, I promise,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, Allie wanted me to ask if you would come to dinner at Emma\u2019s house tonight with me. Emma apparently is feeling like the group hasn\u2019t spent much time together lately, and wants me to bring you. Not sure why Emma didn\u2019t call you, or even me, for that matter, but whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh...I guess? I can just meet you there, though. You don\u2019t have to pick me up, I\u2019ll just come directly after I close up the store this evening.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t fight me on it, not that I thought he would, gave me a wink, a quick smile, and he was gone. I thumped my head down on the counter in front of me, cursing Allie and Emma and their interfering under my breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rest of the day passed without incident, which was a relief. Allie came in looking sheepish at about two, and we worked without talking much, each trying to avoid the giant elephant in the room. We closed the store at six and she rushed off, calling over her shoulder to remind me about dinner.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I pulled up at Emma and Luke\u2019s house, having only stopped to put gas in the car. It didn\u2019t look like anyone else was there yet, except for Allie and Emma. I walked up on the porch and jerked my hand back when I heard them talking inside. The window was open, so I could hear every word.</p><p>\u201cWell how the hell was I supposed to know? Do you think I planned on my mom and Nanny being there? I was only supposed to get him over there and I did. What the hell did you do?\u201d Allie sounded surly.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know, maybe keep your lies straight? Cheese and rice, woman! They\u2019re onto us!\u201d Emma\u2019s voice was shrill with what could only be described as exhilarated fear, which made for an interesting sounding combination. \u201cAnd this was your turn, damnit, so what was I supposed to do?\u201d</p> <p>Emma sighed and started speaking again. \u201cI talked to my sister and she said she walked in on a very, very heated conversation between them at Chloe\u2019s house on Saturday. Apparently that kiss between them made a very big impression on him. I know Chloe likes him, and I know she\u2019s struggling with the whole friendship thing, just like he is, but I swear. Ever since they\u2019ve gotten back, it\u2019s been fucking painful to have them in the same room together. I can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t see it before...it wasn\u2019t angry tension, it was fucking sexual tension!\u201d she crowed.</p><p>I had to strain to hear Allie\u2019s next words and they made my heart ache, but in a good way.</p><p>\u201cAre we doing the right thing, Em? I know she really does like him. I can see it in her eyes, and it was never something she intended, either. Not to mention, I think he\u2019s totally seeing her in a new light since that road trip. I think they would be great together, but I just...I don\u2019t want to hurt either one of them. I love them both, you know?\u201d</p><p>I heard Emma sigh, \u201cI know Allie, I know. Too late now, though.\u201d</p><p>Allie giggled as Emma continued. \u201cWe\u2019re in too deep!\u201d</p> <p>I huffed and knocked on the door, chuckling at the chaos that erupted inside. Yips, barks, woofs, and growls accompanied a flurry of scrabbling sounds as the dogs went wild trying to get to the door.</p><p>\u201cDamn dogs!\u201d I heard Emma yell before the door was wrenched open, releasing the flood of canines upon me.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I cried as I tried to sidestep them so I wouldn\u2019t be sent flying.</p><p>\u201cChloe!\u201d Allie cooed sweetly. I could see the panic in her eyes, though, wondering what I\u2019d heard, if anything.</p><p>Emma pushed her aside and waddled her way outside onto the porch, yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t you do it, Doug! Don\u2019t you dare! You\u2019ll be a bad dad...DJ! Come back here!\u201d She glared at Allie, growling, \u201cHelp me! Call your dog back, too, damnit!\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder to see Doug running hell bent for leather into the woods, DJ and Grady hot on his heels.</p> <p>Allie and Emma both started hollering for them, but they were ignored. They both started cussing under their breath at the same time, too, which was cracking me up.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019re they going?\u201d I asked conversationally.</p><p>Emma sighed deeply, sounding very resigned when she said, \u201cDoug found a stupid skunk nest. I sent Luke out to try to get rid of them somehow without killing them...did you know that some people have skunks for pets? You can get rid of their scent sacs or something like that, and they\u2019re just like a cat! They\u2019re so cute...anyway, he couldn\u2019t get anywhere near the nest, or where he thinks it is, because the stench is so strong. He stumbled out of the woods holding his stomach and dry heaving. It was bad. Funny...but bad.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cSo now Doug is obsessed and his little followers are just like little lambs being led to slaughter.\u201d</p><p>Allie and Emma both nodded, while Emma replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve been lucky so far. Doug is the only one who is consistently getting sprayed. I think he\u2019s addicted to the scent, and the tomato juice baths afterward. Since I\u2019m pregnant, I get a pass, but Brandon and Luke have been flipping coins to see who has to bathe him. Damn dog.\u201d</p><p>She looked out over the yard and chuckled when she saw the two little pups running like mad back toward the house. Doug was trotting behind them, tongue lolling out the side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGuess we got lucky, today, huh?\u201d Allie asked.</p><p>Emma grinned at her again. \u201cNope, we didn\u2019t, but the guys sure did!\u201d</p> <p>The dogs came back into the house and Allie grabbed up Grady, coddling him like a baby, but I couldn\u2019t say much because I did the same to DJ. I gotta say, Doug and his little girlfriend sure made some cute babies!</p><p>After playing with the puppies for a few minutes, I cornered the two women. \u201cAlright. Spill.\u201d</p><p>Twin expressions of exaggerated innocence stared back at me.</p><p>\u201cYour wide-eyed, who me expressions aren\u2019t going to cut it. You know what I\u2019m talking about, and Emma might has well have put up a billboard saying you guys were up to something. So, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I narrowed my gaze at both of them, looking first at Emma and then cocking my head and staring even more intently at Allie.</p><p>She looked defiant for a second before she deflated, the sourest look I\u2019ve ever seen moving across her face. Emma looked relieved once she saw that Allie was going to cave.</p><p>\u201cAlright, fine! I set you up, sent Brandon over to the shop to help you, but I got sidetracked and forgot to make sure I had the boxes there! There was supposed to be boxes and then you two would spend time together and...and...oh, hell. I didn\u2019t think it through! I was just on a high from managing to put the bug in his ear about staying at your place since it\u2019s technically closer and he did. So...\u201d</p><p>Her face became immediately animated again, but it was more on the gleefully evil side; well, not really evil, but more like mischievous.</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen?\u201d</p><p>She looked so hopeful, and so did Emma. I couldn\u2019t help it, I blurted out, \u201cWe kissed again! Twice!\u201d</p><p>Twin gasps sounded and they oohed and ahhed over it for a second but the distinctive slams of car doors closing stopped the conversation cold. Male voices and laughter rang out, causing the dogs to go crazy again, and Emma and Allie immediately began grinning, the anticipation on their faces so adorable to see.</p><p>Luke and Brandon walked in, Jackson right behind them, followed by another guy that I didn\u2019t know. He was tattooed, and had black hair, shaved on the sides with a short, spiky mohawk that looked like it was dipped in fire. The color was vivid, fading from black to blonde to orange, with the tips a flaming red. He had on aviators, so I couldn\u2019t see his eyes, but he was drop dead gorgeous in a very sexy-yet-dangerous way.</p><p>His face was scruff covered, like he hadn\u2019t shaved in a few days, and he was wearing a tight black t-shirt with ripped and faded jeans over...I did a double take, sure I didn\u2019t see correctly, but I did. He had black leather flip flops on his very neat but manly feet, definitely not what I had expected.</p><p>\u201cHey, T.J.!\u201d Allie and Emma both said, embracing the stranger readily with hugs before they claimed their men with heartfelt kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luke and Jackson said hi to me and gave me hugs when they came up for air before Brandon introduced T.J. to me. \u201cThis is Chloe, Jackson\u2019s sister. Chloe, this is T.J., the guy I met at the convention in L.A.\u201d</p><p>I held out my hand and he took it in his, holding it as he murmured, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes never left my face as I nodded and replied, \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>He winked in response and dropped my hand as Brandon suddenly moved, slinging an arm around my shoulder and squeezing me tight as he quipped, \u201cShe\u2019s our little Cali-girl.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded like a conversation opening, what with T.J. being from California, as well, but it clearly wasn\u2019t as Brandon maneuvered me around toward the kitchen. I sent an apologetic smile over my shoulder at T.J., because I\u2019m not a rude person and that, frankly, struck me as rude on Brandon\u2019s behalf. So wait. Was he jealous? No...that couldn\u2019t be it.</p><p>T.J. just gave me an enigmatic half-smile and turned his attention back to Jackson, who\u2019d asked him something as he tucked Allie into his side once more.</p><p>Brandon let me go as we got to the kitchen table and looked at Emma who was waddling around gathering paper plates and napkins. The doorbell rang, causing the dogs to go crazy again and Luke hollered at them to stop while he went to answer the door.</p><p>Twenty minutes later found us all stuffing our faces with pizza and making grossed out faces at Allie who had a pizza to herself because she wanted pickles on it. Even Jackson looked mildly repulsed as she devoured piece after piece like a starving woman.</p><p>At one point she looked up, noticing that everyone was staring at her with varying expressions of disgust on their faces and said, \u201cWhat? Like I\u2019m the only one in the world who eats pickles? I don\u2019t think so. Emma, you eat pickles all the time, and Chloe, you just ate pickles wrapped in a piece of cheese the other day, so...\u201d She cocked her head in a little \u2018what now\u2019 move and took another huge bite of pizza.</p> <p>Emma laughed and inclined her head, acknowledging Allie\u2019s point, but then qualified it a little. \u201cTrue, and Chloe, that sounds a little disturbing in itself, but Allie, you\u2019re eating pickles on pizza. Pickles are not a normal pizza topping and you\u2019ve never eaten them like that before.\u201d</p><p>Allie just shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, bitches. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed at her and dinner wore on, full of smiles and the easy camaraderie I\u2019ve come to expect from this group. It warmed my heart to be included in it and I felt so blessed that they took me in with open arms, making me a part of it like I\u2019d always been there. I think it said even more about the depth of love they had for each other, as friends and family, that this group had been born out of one little trip to a tattoo shop almost two years ago. It\u2019s a beautiful thing, I promise.</p><p>I noticed T.J. out of the corner of my eye, sitting there sort of quietly. It\u2019s not that he wasn\u2019t participating, or that he was excluded, because that\u2019s not it. In fact, everyone had embraced him just as readily. It was more of him just being...watchful. He\u2019d taken off his glasses earlier and I\u2019d finally gotten a look at his eyes. They were honeyed brown, like warm whiskey with the sunlight shining through. Breathtaking.</p><p>He caught me looking and I flushed, smiling and quickly looking away. I heard a huff beside me and realized that Brandon had witnessed the interaction and, if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, I\u2019d almost swear he was jealous. But, as I\u2019d told myself earlier, that couldn\u2019t possibly be true. Could it?</p><p>Perplexed, I grabbed my pizza off my plate and took a big bite, getting even more flustered when a piece of pepperoni flew off and dropped into my lap. I dropped my pizza back on my plate and grabbed my napkin to wipe my hands and face before I went to grab for the wayward slice. But...I never got to grab it.</p> <p>\u201cWHOA!\u201d I yelled as, suddenly, a hundred pounds plus of yellow fur and a wet pointy nose shoved into my lap under the table, snuffling and snorting to reach the dropped pepperoni. I tried and tried to push him back but couldn\u2019t, scrambling at the same time to shove back my chair and stand, but I only succeeded in somehow falling off the side of my chair onto the floor where I was bombarded with exuberant doggy kisses.</p><p>I heard everyone laughing and Luke hollering at the dogs to leave me alone, which they finally did, trotting off happily, Doug smacking his lips with satisfaction at having retrieved his unexpected treat.</p><p>Me? I just laid there on the floor. I really would have just stayed down there, but then Brandon\u2019s face appeared over mine, fighting a smile as he tried to look concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou alright down there?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Dinner wound down eventually with everyone still laughing at my unfortunate floor dive. Leah had shown up late and they had quickly filled her in, allowing her to join in their glee at my expense.</p><p>Allie and Jackson were the first ones to leave the get together, grabbing Grady and heading out the door with a brief wave, the looks on their faces making it clear exactly what their intentions were. I didn\u2019t know how they were going to survive the six weeks after she had the baby. Or Luke and Emma, either, for that matter.</p><p>They were giving each other that look, too, which made Leah give her grossed out face and take off, beeping her horn and setting Doug to howling, DJ yipping along with him. Brandon had stepped out on the porch with T.J., after T.J. had said his goodbyes. He\u2019d only been able to quickly shake my hand again before Brandon had called him away to walk outside, leaving me the only one in the house with the love birds.</p> <p>I heard Luke murmur something to Emma, making her giggle and slap at him, telling him to behave and that was definitely my cue to leave. I told them goodbye, accepting hugs and more good natured ribbing from them before I gave goodbye rubs to Doug and DJ and headed out the door, making my way toward my car where Brandon was standing, having just waved as T.J. pulled out of the drive.</p><p>He turned to me and asked, \u201cYou heading out?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trying not to laugh at his wistful expression. He glanced back at the house, roughed his hands over his head and face and muttered something about going to the shop for a while.</p><p>I took pity on him. \u201cYou can come stay at my place tonight, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He asked, looking hopeful.</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re not gonna wanna be here,\u201d I said ruefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just grab some clothes and meet you there, okay?\u201d he said as he turned to go inside. He paused, hesitation clearly written across his features before he asked, \u201cUh, so...um, you cool if I just stay for a while?\u201d</p><p>Surprise flashed through me and I struggled to hide it as I stammered, \u201cY-uh-yeah, th-that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and jogged inside. I stood there staring after him for a moment in a daze before I shook it off and made the drive home.</p><p>I paced through the house, waiting on him to show up, berating myself the whole time. \u2018Why the HELL would you agree to this? Geez, you\u2019re a dumbass Chloe Jane Matthews. Can\u2019t keep your fucking head together around him, want to do nothing but jump his damn bones and you tell him he can LIVE WITH YOU?\u2019</p><p>\u201cWell, what the hell was I supposed to do?\u201d I yelled out loud at myself, immediately feeling stupid for actually carrying on a conversation with myself like a crazyass.</p><p>I speared my fingers through my hair and gave a quick tug, hoping the slight sting would help bring me back from the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I whirled as a knock sounded at the door before the knob rattled and Brandon let himself in. He looked at me in surprise, which gave way to puzzlement as he froze and just stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Huh?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d I asked, and then continued, \u201cNope. Nevermind,\u201d as I realized that I still had my fingers tangled in my hair. I gave a small, exasperated groan and released my hold as he just grinned at me and came all the way in, closing the door behind him and locking it with the deadbolt.</p><p>I flopped down on the couch with a huff as he just shook his head and lugged the duffle he was carrying into the spare bedroom. He came back and plopped down beside me, patting my leg and smiling once more.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay with me staying here?\u201d he asked, still smiling, albeit very cautiously.</p><p>I turned to him, feeling like an ass. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s completely fine! Don\u2019t worry about it at all, you can stay as long as you want. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to run you out of the house having loud sex every night. Hell, you\u2019d be hard pressed to hear me moan while I\u2019m-\u201d My words choked off, my eyes widening in horror at what I was about to reveal to him.</p><p>Brandon sat up, totally perked up by the turn in conversation. \u201cWhat was that, Chloe?\u201d he asked, smiling widely.</p> <p>I shook my head, refusing to answer the question. \u201cWant to watch a movie with me?\u201d I asked him, hoping to change the subject, or at least distract him long enough for him to forget the word vomit that just flew out of my mouth.</p><p>He agreed, winking at me, letting me know that he knew what I was doing. But I didn\u2019t care, by God, because we were so totally not going there. Not with him blowing so hot and cold on me all the time, kissing me one minute until I\u2019m ready to burst into flame, and then ramming the \u2018F\u2019 word down my throat. You know...friend.</p><p>I jumped up and grabbed the first movie that I laid my hand on, which turned out to be Friends with Benefits. Very funny, very sweet movie with a very hot Mila Kunis and a surprisingly decent Justin Timberlake. I put it in and hit play, sinking back down onto the couch beside him without a second thought.</p><p>We watched and laughed until we got to the sex parts...God, how could I forget how many of those there were in this movie? And it\u2019s not like they were all that hot; in fact, they were pretty humorous, too, but still.</p><p>Hyperawareness prickled down every nerve in my body when Brandon shifted. I moved my legs restlessly, my knee and thigh connecting with him every time I did. I didn\u2019t realize we were sitting so close. I blinked and took a deep breath, letting it out on a sigh as I looked around the room, taking my eyes off the fuck-fest on the screen in front of me for a moment.</p><p>The living room was shrouded in darkness, the only light coming from the TV. I hadn\u2019t even noticed that it\u2019d gotten dark outside.</p> <p>Brandon shifted beside me again, his thigh connecting with mine once more, and this time he didn\u2019t move it away. A jagged breath puffed from my lips, the slight sound seeming so...needy, so desperate in the darkness, even as the characters bantered wittily on the screen.</p><p>\u201cChloe.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and peeked up at him when my name left his lips on a whisper. He was staring at me, his stormy eyes drinking me in, taking me under. The air turned electric, the hyperawareness I\u2019d felt thrumming through me like I\u2019d been hooked up to a 12 volt and tossed in a tub of water.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I answered, whispering back to him.</p><p>His eyes searched my face and then he gave a muttered curse before his lips crashed onto mine, his tongue spearing into my mouth and stealing my breath, along with every coherent thought in my head. I kissed him back like I was starving, the heady thrust and parry of tongues, the sweet, sharp stings of teeth nipping at lips driving me crazy as a wave of lust crashed over me.</p><p>I shot up and over him, shoving him against the back of the couch as I straddled his lap, moaning into his mouth when that achy part of me nestled against the incredibly hard length of him, feeling the exquisite heat of him even through our clothes. I bucked my hips to grind myself against him, the wildness taking me over and pushing me to the razor-sharp edge of a world shattering climax. I arched into him more, the rigid line of him swelling even larger behind the seam of his jeans as I raced toward the finish line, taking what I wanted...no needed, what I\u2019d been craving for so long. All at once the wave crested and broke, drowning me in pleasure as I threw my head back, an uncontrollable scream tearing from my throat as I came.</p><p>I collapsed against his chest in a boneless heap, emotions warring inside me. I didn\u2019t know which should be the winner though; complete and utter satisfaction from that mind-blowing orgasm or mortification that I\u2019d just basically dry humped him like a rabid rabbit hopped up on ecstasy?</p><p>\u201cGod, Chloe!\u201d Brandon gasped out as his fingers clenched hard onto my hips, his chest heaving as he fought to catch his breath, cupping my shoulders with his hands to push me back a little at the same time.</p> <p>I whimpered in my throat and fought against him, not ready to face him. I was so scared at what I would see there. I didn\u2019t want him to regret it, and God help him if he threw that \u2018F\u2019 word out there again.</p><p>\u201cSunshine...\u201d he breathed, releasing one of his hands from my shoulder to run it soothingly down my cheek, bringing my face up to his. I felt myself melt at the look in his eyes, the sincerity that I had only hoped for rather than regret shining back at me from the stormy depths. He leaned his forehead against mine, letting out a breath before he kissed me softly, a tender, slight brush of his lips against mine that was over too quickly.</p><p>\u201cThat was...\u201d he broke off to touch his lips to mine once more, and then continued. \u201cFucking hell, that was so fucking hot, Chloe. Don\u2019t hide from me. Baby, you\u2019ve got me hanging by a thread here, so you need to tell me right now if you don\u2019t want to cross that line. I don\u2019t want to fight it anymore, can\u2019t fight it anymore. Your kisses set me on fire and I want nothing more than to take you back to your bedroom and worship every inch of you with my mouth before I bury myself balls deep inside your tight little body.\u201d</p><p>His words were ragged, his control clearly ready to snap and there was no way in hell I was gonna tell him no. This is what I\u2019d wanted ever since I\u2019d kissed him...things had already changed; we\u2019d already crossed that line, in my own mind at least, and there was no going back. I couldn\u2019t go back, even if I wanted to.</p><p>I leaned forward and pressed my lips to his in answer. On a groan, he slid both of his hands back down past my hips and clenched them tight on my thighs, just under my ass. I squeaked into his mouth and clung to him as he rose off the couch in a fluid movement, no hesitation whatsoever at my added weight, and strode down the hallway to my bedroom.</p><p>My body trembled in his arms, nervousness and desire curling together to land like a lead weight in the pit of my stomach, and it didn\u2019t get any better when he broke the kiss and dropped me gently on the bed, standing at the edge and just staring at me. I swallowed hard and fought the urge to cover myself, which was ridiculous considering I was still fully dressed.</p><p>Brandon held my gaze and began methodically stripping out of his clothes, the heat in his eyes scalding me with their intensity. My breath caught and my eyes widened as he peeled off his boxer briefs, his glorious hardness springing up from the material to bob gently before curving along his taut stomach, pointing directly up to his belly button. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A whispered sound of yearning slipped out between my lips at the sight of the mouth-wateringly impressive expanse of rigid flesh, turning into a moan as he curled his hand around his girth, stroking it firmly from tip to root, teasing me. Without warning, he was on the bed over me. Our mouths met again in a frenzied kiss, lips, teeth, and tongues tangling, breaking apart only long enough for Brandon to reach for my shirt, his hands working frantically to get me as naked as he was. I froze instantly, the word \u2018NO\u2019 dropping from my lips with the weight of a bomb.</p><p>Brandon stilled above me, and I regretted the outburst immediately, but...there were...he just...I wasn\u2019t ready for him to see me. \u201cLights, please. Turn them off,\u201d I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d he said softly, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful to me, sunshine. You don\u2019t ever have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, Brandon, just...please?\u201d I pleaded.</p> <p>He gave me a look filled with concern but complied, moving off the bed and hitting the lights so the room fell into darkness. As soon as the lights went out, I hurriedly stripped off my clothes, anticipating him returning to feel my bare skin, hoping he\u2019d be pleasantly surprised enough to forget about my hang-ups for now. I heard him shuffle around and waited for him to come back to bed, to pick up where we left off, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, the bathroom light clicked on.</p><p>\u201cBrandon,\u201d I started, my hands immediately moving to cover my body, but he cut me off.</p><p>\u201cChloe, don\u2019t hide from me. Trust me, baby, there\u2019s nothing that could make me want you less right now. Okay?\u201d He pulled the door shut, but didn\u2019t close it all the way, so that a sliver of light left a soft glow in the bedroom, casting shadows over everything, including my skin. I glanced down at myself, eyeing the patterns of light worriedly. The way the shadows fell, he could see me, but couldn\u2019t see...anything I didn\u2019t want him to see.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay, baby?\u201d he asked quietly, his voice so tender and careful that it brought tears to my eyes. I blinked them back frantically and nodded, adding a whispered \u2018yes\u2019 when I realized he might not be able to see my head move in the dimness.</p><p>He moved back to the bed, crawling over me and capturing my mouth in a sweet, questing kiss. I gasped against his lips as he finally settled against me, every inch of his rock hard body pressed against my smaller, softer one, his hips resting between my thighs, spreading them. I hooked my legs around his and moaned as the heavy length of his erection slid against my tender, wet folds, branding me with his heat. He thrust against me, the head of him breaching my drenched slit to slide through the wetness gathered there until it nudged my clit, making me jerk against him as pleasure shot through me like lightning.</p> <p>I growled in my throat, a low, wild sound that made him chuckle and shift, breaking away from the kiss as he sat back on his knees between my still wide-spread thighs. I arched my hips, wordlessly begging him to continue to no avail.</p><p>Time slowed to a crawl, every inch of me crying out for his touch, aching to feel him against me with nothing between us again, hip to hip, chest to chest, skin to skin.</p><p>\u201cBrandon...\u201d I whispered, pleading with him to move, to touch me...anything.</p><p>He stared down at me, taking in every detail of my body stretched out, opened completely for him, yet swathed in shadows and light. His gaze burned in the darkness, raking me from head to toe with a hunger that shook me to the core and left me even more breathless than I already had been.</p><p>As if in slow motion, his hand raised up and moved toward me until the pad of one finger gently traced the tender, pink lips of my sex, up and down, over and over again with maddeningly slow, deliberate motions, before he dipped slightly inside, his finger playing in the honeyed warmth gathered at my entrance.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured as he slicked my wetness up through my folds and then tapped the tip of his finger tenderly against the swollen bud of my clit. \u201cI want to taste you, Chloe,\u201d he growled softly when I cried out and arched into his hand.</p> <p>A ragged cry was torn from my throat as he moved suddenly, gripping my hips with his hands and lifting me up until my legs were draped over his shoulders and his lips were latched onto my clit, sucking the tiny nub mercilessly. My head thrashed against the mattress, my hands twisting into the covers as a red-hot haze of pleasure washed over me.</p><p>My head and shoulders were the only parts of my body still resting on the bed, but he held me effortlessly against his mouth, using his hands on my hips to move me where he wanted as he released my clit and his tongue darted out to dive deep inside me. He fucked me with his tongue, then, strong sure strokes that had me hovering on the edge, but he stopped every time I was ready to fly, flicking his tongue up and down my outer lips, nipping and sucking at each one until I was squirming against his face restlessly, seeking the relief he was so torturously denying me.</p><p>When his tongue slid through my folds once more, rubbing against my clit and then spearing inside me again, I cried out, a broken sound that turned into a wild scream that I couldn\u2019t control as white hot ecstasy rushed through every inch of my straining body, arching and writhing against his mouth as he brought me screaming, again and again until I was limp and shuddering in his hands.</p><p>Brandon gently lowered my body back to the bed but kept his mouth firmly on my mound, sweetly kissing my swollen folds and lapping up every drop of my release before he kissed his way up my body, settling his weight over me as his lips met mine in a hot, wet kiss. I could taste myself on his tongue and groaned as desire coiled in my belly again, shifting against him, loving the feel of my breasts crushed against the hardness of his chest.</p><p>He thrust his hips against me, the blunt tip of his length parting my folds and slipping just inside me before he stopped, squeezing his eyes shut as a shudder wracked his body. I whimpered at the feel of him stretching me and then gasped as he pulled away again.</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d he barked out in a hoarse voice, scrambling off the bed to his jeans, digging a foil square out of the back pocket. He tore it open, rolled it on, and was leaning over me again in record time, twin moans sounding from both of us as he pushed inside until he was buried to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d he asked, pressing his body against mine as he leaned in to capture my lips in a sweet, teasing kiss before he trailed tiny kisses along my jawline and then nuzzled my neck.</p><p>\u201cYessss...\u201d I hissed out, stretching languidly against him and wrapping my legs up and over his hips, the movement opening my thighs wider and allowing him to sink a little deeper inside me.</p> <p>We both groaned in unison as my inner muscles clenched around the hot hardness impaled so deep inside.</p><p>\u201cChloe, Jesus you\u2019re killing me here. Give me a second...stop squeezing me like that. You\u2019re so fucking tight...ah, God!\u201d Brandon rasped, the low tone of his voice thick with lust, which caused my walls to convulse around him again uncontrollably. \u201cI, I can\u2019t...\u201d Brandon stuttered out before he growled, \u201cAw, fuck...\u201d</p><p>And then he went wild, pulling almost all the way out of me and slamming back in, pounding into me over and over ruthlessly, a driving rhythm that pushed me over the edge almost immediately, the pleasure so all-encompassing that my vision dimmed and I saw stars. I was screaming uncontrollably, my nails raking down his back, but still he powered into me, thrusting so deep I couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and I began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt like I was one big, raw nerve; every movement of his body inside mine caused me to crest wave after wave, my slickened, swollen flesh grasping at the rock hard, heated length of him, sucking him back in, clenching and massaging and milking him with my inner muscles as I came and came and came.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh God, oh God, yes...yes, yes, yesyesyesyessss...oohh FUCK! BRANDON!\u201d The words were raw, torn from my throat on a scream as my body seized, convulsing under the seemingly endless onslaught of white hot ecstasy.</p><p>My body went limp, still shuddering underneath him as Brandon roared, his hardness jerking and twitching inside me with every hot spurt of his release, his hips locked tight to mine, before he collapsed over me.</p><p>His weight pressed me into the mattress, our passion-slicked skin sticking together, but I didn\u2019t care. We laid like that for what seemed like an eternity, both trying to catch our breath as aftershocks still zinged through our exhausted bodies, until Brandon groaned and hefted himself up on his arms, staring down into my eyes as he slowly, gently slid himself out of me. He leaned in and pressed his lips to mine quickly before rolling off the bed and making his way into the bathroom on unsteady legs to divest himself of the condom.</p> <p>He reappeared after a brief moment to see that I had moved under the covers and, without a word, flipped off the light in the bathroom and slid under the covers with me, pulling me against his chest as he wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>He held me tight and I snuggled into him, my eyelids drooping and sleep taking me under almost immediately.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Heavy breathing woke me in the morning, along with a weight sitting on my chest. Still exhausted from the night (Brandon woke me up twice more through the night; once with his tongue soothing my tender flesh, and the second time by sliding deep inside me and making love to me with slow, unhurried thrusts), I didn\u2019t even bother to open my eyes as I swatted at him with a hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m too sore and tired. You wore me out.\u201d</p> <p>In return, the weight shifted and my whole face was bathed by a slobbery, wet tongue. \u201cUGH!\u201d I yelled, jack-knifing up in the bed, my eyes popping open as I shouted, \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s so gross-\u201d My words cut off sharply when I noticed the small black lab sitting on the mattress in front of me, his head tilted to the side as he watched me curiously.</p><p>What the? \u201cGrady?\u201d</p><p>His wiry tail started a wagging frenzy, his whole little body wiggling along with the movement until he lunged at me, his tongue like a heat seeking missile aiming straight for my face once more. I grabbed for him, trying to hold him away from my face but he still got a few good licks in.</p><p>His paws were prancing a mile a minute, his excitement climbing higher and higher by the second and then...I shouldn\u2019t have laughed. I really shouldn\u2019t have. But I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Grady shifted in my hands and, during his crazy leg dance, his back paw came down...and seeing how Brandon was sleeping on his back beside me...it came down directly on Brandon\u2019s poor, unsuspecting, unguarded man bits.</p><p>He shot up in the bed on a high-pitched groan, doubling over and cupping his junk while I laughed uncontrollably, trying to corral the little dog so he couldn\u2019t do any more damage. I snorted as Brandon glared at me for laughing and then glared at Grady before he gingerly got out of bed and stomped into the bathroom, the sleek, taut muscles of his perfect, naked ass flexing as he went.</p> <p>With a final giggle, I snapped my fingers and told Grady to sit, pleasantly surprised when he immediately complied.</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell are you doing here, boy? Where\u2019s your mommy and daddy, huh?\u201d I cooed to him as I rubbed his adorable, furry little cheeks. I ran my hand down his head and heard paper crinkle when I touched his collar. Pulling him to me, I saw that a note had been tucked underneath it. I jerked it free and read what Allie had scrawled.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Aunt Chloe! Mommy and Daddy called to see if you\u2019d babysit me today but you didn\u2019t answer. Mommy says you don\u2019t have to go in to the store, Grandma Daisy is working to get a break from Nanny. She\u2019s driving her batty. Mommy and Daddy are going to Cincinnati so don\u2019t wait up. And I\u2019m sorry if I made any messes before you woke up...Mommy just shoved me in through the front door with my bag and ran like hell. Love, Grady\u2019</p><p>I winced as I read the last part and looked at Grady, trying to judge if he was looking guilty in any way, shape, or form but I couldn\u2019t tell. He\u2019s just too cute. \u201cWell, I guess we should go see if you made any messes. Or chewed on anything. Seriously, dude, you better not have chewed on anything!\u201d I said sternly, staring down into sweet, innocent, melted chocolate brown puppy eyes. He blinked up at me and I smiled at him, kissing his cute little nose before I moved him away and got up out of bed.</p><p>I reached for my robe, managing to get it on and tied before Brandon threw himself on the bed behind me, making me squeal as he reached out and dragged me backwards onto the bed again. I landed in a heap, tangled up with him, unable to move for laughing so hard.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he growled in my ear and then nipped at my neck, the scruff on his face tickling as it gently abraded my skin.</p><p>I giggled and then moaned as he bit down slightly on the curve of my neck, sending delicious chills down my spine to clash with the growing heat between my thighs. Breathless, I gasped, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be \u2018up\u2019 for anything after catching a paw to your nuts.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and nuzzled my neck again, his words rumbling in my ear as he asked, \u201cAh, worried about my nuts, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmhmmm...\u201d I murmured, getting lost in the small, biting kisses he was dotting down my jawline and throat.</p><p>Suddenly, a distinct chewing noise broke through my lust-induced stupor. I froze, shoving Brandon back and sitting up, frantically looking around for Grady. I groaned out, \u201cOh, no, Grady! Bad boy!\u201d</p><p>The little black puppy was sitting at the end of the bed, my living room tv remote clutched between his paws, teeth gnawing diligently on the corner. The power button kept lighting up red with every movement of his jaw, like a little evil eye winking and taunting me.</p><p>I heard muffled laughter and jerked my head around to see Brandon practically smothering himself in the pillow so I wouldn\u2019t hear him laughing. I smacked his naked shoulder, grimacing when it stung my hand, and then glared at him when he sat up and laughed outright.</p><p>\u201cThis is funny to you?\u201d I huffed at him as I moved slowly to the end of the bed, intent on trying to salvage my remote.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. It is,\u201d he replied succinctly. \u201cPayback for you laughing when he ball-tagged me earlier.\u201d</p><p>I reached out slowly...creeping my fingers closer and closer to the dog, stopping, my hand hanging in mid-air when Grady froze, watching me closely out of the corner of his eye. \u201cGood boy,\u201d I cooed sweetly. \u201cGive Auntie Chloe the remote, Grady. Him\u2019s a good baby, yes him is...\u201d I used baby talk, why? I don\u2019t know, maybe because he\u2019s a cute little baby puppy and that\u2019s what you do to babies, but it seemed to be working.</p><p>Or not. His tail was wagging now, tiny little circles on the blanket, but then he moved. His furry rear end shot up in the air, waggling back and forth while his front legs stayed flat, holding the remote tightly with paws and teeth. I could see it in his eyes, see him gather himself to bolt, and I took a chance, lunging forward to try to grab him before he got away. Instead, I grabbed empty air as I launched myself off the end of the bed to flop less than gracefully face first on the floor with a deep \u2018oompf\u2019. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fucking hell, this is the second time I\u2019ve ended up on the floor because of a damned dog! I pushed up off the floor, scowled at Brandon who was laughing his ass off on the bed, still, and took off after the dog, yelling for him to come.</p><p>I chased the little black furball around the living room and through the kitchen before he headed back down the hallway to the bedroom, remote still clenched in his jaws, and jumped onto the bed, finally dropping it into Brandon\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>I skidded to a halt in the doorway just in time to see this, scowling at Brandon\u2019s face-splitting grin. I walked to the bed and scooped up the pup, whispering \u2018traitor\u2019 in his ear as I sat down.</p><p>Brandon stretched and yawned behind me, still grinning as he reached out and pulled me back against him. We cuddled like that for a moment, the three of us, until the puppy wiggled to be let down. I held him a little tighter to me and sat back up.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m up for the day,\u201d I said as I got off the bed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take him outside real quick. Want some coffee?\u201d I asked Brandon.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved from the bed, just laid there on his back, arms outspread, towel dangerously loose around his hips. He yawned and scratched at his belly lazily. \u201cSure, but since I can\u2019t get you back in bed with me, I\u2019ll just get up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I turned away to hide the gigantic grin that lit up my face at his words, those crazy ass butterflies turning into a tornado inside me as my heart flipped. No, he didn\u2019t say anything special, or cutesy, or even hot for that matter. But he admitted that he wanted me again and that was huge given the fact that he\u2019d used the \u2018friend\u2019 speech on me not too long ago.</p><p>I let Grady out into the backyard, grateful that it was completely fenced in, and let him run wild while I made a couple cups of coffee. I took them out onto the back porch with me and sat, cradling my cup in my hands as I watched the puppy chase a bird along the fence line.</p><p>Brandon came out and sat beside me, having pulled on a pair of jeans and nothing else. Bare chested and bare foot...holy hell, I wanted nothing more than to kneel at the altar of Sinfully Sexy Ass Men and thank the Chief of Staff for such a glorious bounty of hotness. We drank our coffee in the sunlight, watching the gamboling pup with amusement as he chased anything that moved, or even looked like it would move, including his tail.</p> <p>After a while, Brandon stood and stretched, kissing me on the head as he took his empty cup inside. I followed him, calling for Grady and bringing him inside with me. I dug out some of his toys and he pounced on them delightedly, falling for the distraction just like I\u2019d hoped.</p><p>Brandon had disappeared down the hallway again, I\u2019m assuming to get dressed. \u201cYou have a lot of appointments today?\u201d I called to him.</p><p>He walked into the living room where I was standing, still pulling his shirt over his head so his words were muffled at first. \u201cYeah, I have quite a few, and of course we take walk-ins if we can. Why?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNo real reason, I\u2019ve just been actually contemplating getting another tattoo.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose and he gave me a quizzical look. \u201cReally? That\u2019d be...wait, another? You said another tattoo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded and then regretted mentioning it to him as he approached me playfully, hands going to the tie of my robe and pulling. He was grinning and waggling his eyebrows at me, but I couldn\u2019t help the panic that bubbled up. I was naked under my robe and it was pure daylight! I forced a laugh and slapped his hands away, hoping to put him off without offending him, or making him think I was hiding something from him. Which I was, but...</p> <p>He pulled his hands back and his face closed up, eyes going cloudy and dark. He shut me out as I watched, all playfulness gone, the tender man of last night a memory.</p><p>I swallowed hard, my heart sinking to the floor. I felt like an asshole, but there was just too much that no one knew and things about me that I wasn\u2019t ready to share, not even with the man I was falling for. And crap on a cracker, I was falling for him hard.</p><p>\u201cUmmm...so maybe I could set something up with you? Would you tattoo me?\u201d I asked, forcing a light tone and trying to salvage any tiny little piece of the morning I could.</p><p>He nodded sharply and replied, \u201cYeah. Just let me know when you\u2019re ready. I\u2019ll see you later, I\u2019ve gotta get to the shop.\u201d He turned on his heel and within moments, his boots were on, keys in hand, and he was gone.</p><p>I sank onto the couch, a sick feeling in my stomach. And that feeling was fear that I\u2019d just fucked things up before they\u2019d even had a chance to really get going.</p><p>My phone rang about twenty minutes later. I\u2019d missed it by the time I got back to the bedroom where it was still plugged into my charger, even though I\u2019d run like mad, hoping it was Brandon. I picked it up to see who it was and couldn\u2019t help the sigh of disappointment that escaped as I noticed it was Emma who\u2019d called.</p><p>I walked back out to the living room and sat, watching Grady play with his toys on the carpet while I called her back.</p><p>She answered without preamble, asking, \u201cWhat the hell did you do to Brandon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe-uh-whuh...Ex-Excuse me?\u201d I stuttered, taken aback by her no-nonsense, but still friendly tone.</p><p>\u201cHe was at your house last night, he said he was just gonna stay there for a while since Luke and I like to play slap and tickle a little too much, and now he comes stomping in this morning and about bites my head off when I mention your name. So, again, what the hell did you do to him?\u201d she asked briskly.</p><p>I finally found my voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, Emma...\u201d I said, hesitantly. Okay, so that was a little fib, but it\u2019s not like I could tell her, \u2018oh, I just pissed him off because I wouldn\u2019t let him see me naked after he fucked the living daylights out of me all night long,\u2019 you know?</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYeah, and I\u2019m the friggin\u2019 Pope.\u201d After a lengthy sigh, she said, wryly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come down here and talk to him, then? Fix whatever might be wrong because, honey, he\u2019s in a piss poor mood and I\u2019m pregnant. That\u2019s a bad combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t come down there. Allie dumped Grady at my house this morning in a drive-by-drop-off on her way to Cincinnati with Jacks. He woke me up standing on my chest.\u201d</p><p>Emma was quiet for a moment. \u201cShe did what?\u201d she asked, laughing. \u201cThat sneaky little bitch. She didn\u2019t go to Cincinnati with Jacks. She\u2019s at home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, she\u2019s at home?\u201d I asked her, incredulously.</p><p>Emma\u2019s laughter rang out through the phone, the clear, gleeful sound making me smile.</p><p>\u201cGrady got ahold of two of Jackson\u2019s shoes and chewed them up. And not of the same pair, either! He was threatening to do bad things to the poor little thing and Allie was so worried she must have snuck him out to your house away from Jacks!\u201d Emma was laughing harder now.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God...she- wait, what? Jackson was threatening to do bad things? Like what?\u201d I was genuinely taken aback by that because I knew my brother and he\u2019d never hurt a hair on an animal\u2019s head, let alone his Grady. He loves that dog! \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt Grady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie said he threatened to...\u201d she dropped her voice and whispered in mock fear/affront, \u201cmake him an outside dog!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holding back a giggle, I played along, \u201cNo! He didn\u2019t! Jackson would never say those evil words...tell me it isn\u2019t so!\u201d</p><p>Emma busted out laughing and I joined in, sobering shortly after when she asked if I was coming down to the shop.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI really can\u2019t Emma. I don\u2019t want to leave Grady here alone in the house because Allie didn\u2019t drop his crate off.\u201d</p><p>She quickly waved away my excuse when she said, \u201cJust bring him with you. Call when you get here and I\u2019ll just run him home. I have to go let DJ out anyway, and pick up lunch for the guys so it all works out. Just get here and fix him!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said begrudgingly.</p><p>We hung up and I gathered all of Grady\u2019s things, piling both of us into the car and heading downtown to Skin Deep, dread building in the pit of my stomach with every mile.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Emma was gone, taking the wiggling little puppy from me with a jaunty wave and a casual, \u2018Good luck,\u2019 thrown over her shoulder as she left without a backwards glance.</p><p>The dread was still hanging heavy in my belly, and I had to force myself to walk into the shop, flinching when the first face I saw darkened in a scowl immediately.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d It came out timid but not shaky, thank God. He jerked his head at me in acknowledgement but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>On a sigh, I crossed the floor to the counter where he was sitting. \u201cCan we talk for a minute, Brandon? Please?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulder at me and waved a hand as if to say, \u2018go ahead.\u2019</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry about this morning, but there\u2019s just things...I just don\u2019t...I have scars.\u201d</p><p>It took me a second to get it out, but after a faltering start, the words tripped off my tongue and dropped like a bomb into the silence stretched out between us. I squeezed my eyes tightly closed, not wanting to see his face, not even breathing as I waited for his response.</p><p>When the silence continued unbroken, I cracked one eye open and peeked at him. He was sitting, stunned, on the stool on the opposite side of the counter. In the distance, I heard the faint buzz of a tattoo machine start up, but he still didn\u2019t move.</p> <p>\u201cBrandon,\u201d I started.</p><p>He stopped me. \u201cI don\u2019t care about any scars, Chloe.\u201d His words were low, but sharp, like a velvet wrapped razor. \u201cI meant what I said. You\u2019re beautiful to me, just the way you are. I can\u2019t...he hurt you...that bad? He hurt you worse than you were when you showed up here?\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him, unable to form the words for a response. I finally settled on saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to get into it here, okay? I\u2019m not really ready to talk about it, Brandon. There\u2019s so much that I\u2019ve kept to myself and I...you just have to give me time.\u201d A small, incredulous laugh escaped my lips on a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re doing! Are we having a thing? Are we an item, is it a fling, are you going to change your mind again tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a frustrated, ragged breath and answered, \u201cI told you last night that you needed to tell me if you didn\u2019t want to cross that line, Chloe. But we crossed that line and there\u2019s no going back, damnit!\u201d He slapped his hand down on the counter and then shrugged sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to call this, I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I slept with my brother\u2019s best friend\u2019s little sister, who also happens to be one of my closest friends, too. But I can\u2019t deny that something has changed between us and I\u2019m still not sure I want it to! You make me feel things that I\u2019m not supposed to feel, at least not with you, and it\u2019s driving me insane!\u201d</p><p>My breath came in sharply, the pain immediate and piercing as his words echoed in the suddenly deafening silence of the studio. I stood, frozen and silent, eyes wide and blinking as I stared at Brandon in shock.</p><p>A throat clearing behind Brandon drew my gaze and I flinched when I saw Luke, shifting uneasily from foot to foot. \u201cUh...maybe this conversation should be done somewhere else?\u201d He looked pained as he said the words and he was clearly uncomfortable.</p><p>That spurred me to action. I nodded once at him, ignored Brandon, and spun on my heel, practically running for my car. I got in, started it up, and peeled out of the parking lot, intent on nothing more than putting as much distance between myself, Skin Deep, and the gorgeous men inside it as possible.</p><p>I drove on autopilot, having no destination in mind, no plan in mind, nothing. I just knew I didn\u2019t want to go home, didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near anyone I knew. I found myself crossing the Ohio river into Kentucky, but still kept going until I saw the water tower proudly stating, \u2018Florence Y\u2019all\u2019, and took the nearest exit, pulling into the first gas station I saw.</p> <p>I sat there for a minute and then, taking a moment to be a little bit responsible, checked my gas gauge to see if I should fill up while I was stopped. Noticing that I was at almost a quarter of a tank, I filled up my tank, and then went inside and grabbed a couple bottles of water, a couple candy bars, and a Slim Jim.</p><p>Getting back in my car, I headed back to the interstate, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to take the ramp for 75 North, which would take me back to Ohio. Instead, I stayed off the highway and turned into the parking lot of a hotel.</p><p>Half an hour later found me safely ensconced in a room, curtains drawn, sitting against the headboard in the dim bedside lamplight. I\u2019d finally turned my phone off, unwilling to hear it ring or chime with another text one more time. It\u2019d been going off since I\u2019d left the shop, but I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.</p><p>No, I was having a pity party for myself. One where I called myself a dumbass about a million times over for even thinking that things could be different with Brandon. For falling in love so recklessly after just one fucking kiss. If I was being honest with myself, I could admit that there\u2019d always been that little part of me in the very, way back, teeny, tiny corner of my mind that had appreciated him as the fine ass male specimen he was...but I\u2019d never had the urge to act on it. Until that drunken night when I let my lips get me in trouble.</p><p>And where did it land me? Running away like a scared little bitch because someone said something that hurt.</p><p>I thumped my head back against the headboard in disgust at myself. I was probably overreacting a little, but damnit, it hurt! It hurt to hear him say that he wasn\u2019t sure he even wanted things to change and one thing I never thought Brandon would be was wishy-washy. He ran hot and cold and changed his mind more than a whore dropped her panties and it was driving me nuts.</p><p>Yeah, I get the fact that he was probably just as confused as I was about this whole thing, but Jesus! I wasn\u2019t the only one in the bed last night, and he specifically said he didn\u2019t want to fight it anymore. So what the hell gives, man?</p><p>I closed my eyes against the tears of pain and frustration welling up, not bothering to wipe them away as I cried myself to sleep, alone in a hotel room in Kentucky.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d</p><p>What? I squeezed my eyes shut tighter, confused by the sweet, caring tone of his voice. He sounded like the old Greg...the one I fell in love with. My head felt like it was about to explode and grogginess permeated every inch of it, making me aware that I must have passed out. Again.</p><p>Suddenly, blazing pain shot through my cheek as Greg\u2019s hand connected with the already bruised skin. \u201cOpen your eyes, bitch! You watch everything and I\u2019ll untie you and let you make us some dinner. You close them, just once, and you\u2019ll fucking regret it. I promise. So open up!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I complied, knowing that it would only make it worse if I refused his order. I blinked in the kitchen light, fear trickling down my spine as I realized he\u2019d tied me to a kitchen chair beside the table. My heart sank as my eyes found him. This was going to be a bad night.</p><p>He was smiling at me, but it was an evil, ugly grin. His arm was slung around the neck of a woman bursting out of her clothes, leaving little to the imagination. Her makeup was heavy and dark, making her look older than I imagined she was, a little trashy, and a little sexy in a hardened, edgy kind of way.</p><p>He turned to her and said, conversationally, \u201cAmber, this is the poor little rat I told you about. See how pathetic she is? Can\u2019t even be where she\u2019s supposed to be when she\u2019s supposed to be there. I swear, I spent so much time training her to be the perfect little woman to keep my home and this is the thanks I get. But see how cute it is when she thinks I\u2019m going to actually be nice to her? Stupid little cunt. She can just sit there like the pussy little bitch she is and watch our fun, then, huh, Tina?\u201d Greg\u2019s voice was gleeful, almost childlike with giddiness and I knew he was high on something. He shook his head as his companion laughed, sneering at me as she ran her hand up Greg\u2019s chest.</p><p>She snarled and corrected him. \u201cAmber!\u201d before she continued. \u201cSo, what do you need me for then, Greggy-baby, if you\u2019ve got her here waiting on you?\u201d she pouted in a creepy little girl voice, walking her fingers up his chest and back down over the placket of his jeans.</p> <p>He pulled her in and kissed her, opened mouth with lots of tongue, groaning, and heavy breathing on both their parts. When he pulled away from her, her red lipstick was smeared across his face, looking eerily like blood, like a sinister omen.</p><p>He stared at me boldly, daring me to try to move, to say something as he pulled a syringe, a lighter, and a tourniquet, the rubber kind nurses use to take your blood, out of his pocket, along with a small foil packet, and a small piece of cotton. He grinned as he strode to the drawer and pulled out a spoon.</p><p>\u201cCause I\u2019ve got the good stuff you want, doll, and then we\u2019re gonna have a little fun with the prude over there,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Amber giggled and then moaned, pressing herself against Greg\u2019s back as he sat at our kitchen table and proceeded to unwrap the foil packet, placing a tan-ish looking lump in the bowl of the spoon, crushing it up into powder with the flat end of the plunger on the syringe. He handed the syringe over to Amber who prowled across the kitchen like she owned it to the sink, where she drew a small amount of water into the syringe.</p><p>She moved back to him, sitting it on the table beside him without a word, but you could see the wanton desperation, the anticipation clearly written on her face. Greg picked up the syringe and squirted the water into the spoon over the powder before he flicked the lighter to life and held it under the spoon suspended carefully in his fingers.</p> <p>I watched the process silently, not looking away no matter how much I was screaming on the inside, sickened by what was happening in front of me. This was new, the drug use. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I suspected it was heroin. I didn\u2019t want to watch, I wanted to run screaming from the room, but that would just make things worse...not to mention the fact that I was tied to a chair currently. Maybe he would just get high and pass out, leave me alone...but I\u2019d still be tied.</p><p>Once the process was done and the drug pulled into the needle, I watched Greg pick it up and, after a brief, pensive pause, he swung the needle towards my arm where it was lashed to my own thigh. I could feel the panic rising, my heart beating like a runaway horse as he shook the syringe mockingly in my face.</p><p>\u201cWant some of this, little whore? I should do it...I should jab this needle in your fucking arm and give you so much of this shit that you OD right here in front of me so I can fuck the shit out of Tina while I watch you die.\u201d</p><p>I flinched when I heard a slap, bewildered when I realized it wasn\u2019t me getting slapped this time. The oh-so-lovely Amber had taken offense to Greg calling her by the wrong name again that she smacked him upside the back of his head, screeching, \u201cMy name is fucking Amber, you asshole! Who the fuck is Tina?\u201d</p><p>Greg shrugged her off, raising his hand threateningly at her, which only made her laugh.</p><p>He turned to me again, the needle still waving hypnotically in his hand, coming closer and closer to my skin. I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes again...I didn\u2019t want that shit in my body...God, why was I such a weak ass loser? Why hadn\u2019t I left him the first time he hit me?</p> <p>\u201cI think she might want to try a little, what do you think, doll face?\u201d He grinned evilly and seized my arm between rough, pinching fingers. He jabbed the needle sharply into my skin cruelly. I bit back my scream, but a whimper still escaped.</p><p>\u201cGreg! Don\u2019t waste that good shit on her! I ain\u2019t gonna be no party to no murder, either, so quit fuckin\u2019 around and give it to me!\u201d Amber yelled.</p><p>He jerked the needle out of my arm and I thanked God and anyone else who was listening that he hadn\u2019t depressed the plunger on the syringe to release the drug. Instead, he tied off Amber\u2019s arm with the tourniquet, inserted the needle into her arm and shot her up. Her head lolled for just a second before she looked up with a smile.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s such a fuckin\u2019 rush...just enough to take the edge off, eh, lover? Just enough to make you wanna fuck me right here on this table?\u201d she said, her eyes glazing over.</p><p>Greg took the needle out of her arm, tied off his own, and shot himself up with the rest of the syringe\u2019s contents. He sat there for a few seconds, looking slightly dazed before his nostrils flared and he stared at Amber like she was the last piece of pie left on earth and he had a craving.</p><p>I tried to block it out, to float off inside myself like I would normally do, but I couldn\u2019t block out the sounds...couldn\u2019t block out the sight of Greg stripping down, tearing off Amber\u2019s clothes, and then positioning her on the table, right in front of where I was sitting. He spread her legs and she laughed as he slid her towards me, her hairy, unkempt snatch now just inches from my face. I fought a gag as the stench of an unwashed, sweaty body invaded my nostrils before he pulled her back and mounted her, right there in front of me, one hand on her ass to hold her still, and the other tangled in my hair, forcing me to keep watching while tears poured, unchecked, down my bruised cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I screamed as I woke, my body shivering, as I tried to shake off the effects of the memory afforded to me by my dreams.</p><p>I blinked into the dimly lit room, taking a second to realize that I was in a hotel room, and everything clicked into place. Brandon pushing me away even as he pulled me to him...my own hang ups that fuck everything up...my life in general.</p> <p>With a sigh, I grabbed my cell phone and powered it back on, groaning when it immediately began chiming and pinging with incessant notifications of voice mails and text messages.</p><p>I opened my texts, knowing that I would find a lot of pissed off people, including my brother. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for was a text from my mom. It was simple, to the point...and devastating.</p><p>Greg is out.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Three little words made me sick. Literally.</p><p>I clung to the hotel room toilet after having lurched in there to empty the contents of my stomach as the words my mom texted ate at my soul. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s even possible, given what transpired to put him in prison, but it was true. It had to be because my mom is not a liar and she wouldn\u2019t be that cruel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat there long after my dry heaves had stopped and my legs had gone numb. My phone, dropped somewhere on the carpet in my haste to make it to the bathroom, chimed every few minutes, alerting me that I had a new message.</p><p>Finally, I dragged myself up off the floor and sank onto the mattress after grabbing my cell phone. I scrolled through the missed calls to my brother\u2019s number and hit call, running a shaking hand through my hair as I waited for him to answer.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell, Chloe! What is going on? Are you okay? Where the hell are you?\u201d Jackson roared, completely foregoing the standard hello-how-are-yous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jacks. I just needed some time, okay?\u201d I said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cNo! No, it\u2019s not okay, Chloe! You can\u2019t just fucking disappear like that, especially after...have you talked to mom?\u201d he asked, his tone turning subdued.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t already gotten a text from my mom, I\u2019d have known something was wrong right then. \u201cShe texted me. I know that...I know.\u201d I couldn\u2019t bring myself to utter it out loud, afraid that it would make all of this real instead of the dream I was hoping it was.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? We\u2019ve had people looking for you ever since mom called me, even though we\u2019ve been trying to get ahold of you long before that, at least just to make sure you were okay.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my eyes and yawned tiredly as I answered, \u201cI just needed some time.\u201d</p><p>Jackson sighed. \u201cYou already said that. Luke and T.J. are out driving around and so am I. Just tell me where you are so I can come check on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone looking for me, right now. I just need time. I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m in a hotel in Florence, Kentucky,\u201d I said, begrudgingly.</p><p>\u201cFlorence? What the fuck are you doing there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI just drove and this is where I ended up. Look, I\u2019m just gonna ride out the night here, okay? It\u2019s already late, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t even know what time it is...but I\u2019ll be back in town tomorrow. Call off your dogs. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Jackson gave a short, barking laugh, filled with mocking. \u201cIt\u2019s only seven in the evening and, yeah, fine is one thing you\u2019re not. This is gonna stop, Chloe. I want the whole story from you so I know what the hell is going on. Stop shutting us all out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson-\u201d</p><p>He cut me off. \u201cJust tell me what hotel you\u2019re in at least,\u201d he said impatiently.</p> <p>I told him and hung up, curling up into a ball on the bed and sobbing my eyes out. I cried, finally, for everything that had happened with Greg, which is something I hadn\u2019t really let myself do. I cried about the whole Brandon situation, and I cried because I could only think about how much I let everyone down...I felt like such a piece of shit for running off, making everyone worry.</p><p>I cried until I could cry no more, my sobs were just little hiccups, and my face was completely red and swollen, my eyes gritty and burning. I switched off the light and hunkered back down under the covers, ready to slip into a, hopefully, dreamless sleep, when there was a knock at the door.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and stomped to the door, knowing that my brother couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone and had to have driven down here. I peeked out the peephole and about swallowed my tongue when I saw Brandon standing on the other side. His face was drawn, almost haggard, but he looked pissed off.</p><p>I gulped and stepped back from the door, hoping if I ignored him he\u2019d just go away. I should have known better.</p><p>\u201cChloe...\u201d he said softly, dangerously. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there. Quit peeking through the peephole and open the door.\u201d</p><p>With a shaking hand, I released the locks on the door and swung it open, stepping back as Brandon pushed past me into the room. I closed it behind him and locked it once more, squeaking in surprise when he swept me into his arms the minute I turned around.</p><p>He hugged me to his chest tightly, murmuring \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 into my hair. I tensed briefly and then allowed myself to melt into his arms, taking his offered strength without question, even though I wasn\u2019t letting him get away with the hot and cold game anymore. He came after me...surely that meant something, right?</p><p>\u201cBrandon...what are you doing here?\u201d I asked him softly after a few minutes, tilting my head up to look into his stormy eyes.</p> <p>He gazed down at me as he cupped my cheek with his hand, our eyes locked as he lowered his head and brushed his lips gently back and forth across mine.</p><p>My breath left me on a sigh, my lips parting to grant him the access he so sweetly sought. He kissed me carefully, tenderly...like he was afraid I would break. The sad thing was, it felt like I still might.</p><p>After our lips parted, he closed his eyes and rested his forehead against mine, still holding me close. His breath, warm and minty, bathed my lips as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI never should have said what I did earlier in the shop. You know it\u2019s not like me to be so...so fucking indecisive! I know what I want and I go after it, but, with you, I just...God, Chloe you tie me in fucking knots! I don\u2019t know which way is up and it\u2019s something that I never felt before.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath and moved away to sit on the edge of the bed, pulling me down beside him. He turned, angling his body so that we were face to face as he took my face in his hands, staring at me earnestly as he continued speaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve felt lust before. I\u2019ve been in love before, too, with Allie. She made me feel invincible and happy but there was always that little part of me that was levelheaded. She drove me nuts wanting her and-Jesus, I\u2019m not saying this very well. What I\u2019m trying to say, Chloe, is that, that one kiss with you, it shook me. It opened my eyes and I found myself looking at you in a totally different light and I felt guilty about it. I seriously felt like a fuckin\u2019 girl, changing my mind over and over because I was so afraid to let you in because I don\u2019t want to ruin what\u2019s always worked for us, for our friendship.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAnd then you pushed me away, hid from me after we...I just...fuck, Chloe! The things I feel for you scare me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think they don\u2019t scare me, Brandon?\u201d I interjected. \u201cI\u2019ve been petrified since I kissed you, someone who\u2019s always been a good friend to me, someone who was involved, seriously involved, with a woman that I love like my own sister! But then Allie and I talked and I started hoping...and then...and...I fucking fell in love with you!\u201d</p><p>The last words came out on a shout, echoing in the stunned silence left behind. It stretched on, that silence, for what seemed like eternity before Brandon said, quietly, \u201cThat settles it, then. You\u2019re mine, Chloe, because, God help us both, I\u2019ve fallen in fucking love with you, too.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, scared to believe I just heard him correctly...to think that maybe, just maybe, this could really be happening.</p><p>I searched his face, finding nothing but honesty written across it and my heart swelled with hope. I leaned in and captured his lips with mine, sweeping my tongue across the seam of his mouth, seeking entrance. He parted his lips on a groan, his tongue meeting mine in a tangling frenzy, kissing me deeply.</p><p>Breathing hard, we broke apart and just held each other, taking everything in. After a while, Brandon pushed me back so he could see my face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to talk, Chloe. No more hiding, especially now that Jackson told us Greg is out. We all need to know what that means, what exactly happened with you two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded slowly, my stomach knotting up instantly again at the thought of having to reveal the depravity I lived with for longer than I should have, for letting them see that I was stupid and weak for not getting out and stopping it until it was almost too late.</p><p>I peered up at him and asked quietly, \u201cCan we do it tomorrow with everyone? I don\u2019t want to have to go through it more than once.\u201d</p><p>Brandon kissed my head once more and nodded his assent. He pulled me into his arms and moved us so we were laying in the bed, wrapped up in each other. We fell asleep that way and, blessedly, it was a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><p>When morning came, we got ready and checked out without speaking. I was on edge, knowing that I was about to lay bare all the sordid details I\u2019d kept hidden for a long time. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy...it was going to be hell.</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>Three hours later found me surrounded by friends and family, each of them waiting patiently to find out just what was going on.</p><p>Emma must have called Leah because she was on one side of me on the couch at Luke and Emma\u2019s house, which is where everyone just naturally congregated, and surprisingly, my mom was on the other side.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to get a flight before Jackson had even told her that I was going to tell them everything, which is why she\u2019d sent just that short text letting me know about Greg; she\u2019d already been on her way to the airport. Our mom is good like that, willing to fly across the country in a hot second because one of her babies just might need her.</p><p>I just hated that she had done it to deal with my shit.</p> <p>I cleared my throat and glanced over at Brandon, who was sitting on the arm of the love seat beside Allie. Jackson was sharing the loveseat with her, and she was leaning back against his chest. Luke and Emma were squeezed into the armchair that is usually Doug\u2019s favorite seat, Emma on Luke\u2019s lap, cradled in his arms, his hands splayed protectively, yet lovingly, across the girth of her pregnant belly.</p><p>Brandon gave me a small, encouraging nod so I started talking. I began with the beginning; how sweet and loving Greg was\u2014but it was all an act.</p><p>He hit me for the first time six months into our relationship. He convinced me it was an accident, that I\u2019d just happened to turn into his hand while he had it raised during an argument. It was believable at the time. Now I know I was just stupid and na\u00efve.</p><p>It all poured out from there. I ignored the tears streaking down my face silently, just stoically kept talking, letting it all out. I wasn\u2019t holding back any details and I could see it was taking its toll on everyone else, too.</p><p>My mom was sobbing quietly beside me, trying to stay strong for me. Leah looked like she could kill someone, all the while tears were tracking down her cheeks, as well. Allie and Emma were both crying, trying to muffle their sobs on the shoulders of Jacks and Luke.</p><p>And all three of the guys? I\u2019d swear I saw death in their eyes.</p> <p>Brandon was almost vibrating in anger and shock; his face was dark with fury, jaw tight, fists clenched on his thighs. Jackson and Luke looked about the same, but they were controlling it just a bit better because their arms were full of crying women.</p><p>I got to the womanizing, all the times he fucked women right in front of me...the drug use...and the beatings.</p><p>I was wrung out\u2014a complete wreck by the time I got to the final fight that sent me running for my life, knowing that if I didn\u2019t get out this time, he\u2019d kill me for sure. My voice a whisper, I sank into the memory, ice-cold numbness washing over me as I spoke...</p><p>For what I swore was the last time, I opened my eyes and I promised myself, right there staring in the mirror, that this was it. This was the time I was going to walk away, be the strong woman I always prided myself on being. Until I met him. Greg.</p><p>I was working as a bartender in a popular club, and late one night, he showed up. He was perfect, blonde haired, blue-eyed...the All-American boy that every girl wanted, dreamed about. He was sweet, charming, and respectful and I thought I\u2019d hit the good-guy lottery. Little did I know that I\u2019d only been duped...that I was dancing with the devil.</p><p>But I knew now...and I was done being his punching bag. I had to get out and I had to do it soon. I leaned back over the sink and carefully dabbed some powder along the fading edge of the black eye I still had from last week. Glancing at my watch, I swore under my breath and fled to the kitchen to get dinner laid out on the table like he expected.</p><p>Everything was fine until after dinner when I was cleaning the kitchen. I had managed to keep him calm and not set him off. But...</p><p>A wine glass. A single, simple, fucking wine glass. That\u2019s what did it. I can\u2019t help the fact that he bumped into me while I was putting it away in the cabinet and dropped it, causing it to shatter all over the counter and the floor.</p> <p>I cleaned it up quickly after he smacked me across the face, vile words burning my ears as he swore at me while I worked. I winced as a small shard of glass sliced into my finger when I went to pick it up, pulling it out and then staring absently at the drop of blood welling to the surface.</p><p>\u201cStupid fucking cunt, can\u2019t even clean anything up without fucking shit up more! Get up and get a bandaid on it now before you get blood all over my kitchen!\u201d Greg screamed at me.</p><p>Tossing the small sliver of glass onto the pile, I swept it all up and deposited in the trash can, putting the broom and dustpan back away before I started to leave the kitchen for the bathroom to get a bandaid.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he yelled behind me from his seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cTo\u2014to get a bandaid-\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>He shook his head vehemently at me and pointed to my purse, sitting on the counter by the back door. \u201cI know you have a bandaid in there, you prissy little bitch. You don\u2019t need to the leave the room. I want you here where I can see you so you don\u2019t destroy any more of my shit.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and walked to my purse, pulse pounding. He never got in my purse. Ever. I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s something he\u2019s never checked, never thought about until now. But today, there was something in my purse that I was hiding, something that had to be kept a secret at all costs. That secret was what prompted me to finally make the decision I made standing in the bathroom earlier that day.</p><p>I unzipped my purse and fumbled carefully inside for the small first aid kit I\u2019d always kept in there, holding my breath as pure, unadulterated fear shot through every cell of my body. I pulled it out and zipped my purse back up, letting out my breath slowly in relief as I turned away from it, moving to the table to pull the bandaid out and wrap it securely around my finger.</p><p>I glanced at Greg surreptitiously from the corner of my eye and flinched reflexively when I saw him watching me carefully, suspicion beginning to crawl across his features.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very pleasant this evening, bitch. Other than that glass your clumsy ass broke, you\u2019ve been on your best behavior like you\u2019re supposed to be. Should I be worried?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him, knowing that he was gearing up to explode and wanting to avoid it at all costs. I knew that it didn\u2019t matter if I was the perfect little robot for him every second of every day, he was never going to be happy anymore, he was always going to look for the excuse to punish me.</p><p>He nodded and breathed, \u201cAhhh...I know what it is. Greg hasn\u2019t given you any good lovin\u2019 lately, has he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gulped, knowing things had just taken a turn for the worst.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play tonight, shall we?\u201d he asked. He tapped his finger to his chin as I stood, mutely, at the side of the table. \u201cHow about you be my little whore tonight, huh? Dress you up like a fuckin\u2019 hooker and make you do every dirty thing I can think of...maybe I\u2019ll call Amber up and make her sit on your face while I fuck you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glazed over, breath beginning to come in pants, and his hand slid down to rub against the bulge behind his zipper. \u201cYeah...but first, I wanna fuck your face and I want to see your whorish mouth painted red while I do it. Give me your purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014what?\u201d I stuttered in shock. The blood in my veins froze when I realized my mistake.</p> <p>His face turned a mottled red and purple with rage. \u201cYou fuckin\u2019 questioning me? I told you to do something, you bitch, and you have the nerve to question it?\u201d he roared.</p><p>\u201cN-n-no, Greg, I wasn\u2019t quest-questioning you...I swear! I just-I don\u2019t have any lipstick in my purse!\u201d The words were tripping off my tongue and the panic was swelling like a tsunami inside me, threatening to crash down and drown me under the tide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check for myself, bitch. I know you\u2019re lying to me...you always lie!\u201d he screamed, jumping to his feet so quickly that the chair he was in tipped back and crashed to the floor.</p><p>He jumped toward the end of the counter and grabbed my purse, unzipping it and unceremoniously dumping the contents across the kitchen table. He started rifling through it, picking up my lip gloss and shaking it in my direction.</p><p>\u201cSee? You did lie, you stupid bitch. And you\u2019ll pay for--\u201d his words cut off as his breath caught sharply. He gingerly picked something up off the table and, whispering, said, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p> <p>He turned to me, rage growing in his eyes, making them widen and darken. In his hand was the pregnancy test that I\u2019d taken two days ago...and it clearly indicated a positive result.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d he roared.</p><p>I could only nod my head...</p><p>\u201cChloe?\u201d my mom said, softly.</p><p>I started, realizing that I\u2019d stopped speaking as the memories played like a movie through my mind. I swallowed thickly, taking a moment to gather my courage to tell them my dirty secret. To tell them how I failed my unborn child...</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Chloe?\u201d</p> <p>Brandon asked that question, his voice raw but gentle. I blinked at him owlishly for a second, then blurted, \u201cHe made sure I wasn\u2019t pregnant anymore.\u201d I stood up slowly and raised my shirt, tucking it just under the edge of my bra as I pushed my pants down just enough to show them the scars marring my lower abdomen.</p><p>I heard my mom\u2019s shocked cry ring out, along with gasps and varying swears from everyone else as they put two and two together.</p><p>With a steadying breath, the rest of the story came out. \u201cHe went crazy, telling me that I ruined his life, that I had cheated because there was no way he\u2019d gotten me pregnant. Of course, he used other words, but...you get the idea. He-\u201d my voice cracked; I cleared my throat and tried again.</p><p>\u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t stand a bastard child, so he grabbed the butcher knife from the block on the counter and stabbed me twice in the stomach and once in the thigh. He cut me open and then he beat me. He left to go get drunk because I pissed him off and I was able to call the squad, but just barely. He managed to miss anything vital, with the exception of my uterus. Of course, I lost the baby...I stayed in the hospital for four days and then checked myself out against doctor\u2019s orders because I just couldn\u2019t stay there anymore, came to Ohio, and the rest was history.\u201d</p><p>Allie spoke up, her voice thick with tears and pain. \u201cSo when you came here, you hid most of your injuries from us, didn\u2019t you.\u201d It was a statement, not a question. She knew the answer. She gave a soft sob and clutched at my brother, who was sitting there like stone, literally vibrating with fury.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI had fifty-two stitches in my stomach total, and thirteen more in my upper thigh where he buried the knife to the hilt, before he left. He left me bleeding out on the floor, and he killed my baby. I was about eight weeks along, as far as they could tell. They found him at the bar down the street, actually passed out in the bathroom stall with a needle in his arm and arrested him.\u201d I shrugged and spread my hands out in front of me, indicating that that was it.</p><p>My story was done. It was finally out, all of it.</p><p>They were all staring at me, horrified. But it was actually cathartic to get it all out, finally, to quit hiding the hell I lived for too long.</p> <p>\u201cMy babygirl,\u201d Mom whispered. She reached out and pulled me into her arms, cradling me like I was a little girl once more. She kissed my head and sobbed into my hair until I heard shuffling.</p><p>She squeezed me again and then, suddenly, I was airborne, crushed against my brother\u2019s chest. He hugged me tightly, apologizing repeatedly to me, though he had nothing to apologize for. Tears were still streaming down my cheeks but I felt lighter, freer.</p><p>A gruff voice said, \u201cJacks,\u201d and I was passed into Luke\u2019s arms. He did the same as Jackson, holding me, kissing me on my forehead, and then...</p><p>There was Brandon. He held me to him, kissing the top of my head gently, and then sat me back on my feet, steadying me briefly before he turned on his heel and barreled out the door. I heard him calling for the dogs just as the girls converged on me.</p><p>After a while, Allie sent Jackson out to get a couple buckets of chicken, which was her new craving, for all of us. The mood had finally lightened after everyone had bombarded me with questions, initially. Brandon still hadn\u2019t come back inside, but he was still here because his Expedition was in the driveway.</p><p>Luke eventually went out to check on him; he paused beside me, his hand cupping my cheek as he whispered, \u201cWe\u2019ve got you. Always. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a shaky smile and nodded before he walked outside.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Brandon was silent on the way home when we finally left.</p><p>We\u2019d eaten chicken and laughed our asses off when Doug absconded with a chicken strip box that was, unfortunately, placed too close to the edge of the table.</p><p>There was only two strips left in the box, thankfully, but I think the thing that made it the most comical was the fact that Doug took so long getting himself settled that the puppies had managed to duck their heads in the box and each scarf down a strip. When poor Doug finally poked his head in for his stolen treat, he got nothing but crumbs stuck to the end of his nose.</p><p>Before we left, Allie had pulled me aside, Emma and Leah hot on her heels, and asked me what had happened with Brandon. I just told them that we were trying to figure things out. I just didn\u2019t feel like going into details right then, and plus, they were talking about having a girls\u2019 night soon, so I figured I\u2019d be forced to spill then.</p><p>We pulled into the driveway and sat in the darkness, which seemed to be a thing with us. I leaned my head back against the headrest and waited him out, knowing that he was working things through in his mind.</p><p>Finally, the silence was broken by his words, low and throaty with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying so hard to hold on to my sanity, right now. All I keep seeing is your face and the way you were holding yourself the day you showed up at the house. We should have seen it, we should have been there for you, Chloe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I reached over and clasped his hand in mine as I said, \u201cYou were there for me, Brandon. You all were when I needed you. It\u2019s my fault for letting it happen for so long, for not being the strong woman my mom raised me to be. There\u2019s no way you would have known because I didn\u2019t let anyone know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bullshit, Chloe!\u201d he howled, anger twisting his features. \u201cNone of this is your fault and you better get that through your thick head! You didn\u2019t ask him to beat your ass and almost kill you, did you?\u201d</p><p>At my indignant denial he continued, \u201cThat\u2019s right, you didn\u2019t. But you were scared and didn\u2019t want to make things worse than they were. What if you\u2019d tried to leave before then and had gotten caught? What if you\u2019d never gotten away from him at all? What if he\u2019d killed you?\u201d</p><p>His voice was gravelly and raw, his face tortured in the dim moonlight filtering through the windows of the vehicle.</p> <p>Surprised to find that my voice was clear and steady, I replied, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough what-if\u2019s in my life to last me a long time, Brandon. I\u2019d like to leave that in the past now that I\u2019ve gotten everything out. He didn\u2019t kill me. I\u2019m alive and I\u2019m here...with you. And there\u2019s no where else on earth that I\u2019d rather be. But, just to make sure we\u2019re on the same page here and there\u2019s no more flip-flopping from you...\u201d</p><p>He shot me a droll look and I smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cIs this a thing? You and me?\u201d I asked, carefully. I know we\u2019d already confessed our feelings to each other, but hell, a lot has happened since then. I guess I just wanted to give him an out. Just in case.</p><p>He jerked his head toward me. \u201cSeriously, Chloe?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged helplessly. \u201cWell, I just need to make sure, Brandon. You\u2019ve been so hot and cold and-\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he got out of the truck. He waited on me to follow, but still didn\u2019t speak as we went inside. Once the door was shut and locked behind me, I found myself pushed back against the door, Brandon\u2019s body pressing against me from the front, leaving no space between us.</p><p>His lips hovered over mine, so close but not touching. \u201cBaby, I told you that I was falling in love with you. If you think I just throw those words around, then you don\u2019t know me at all. I told you you were mine, and that\u2019s that. It\u2019s you and me from here on out, sunshine. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been holding my breath until it rushed out on a gasp. I barely got the word \u2018yes\u2019 out before Brandon captured my mouth with his, plundering with his tongue, nipping at my lips with his teeth, and then soothing the slight sting.</p><p>I moaned when he lifted his lips from mine, desperate to keep him close to me. He chuckled and wrapped his hands around my waist, lifting me up so that my legs clasped around his waist and my arms wound around his neck. He brought his mouth back to mine, kissing me deeply as he walked us down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>He flipped on the light and laid me on the bed, the look on his face almost daring me to protest the brightness of the room. My chin rose, the small act of defiance instinctual, but he only shook his head once, letting me know that he wasn\u2019t going to let me hide this time.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to hide from him anymore. It was pointless anyway; he knew my secret now, he\u2019d seen my scars. I sat up and stripped my shirt off over my head, my eyes never leaving his face. His gaze immediately dropped to my stomach, as I figured they would. It still flustered me a little, but I busied myself by stripping off my bra, and then making short work of my jeans and panties.</p><p>Brandon watched every move, his eyes sliding over every inch of my body, the heat of his gaze moving over my skin like a caress. He knelt on the bed beside me, his hands reaching out to slide over my stomach. His fingers gently traced the lines of my scars, his touch barely a whisper over my skin, and then I gasped as his lips and then tongue followed.</p><p>He kissed my scars, seeking out every mark on my skin, pressing his lips to each one and telling me, as he showed me, how beautiful I was to him. Tears sprung to my eyes, not sad ones, no, but tears of relief, of happiness.</p><p>His lips found their way back to mine, but instead of plundering, they sipped, sweet, tender kisses that stoked the flames of desire at a slow and steady pace. His hands slid up my sides to cup my breasts, cradling the full, tender globes in his palms as he swiped his thumbs over the pearled tips.</p><p>I hissed at the sensation of pleasure/pain when he pinched the turgid tips of my breasts, rolling the nipples between his fingers and plucking them, making me arch and moan. I cried out when his fingers abandoned their play, but moaned once more as his lips closed over my stiff peak, his teeth lightly scraping before he sucked hard and then laved it with the flat of his tongue.</p><p>His hand slipped back down my stomach and his fingers found my wet center, deftly parting the slick folds and sliding deep inside. He hooked his fingers and rubbed them over the hidden sweet spot there, relentlessly driving me to the brink of release in seconds. It shimmered before me, that beautiful rush of pleasure, but he stopped just before I went over.</p><p>I grunted in frustration and thrust my hips up, trying to force his fingers to move once more, to take me up and over that edge. He denied me, instead slipping his fingers out of my clenching heat, bringing them to his mouth. He tasted me on his own skin, his eyes locked on mine.</p><p>A tidal wave of desire crashed over me, curling throughout my body, and I could see the answering heat in his gaze. Suddenly, the control he was so tightly clinging to snapped and he was over me in a flash, his hands pressing my thighs wide as the swollen, rock hard length of him pushed inside, driving deep, not stopping until I was fully impaled.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you feel so good, Chloe...\u201d he froze, the words dying on his lips as his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, confused by the sudden change in him. I shifted beneath him, my hips arching into his as I moved, and a guttural cry was torn from him, ending on a curse.</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d he said, tersely, beginning to raise his hips to slide out of me.</p><p>I could feel the hesitation in him when my inner muscles fluttered against his hardened flesh still buried deep inside me and I said, hesitantly, \u201cI\u2019m on the pill...and I\u2019m good. Clean, I mean...I don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He sank forward the tiniest bit, gaining back what little ground he\u2019d lost when he pulled back and we both moaned.</p><p>\u201cI just- I\u2019ve always used protection. Even with Allie unless it was in the...nevermind. I\u2019m safe, too, but...are you sure?\u201d he asked. He pressed into me again, the movement seeming almost uncontrollable to him, even as he hesitated.</p><p>I caught his eyes, held them, as I answered, \u201cYes. I want to feel you. Brandon, I- oh, God, I love you. God help me, but I do.\u201d</p><p>His body moved over mine again and we were one, skin to skin, breath to breath, heart to heart. There was no space left between us, no way to tell where he ended and I began as his lips met mine in a seeking kiss, so soft and gentle as he began to rock into me, his hardened shaft plumbing my depths with leisurely strokes, his chest abrading my puckered nipples.</p><p>Still kissing me deeply, he shifted once more, bring his hands up and sliding them underneath my back and up over my shoulders, cupping them in his hands, giving him leverage to pull me into his thrusts, every inch of him rubbing against me, creating delicious friction that sent white hot pleasure streaming throughout my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It built and built, my nerve endings on fire, the pleasure so intense it bordered on pain as his thrusts increased, his hips circling. Unable to contain it any longer, the dam broke, sending me flying into a free-fall of ecstasy. My hands slid across his broad shoulders, scrabbling for purchase on his sweat-slickened skin, clawing him as passion-filled screams poured from my lips, muffled by his kiss. He swallowed them down, moaning against my lips and mingling our cries.</p><p>He slammed home once more and wrenched his lips from mine as he came, bringing me again as he jerked inside me, the scalding heat of his release spurting deep. A guttural, ragged cry tore from his throat, twining with the sounds of pleasure still being wrung from my lips, echoing throughout the room.</p><p>He dropped his forehead onto my shoulder, our chests heaving as we fought to catch our breath. After a moment, he lifted his head and, holding my gaze, he whispered, \u201cI love you, too, Chloe. I fucking love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me again, then, a sweet kiss that he poured his heart into and my heart spilled over, overflowing with emotion as I fell that much deeper for him.</p><p>We drifted off to sleep, still entwined, until I was woken later by the feel of him swelling inside me, hardening and growing until he filled me completely. He grasped me tightly and rolled until I straddled him, opening my thighs wider to settle deeper onto him.</p><p>I gasped at the sensation of him sliding deeper than before and my muscles contracted, squeezing around him and making him moan. He watched me, his beautiful, smoky eyes heavy lidded with sleep, letting me set the pace of our love-making.</p><p>I tucked my knees tight against his ribs and ground my hips down, circling and swirling, massaging his shaft with rhythmic pulses of my inner walls as I massaged my clit against his pelvis. Of their own volition, my hands came up and cupped my breasts, palming the weight of them as I plucked my nipples, dragging a ragged \u2018oh, fuck\u2019 from Brandon as he watched my every move.</p><p>My breath hitched as I edged closer to the point of no return, the crescendo building steadily toward climax like a perfectly tuned orchestra. Brandon\u2019s hands encircled my waist, pulling my hips tighter to his and arching into me in counter-point, increasing the friction. One of his thumbs slipped down into my cleft, stroking once...twice...and again over the swollen bud of my clit and I screamed as I came, my body spasming and twitching over his, my thighs growing wet with my release that showed no signs of slowing.</p><p>He kept up the lazy circles of his thumb on my clit and began thrusting up into me, short, sharp movements that made his balls slap heartily against my ass, adding to the myriad sensations already flooding me with heart-stopping pleasure. It wasn\u2019t long, though, before his thrusts became erratic and his thumb abandoned its stroking, his hands clenching tightly on my hips, instead, pushing, pulling, and sliding me against him as he worked himself inside me, the hot, drenched folds of my sex swollen and clenching around him, milking him with my everlasting release until he thrust deep once more, roaring out his release as he filled me, grinding against me until every last drop was wrung from him.</p><p>I slumped onto his chest, my body shaking and limp, and let exhaustion carry me back to dreamless sleep.</p><p>My alarm woke me in the morning and, fumbling for it in the low morning light creeping around the edges of the curtains, I shut it off as quick as I could. I stretched, grinning to myself at the soreness radiating throughout my body.</p><p>My eyes drifted to my side, drinking in the sight of the tall, muscular form stretched out beside me, one arm thrown up over his face while the other one looped loosely over my thigh. Contentment spread through my body, commingling with the awe still swirling around at the fact that he was here, in my bed; that he was mine.</p><p>I shifted, carefully moving out from under his arm, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead before I slipped out of bed and padding naked to the bathroom. I took a quick shower (and shaved, of course), brushed my teeth, and wrapped a towel around my wet hair, then made my way quietly back into the bedroom to grab clothes.</p><p>I smiled at the rumpled, half-awake male lounging on his elbow in my bed, blinking those gorgeous eyes at me, the corner of his mouth quirked up in a secretive, sexy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou showered already?\u201d he asked, his voice deep and gravelly with sleep.</p><p>I laughed and couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cNah, it\u2019s raining in the bathroom,\u201d I quipped, following it with, \u201cCaptain Obvious.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cOh, really? Is that how it is?\u201d Without warning he was up off the bed and had me flung over his shoulder.</p><p>The towel tumbled from my head and I squealed as his hand landed solidly on my ass, smacking it smartly.</p><p>\u201cOw! Hey!\u201d I cried, ruining the effect by laughing again.</p><p>Brandon tossed me down on the bed and was over me before I\u2019d even settled from the bounce, his face buried in my neck, nipping and licking and kissing every inch, making me moan, shivers skittering up and down my spine as lust curled heavy in my belly. He kissed up my jaw, taking my mouth in a sweet, hot, tongue tangling kiss that had me panting by the time he lifted his lips from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he breathed, arching into me, pressing the evidence of his arousal firmly to the apex of my thighs, leaving no doubt as to the real question he was asking.</p><p>I lifted my mouth back to his, arching into him even more as I muttered, \u201cWe have time.\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through my hair, tangling them in the damp locks and pulling my head back to bite at the curve of my throat, drawing a low sound from my lips. He separated my thighs with his knees, sliding them open wide and lowering his hips to drag the heavy weight of his erection through the moisture gathered at my opening.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I sighed as he rubbed the engorged head of his shaft over my clit, the pearly drop of fluid seeping from the tip slicking over the tiny, swollen nubbin of nerves to mingle with my own wetness. He continued to slide the hot, hard length of himself between the folds of my sex, teasing my opening and then caressing my clit, alternating strokes with light taps against that tender bud.</p><p>The teasing was unbearable, each movement of his body on mine scooting me that much closer to the edge of coming, but keeping me perched on that razor line, not allowing me to go over. Finally, unable to take it anymore, I slid my hand between our bodies and captured him tightly in my fist and stroking him firmly from root to tip before I positioned him at my entrance and raised my hips sharply, impaling myself on his thickness.</p><p>My name was wrenched from his lips on a guttural cry as he took over, burying himself in my damp heat, slamming to the hilt. He held tightly to me for just an instant before he began to move, pounding into me with hard, heavy thrusts.</p><p>\u201cChloe...\u201d he moaned, then shifted, making me cry out as he quit my body.</p><p>It didn\u2019t last long, though. With quick, efficient movements, he flipped me over and pulled me to the end of the bed, positioning me on my knees, my face pressed to the mattress. \u201cGive me your hands,\u201d he demanded gruffly.</p><p>I stretched my arms down my body, along my sides and he grabbed them, pinning them, wrist to wrist, behind my back with one of his hands. \u201cYou okay? Is that uncomfortable?\u201d he asked me, softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine...\u201d I barely got out before he moved behind me, slicking his fingers through my folds, spreading me wide, and then he slammed home once more.</p><p>He fucked me, there\u2019s no other word for it. It was dark, heady, and raw, and I loved every second of it. I cried out with every thrust, the loudness of his flesh hitting mine acting as a catalyst, making my insides quiver and clench around him. His balls slapped heavily against my clit, adding another layer of almost painful pleasure to the drag, push, and pull of his thick, rock hard length plundering the tight, slick, depths of my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t do anything more than arch my hips into him and ride the waves of scream-inducing ecstasy as he held tightly to my hands, keeping them pinned with one hand while his other gripped my hip tightly, his fingers digging almost painfully into my flesh as he jerked me back into his thrusts.</p><p>With one, final, forceful plunge into me, the tide crested and broke. I screamed, a ragged, wild cry as my orgasm exploded through me, rushing over every inch of my body, tingling and burning through me like I\u2019d been injected with fireworks. Aftershocks singed the already frayed nerves of my sex as I came, and came, and came, still screaming with the never ending pleasure drinking me down. Brandon\u2019s hips locked tight to mine and he shouted hoarsely as he bathed my insides with his scalding hot release, each spurt making him flex and twitch inside my sheath, sending even more paroxysms of bliss over my shivering, well-used body.</p><p>Once our bodies had calmed a bit, he disengaged, making both of us moan. He slumped to the bed beside me, pulling me to him and spooning me as he ran a soothing, gentle hand up and down my side.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cGood morning to you, too!\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully chipper this morning,\u201d Allie said to me, suspiciously, a couple hours later at the store.</p><p>I\u2019d managed to get up out of bed, shower once more, and actually get dressed this time before heading to work. Brandon was moving a little slower, but he didn\u2019t have to be at the shop until ten this morning, so he was just getting in the shower when I left. Before I\u2019d walked out the door, though, he\u2019d pulled me close and kissed me, making me promise to be careful. He\u2019d said, \u2018I know that somewhere in the back of your mind, you\u2019re still worried that that jerkwad will find you. But Chloe, he won\u2019t ever get near you. Not if I have anything to do with it.\u2019</p><p>I jumped and spun to face Allie, who\u2019d snuck up behind me while I was organizing the book rack and putting some new stock out. I gave her a smile and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just a beautiful day,\u201d I said, winking.</p><p>She cocked her eyebrow at me and then glanced out the front windows, looking back at me with a baleful expression when I noticed that the sky outside had darkened and it had started to rain. \u201cWanna try again?\u201d she said, drolly, the corner of her mouth quirking up. She rubbed her belly absently and waited for my response.</p> <p>\u201cThings are just looking up for me. You know?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI hope so. You sure you\u2019re okay? I know your mom said that that monster was out of jail...I hate to bring it up, but there\u2019s no way he knows you\u2019re here, right?\u201d</p><p>I jerked my shoulder at her in a half-hearted shrug. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I feel like I\u2019m allowed to heal now, and, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I puked my guts out when I heard that he was out, but there\u2019s no way he knows where I am. He never knew that we lived out here before, he didn\u2019t know really anything about Jackson, and we never spent any time with my mom,\u201d I paused for a second, uncertainty wavering in my mind. \u201cAt least I hope not...\u201d I finished, softly.</p><p>She gave me a tender look, patted me on the shoulder, and sighed. \u201cWell, damn. I didn\u2019t mean to drag the mood down, but I didn\u2019t get to really talk much to you last night. And then you come in this morning, smiling, all sunshine and rainbows, and...wait. Did you...?\u201d</p><p>An odd look crossed her face and then she shook her head, but I could see the question forming on her lips. \u201cDid you and Brandon...?\u201d She didn\u2019t complete the question, just left it hanging.</p><p>I knew what she was asking and couldn\u2019t stop the grin spreading across my face.</p> <p>\u201cYou did!\u201d she crowed. \u201cHoly shit! You guys had sex! You...oh. Hmm.\u201d She nodded, but her smile slid away, melancholy taking its place.</p><p>My heart dropped. \u201cOh, God. Allie, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d I cried.</p><p>She waved it away, smiling once more, a faint, sad smile. \u201cNo, Chloe. Don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m happy for you, happy that you two are going to make a go of it. I guess I just didn\u2019t realize that it would-never mind.\u201d She turned away quickly and headed into the office.</p><p>I called after her, but she ignored me. I tossed the stack of books in my hand down into the box beside me and took a step toward the office to follow her, but the bell above the door jingled, heralding the arrival of a customer. I turned to greet the customer, smiling faintly when I saw it was Emma.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chloe!\u201d Emma called.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing today? Better?\u201d she asked, pulling me in and giving me a hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I sighed.</p> <p>She tsked. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. What\u2019s up? And where\u2019s Allie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I felt tears threaten as I gestured toward the office. \u201cShe\u2019s in there...she-I think she\u2019s mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Emma said, worriedly.</p><p>\u201cGod, Emma. I don\u2019t know why I even agreed to try to see where things would go with Brandon. I mean, Allie kept saying that I should because of the kiss, and this conversation we had, and...and...I\u2019m just a fuck-up, is what I am!\u201d I sobbed, burying my face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Emma cooed, wrapping her arms around me. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not, Chloe, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an explanation for this. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon and I...you know...and I was so happy this morning and she asked me why and then I smiled and then she got mad and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Slow down, chick. Take a breath.\u201d Emma held me back from her by the shoulders, not letting me go.</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. Tears slid silently down my cheeks as I looked at her and began again. \u201cI think she\u2019s mad that I slept with Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept with Brandon?\u201d she squealed, shaking me around a bit and grinning from ear to ear. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the whole point, wasn\u2019t it? To get you two together and then all that\u2019s left of the group is Leah and Calland to get paired off...of course, now there\u2019s T.J. that we need to worry about, but I don\u2019t kno--\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma! Focus!\u201d I said sternly, my voice still clogged with tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said contritely. Her brow furrowed then and she glanced worriedly at the closed office door Allie had disappeared behind. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand, because wasn\u2019t this whole thing her idea?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, a little churlishly, but I kinda felt like I had the right to be a little disgruntled about the situation. She\u2019s the one that insisted...but...no. I shouldn\u2019t have listened. Guilt choked me up again, and more tears followed the damp trails streaking my face.</p><p>Emma hugged me, gently rocking me from side to side. I could tell she was perplexed and was taking a second to think about what was going on and how to fix it. She\u2019s a fixer.</p><p>I closed my eyes and sighed. We stayed that way for a minute until she patted my back and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure this is all a misunderstanding. I\u2019ll talk to her, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my chin bumping her shoulder.</p><p>A throat cleared behind us and Allie said, timidly, \u201cIt\u2019s not a misunderstanding. It\u2019s just me being a bitchy asshat on top of a hormonal pregnant woman. I\u2019ve turned into an emotional wreck.\u201d She moved to us and reached out to touch my arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChloe, it\u2019s not you. I swear. It just...well, fuck it, it honestly hurt when I heard that you guys had finally taken that step. I know I pushed you into this whole thing and told you there was nothing to feel guilty about, and there\u2019s not. Don\u2019t you ever feel that way, and I should never have done or said anything to wipe away that gorgeous smile of yours that was plastered across your face. I\u2019m happy for you. I really am,\u201d she said earnestly.</p><p>She smiled, a small, hopeful smile. \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her and nodded slightly. \u201cYeah. And I\u2019m sorry for springing it on you like this, but-\u201d</p><p>She cut me off. \u201cYou didn\u2019t actually say a word, if you remember. You just stood there and grinned at me like a goofy idiot,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cAnd I was happy at first and then it kicked in and it stung a bit, but...forget about my stupid feelings. Seriously. Beyond the sting of it, I realize that this is a good thing, and that I really am happy for you two. There\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather see him with, or you for that matter. You\u2019re going to be great together.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled away from Emma and grabbed Allie, pulling her into me for a big hug. We held on to each other for a minute before she pulled away and asked, mischievously, \u201cSo did he put it on you good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie!\u201d Emma cried, aghast. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask her that after you just...you know what? Hell with it, I wanna know, too,\u201d she said, turning to me. \u201cSpill it, woman!\u201d</p><p>We all laughed and the tense moment was broken.</p><p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d I said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cUh, just good?\u201d Emma asked, sarcastically.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOkay, so it was great. Phenomenal...God, it was awesome!\u201d I said giggling as I gave in to the glee bubbling up inside me again.</p><p>We laughed and teased for a bit before I admitted, quietly, \u201cI told him I was falling in love with him. That I love him.\u201d</p><p>Both of them watched me with wide eyes, waiting with bated breath to hear what he said back. They prompted me silently and then smiled at me when I finished, \u201cHe said he was falling in fucking love with me, too. His words.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed and hugged me. Allie held me just a little bit longer and I could sense the sadness still clinging to her, but I didn\u2019t begrudge her that. I couldn\u2019t. This was definitely a unique situation, but I had faith that we would all be okay. Some people would probably never understand the dynamics of our little group, but we would, and that\u2019s all that mattered.</p><p>The conversation finally petered out and Emma left to go to the shop with the guys. Allie and I finished the day working with the easy camaraderie that had built between us, all traces of the emotional morning washed away.</p><p>With the store closed down for the day, I headed for my car to go home. My phone beeped and I pulled it out to see a text from Brandon.</p> <p>Hey, I have to stay a little late at the shop. Want to come here and wait for me? We can get dinner after I\u2019m done.</p><p>I hit reply and sent: Sure. On my way.</p><p>I pulled into the shop and walked inside to see him sitting at the counter, looking over some papers with Luke.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I said in greeting to them both.</p><p>Luke looked up and gave me a warm smile, winking at me when Brandon got up from the stool he was on and came around the counter to pull me into his arms. I wound my arms around his neck and rocked onto my toes to meet his kiss, feeling his smile against my lips at my eagerness.</p><p>He kissed me briefly, although it definitely wasn\u2019t chaste, and squeezed me tight against his chest before he loosened his hold enough for me to drop off my toes.</p><p>\u201cSo, you mentioned me inking you sometime. I have about an hour before my next client comes in because someone just chickened out.\u201d Brandon waggled his eyebrows at me exaggeratedly, which made him look like one of those cartoon villains.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI said I might have you ink me sometime, I never said when!\u201d I exclaimed, although I already knew I was going to agree.</p> <p>Luke laughed and shook his head at us. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna let that bozo ink you?\u201d he asked, jokingly. \u201cCome on, we all know that I\u2019m the better artist here,\u201d he said, shooting a mocking look at Brandon.</p><p>Brandon scowled in mock anger and dropped one arm from me long enough to punch his brother in the arm. Luke just laughed again and walked back to his office, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got some paperwork and inventory to do. You kids behave, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick,\u201d Brandon muttered under his breath, leaning in and pecking my lips once more. \u201cWhatcha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d I murmured against his lips. \u201cI think you could just kiss me for the next hour...\u201d I sighed.</p><p>He chuckled and pushed me back. \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to do that, baby, but I think Luke would probably get jealous.\u201d</p><p>We waited for his next client, bantering back and forth with Luke and Emma, who\u2019d come back to the shop lugging a box of tacos from Taco Bell. Luke had muttered under his breath about her obsession with the restaurant, giving Emma an innocent look when she glared at him and dared him to say another word.</p><p>I sat with Emma when Luke and Brandon both had to go back with clients, talking and laughing until they were done. When they closed the shop up, Luke and Emma headed home and Brandon and I headed to dinner.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>The next couple of weeks settled into a routine. My days were spent working or hanging out with the girls, and my nights were filled with Brandon. It still seemed so surreal to me to think that we were together, that we had moved beyond friendship into something more.</p><p>He\u2019d been so attentive, and the sex? Off the charts, HOT.</p><p>I\u2019d been hanging out more and more with Emma and Allie because Leah had been seeing Ian non-stop since the night she met him. He\u2019s seems to be good to her and she\u2019s so stupidly giddy every time she talks about him, which is the only reason I don\u2019t smack her silly for abandoning her best friend. Of course, since Brandon and I got together, too, I was guilty of the same thing.</p><p>But who could blame me? Just this morning he woke me up with his mouth kissing every inch of my body and didn\u2019t stop until my eyes were crossed and I thought my toes would never uncurl.</p><p>A snuffle at my feet caught my attention and I looked down to see Grady sitting, pretty as you please, in front of me. Allie and Jackson were going to Cincinnati for the night (for real, this time), so they\u2019d asked me to keep Grady. It was Saturday, Allie\u2019s mom, Daisy, was watching the store today, and it\u2019s closed on Sunday, so they weren\u2019t coming back until morning to get him. I didn\u2019t mind, but I\u2019d made sure they brought his crate this time.</p><p>His furry little face was so angelic that I had to smile. Then, I shit you not, he opened his mouth and grinned at me, just like his father does! I laughed at him, but it died pretty quickly when I realized he had the remnants of something that looked suspiciously like a bar of soap stuck all through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cGrady...\u201d I sighed. Then, so I could pull him closer to see what it was, I cooed, \u201cAnd just what did you get into, boy? Huh? Did you find my shameful stash of hotel soaps?\u201d</p><p>He wiggled in my hands and yipped in excitement, so I picked him up, muttering at the fact that he\u2019d grown and definitely gotten heavier. He was probably closing in on fifteen to twenty pounds now and came to my knees. His paws were roughly the size of saucers (okay, maybe not quite that large) and I figured he would probably be as big, if not bigger, than his furry father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When his face got close to mine, he licked my cheek and, without even having to inspect the contents of his teeth, I knew without a doubt it was soap. His breath smelled rather fresh...in a soapy-clean way. He wiggled again so I put him down and trudged down the hallway toward the bathroom, dreading the mess I would find. Sure enough, there was a trail of ripped wrappers and three little soap cakes either crumbled up completely or bearing gnaw marks. My floor was also pock-marked with a half-dozen or so little puddles of shampoo and conditioners because, apparently, the plastic bottles were tasty, too.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you get into the cabinet, you little shit?!\u201d I asked him, conversationally. He gave a small whine in response and bounded out of the bathroom as I started cleaning up. I closed the door to the cabinet under the sink, where he\u2019d managed to Houdini it open somehow and drag out the basket I\u2019d had stashed under there.</p><p>When I closed it, I realized that a curling iron I\u2019d shoved under the sink had shifted, blocking the door from shutting all the way. It left a very small gap, but it was enough to let the little demon dog worm his nose inside until he was able to get his head in.</p><p>I cleaned up the mess, shaking my head and muttering the whole time. I\u2019d just finished when I heard a shout and then pounding feet as Brandon raced down the hallway, hollering for me.</p> <p>\u201cChloe! There\u2019s something wrong with Grady!\u201d He sounded frantic, which made me panic, because I didn\u2019t even think about the fact that he ate soap...God, what could that do to his little belly? I jumped up and raced out the door, meeting him halfway down the hall.</p><p>Brandon was holding the pup under his furry armpits, dangling him in front of him. I stopped, my alarm giving way to uncontrollable laughter, even though I knew it was not a good time for it. I couldn\u2019t help it, though.</p><p>Apparently, Grady had gotten a drink from his bowl in the kitchen and the water, mixed with the soap bits stuck in his teeth and agitated by his lapping, created a lovely, frothy white beard of bubbles that was dripping down his doggy chin like a deranged, soapy Santa. His tongue was lolling from his mouth, and he was still wearing his goofy puppy-grin, like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s foaming at the mouth...he has rabies or some shit! What the fuck is going on? Why are you laughing?\u201d Brandon shouted at me.</p><p>I laughed even louder, clutching my stomach, unable to form words as tears streamed from my eyes because, as he was yelling at me, Grady belched, a lovely, bottom-of-the-gut burp that gurgled from his mouth. With that burp, a perfect soap bubble sailed out into the air, floating over my head to pop on the wall behind me.</p> <p>Brandon glared at me. \u201cJesus, Chloe. Can you stop laughing long enough to tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>I wiped my eyes and, still chuckling, took the dog from him. I carried him back into the bathroom and grabbed a towel to wipe his face, explaining to Brandon what happened while I did.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all I got for a reply until he said, \u201cIs it gonna make him sick? Did he eat it all?\u201d</p><p>My concern returned and I glanced into the trash can where I\u2019d deposited the crumbled soap pieces. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think he ate much of it, just kinda crumbled it all up and chewed on it. I probably should call his vet to see. Do you know who they use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably take him to Doc, same as everyone else. That\u2019s where we take Doug and that\u2019s where Emma and Luke take DJ now, too. I\u2019ve got his number in my phone.\u201d Brandon pulled his phone out and called the vet\u2019s office as he walked out of the bathroom.</p> <p>Grady, still in my arms, suddenly looked at me with a pained expression (yes, even dogs can look pained) and whined.</p><p>\u201cWhat, boy? Does your tummy hurt?\u201d I cooed to him softly, ruffling his fur. He whined again and I shifted him in my arms before placing him down on the floor. We headed out into the living room to find Brandon still talking on the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes...uh-huh...okay. Okay, thanks Shirley.\u201d Brandon paused again, nodding as he listened to whoever Shirley was. \u201cWell that doesn\u2019t sound very pleasant...okay. Got it. Thanks again!\u201d Brandon said as he hit end on his phone.</p><p>He looked at me and explained, \u201cShe double checked with Doc and he said that his stomach is probably going to be a little upset, but it won\u2019t hurt him as long as no big chunks get lodged in his intestines, causing a blockage. She said that he probably will throw--\u201d</p><p>His words cut off as Grady made a horrible hacking sound and then horked all over the carpet. We both stared in horrified disgust for a second until Brandon gagged and ran from the room.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I yelled after him.</p><p>\u201cGotta get to the shop, have a client!\u201d was shouted back at me, followed by another gag. I heard the back door slam and shook my head in disbelief. He was off today, there was no client!</p><p>Grady was done spewing everything in his stomach all over my floor and sat watching me, wagging his tail in happiness once more.</p> <p>I cleaned up the mess, thanking my lucky stars that I\u2019d bought more carpet cleaner last time I\u2019d gone to the store, and then checked my phone when it dinged. A bubbling, squelching, almost-empty-ketchup-bottle sound came from behind me and my heart sank as I read the text I\u2019d just gotten from Brandon without turning around.</p><p>He\u2019ll be fine, Doc said. He just will probably throw up, which you know already. He\u2019ll also probably have the runs. If he doesn\u2019t eat or drink and keeps getting sick, take him in. When are Allie and Jacks coming back?</p><p>I closed my eyes and groaned, knowing what I would find when I turned around...and it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. Nor was anything else that came out of that poor dog for the next couple of hours. He acted completely normal between bouts, bounding around the yard until he had to hunch over for the soap to come out whichever end it decided to that time. Thank God it was a nice day because I had no choice but to stay outside. No way in hell was that happening on my carpet any more!</p><p>Four hours after the initial explosion, Grady had ceased his disgusting attack on my yard. I\u2019d have to say the only upside to this whole fiasco was that his vomit didn\u2019t stink. Instead, it smelled rather fresh, like...well, like soap.</p><p>I allowed him back inside finally and fixed myself some lunch, after I\u2019d blocked him into the kitchen with me, of course. I didn\u2019t want to take a chance in the event he decided to have more digestive pyrotechnics, but I figured if it happened, it\u2019d be easier to clean off the tile than it would be to have to drag out the carpet cleaner every time. Fingers crossed, though, that he was completely done\u2014that the soap had left the canine!</p><p>I was standing at the stove, stirring a pot of mac &amp; cheese (the boxed kind, I was being lazy) when I heard the door open and keys being dropped on the front hall table.</p><p>\u201cIs it over?\u201d Brandon hollered cautiously.</p><p>Mentally high-fiving myself for my evil ingenuity/payback, I made a hacking sound in my throat a couple times, sounding like Grady had earlier, and then grinned when I heard Brandon gag.</p><p>\u201cAww, man...\u201d he groaned and then gagged again.</p><p>I laughed out loud, giving away my game. I couldn\u2019t help it; I\u2019d finally found a weakness!</p><p>I saw him peek his head around the corner, his eyes darting around the room wildly to make sure he wouldn\u2019t see anything gross. I kept laughing and stirring the noodles, still chuckling as I spooned one out to check for doneness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was you?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>I nodded gleefully and popped the noodle in mouth, happy to find it was done. I moved methodically around the kitchen, straining the water out, adding milk, butter, and the day-glo orange cheese powder as Brandon scowled at me.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I shrugged and grinned at him again. \u201cMaybe not nice, but it was pretty funny,\u201d I said smartly. \u201cAnd speaking of niceness, why should I be nice to you when you weren\u2019t nice to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was very nice to you this morning!\u201d he said, deepening his voice and waggling his brows at me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him. \u201cNo, Cassanova, that\u2019s not what I was talking about. Perv. I was talking about the fact that you lied to me. Seriously? A client?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hand over the back of his head and sighed before shooting me a sheepish smile. \u201cI panicked and it was the first thing I could think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, next time, you might keep in mind that we\u2019d already had a whole conversation about you being off today.\u201d I winked at him, letting him know that I wasn\u2019t mad.</p><p>He peered over my shoulder as I spooned a healthy helping of mac &amp; cheese into a bowl and then watched as I took a big bite. \u201cCan I have some of that?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d I said succinctly.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he repeated, staring at me incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d I replied, taking another big bite.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked petulantly.</p><p>I walked by him and smacked him in the arm with my spoon, leaving an orange smear on his skin. He stood there gaping at me as I strolled into the living room and curled into my favorite spot on my couch.</p><p>He followed and leaned against the door frame between the kitchen and living room, crossing his arms over his chest. He motioned with his hand, an impatient gesture to indicate he was waiting for my answer.</p> <p>\u201cYou were supposed to bring me breakfast this morning and, well...where\u2019d it go?\u201d I cocked my head at him, partly being a playful smartass, but also genuinely curious.</p><p>He\u2019d left after Allie and Jacks had shown up to drop Grady off to go to McDonald\u2019s because I was craving a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. I\u2019d let the pup into the house while I stood in the driveway talking to them, which is apparently when Grady had gone on his soap hunting expedition.</p><p>Brandon hadn\u2019t been holding anything but \u2018Santa-dog\u2019 in his hand when he\u2019d come back, and there\u2019d been no bag on the counter, so what the hell?</p><p>He shot me a guilty look. \u201cI went through the drive through and got everything. So I thought, anyway. I didn\u2019t realize until I pulled into the drive that they\u2019d forgotten to give me your frou frou coffee thing. I ran in to tell you before I went back up to get it because I didn\u2019t take my phone with me and...well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I asked, wanting the rest of it.</p><p>\u201cYour bagel was good?\u201d he said sweetly, the end of it rising like a question, giving him an innocent boyish air.</p><p>I gave him an evil look and asked, \u201cAnd what about my frou frou coffee drink, as you so politely called it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d he said, drawing it out. \u201cI might have drank that, just a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped and then, glaring at him, spooned up another bite of macaroni, shoving it in and chewing as angrily as I could. Which was kind of hard to do. It\u2019s hard to angry eat. I managed to knock the spoon against my front tooth when I shoveled another bite in and then scowled even harder when Brandon laughed his ass off at me.</p><p>He moved in front of me and leaned in, lightly kissing the scrunched up tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute,\u201d he said, smiling at me.</p><p>I smiled back at him, letting him know I wasn\u2019t really mad (which he obviously was aware of...either that or I\u2019m not very scary when I\u2019m \u2018mad\u2019), and tilted my face to receive his chaste kiss on my lips. \u201cOkay, you can have some macaroni,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>He shook his head at me. \u201cNah, I\u2019m still pretty full from eating my breakfast and yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ass!\u201d I yelled, laughing at him again.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Emma had called a little later and asked if we wanted to have a cookout and a bonfire with them that night. She said she\u2019d been craving s\u2019mores, too, so that\u2019s what we were instructed to bring. We ran by the store and bought double everything to make sure there was enough and then went back home and loaded Grady up to head over.</p><p>We pulled up and Doug was sitting on the porch, looking decidedly pissed off for a dog. I got out of the car and padded up the steps, stopping beside him to scratch his head and ask him what was wrong.</p><p>Brandon just shook his head at me and let Grady out of the backseat.</p><p>Doug stared up at me with doleful eyes, then threw his head back and let out a ululating half-howl, half-growl/groan. I made sympathetic noises to him and he kept \u201ctalking\u201d to me, letting me know about whatever injustice had been done to him.</p><p>When he\u2019d gotten it off his chest, he looked up at me expectantly. I told him, \u201cQuite the story there, huh?\u201d He gave me a sneeze/snuffle that shook his head in what looked like a nod and then trotted off to follow Grady, who was galloping through the grass at full speed.</p><p>\u201cDamn dog,\u201d Brandon said affectionately as he watched Doug go.</p><p>We walked into the house to see Luke standing on one side of the counter in the kitchen, a jar of peanut butter in one hand and a jar of pickles in the other. Both hands were raised above his head and he was shaking his head vehemently at Emma, who was on the opposite side of the counter. She was mean-mugging the hell out of Luke and yelling at him.</p><p>\u201cGive me back my peanut butter and pickles, Lucas Tyler Crimshaw! Right now or else I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll...aaiiiyeeeee!\u201d She shrieked in frustration and stomped her foot on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo, Emma Marie Crimshaw! I won\u2019t give you back the pickles and peanut butter! I draw the line at pickle butter milkshakes. It\u2019s just wrong, woman!\u201d Luke yelled back at her. He caught sight of us standing in the living room, watching the drama unfold.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, tell her! Tell her that she can\u2019t do that to my daughter!\u201d</p><p>Emma whirled around and stomped over to Brandon. Well, stomped as much as she could. It was more like a heavy-footed waddle. \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, dear brother-in-law, you\u2019ll go in there and get my pickles and my peanut butter and you\u2019ll like it!\u201d</p><p>Brandon tried to keep a straight face as he replied, \u201cI\u2019m not getting in the middle of this. It\u2019s too entertaining to interrupt, but could you wait until I make some popcorn to finish arguing?\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s face screwed up and a tear streaked down her cheek. Brandon\u2019s mouth dropped and he backpedaled, trying to assure her that he would get the stuff from Luke, begging her not to cry. In the kitchen, Luke dropped his arms and set the jars down, shaking his head in what I figured was defeat.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cBro...no. She\u2019s playing you. She\u2019s completely hormonal and can cry at the drop of a hat, almost on command. It\u2019s a new talent she\u2019s exploited far too often,\u201d he emphasized, loudly, \u201cand you\u2019re playing right into it,\u201d Luke told Brandon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma huffed and rolled her eyes at both of the men before she looked at me and said, \u201cCome on, Chloe. You can come see the nursery that Luke finally finished while they get the grill going. You know, since the peanut butter and pickle Nazi over there is being an asshole to his pregnant wife.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and followed her upstairs. We went into the nursery, which had previously been a guest room. It was done up in pink and brown polka dots and was so absolutely adorable, as well as definitely baby-chic. Not even born yet, and already completely spoiled!</p><p>I smiled fondly over at Emma but my smile faded when I saw her rummaging through the closet in the baby\u2019s room. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She rifled around a bit more before she spun, yelling \u2018Ah-ha!\u2019 gleefully as she held a jar of peanut butter aloft.</p> <p>I quirked a brow at her and said, dryly, \u201cYou keep peanut butter in your daughter\u2019s closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my emergency jar. I\u2019ve moved on from tacos to the peanut butter and pickles. It was cheese slices wrapped around pickles for a few days but then I had a peanut butter sandwich with a pickle on the side and some of my peanut butter touched my pickle and that\u2019s all she wrote!\u201d Emma said, leaning toward me like it was a big secret. Which it apparently was, considering the fact that she\u2019s hiding foodstuffs around the house.</p><p>\u201cReally, Emma? Pickles and cheese slices...Weren\u2019t you the one who told me that was disturbing not too long ago when everyone was razzing on Allie for eating them on pizza? So, what about the pickles, you have a jar of those stashed around here somewhere?\u201d I asked, jokingly.</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cNo,\u201d she sighed. \u201cPickles have to be refrigerated and I think Luke would be suspicious if I smuggled a mini-fridge into the house.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at her and gave her a hug, smiling fondly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Emma. I\u2019ll go get you a pickle and we\u2019ll go hide outside so you can eat it.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, her entire face beaming with joy and we beelined for the kitchen, Emma all but dragging me along behind her. Moral of the story? Never get between a pregnant woman and her pickles and peanut butter...yikes.</p><p>We got lucky; Calland had shown up with a new flavor of the month, and Allie and Jackson, lured back by the temptation of a cookout and bonfire, apparently, were walking in the door so Luke was occupied greeting everyone.</p><p>As Emma scurried behind them, dropping to the floor to crawl behind the cabinets (which was hilarious...have you ever seen a very pregnant woman crawl on the floor?) I ran interference by hugging and talking to everyone in the living room, making sure to engage Luke as much as possible so he wouldn\u2019t glance into the kitchen to see the refrigerator door mysteriously open and close on it\u2019s own.</p><p>Allie, on the other hand, noticed. She opened her mouth and I hugged her to me again, having to almost bend in half to do it because of her belly, whispering in her ear, \u201cShe\u2019s crave-obsessed and Luke\u2019s being a pickle Nazi.\u201d</p><p>She guffawed in my ear and then cut off her laugh so hard she choked. Immediately, Jackson was there, almost shoving me out of the way as he patted her on the back and frantically tried to get her to tell him she was okay.</p><p>She waved him off, but the damage was done. Calland had piped up.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my sister? I want her to meet Legsy.\u201d</p><p>Luke started to look around but at my frantic look, Brandon, even though he glanced at me like I\u2019d lost my mind, started to say something to distract Luke again. But then what Calland said trumped it and he lost his train of thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014what was her name? I think I misheard you,\u201d he asked Calland.</p><p>Calland answered again, an unmistakable twinkle in his eye. \u201cLegsy. Her name is Legsy.\u201d</p><p>Brandon fought hard against his grin and politely held out his hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Legsy. That\u2019s a very...unusual name.\u201d (Luke was definitely distracted now. Good thing too, because I could see hands moving carefully along the counter until they connected with a plate, dragging it over the edge to disappear.)</p><p>She simpered. \u201cOh! Thank you! My Daddy, bless his heart, he\u2019s not a very good speller. When I was born, see, he was writin\u2019 the paperwork out for my poor, exhausted Momma, she said to name me Lexi. You know, like with the \u2018X\u2019. But her words were a little slurred, well, from the drugs and all, and it came out like Legsy. So that\u2019s what he wrote and my Momma didn\u2019t see it until a \u2018lil bit later but by then it was too late. So that\u2019s my name, Legsy. You know, like I\u2019m all legs, Legsy!\u201d</p><p>Crickets. I swear I heard them. That\u2019s how stunned we all were, with the exception of Calland, who had more than likely already heard the story. We were all just staring at her, varying expressions plastered on our faces, while she grinned and...well...you guessed it. Simpered.</p><p>Where the hell does he find these girls? Good Lord, the boy has found some doozies just since I\u2019d been in town, and I couldn\u2019t even imagine the ones before that!</p> <p>Brandon cleared his throat but still didn\u2019t manage to think of anything else to say. Just then a muffled crunching sound, followed by a low \u2018mmmmmmm\u2019 sounded from the kitchen. I gave a mental \u2018eek\u2019 and opened my mouth to say something but it was too late.</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes narrowed and he glared at me. I looked away, a flush creeping up my face at being caught red-handed helping the pickle bandit. He reached out and snagged my arm, pulling me behind him after motioning everyone to be quiet.</p><p>They followed us, every single one of them tip-toeing as best they could. We all peered over the counter, Luke shaking his head with resign and a touch of exasperation at the sight before us. Emma was sitting on the floor, leaning back against the counter with her legs splayed in front of her. The open jar of pickles was sitting beside her, and she had the jar of peanut butter in one hand, dipping a pickle spear into it with another.</p><p>A louder crunch sounded as she took a bite and then froze with it hanging out of her mouth as she noticed her audience. She finished her bite, chewed slowly, and then, rather defensively, said, \u201cWhat the hell are you shaking your head for, Lucas? It\u2019s not a pickle butter milkshake, so get the fuck over it!\u201d</p><p>Luke just sighed and went to help his wife up while we all laughed. There\u2019s never a dull moment around here...</p><p>A couple of hours later, bellies full of perfectly grilled hamburgers and hot dogs and all the other requisite cookout fare, we were all relaxing by the fire, enjoying each other\u2019s company and laughing at the antics of the dogs. All three of them had been chasing each other around the yard until the pups tired Doug out and he collapsed in a heap at Luke\u2019s feet, panting and grinning his doggy-grin at everyone.</p><p>Grady and DJ followed suit, although DJ chose to lay on top of Doug while Grady clamored up into Jackson\u2019s lap like he was still a tiny little thing.</p><p>While Emma broke out the s\u2019more fixings, Luke caught my eye and motioned for me to follow him. I did, and Brandon, shooting me a curious look, did the same.</p><p>We walked into the kitchen and Luke turned to look at me. \u201cChloe, I hate to do this tonight since we\u2019ve been having such a good time, but I don\u2019t want to let it go without telling you. If I know my brother,\u201d he glanced wryly at Brandon, \u201cit won\u2019t be too much longer before he\u2019s trying to sneak you off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay...\u201d I said, waiting for the bomb to drop.</p><p>\u201cThis came to the house addressed to you. I didn\u2019t open it, and I kind of hid it from your brother, too, because I didn\u2019t want him to go off half-cocked. But this worries me because if it\u2019s what I think it is, then you\u2019ve got trouble. And if you have trouble, we have trouble,\u201d he said, motioning to himself, Brandon, and the whole of the house, indicating Jackson and the rest of them even though they were still outside and clueless.</p><p>I reached out tentatively to take the envelope he was holding but Brandon snatched it away. I didn\u2019t argue. A rock had settled in my stomach and was growing because I had a feeling that things were about to go bad.</p><p>But I had no idea just how bad.</p> <p>Chapter 15</p><p>I stared at the envelope in my hand, turning it over and over and over but not opening it. I\u2019d ignored it last night as best I could, tucking it into my purse and going back outside with the others.</p><p>Luke had hugged me before we went back outside and asked that I call him when I finally read it. He\u2019d looked at me so seriously and said, \u201cNot sure how he got it, but he\u2019s got our address because that\u2019s where Jackson was. That\u2019s what I figure anyway, but, babe...I got a baby about to pop out and I need to know what\u2019s going on so I can protect my family. \u2018Cause there\u2019s no fucking way in hell that anyone is going to touch so much as a hair on the head of a member of my family.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were the most intense I\u2019d ever seen them, almost scary-intense. I\u2019d gulped and nodded, the sick feeling in my stomach growing that much bigger because of the threat I\u2019d caused to people that have been nothing but nice to me, to my friends that had become my family.</p><p>He\u2019d leaned even closer to me then and made sure I\u2019d understood what he was saying. \u201cAnd by family, Chloe, that means you, too.\u201d</p> <p>I flipped the letter over again and stared hard at the postmark and the return address scrawled in the corner. The address and inmate number glared back at me, taunting me with the knowledge that this was from him.</p><p>\u201cSunshine, let me do that for you. Please,\u201d Brandon implored quietly.</p><p>We were sitting in bed on what should have been a happy, normal Sunday morning, when we should have been getting ready to go to Emma\u2019s parents\u2019 house for Sunday breakfast. Instead, there we were. Quiet. Serious. And the sick feeling in my stomach had yet to leave.</p><p>I sighed and closed my eyes, shaking my head at him. \u201cNo, I have to do this. I\u2019ve been pretty damn strong since I left California. I\u2019m not letting him get the best of me.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, I ripped the envelope open and pulled out the single, handwritten page. I skimmed through it and then, knowing Brandon was getting impatient, I read it out loud, my voice wavering and cracking with suppressed emotion.</p><p>Dearest, Ungrateful Slut,</p> <p>By the time you get this letter, I\u2019ll be out. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know where you are, because I do. I\u2019m coming for what\u2019s mine, bitch.</p><p>Don\u2019t bother thinking we won\u2019t be together again. I\u2019m giving you a second chance to please me, regardless of the fact that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve spread your fucking thighs for countless diseased pricks since I\u2019ve been gone. I\u2019ve got a bottle of bleach with your name on it so I can disinfect your nasty cunt before you welcome your daddy home.</p><p>See you soon, bitch.</p><p>Greg</p><p>P.S.-Don\u2019t think your big, bad brother is going to save you just because you ran to him. In fact, I\u2019ll be paying your mom a visit before I come get you. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to come see you, might make it a little bit easier for you to decide to be a good little whore and come home.</p><p>\u201cMOTHER FUCKER!\u201d Brandon roared, flinging himself out of the bed to pace angrily around the room. He raged, mumbling incoherently, his voice deeper than usual, and it wasn\u2019t in a sexy way. His face was dark, murderous.</p><p>I dropped the letter and watched him silently. When his growling increased, I beseeched, \u201cBrandon-\u201d but my words were cut off on a gasp when he drew his fist back and punched the wall.</p><p>The drywall crumbled beneath the onslaught, a hole immediately appearing. With an anguished cry, he dropped to his knees and covered his head with his hands. In a flash, I was off the bed, falling to the floor beside him and whispering to him brokenly. I could hear him breathing heavily, but couldn\u2019t tell if it was anger or pain.</p> <p>I grabbed for his hand, beyond sick at the thought of the damage he might\u2019ve done to himself...to that beautiful hand of his that is his livelihood. How could he tattoo with a broken hand?</p><p>He didn\u2019t let me have it, pulled it away from my grasp immediately. But it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t want me to touch him. No, it was because he reached for me, dragged me into his arms and buried his face in my neck. He drew in a ragged breath and squeezed me tighter as he whispered, \u201cOn pain of death, I swear to you, Chloe, he will never lay a hand on you again. I will never let you go, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>I curled into him and held him just as tightly, letting the tears finally fall. He rocked me, giving me his strength, and if I hadn\u2019t been in love with him already, I\u2019d have fallen right then and there.</p><p>When the tears subsided, Brandon shifted me in his arms and got to his feet, still holding me. He sat me gingerly down on the end of the bed and knelt in front of me, looking up at my face earnestly while he wiped away the tears lingering on my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Chloe. I don\u2019t care how it happened, how fast it seems, none of it. All I care about is the fact that we\u2019re together and that\u2019s not going to change. You\u2019re mine now and I\u2019m not letting you go. And I for damn sure won\u2019t stand by and let anyone threaten you. We\u2019ve got this, sunshine. I promise.\u201d With that, he leaned in and kissed me sweetly.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, your hand,\u201d I whispered to him, trying to get a good look at it.</p><p>He moved his hand up and looked at it like he was just realizing that something was off about it. The skin was puffy and bruised already, broken in a couple places and seeping blood. He sighed heavily and swore under his breath before he shook it off. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, sunshine. I\u2019ll get over it. Won\u2019t be able to work for a couple days, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him helplessly but he shrugged the injury off, pushing up off the floor and reaching for his phone. He dialed and when the other party answered, the conversation was short and to the point.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad news. Get Jacks and get here when breakfast is done.\u201d He listened for a second and then cracked a grin very briefly. \u201cYeah, I know. Tell Jan and Ben I said hi.\u201d</p><p>He hung up without saying goodbye and turned to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get dressed, baby. Group will be here after a while to talk.\u201d</p><p>It seemed like it didn\u2019t take any time at all before my house was overflowing with friends and family, including Leah and Ian. Jackson had walked in the door, letting me know that my mom was on a trip with friends for two weeks and would be coming directly here when she got back, and then scooped me up in his arms, hugging me and reiterating what had already been said to me in various ways.</p><p>\u201cBastard won\u2019t get near mom, and he won\u2019t touch a fucking hair on your head ever again, little sister,\u201d he grunted. He gave me one last squeeze and put me down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The letter had already made its rounds, drawing a mixed-bag of reactions from every one, but Jackson\u2019s and Luke\u2019s reactions were pretty much like Brandon\u2019s, just without the wall-punching. Ian patted my shoulder and offered to help with whatever he could. Calland had shown up a little later; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him when he wasn\u2019t smiling, but there was absolutely no trace of the levity he usually showed as he put his arm around my shoulder and kissed the top of my head. He didn\u2019t say anything, but he didn\u2019t have to. I knew.</p><p>My heart was full to bursting once again at the love I was being shown and I wondered briefly how my life had gone from such shit to better than I\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>Hours later, there was a plan set, I was temporarily out of a job, and everyone had left, leaving me alone with a tall, gorgeous man who was busy cleaning (yes, I said CLEANING!) up pizza boxes and plates.</p><p>On his last return trip from the kitchen, I grabbed him, pressed my body against his and wrapped my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He chuckled softly before he complied, pressing his lips sweetly against mine for a brief second. I whimpered when he pulled away and he smiled at me, but it faded as he stared into my eyes, looking intently for something, but I wasn\u2019t sure what.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked me, quietly. \u201cI know we kind of took over everything and didn\u2019t even really ask your opinion. But, sunshine, you have to agree, it\u2019s what\u2019s best until that dickface is behind bars again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I replied firmly. \u201cI\u2019m really okay with everything because it\u2019s just nice to know that I have people standing behind me. I mean, I know I had people behind me always, but I was too stupid to accept it, to let anyone know the horror I was living. I won\u2019t make that mistake again. I won\u2019t let him take another second of my life away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he said, snuggling me against him again.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d I asked him dryly, tilting my head back to look up at him.</p><p>He grimaced a bit and gave me a sheepish look before he answered. \u201cPretty fuckin\u2019 sore. Luke\u2019s having T.J. fill in for me, take on some extra hours for a couple of days. So, upside, I guess, is that you get me all to yourself since you don\u2019t have to work and neither do I.\u201d</p><p>I sighed guiltily. \u201cYeah, I know. But how can I do that to Allie, even though everyone agreed it was best, when she\u2019s due like any time now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie\u2019s mom is taking over for a while and, not that it\u2019s public knowledge yet, but Allie\u2019s been thinking of selling the store since Jackson\u2019s firm is very successful and she wants to be home with the baby.\u201d He said it nonchalantly, but I could hear the caution behind it.</p><p>I blinked up at him, stunned, because if that happened, I\u2019d really be out of a job and possibly even a home.</p><p>Brandon pulled away from me and ran his hands over his face. He blew out a breath and said, \u201cWell, actually...Luke and I were going to talk to you about something. Emma is wanting to stay home with their baby, too, which means she won\u2019t be available to help out in the shop. So...would you be willing to come to work for us?\u201d He peered down at me, his face hopeful.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked him, surprised that situations just seem to resolve themselves so quickly around here.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d was my only reply. Not that I would refuse the job; seriously, I wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>Brandon hugged me to him once more and said those five little words that every woman wants to hear. \u201cLet\u2019s go get some ice cream.\u201d</p><p>I grinned up at him and nodded. Okay, so there could be other words that women want to hear, but who doesn\u2019t love ice cream?</p><p>We got our ice cream and walked around the park, holding hands as we ate our cones. He leaned me up against a tree and kissed the daylights out of me when our ice cream was done, laughing as he gamely explained he was only trying to get the chocolate off my lip. I wasn\u2019t complaining though, and he definitely didn\u2019t need an excuse to kiss me senseless...</p><p>We headed home when the sun was setting and, by the look in Brandon\u2019s eyes, our night was just beginning.</p> <p>We walked in the door at home and I\u2019d barely gotten the door shut and locked behind us when I found myself being spun around and pressed against the door by his body. He locked his lips on mine in a heated kiss as his hands found my hips, slid down a bit and lifted me up into his arms. My legs automatically wrapped around his waist, nestling the hardened ridge of him between my thighs, which drew a ragged groan from his throat.</p><p>He wrenched his lips from mine and leaned his forehead against mine, his breath puffing against my mouth as he whispered, \u201cIs this okay? I know it\u2019s been a rough day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t stop...\u201d I moaned, seeking his kiss once more.</p><p>He complied, his mouth slanting over mine in a rough, deep caress, his tongue sliding inside to duel with mine before slipping back out as his teeth closed over my bottom lip, sucking on it and then biting sharply.</p><p>I arched into him, crushing my breasts to his chest, rubbing myself against the engorged column of flesh trapped beneath the placket of his jeans. One of his hands left my thigh and slid up my body to tangle in my hair, jerking my head back as he moved down my throat, sucking and licking the tender flesh and sending shivers down my spine.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d he panted against my throat and I nodded wildly, feverish to feel him against me, skin to skin, with his length buried deep inside my body.</p><p>He carried me into the bedroom and laid me on the bed, but he didn\u2019t follow me down. Instead, he ordered me to strip as he moved to my closet. He watched me distractedly, torn between drinking in the sight of my naked flesh that each removed article of clothing revealed, and whatever he was reaching for in the darkness of the closet.</p><p>Finally he swore, snapped the light on, grabbed something, and then the light was off and he was on the bed with me. I have no idea how he\u2019d done it so quickly, but he was naked when he got there.</p><p>I gasped and arched into him as his body came down over mine, his hard to my soft, every inch of him pressed to me. His teeth nipped at my shoulder and then he kissed his way down my stomach, stopping to lick along each of my hip bones, moving down a little further as he hooked his arms under my thighs and pulled them apart, spreading me open and covering me hungrily with his mouth.</p><p>His tongue made a long, leisurely stroke through my slick folds, the tip swirling around and around my clit before sliding back down and inside me, tasting every inch of my dripping wet heat. He kept up his assault on my tender flesh until I was hovering on the edge of release but, right before I tipped over into blissful orgasm, he moved, kissing back up my body until his lips met mine.</p><p>I tasted myself on his tongue, moaning at the heady sensations coursing through my veins, lust overriding every thought. He ate at my mouth with a ferocity that belied his sure movements. He moved in haste, yes, but there was nothing hurried about the way he slowed and sipped at my lips and plucked at the tips of my breasts, the tight buds swollen, tender, and aching with need. The smooth, firm head of his turgid length slid effortlessly though my damp folds, the ridge of him dragging over my clit with every thrusting stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He broke the kiss on a groan and shifted, moving off of me just enough to reach between our bodies. He positioned himself at my dripping entrance, the tip barely penetrating my opening before he thrust deeply, seating himself fully inside me. At that same, earth-shattering moment, his hand moved, a buzzing came to life, and my clit turned to fire as pleasure raced over me.</p><p>With a high-pitched cry, I flew over the edge, coming hard as he impaled me with his hardness repeatedly while his fingers worked my micro bullet over my now over-sensitized clit. I was jerking against him, trying to pull away even as I arched into him, seeking more of the blinding ecstasy filling me, pushing me almost violently to that razor edge and beyond once more.</p><p>I screamed out my release until I was hoarse, my fingers clutching and scratching helplessly at his back and shoulders as I was dragged under by waves and waves of almost unbearable sensation. Brandon, with one last hard thrust, slammed deep inside my clenching heat, spilling himself inside of me on a loud, primal shout before he collapsed across me, taking care, though, not to crush me beneath his weight.</p><p>We laid there panting, our sweat slickened skin sticking together where we touched, his heavy weight pressing me into the mattress while the forgotten toy buzzed happily alongside my hip where he\u2019d dropped it. As I worked to catch my breath, I mused that I didn\u2019t have to wonder what he\u2019d been doing in my closet. The better question to ask would probably be how the hell he\u2019d known where my stash was?</p> <p>After a few moments, he rolled to his side after carefully disengaging from my sated body. He reached for the toy, smiling slyly at me as he thumbed it off and tossed it aside before gathering me in his arms and cuddling me against his chest. He drew lazy circles on my shoulder and down my side and hip while we laid there quietly, our breath mingling in the closeness of our lips.</p><p>He smiled tenderly and kissed me softly, sweetly. \u201cMmmm...\u201d he murmured between kisses.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I sighed happily.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he began, his tone getting softer, not quite worried, but definitely getting a little tense. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been using any protection.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know,\u201d I said, my voice very quiet. \u201cBut, like I told you before, I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d I looked away from his and whispered the real reason I\u2019d never worried about protection with him. The painful one. \u201cI-I can\u2019t have kids anyway.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned up on his elbow and gripped my chin gently in his fingers, turning my face back to his. Concern creased his brow as he asked, \u201cWhen...?\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the question, but he didn\u2019t need to. I knew what he was asking.</p><p>I nodded once more.</p><p>He blew out a breath and kissed me again, holding me tighter in his arms. After touching his lips almost absent-mindedly to my forehead, he said, firmly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sunshine. That bastard will never hurt you again.\u201d He dipped his head, his eyes searching my face. \u201cThere are always other options, baby. Don\u2019t ever think there aren\u2019t. If and when we decide to explore that path...\u201d</p><p>His words trailed off. All I could do was smile at him and lean in for another kiss as my eyes filled with tears. But they weren\u2019t sad tears. They were the happiest-I\u2019d-ever-been, how\u2019d-I-get-so-fucking-lucky kind of tears. And those are the best kind to have.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The plan put into motion by my friends and family shifted my life completely, turning it upside down over the next week or so. I couldn\u2019t complain about it, though. When Allie learned that everyone was on board with her selling the store, including her mom because she\u2019d been wanting to take an RV tour of the U.S. with George, Allie\u2019s dad, she moved quickly.</p> <p>The realtor found a buyer immediately; it was unreal at how everything played out, especially finding a buyer so quickly. Allie settled into her role as a housewife rather easily, content to ready the house for the baby that was due any time now and spoil Grady even more than he already was. Jackson was ten times happier, too, knowing that Allie wasn\u2019t overexerting herself, and he wasn\u2019t worrying so much anymore about something happening with her being alone at the store or any of the hundred thousand more scenarios that had been giving him nightmares since the night she told him she was pregnant.</p><p>He\u2019d kept it together pretty well, I must say, though. Did it stop me from teasing him about turning into a worrywart? Nope. Although, I would have to admit that I may have used other words. You know, like...hell with it, I called him a pansy. It earned me one of his death-glares and he threatened me with a mega-wedgie, but it was worth it.</p><p>Emma gladly turned over her duties down at Skin Deep to me, especially with her due date looming so close, so now, not only do I get to have Brandon in my bed every night, I get to spend my days with him, too. I worried about him getting sick of seeing me so much, but he assured me he wouldn\u2019t. Honestly, I think he was just excited to get to figure out ways to get me naked in the supply closet. Or in his office. And once on the floor behind the counter...but the shop had been closed at the time, thank God.</p><p>Luke just shakes his head in disgust when he catches Brandon kissing me at random times throughout the day, but then he just grins wryly when Brandon reminds him that it was he himself getting caught lip-locked all the time before I started working.</p><p>My mom was back from her trip and had flown directly out to Ohio instead of going home. She\u2019s staying at Jackson and Allie\u2019s house so she can be there when the baby comes. Emma and Luke already had a security system in place, as did Allie and Jacks. Needless to say, my house was wired up within an inch of it\u2019s life now, too. They even upgraded the system down at Skin Deep, just to be safe.</p><p>So, just like that, everyone did what they needed to to protect themselves and...well, mostly to protect me. Every day, I woke up and thanked God and anyone else who would listen for all of them. I may have saved myself by getting the hell away from Greg, but in all honesty, they were the ones who really saved me.</p><p>I still had nightmares, but they\u2019d been getting less frequent. I still jumped at shadows, which Brandon laughed off, but I could still see the worry in his eyes. I rarely went out by myself, just until we got confirmation that Greg was back behind bars for violating his probation and the no contact order. Emma had waltzed up into her old boss\u2019 office and Attorney Floyd Grimm had sent out a nice, biting little letter to the Department of Corrections and the Courts out in California, along with a copy of the letter I received from Greg. The police had been looking for him, putting out BOLO\u2019s and everything, but they\u2019d had no luck so far.</p><p>Other than that, everything was good...no, it was perfect. Okay, so perfect with a few hiccups. But I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world.</p> <p>Not even when I got the phone call. The one that said they\u2019d found a car registered to Greg in a little town on the outskirts of Cincinnati, abandoned on the side of a township road in the middle of nowhere. They\u2019d done a search of the area, including the woods and the one and only motel in the town, but they\u2019d found nothing.</p><p>With things being so tense until we heard something from the police, the group had banded together even more than usual. In fact, dinner was a nightly event, moving from house to house. Two nights ago we were at Luke and Emma\u2019s, last night was at Leah\u2019s...and I can\u2019t with good conscience tell you that that would be happening again anytime soon. Unless we order pizza or takeout from somewhere... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were supposed to be having spaghetti and garlic bread, which should be simple to cook. Or at least, I always thought so. But we didn\u2019t have spaghetti. We had pizza. Why, you ask? Because Leah can burn water. Not kidding. The cooking genes definitely skipped her.</p><p>Tonight had been my turn to cook; I had Brandon grill some steaks and then I topped them with Maytag bleu cheese crumbles (best bleu cheese in the world...so yummy!) and crumbled bacon. I paired them with my favorite Italian-ranch pasta salad for a simple but very filling and tasty meal. I even made my own appetizer of fried pickles with spicy ranch to dip them in. For obvious reasons, Allie and Emma both (but especially Emma) were over the moon about that.</p><p>I\u2019d have to say dinner was a resounding success...but anything probably would have been after Leah scorched a pot full of water, then managed to turn a pan of spaghetti noodles to glue. I won\u2019t even mentioned what happened to the sauce.</p><p>We were all lounging around the living room, laughing and joking with Leah, who was flying solo tonight because Ian had a meeting or something, about her cooking skills (or lack thereof, actually), and then about Allie and Emma\u2019s due dates. Allie was technically due in three days, and the little baby boy nestled inside seemed like he wasn\u2019t budging. He\u2019d turned head down and had dropped majorly, but that\u2019s it. She went to the doctor three days ago and they said they\u2019d give her until next week; if she didn\u2019t go naturally by then, they were going to induce her.</p> <p>Emma, on the other hand, is due next week but they don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to make it. She\u2019s already dilated to 2 and is effacing rather rapidly, as well. It\u2019s kind of a toss up at the moment to see which one is going to pop first. The guys have been taking bets, but that was curbed when my brother got caught with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar. He was doing everything he could think of that he\u2019d read about to try to bring on labor. Allie caught on when she got on her laptop and saw the Google search for \u2018ways to get a woman to give birth\u2019 and finally figured out that\u2019s why he\u2019d been trying to get her to take long walks with him every night. Just for that, Allie made him double his bet, then bet against him, and gave Luke every idea she could find to make Emma go first.</p><p>There was a break in the conversation as we all debated going out for ice cream and we all froze as Allie moaned. She was sitting on the couch, Jackson beside her. When she noticed we were all looking at her, her face flushed and she ducked her head.</p><p>We all wondered why...until Jackson jumped up and shot away from her like a rocket, yelling, \u201cFucking hell, woman! That\u2019s worse than both Grady AND Doug!\u201d</p><p>My mom scolded him for talking like that, but then, suddenly, her nose twitched and her face fell. One by one, the expressions around the room started changing, mostly looking horrified, disgusted, or a combination of both.</p><p>Brandon, realizing what had happened, darted away to stand by Jackson in the doorway to the kitchen. He got halfway there and his eyes widened, then his nose screwed up comically as he shouted, \u201cOh my God, Allie! You seriously just farted like that? What is wrong with you?\u201d</p> <p>Allie looked so ashamed, but at the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Emma was sitting in the armchair not too far away from her, just shaking her head. \u201cShe\u2019s always been like that. It\u2019s just worse now that she\u2019s pregnant. Trust me...I know.\u201d</p><p>Luke shot her a droll look, muttering, \u201cYeah, you think you know. She doesn\u2019t sleep with YOU every night.\u201d</p><p>It was Emma\u2019s turn to blush and we all laughed.</p><p>Then Allie moaned again, but this time, she followed it with a loud, gasping, \u201cOh!\u201d Her eyes blinked rapidly in surprise and she sought Jackson\u2019s gaze, her jaw dropping open before she looked at me. \u201cChloe, I\u2019m so sorry, but either my water just broke or I just peed on your couch.\u201d</p><p>We all sat there, stunned, for a moment before all hell broke loose. Jackson beelined for the couch and swooped Allie up into his arms, hollering at Luke to move his car and Brandon to grab his keys out of his pocket. That in itself was pretty comical to watch as Jackson didn\u2019t slow in his determined stride to the door. Brandon ran along beside him, his hand scrabbling on Jackson\u2019s hip until he could jam it down in his pocket. He gave a war whoop as he jerked his hand free, the keys clasped in his fingers like the ultimate prize.</p><p>Before he got out the door he paused, looking back at me. My mom, who was hot on his heels, didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d stopped and ran smack dab into his back, falling back with an \u2018oompf.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Mom,\u201d he said, before addressing me again. \u201cYou and Brandon head to the house, let Grady out for us, and grab her bag, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we got it,\u2019 I said. I moved to the bedroom to grab my shoes and my purse, grateful we\u2019d already cleaned everything up from dinner. Brandon was still outside but his wallet was sitting on the dresser, so I grabbed that as well.</p><p>I heard Leah pipe up as she headed out the door behind Jacks, Allie, and my mom, calling out to Allie and Jacks that she\u2019d make the necessary phone calls to Allie\u2019s parents, her grandparents, and everyone in Emma\u2019s family.</p><p>When I got back out into the living room, the house had been evacuated by everyone but Emma, who was trying to lever herself out of the chair. She gave me a pitiful look and I smiled at her in sympathy as I helped her up.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, the waiting room was packed with bodies and filled with laughter and happiness. We\u2019d been updated briefly by my mom, letting us know that Allie was really in labor and we were about to have a baby! Everyone had been speculating on names, because Allie and Jackson already had one picked out but they wouldn\u2019t tell anyone what it was.</p><p>Luke broke into the conversation on a sigh. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no stopping it. Jackson\u2019s going to be ridiculous about this...\u201d He glanced up at us all. \u201cYou do realize that he won the bet, right?\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled up from everyone and groans resounded as we tallied up his winnings. We laughed even harder when Nanny walked right up to Luke, snatched the money out of his hands, and stuffed it into her bra, claiming that she was just going to hold it for him.</p><p>Once Allie was pretty settled, we all got to take turns going back to see her. When it was my turn, she grabbed my hand and pulled me close.</p> <p>\u201cChloe, I feel really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked her, smoothing her wildly spiking hair back from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cBecause I leaked all over your couch...\u201d she cried, her eyes filling up with tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, Allie...don\u2019t you even worry about it!\u201d I told her, chuckling affectionately. Truth be told, I completely forgot about it, but that was definitely something I should probably get cleaned pretty soon. Like really soon.</p><p>I wiped her tears away and glanced at my brother, who was beaming with complete and total joy. But then his expression dropped as Allie cried out. He was by her side in an instant, checking her over, asking her, \u201cAre you in pain, is something wrong, do you need something, what can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>Allie looked at him in horror and then at her mom and my mom, who were both sitting across the room on the little sofa there. \u201cWe have to get married!\u201d</p><p>Jackson sat gingerly on the bed beside her and took her hand. \u201cAllie, sweetheart, it\u2019s a little late for that. You\u2019re in labor.\u201d His words were cautious and soft, and he looked like he was approaching a rabid bear as he spoke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t far off with that look.</p><p>She rounded on him, eyes wide and teeth gritted. \u201cBy God I will be married before this child comes out of my vagina, Jackson Beckett Matthews!\u201d</p><p>Holy shit!</p><p>Daisy, Allie\u2019s mom, gasped. \u201cAllison Anne McCormick, don\u2019t you yell at him like that! I don\u2019t care if you are giving birth, you will be nice to the father of your child or you\u2019ll answer to me. Now I may be an old hippie, but girlfriend, I brought you into this world and I WILL take you out!\u201d</p> <p>Jackson, my mom, and I all gaped at Allie\u2019s mom. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t there an unwritten rule that you keep the woman in labor happy and let her be a raging bitch? Apparently not according to Daisy...</p><p>But instead of getting pissed, Allie grinned at her mom, all traces of anger melting away like they\u2019d never even been there. \u201cEhhh, I guess giving birth to your child before you\u2019re married is overrated anyway, right Mom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Daisy just grinned back, her eyes sparkling with love and humor. Jackson just looked scared. I didn\u2019t blame him; Allie was switching emotions faster than a hooker drops her panties for a bill.</p><p>I spent a few more minutes in the room, watching my family with a sense of pride and satisfaction. Sure, there was an ache deep in my heart that I would never get to be the one in that bed, giving birth to my child. But I\u2019d come to terms with that, for the most part. It was seriously bittersweet, though, to imagine what my child would have been like...</p><p>A commotion at the door drew our attention.</p> <p>\u201cMA\u2019AM! You can\u2019t go in there! Especially not with that!\u201d a strident voice said sternly.</p><p>Nanny\u2019s crackly, gravelly voice cut her off, getting louder as she pushed through the door into the room. \u201cOh, piss off. This is my granddaughter\u2019s room and by God, I can go in if I want. And don\u2019t you pay no mind to my flask, you nosy rosy. It ain\u2019t for my girl. It\u2019s for that pasty-looking thing standing by her bed. Seems like he might be one \u2018a those that falls over when it gets down to the dirty stuff in here.\u201d</p><p>She cackled and Allie waved off the stout, gray-haired nurse trailing behind her grandma, shooting scandalized looks at Allie. \u201cShe\u2019s fine, I promise,\u201d Allie said.</p><p>The nurse gave a curt nod and said, primly, \u201cYou really should be resting, Ms. McCormick. You\u2019re doctor won\u2019t want all these people in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, nurse, but I can speak for myself, and Allie can have as many people in here as she wants, as long as she\u2019s comfortable.\u201d</p><p>An imposing woman with striking features stood behind the nurse, her trim figure covered in a white lab coat over bright, cheery scrubs. The nurse turned and stammered, \u201cDr. Merrick, I\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t know you were on the floor already. I was merely-\u201d</p> <p>The doctor nodded. \u201cI know, Clarice. You\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>The nurse scrambled out into the hall, cheeks flaming, but I\u2019m guessing it was more in anger than remorse or embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWell, Allie,\u201d the doctor said, smiling widely at her patient. \u201cLet\u2019s see where we\u2019re at, shall we?\u201d</p><p>I excused myself, patting Allie on her shoulder and smiling at everyone else, before heading out into the waiting room with everyone else. More time passed and people started leaving to go home. Jenna went first, but only because she got a phone call from home, something about a Barbie, a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, and the dishwasher. Then Ben, Emma\u2019s dad left, followed by Calland and Leah. Jan, Emma\u2019s mom, left around midnight, taking Nanny and Poppy with her, but not before making us promise to call them as soon as the baby was born, no matter what the time. Eventually, only my mom, Allie\u2019s parents, Daisy and George, Emma and Luke, and Brandon and I were left.</p><p>I curled up on a sofa in the waiting room beside Brandon, listening to Luke try to bribe Emma into going home so she could get some rest. She wasn\u2019t having it though. The last thing I heard was her emphatic, \u2018hell no!\u2019 and his long-suffering sigh before my eyes closed and I was out.</p><p>\u201cHey, Auntie Chloe.\u201d</p><p>My brother\u2019s voice broke into my dream and I blinked up at him from where I\u2019d been asleep with my head on Brandon\u2019s chest. My brow furrowed in confusion and then the light popped on.</p><p>Jackson grinned at me and I grinned back, jumping up and wrapping my arms around him. He hugged me tightly and I could hear the sob break free from him, buried in my hair. We held each other for a moment, crying together, but they were the happiest tears that could be cried.</p> <p>He pulled back and cradled my face in his hands, wiping away my tears. He then looked around and spread his arms at all of us. \u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d he hollered, his face jubilant.</p><p>Brandon and Luke both crashed into him and they all shared a hearty-back thumping hug before Emma made her way to him and he hugged her carefully, smiling down into her beaming face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful and perfect,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou guys can come meet him in just a few minutes because they\u2019re cleaning them up and everything, but Allie wanted me to come tell you. I\u2019m going back in, but I\u2019ll send someone out to get you guys in a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>He started to walk away but Emma stopped him. \u201cJackson...you\u2019re not gonna give us any details?\u201d she said incredulously.</p><p>He just smile and walked off.</p><p>I bit my cheeks, trying not to laugh at her expression. Poor Luke just shook his head and looked to the sky, probably asking for divine intervention.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, we were introduced to Liam Joel Matthews, born at 4:32 a.m., weighing seven pounds and eleven ounces, twenty-one inches long....</p><p>And he was perfect!</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did I agree to this?\u201d I moaned, shoving another snoring dog off my chest.</p><p>He grumbled and chuffed before the snoring commenced once more. Two other snores sounded from other parts of my bed and I wanted to cry. I was tangled up in the blankets, unable to move because they were weighted down by sleeping canines, each of which had slept on top of me at one point or another throughout the night.</p><p>I had Doug, DJ, and Grady at my house, watching them for a couple of days. I\u2019d offered this because Emma had gone into labor last night, and...I don\u2019t know why I had Grady, too. Glutton for punishment, I guess.</p><p>I\u2019d offered to keep the boys for Luke and Emma when they\u2019d called to say she was in labor because no way in hell could Allie do it, and Emma\u2019s going to have crazy amounts of family up at the hospital with her. Allie was upset that she couldn\u2019t be there, but she\u2019d just give birth to Liam barely five days ago. So last night when I went over to get Doug and DJ, Grady had been sitting with them on the front porch and looked so sad when I\u2019d put them in my car that I just took him, too.</p><p>I\u2019d stopped over at Allie and Jacks\u2019 house to grab his crate (and see the baby, of course), and really didn\u2019t even ask. I just took their dog.</p><p>Now here it was, almost three in the morning, and I couldn\u2019t sleep without getting smothered by labs.</p><p>Brandon was at the hospital and so, for the first time in a while now, I was alone. Or, alone as I could be with said smothering dogs.</p><p>My cell phone rang from the bedside table and I grappled for it, struggling against the covers and dogs surrounding me so I could answer it. \u201cHello?\u201d I said breathlessly, hoping I caught it before it stopped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChloe?\u201d Brandon said quietly, almost reverently.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answered, just as softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding my niece. She\u2019s so beautiful...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww...\u201d I sighed, my heart melting at the complete and utter devotion in his tone. \u201cHow is she, how\u2019s Emma? Everything good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cEmma\u2019s a champ.\u201d He paused and then continued conversationally, \u201cI saw her vagina. Walked in right as she started to push coming back from the cafeteria and, let\u2019s just say that\u2019s a side of my sister-in-law I never wanted to see. All red and angry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon! She was giving birth, cut her some slack!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cHuh? No, her face! Her face was all red and angry. Jesus, I didn\u2019t stare at her vagina...what kind of perv do you think I am?\u201d he asked indignantly.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSo, did they finally settle on a name?\u201d</p><p>I could hear the smile in his voice as he said, \u201cYep. Her name is Everly Jane Crimshaw.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJane?\u201d I asked, my heart melting even more.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They chose Jane because Jan is Emma\u2019s mom\u2019s name, and well, because they wanted to name her after you, too. She talked to Allie about it and they both agreed that it was fitting because you\u2019ve been such a great friend to them both. So, yeah. Everly Jane.\u201d</p><p>Emotion clogged my throat and tears stung my eyes as I was hit again by the fact that I was so damned lucky to have friends and family like them, people that opened their arms to me without hesitation. It felt great.</p><p>I cleared my throat, realizing Brandon was waiting silently, patiently on the phone for me. \u201cHow much did she weigh?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s a heavy weight. Weighed in at eight pounds, two ounces, bigger than Liam! They\u2019re about the same length, though.\u201d</p><p>A tiny little mew sounded then, and Brandon cooed to the baby nestled in his arms. \u201cShh...let\u2019s go see your momma, \u2018kay?\u201d Then to me, \u201cChloe, I\u2019m gonna take her back over to Emma and I need to hang up. I\u2019ll call you back in a little bit, okay? Are you okay there by yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Give Emma and your brother hugs from me and tell them congratulations. I can\u2019t wait to meet her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, sunshine. I\u2019ll call you later. Love you.\u201d</p><p>He hung up before I could say anything more.</p><p>I laid back in the bed and sighed, glancing at the dogs who were...well, they weren\u2019t sleeping anymore. They were all three sitting up, staring at me like they were waiting for me to tell them what Brandon said. So I did.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here, Doug, DJ...your furless sister is finally here.\u201d</p><p>I laughed when their tails wagged and then Grady jumped from the end of the bed smack onto my chest, knocking me down and licking my face exuberantly. I pushed him off and, realizing I probably wasn\u2019t going to get any sleep, asked if they wanted to go outside.</p><p>Immediately, three wiggling, bouncing bodies lurched off the bed and danced around me as I got up and headed to the back porch to let them out. I stepped out the back door with them, standing on the cement at the edge of the grass and watching them run around the yard like mad, marking everything they could.</p><p>The wind blew and, even though it was summer now, this early in the morning there was a chill in the air. I rubbed my arms briskly with my hands to help ward off the cold. I jumped, whirling to look at Doug when he let out a low, menacing growl, his hackles rising as he stared at the fence.</p> <p>It was dark and it was a six-foot privacy fence, so I couldn\u2019t really see anything; but that didn\u2019t matter. Fear skittered up my spine as DJ and Grady, even as young as they were, turned and crept toward Doug, their hackles raised and twin growls emanating from their throats as they joined him watching the fence. I took that as my cue, not waiting for anything else to happen. I could feel the wrongness sweeping through the air, my instincts screaming that someone was out there and the dogs had alerted me to their presence. Shivers raced down my body as I turned and fled into the house, calling the dogs sharply to me as I ran.</p><p>They followed immediately, the pups just a bit quicker than Doug, who gave one last, warning growl and a sharp bark before he came in. I locked the door to the screened-in porch, then double bolted the door to the inside of the house before resetting the alarm that I\u2019d disarmed to let the dogs out.</p><p>Back in the safety of the house, I made my way through every room, checking the doors and windows to make sure each and every one was secured. Doug followed closely at my heels, but the pups sat stoically on the couch, side by side, their heads tracking Doug and I as we came and went through the room.</p><p>Finished with that, I headed back into the living room and carefully hooked my finger into the blinds, moving one slat down just enough to peek outside. The street was empty, no movement anywhere. The dew on the grass glistened in the street lights, but beside that, there was nothing to see. Then, my breath caught as something moved in the darkness by the neighbor\u2019s garage. I let it loose on a shaky laugh as a cat trotted out of the shadows and meandered down the driveway and onto the sidewalk before disappearing into the night.</p><p>The dogs had all settled completely by this point, so I padded back to my bedroom and climbed into bed to try and get whatever little amount of sleep I could. This time I was grateful to have the three dogs cuddling close to me, no matter that I barely had any room on the mattress and couldn\u2019t move once more. Finally, I drifted off to sleep curled on my side, Doug lying against my back with his head on my pillow, Grady curled into my stomach with his head on my side, and DJ curled up behind my knees.</p><p>Sunlight filtered around the curtains when I cracked my eyes open, yawning and stretching as I tried to wake up. I sat up when I realized I could move freely in my bed, my eyes darting around the room, searching for the dogs. When I didn\u2019t see them, I rolled out of bed and strode from the room to figure out where they were.</p><p>I skidded to a halt in the living room when I noticed Brandon asleep on the couch on his back. He looked super uncomfortable, not only because he\u2019s too long for the couch, but because Doug was sprawled out on top of him. The other two dogs were sleeping on the other furniture; one on the armchair, and one on the loveseat. Their tails wagged lazily as I shook my head at them.</p><p>I let Brandon sleep, but to do that, I had to leave Doug where he was. I was afraid if I tried to get him down, his paws would hit some...vital areas, and for sure wake him up. I glanced at the clock on the microwave in the kitchen as I made myself a cup of coffee, surprised to see that it was almost noon. I was curious as to what time Brandon had gotten home, and why he hadn\u2019t come to bed.</p><p>A muffled curse broke the silence of the house as I stood looking out the kitchen window while I drank my coffee. I sat my cup down and moved into the living room, giggling when I saw Brandon trying to struggle out from under Doug\u2019s pretty significant weight. His struggles excited the pups, so they were jumping back and forth along the couch on the floor, and every time they got within licking range, their tongues darted out and swiped whatever part of Brandon they could get.</p><p>I finally called them off when Brandon gave me an evil look, laughing as the three of them pranced off into the kitchen, I\u2019m assuming to empty the bowls I\u2019d just filled for them.</p><p>\u201cSo nice of you to help me,\u201d Brandon said wryly as he sat up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stretched and I was distracted by the tanned expanse of gloriously hardened flesh showing where his shirt had ridden up. I could see his muscles working under there, tensing and flexing as he moved around.</p><p>His sleep-roughened voice reached my ears. \u201cThere you go staring again, baby. Need to get that camera out soon.\u201d</p><p>I flushed. \u201cSmart ass,\u201d I mumbled, looking away from his smirk.</p><p>He got up and moved away from the couch, stopping at my side to enfold me in his arms. He tipped my head up and kissed my lips briefly before he headed off down the hall, nonchalantly scratching his ass as he went.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes. Typical male.</p><p>He came back into the living room, holding out his phone. He waved it at me when I didn\u2019t take it right away. \u201cThought you might want to see a picture of Everly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh! I do!\u201d I snatched the phone from his hands and thumbed through the photos. \u201cShe\u2019s so freakin\u2019 adorable...\u201d I sighed, smiling at a beautiful picture of Luke sitting beside Emma, his arm around her as she held the baby. They made such a gorgeous, happy little family.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Jackson and he said that we can bring Grady back home and see Liam for a bit before we head to hospital to see Everly again. It blows my fucking mind that we have two babies in the family now. How does that even happen?\u201d</p><p>Brandon\u2019s face was bewildered. I knew what he meant, but I couldn\u2019t help but tease him. \u201cWell, you see, there\u2019s a daddy and a mommy; the daddy puts his penis in the mommy and his spermies come out and mix with the mommy\u2019s egg, so the baby is then planted in the mommy. It just so happened that TWO mommies and daddies got down in Sexy Town around the same time, and so the babies were born very close together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that how it happens?\u201d he said sarcastically when I was finished.</p><p>I nodded, definitely being a smart ass.</p><p>He lunged at me, catching me around the waist and flinging me over his shoulder. I squealed with laughter and shouted as he smacked my ass, as usual. \u201cSince you want to be such a smart ass this morning...\u201d His words cut off as he jiggled me on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? And just what are you gonna do to me, ya big, bad meanie?\u201d I goaded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it, sunshine,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou going to punish me?\u201d I asked, my tone lowering mischievously.</p> <p>He chuckled, palming my rounded ass cheek and squeezing it roughly before smacking it again. \u201cNot right now, I\u2019m not. But I won\u2019t forget you egging me on like this, woman. Just wait til tonight.\u201d</p><p>He carried me into the bedroom, set me on my feet, and gave me a gentle push toward the bathroom. \u201cShower, now!\u201d</p><p>I saluted him smartly and dashed into the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind me when his eyes narrowed and he took a menacing step in my direction.</p><p>A little while later, Grady was safely back with Allie and Jackson, I\u2019d had ample cuddle time with the cutest little nephew in the world, and we were on our way to the hospital with a huge pink teddy bear and a bouquet of flowers in tow.</p><p>I eyed the bear as we crammed into the elevator, shaking my head in exasperation at Brandon. \u201cYou could have left that at their house, you know.\u201d</p><p>He hugged it tighter to his side. \u201cNope. I wanted her to have it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon, that thing is huge! It\u2019s going to take up half of Emma\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, just shifted it so that the leg of the thing nearly knocked me backwards. I glared at him and he just shrugged, but I could see the sly smile playing about his lips.</p> <p>I walked into Emma\u2019s room to see her sitting up in the bed, nursing the baby. Luke was passed out on the sofa along the window, snoring lightly.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she said brightly. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came...I felt so bad last night that you weren\u2019t here with everyone, but I really appreciate you taking care of the dogs for us.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hugged her, careful not to jostle the baby sucking greedily at her breast. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not a big deal and I\u2019m here now, so...God, Emma, she\u2019s so gorgeous!\u201d I breathed, running a finger lightly down her soft little cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Emma beamed with pride, and then her eyes blinked owlishly as she took in the ginormous bear Brandon was holding. \u201cWhere the hell are you gonna put that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Everly, so hush,\u201d he replied affectionately, walking over and kissing Emma\u2019s forehead and then the top of the baby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cGet your lips away from my woman, perv,\u201d a groggy voice called from the other side of the room.</p><p>Brandon, checking to make sure he wouldn\u2019t hit anything or anyone else in the process, chucked the huge bear at his brother, who\u2019d just sat up and was rubbing his eyes. Emma rolled her eyes and we shook our heads.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d she said, \u201cThey never grow up.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and laughed when Luke glared at Brandon and then got up and punched him in the shoulder. I guess some things never change, even when you\u2019re grown.</p><p>Emma shifted in the bed, pulling the now sleeping baby away from her chest and pulling her gown back up over her shoulder. She swaddled the infant tighter and held her out to me, asking silently if I wanted to hold her.</p><p>I grinned, excited to hold the little bundle. I took her gently and cradled her in my arms as I walked to the rocking chair in the corner. I rocked and cooed to her as she slept peacefully in my arms.</p><p>\u201cSo how happy are Jan and Ben, Emma?\u201d I asked as I stared down at the baby, watching her with the same awe I knew I did when I held Liam, too.</p><p>Emma groaned a little, but then laughed. \u201cThey are driving me nuts already, saying they get dibs on first overnight stay and they\u2019re planning it for six weeks from now. Daisy gave them the idea when Allie had Liam; said that if they keep the baby that night, it\u2019ll be okay for Allie and Jacks to get busy and give them another grandchild. Mom and Daisy both are caught up in baby fever...\u201d she cocked her head and eyed Brandon with a smirk. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re home free, either, buddy. Chloe\u2019s mom was right there with them and she\u2019s got two of them to work on!\u201d</p><p>She cackled with glee and I could see Brandon\u2019s throat work as he swallowed hard before looking at me, worry clouding his gaze. My heart sank but I shook my head slightly at him, telling him it wasn\u2019t the time, just to let it go. No one but he and I knew what the result of the damage was. Not even my mom.</p><p>Brandon walked over to me and took the baby from my arms. My stomach clenched at the sight of him holding the tiny little girl in his hands, but I pushed it away. I glanced sideways and noticed Luke looking at me.</p><p>The shrewdness in his eyes was not lost on me; in that moment, I knew that he\u2019d put two and two together. The corner of my mouth tipped up in a wry smile, which he returned, nodding his head slightly to let me know he understood. He\u2019s a good guy like that.</p><p>\u201cSo, Brandon told me he saw your vagina.\u201d</p><p>I clapped a hand over my mouth as my face flushed. I closed my eyes, mortified that that was what had come out of my mouth to break the silence around me. Open mouth-insert foot. Geez Louise.</p><p>All three of them burst out laughing, Brandon\u2019s guffaw so loud it startled the baby still sleeping in his arms. She let out a wail that sounded like a little wildcat and Brandon looked at her, shame at scaring her marring his features. Luke just laughed again and took his daughter from Brandon, cradling her close to his chest and kissing her perfect little bow-shaped lips and her rosy little cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stayed and visited with the happy little family a while longer before Brandon said he wanted to go check in at the shop with T.J. to see how things were going. T.J. had been a lifesaver the past week, taking over the shop and running it almost as if Luke and Brandon had been there the whole time.</p><p>Both Brandon and Luke had commented on how impressed they were by their strong, silent new friend. In a short amount of time, they\u2019d come to trust him implicitly, and he\u2019d become one of us, part of the group. In the back of my mind, though, the thought still floats around that he\u2019s got a story, that one, and I\u2019d love to figure it out.</p><p>We left the hospital and Brandon dropped me off at my brother\u2019s house to spend some time with them while he checked in on the shop. I let myself in with the key they\u2019d given me a while back, hurrying to the alarm pad to key in the code so the alarm wouldn\u2019t go off. The house was strangely silent.</p><p>I walked into the living room and bit my lip to keep from laughing at the sight. Grady was lying on the floor beside the bassinet where the baby was sleeping, his tail thumping softly on the rug, but he didn\u2019t get up to greet me. My mom was curled up in the chair beside the bassinet, reading a book on her Kindle and shushing me quietly with a finger to her lips. Jackson and Allie were on opposite ends of the couch, each sprawled out and sleeping like the dead, mouths open, snoring...it wasn\u2019t pretty.</p> <p>My mom sat her kindle down and motioned me into the kitchen with her, so we could talk quietly. We chatted for a while, mostly about the babies, until my phone chimed in my pocket. It was Brandon, letting me know he was getting ready to leave the shop to come get me. I texted him back to let him know that everyone was sleeping and agreed to meet him outside.</p><p>Half an hour later, I was standing in my kitchen, trying to make sense of the chaos...</p><p>Brandon was no help whatsoever. He was standing there laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>My eyes shot daggers as I glared in his direction, my palm itching to smack the grin off his face. I don\u2019t think I would have been so upset, but this was my coffee we were talking about, here...my COFFEE!</p><p>Every single K-Cup I owned, that I pop into my Keurig every morning to make sure I have the necessary caffeine in my veins, was strewn across the kitchen floor. And every single one of them had puncture holes in the tops and sides. Little puncture holes that matched up perfectly to the pearly white canine teeth currently staring at me from the mouth of the blonde puppy sitting across the room, smirking at me. Of course, those pearly whites were suspiciously decorated with tiny black dots, which were identical to the coffee grounds peppering my floor from where they\u2019d been shaken free.</p> <p>Doug was nowhere to be found, I\u2019m assuming to make sure the blame was placed directly on the coffee murderer in front of me. Nothing else was disturbed, not the soap, not my shoes, not anything else.</p><p>Just my coffee.</p><p>Oy.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>I paused in my efforts to rid my flower beds of weeds, wiping my forehead with the hem of my tank as I looked around. Brandon was mowing the grass, shirtless, so of course I took a moment longer to stare at the smorgasboard of hotness before my eyes. God, he was so hot...and holy mother of toe-curling orgasms, the man had the stamina of a horse. The things he could do with those hands and that mouth...</p><p>He caught my eye and shook his head, smiling at me knowingly, as he turned to make another swipe through the grass. He disappeared beside the garage and I shook my head at my thoughts, smiling as I started pulling weeds again.</p> <p>It\u2019d been a month since the babies were born and since everything had settled back to normal. Or at least to the new normal, anyway.</p><p>We\u2019d gotten word from the police that they had a lead on Greg out in Texas. Not sure what he would be doing there, but good riddance. Mom had finally flown home, but she\u2019d decided that she didn\u2019t want to be there when her kids and new grandbaby are here, so she planned to sell the house in California and find something here in Phillus.</p><p>She still gets a kick out of the welcome sign every time she sees that it\u2019s been painted over again. Now the kids are getting creative; instead of just changing it to Phallus, they\u2019ve started using phrases, the latest being, \u2018Phillus Up.\u2019</p><p>Brandon keeps swearing that he\u2019s going to come up with something good to change it to and go do it himself. I just tell him that if he gets arrested and has to spend the night in jail, I\u2019m not bailing his ass out.</p><p>I shifted, leaning forward on my knees to reach a weed that was closer to the bush under the living room window. A glint caught my eye and I moved closer to see what it was. As soon as the object came into focus, I jerked back on a gasp, stumbled to my feet, and looked around fearfully, my heart pounding out of my chest.</p><p>Brandon came back around the side of the house on the mower and, when he caught sight of me, he turned it off and was at my side in an instant. \u201cChloe, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re white as a ghost, baby, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been here,\u201d I whispered, my eyes still darting around, scanning the houses around us.</p><p>Brandon grabbed me by the shoulders, shaking me gently until my eyes met his. \u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s been here?\u201d</p> <p>I pointed to the bush. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it! We have to call the cops...he\u2019s been here. He\u2019s been watching and he left me something to let me know it. The ring he gave me when he proposed...it\u2019s hanging on the branch there.\u201d</p><p>Brandon moved closer to see and swore when he saw the diamond winking in the sunlight. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said brusquely, pulling me with him into the house. He strode directly to the counter where he\u2019d left his phone and grabbed it, wasting no time in dealing with the police. No, he went straight to a detective and called Noah, Emma\u2019s brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cNoah...not good at the moment, man. Listen, I need you to come over here. That fucking bastard has been lurking around the house.\u201d He listened for a minute, grunting and nodding in assent, I\u2019m assuming, to whatever Noah was saying. \u201cYup. Later.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his phone in his pockets and turned to me. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way out here. I\u2019m gonna go put the mower away and clean up the weeds you tossed, but you sit tight.\u201d He kissed my lips briefly and went outside, leaving me standing alone in the kitchen.</p><p>I leaned against the counter and put a hand to my head, realizing belatedly that it was shaking. I took a deep breath and let it out, giving myself a pep talk. \u2018Nothing is going to happen, Chloe. Brandon and everybody, they\u2019re all here for you and YOU aren\u2019t that girl anymore. So calm the fuck down.\u2019</p><p>I heard the door slam again and Brandon was back in front of me, pulling me into his arms so that my cheek was pressed to his bare, sweaty chest. I really wouldn\u2019t have minded it, in fact, it felt pretty welcome to me, but he had bits of grass stuck all over him and those didn\u2019t feel very nice sticking to my face.</p><p>I pushed away a little to look up at him and he chuckled, brushing the grass off my face. \u201cSorry. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>I smiled faintly and shrugged it off. I opened my mouth to say something but didn\u2019t get a chance as someone pounded on the door. Brandon went to the door, checking to make sure it was Noah before he opened it.</p><p>He clapped Noah on the shoulder as he came inside. \u201cThanks for coming so quick, man. You must have run every light from the precinct to here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah chuckled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad. I don\u2019t get to run full out much, so I got to blow my car out a little on the way.\u201d He flashed a smile at me as he said it. \u201cYou alright, Chloe?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m good. Just a little shook up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me what you found, alright?\u201d</p><p>I took him outside, Brandon hovering at my back the whole time. He took pictures of the ring where it hung, the surrounding area, and then used tweezers to pull the ring from the branch and put it in a bag.</p> <p>\u201cYou and I both know that this is going to come back with his prints on it, especially since you can ID the ring as something you wore once. I\u2019ll do what I can, standard procedure and all, but there\u2019s not much we can do with this unless we knew where he was. We\u2019ve already been looking for him and you\u2019ve got the CPO against him, which he\u2019s already broken.\u201d Noah looked apologetic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Noah. I know that and completely understand. I just wish that he\u2019d be found so I don\u2019t have to keep looking over my shoulder. I don\u2019t know why I started feeling secure...I guess it was when they said they\u2019d had reports of him in Texas.\u201d I shrugged again, feeling helpless about the whole situation.</p><p>\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve been out here in a while?\u201d Noah asked me.</p><p>\u201cSince last weekend when we mowed and weed-eated. I didn\u2019t get out here to pull weeds, though, so I couldn\u2019t tell you when he put that there.\u201d I paused, a thought crystalizing in my mind. \u201cYou know, that night that Emma went to the hospital when she was in labor with Everly, something happened that night. I mean, not really something, but definitely something. I took the dogs outside after Brandon called to tell me the baby was here. It was maybe, I don\u2019t know, two or three a.m.? I could look on my phone and tell you exactly if I needed to. Anyway, Doug and the pups were here and Doug started acting weird, put his head down and growled at the fence, all the hair on his back up on end. The pups did it, too.\u201d</p><p>That got Brandon\u2019s attention. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just mentioning this now?\u201d he asked me incredulously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it kind of slipped my mind with all the babies and everything.\u201d I turned back to Noah. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. It was dark and the fence is six feet high, but...I don\u2019t know. I had shivers go down my spine when the dogs growled because they acted like they knew something was wrong. It felt like something was wrong. I went in and locked everything down, set the alarm again, and checked the windows to see if I saw anything or anyone, but there was nothing.\u201d</p><p>Noah jerked his chin towards the backyard. \u201cShow me where the dogs were going crazy.\u201d</p><p>I took him through the house and the screened in patio, showing him where I was standing and then where the dogs had been when they\u2019d gone off. He checked around a bit and then asked to go around the back of the fence. Brandon took him back there, but he asked me to stay where the dogs were so he could line it up from the other side of the fence.</p><p>I heard their muffled footsteps on the backside of the fence and then the silence was broken by Brandon.</p><p>\u201cMother fucker!\u201d</p><p>I heard Noah\u2019s voice but I couldn\u2019t make out his words. Then I heard Brandon again.</p> <p>\u201cChloe, come out here, please.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard as a frisson of fear sent chills over my skin, even in the summer heat. I unlocked the gate at the side of the house and rounded the fence to the back. The house butted up to a creek about fifty feet back, and then there were a bunch of trees. The neighbors\u2019 yards on either side of the house weren\u2019t fenced in, so there was easy access to the back of my property behind the fence.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I asked them, trying to keep calm. My voice only shook a little, which I prided myself on.</p><p>\u201cHe was out here, baby,\u201d Brandon said. His words came out on a growl and I could see that he was trying to keep his anger in check.</p><p>I looked at Noah for confirmation, not that I really needed it. \u201cHe was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was, or someone was, at least. The grass back here is all trampled. You didn\u2019t notice when you mowed the last couple of times?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Brandon answered. \u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t have because I mowed and I didn\u2019t even pay attention. I generally mow first and then weed-eat, and that close to the fence I\u2019m usually more worried about not running into it rather than anything else. Damnit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, man. You didn\u2019t know. But it looks like the grass is freshly crushed, like he\u2019s been here recently. And that\u2019s not all.\u201d He knelt and pulled up a small square of paper that was half buried in the grass.</p> <p>He glanced at me with a worried look, waiting for me to nod at him before he continued. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of waiting. Let the games begin. I spy with my little eye...something red.\u201d He looked up at me, eyebrows raised in question. \u201cDoes that make any sense to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I don\u2019t know what he means, unless...I don\u2019t know. Maybe I was wearing a red shirt that night I was standing out here? Or since then, maybe?\u201d I threw my hands up in frustration. \u201cI just want this to be over! Why the hell did they let him out on probation anyway?\u201d</p><p>Brandon grabbed me and hugged me to his chest, murmuring soothingly to me. Noah reached out and patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, Chloe. Somehow.\u201d Noah sounded sure, but I could hear the worry behind it. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take this with me and write it all up. I\u2019m also gonna have patrols stepped up around this area, especially around your house. If I can swing it, too, I\u2019m gonna get tech out here to install some hidden cameras behind the fence to see if we can catch him back here, or at least to see where he\u2019s coming from. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Brandon and I both nodded.</p><p>We made our way around front and said our goodbyes, Noah promising to get back with us and let us know something as soon as he could.</p><p>We weren\u2019t sure what he could let us know about, other than whether or not they were going to do the cameras. He pulled away and left us standing in the driveway. Brandon grabbed my arm and pulled me into the house, locking the door and setting the alarm behind us.</p><p>I slouched into the armchair and pulled my legs up, hugging my knees to my chest as I watched Brandon pace back and forth in front of me. He kept rubbing the back of his head with his hand over and over again which, if I didn\u2019t already know that was his tell, would have let me know he was extremely agitated.</p><p>He stopped suddenly, his gaze zeroing in on me and I could see the wheels turning in his mind. He confirmed it when he said, \u201cWhat if we go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked him, confused.</p><p>\u201cYou and I could just go away for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>He said it decisively, nodding his head like it was a done deal. I shook my head \u2018no\u2019 at him. He quirked a brow at me and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean no because I\u2019m not running from him. I want him caught. He\u2019s here, he\u2019s going to come back around, obviously, because he\u2019s trying to rattle me. He wants to catch me off guard so he can get me back, even though it\u2019s never going to happen. But that means, if I\u2019m here, he\u2019s accessible. I\u2019m not here, he\u2019s not here. No one knows where he\u2019d be. Get me?\u201d I asked it gently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded, though he didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cI get it. Fuck, Chloe, I just feel like I\u2019m doing a shit job protecting you. Christ, he was here at the house, all over the fucking yard and I had no fucking clue!\u201d He was pacing again, opening and closing his fists.</p><p>I beckoned him to me, moving my legs out of the chair to make room as he dropped to his knees in front of me. I wrapped them around his waist lightly as he leaned his head into my stomach, one of my hands moving to cradle the back of his neck, the other smoothing over the wide expanse of his shoulders. I felt his arms shift and, suddenly, they were sliding around me, holding me tight.</p><p>I held him like that for a while, each of us lost in our own thoughts. Finally, he moved and leaned up for a kiss, then gained his feet, holding a hand out to pull me up, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early on a Saturday and, since you won\u2019t run off with me,\u201d he paused, giving me a playful grin, \u201clet\u2019s go do something fun. No point in just sitting here wondering if he\u2019s out there. Noah has our numbers, so if they need us, they\u2019ll get us. Whaddya say?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, grinning back at him, wondering for the millionth time how I got so lucky.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cBrandon...this is not what I meant when I agreed to go have fun with you,\u201d I said nervously, shuffling my feet and trying my hardest not to look over the edge of the platform I was standing on.</p><p>Calland, who I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019m speaking to at the moment, spoke up behind me. \u201cCome on, Chloe. Live a little! It\u2019ll be fine, I promise!\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at him and my heart seized as I saw just how close he was to the edge, peering over almost carelessly.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were afraid of heights, sunshine.\u201d Brandon\u2019s voice rasped in my ear, his lips brushing the outer shell and making me shiver even through my fear.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of heights, per se...it\u2019s more like I\u2019m not fond of jumping off a platform high in the air and dangling from a wire as I speed over treetops that would be more than happy to break every bone in my body if I fell.\u201d</p><p>I heard a snigger behind me and peeked through my lashes to see the guide shaking his head as he tried to cover his laughter with his hand. I opened my eyes to glare at him, huffing when he finally gave up all pretense and grinned at me unabashedly.</p><p>\u201cMan, Luke, Jacks, and Allie are gonna be pissed that we did this without them,\u201d Calland hooted, rubbing his hands together gleefully while the guide motioned for him to step into the harness he was holding.</p><p>\u201cNot Emma?\u201d I asked, curious about the answer, though really I was only asking to take my mind off of what was about to happen.</p><p>It was kind of a blur, the whole trip here, because I was too busy trying to come up with a way to change his mind. We hadn\u2019t figured out what we were doing yet when we stopped at the gas station to get gas in Brandon\u2019s truck, and \u2018lo and behold, there was Calland, walking out with a huge fountain pop and three hot dogs stacked on top of each other in his hands.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d He\u2019d hollered, walking over to us. \u201cWhat are you guys up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to figure something fun out. What about you? Other than stuffing your face with hot dogs...\u201d</p><p>Calland sat his pop down on the bumper of Brandon\u2019s truck, grabbed the top dog, and took a huge bite. Thankfully, he chewed and swallowed before he answered. \u201cMy buddies were talking about this zip lining thing down in Hocking Hills that they did. I was thinking about heading down that way, meeting up with them. You guys wanna check that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZip lining?\u201d Brandon repeated. \u201cHuh.\u201d He looked at me speculatively.</p><p>I shook my head, already knowing what was coming.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they have that SuperZip thing now? The one that you actually are in a sling thing and fly like you\u2019re Superman or something?\u201d Brandon asked Calland.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, they do! I wanted to try that but I also wanted to do their twilight tour or even the night flight thing. You actually go zip lining in the dark.\u201d</p><p>I was still shaking my head, but, apparently, my vote didn\u2019t count. And that\u2019s how I came to be standing on a platform, being strapped into a helmet and a harness. I tried and tried to resist, to tell them that I\u2019d just wait at the truck until they got done, but...it didn\u2019t get me anywhere.</p> <p>Okay, so it did...just not where I wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cAlright, man. You\u2019re ready,\u201d the guide said, motioning Calland to step up to the line. He clipped his harness onto the safety line and showed him the hand brake again, giving him last minute instructions.</p><p>Calland grinned at each of us and then was off with a whoop, soaring down the line over the trees.</p><p>I looked over at Brandon who was grinning like a kid in a candy store as he watched Calland. Once Calland had landed safely on the platform at the end of the line, the guide turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I croaked. \u201cNo, Brandon can go first.\u201d</p><p>The guide shook his head, smiling. \u201cNope, we\u2019re sending you first. Remember the class we had before we even came up here?\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly, my stomach clenching as anxiety washed over me.</p><p>\u201cWell, just keep that in mind. You\u2019ve got this, and I promise, you\u2019re going to have a blast.\u201d</p><p>I gulped, watching and listening intently as he gave me the run down and then...it was time. I took a deep breath and stepped off, not wanting to disappoint Brandon by backing out. I knew, even though he pushed me to do this, got me up here, that he wouldn\u2019t force me to do it if I absolutely didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>My stomach dropped as I took off and then--then exhilaration took over as the wind ruffled my hair and I looked around at the scenery stretched out before me, the trees under me...it was amazing!</p><p>When the tour was finally done and we were all safely back on the ground, we headed home. We dropped Calland off at his apartment, where we\u2019d met him before we left, grabbed some dinner at a late night fast food place, and cuddled up on the couch to watch a movie while we ate.</p><p>I yawned halfway through the movie and Brandon pulled my head down on his chest, running his fingers through my hair, smoothing the silky strands down my back. He shifted us so that I was lying on top of him while he stretched out on the couch. He kept playing with my hair and caressing my skin with light, soothing touches.</p><p>I realized that he wasn\u2019t watching the movie at all; instead, his eyes were on me, roving my face like he was memorizing every inch of it. I propped my chin up on his chest and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cTake a picture...it lasts longer. Or so I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin grew on his lips. \u201cTurning my words around on me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded as he reached up and pushed a tendril of hair back that had fallen across my forehead before drawing his finger gently down my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy fucking ride, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, still brushing his fingers down my cheek. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that the blonde hair brat that followed us around would one day be lying in my arms like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is kinda crazy, isn\u2019t it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. We both knew it was. \u201cDo you regret anything?\u201d I asked him, hesitantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His brows drew together. \u201cNo, sunshine. I don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I really don\u2019t. I probably should...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this, Chloe. It\u2019s okay for us to be happy. And we are happy. Right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded this time, giving him a half-smile that he returned as he ran his thumb over my lips before he leaned up and brushed his lips over mine.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready for bed?\u201d he asked me when he pulled back, winking.</p><p>I rolled off him and stood, tapping my foot pseudo-impatiently. He chuckled and got to his feet, swatting my ass as he walked by me towards the bedroom, turning off lights as he went.</p><p>I ran after him, jumping up on his back and wrapping my arms and legs around him. He caught me effortlessly, carrying me into the room before turning and tossing me backwards on the bed. I scrambled up to lean against the headboard, wagging my finger at him when he put a knee on the bed.</p><p>He stopped, giving me a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d</p> <p>One dark eyebrow rose, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He moved back and turned to my iPod where it was sitting on the shelf. He grabbed it up and docked it, thumbing through my playlists until he found something he liked and hit play. Immediately the strains of Bump &amp; Grind by R. Kelly filled the air.</p><p>I grinned as he spun around to face me again, thrusting his hips forward suggestively and swaying from side to side with the beat of the music. I expected him to balk, or to turn it into a joke, but holy sex-on-a-stick, the man had moves and he wasn\u2019t playing.</p><p>He moved his hands up and grabbed the bottom of his t-shirt, sliding it up his delicious abs, pulling it up over his head and tossing it at me on the bed. He ran his hands down over his chest and stomach, reaching for the snap of his jeans, the ridge of him clearly visible as it stretched the unforgiving denim.</p><p>The button popped free and he lowered the zipper slowly while he arched and rolled his hips, dipping and thrusting, making all of those lovely muscles of his dance under his golden skin, the swirls and angles of his tattoos creating a mesmerizing tableau in front of me. With his zipper finally opened, he reached in and carefully adjusted himself. Lust hit deep, curling in my belly at the sight of the long, thick, rock hard shaft framed in the vee of denim.</p><p>\u201cNo underwear? You bad, bad boy...\u201d I purred, not taking my eyes off of him.</p><p>He hooked his thumbs in his waistband and began to really move as he slid his jeans down sinfully slow, baring inch after inch of his delectable skin. He kicked his jeans off, leaving his whole body bare to my gaze. Heady tendrils of desire prickled over my skin at the hungry, predatory look in his eyes.</p> <p>I crooked my finger at him, urging him closer. He came toward me, still moving to the beat of the music. He put a knee up on the bed and arched a brow at me again. I beckoned him once more, but he only moved a tiny bit further onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Brandon!\u201d I cried. \u201cGet your ass over here!\u201d</p><p>He grinned and moved fully onto the bed, stretching out beside me without touching. I reached my hand out to skim it over his chest but stopped when he shifted away.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah,\u201d he said, teasingly. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him. He blinked back. I shook my head no, telling him wordlessly that I wasn\u2019t giving him a strip tease. He nodded yes and a smile bloomed on his succulent lips. I smiled back and shook my head no again, which only made him shrug and tuck his hands behind his head, crossing his legs at the ankle.</p><p>I scowled at him. If my blood wasn\u2019t already heated by his strip tease, I may have been able to withstand the sight of his body laid out before me; might have let the impasse go on. But I couldn\u2019t. My fingers itched to explore every inch of his velvet-covered hardness, my lips yearned to kiss all the hot spots I knew he possessed. More than that, my core was flooded with desire, aching with an emptiness that was begging to be filled.</p><p>Still scowling, I slumped off the edge of the bed with a sigh, turning my back to Brandon. Just then, the music changed and Gimme That Nutt by Easy E started blaring. I stopped and look back over my shoulder at Brandon, giving him a wry grin. He was laughing, his shoulders shaking with mirth, and then started singing along with the raunchy words.</p><p>I felt my cheeks flush, more from embarrassment that now he knew I had that song (and many other older, not-fit-for-young-ears-songs) on my iPod than anything, and hurried over to change it. When Ride by SoMo started, I turned back to see him still lying prone on the mattress, grin still locked firmly in place. Figuring the time to play was over, I tossed my clothes off in a hurry and climbed back onto the bed beside him.</p> <p>\u201cHey, no fair!\u201d he cried, starting to sit up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t dance for me.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him back down and leaned over him, aiming my lips for his. Just before they met in a searing kiss, I muttered, \u201cGet over it.\u201d</p><p>He did. My questing kiss turned fevered and dark. Our teeth, lips, and tongues clashed, pressing, biting, licking at each other\u2019s mouths, both of us moaning at the sensations. Deepening the kiss even more, I moved, covering his body with mine, drawing a ragged cry from my lips when my skin met his.</p><p>I straddled his hips, my chest pressed to his, my wet heat sliding against the perfect length of him, coating his hardness with the evidence of my desire. His hands came up, one wrapping itself in my hair and giving a sharp tug, baring my throat to his teeth, the other sliding down to clutch at my hip, holding me still as he thrust against me.</p><p>Unable to bear the ache in my loins any longer, I slid forward, arched up, and impaled myself on his jutting length. A hiss sounded from his lips, then he groaned, his hand abandoning my hair to use both to clench on my hips almost bruisingly, as I started riding him wildly, the fast, pounding rhythm leaving us both breathless.</p><p>I sat up, taking him that much deeper inside, and arched my back, my hands finding purchase on his thighs behind me. I rested my weight on my knees and braced myself on my hands, using my hips to pump up and down on his shaft, swiveling my hips as I did.</p><p>\u201cJesus, that\u2019s good,\u201d Brandon panted, arching his hips up to meet my downward thrusts.</p><p>One of his hands left my hip, sliding over to splay on my lower stomach, his thumb finding my clit unerringly. He pressed hard on the nub and, like he\u2019d pushed a detonator button, I went off, coming hard around him. I could feel my inner muscles contracting, pulsing around the swollen, heavy length pressing against every silken inch of my core, milking him uncontrollably as I bucked and screamed out my explosive release.</p><p>\u201cYeah baby, that\u2019s it...come on me, sunshine,\u201d he growled, rubbing my clit in shallow circles, faster and faster. The sensations built, layer upon layer, so quickly I couldn\u2019t catch my breath before I went over the edge again. This time, though, his fingers left my sensitive nub and gripped my hip once more. He rode out the spasms of my body, thrusting up into my body with barely controlled, almost violent thrusts. Each heavy slap of his skin against mine, the soft sucking noises of his body slipping in and out of mine, all worked together to create a sweet cacophony of pure, white hot pleasure that blended perfectly with the rough grunts torn from Brandon\u2019s throat as he pounded into me.</p><p>Finally, with one last, forceful thrust upward, he buried himself deep, pulling me roughly down onto him so that I was fully and completely impaled as he groaned out his release. The hardness of him swelled impossibly larger as he spurted deep inside me, each forceful jet of his seed flooding me with warmth. I ground against him, wringing every last drop from him and riding out the last lingering vestiges of my own orgasm, my body shuddering on top of his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Body spent, I collapsed on top of him and his arms came up to enfold me. He smoothed his hands down my back soothingly as we fought to catch our breath, and as we laid there, melded together, he whispered softly in my ear, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re my everything, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>The bell chimed above the door at the shop and I hollered out, \u201cHey! Welcome to Skin Deep, I\u2019ll be right with you!\u201d I laid the box of supplies I was unloading on the table in the supply room and hurried out to help the customer who\u2019d come in.</p><p>Brandon was in the back with a client, working on a back piece. This was the fourth and final session but it was absolutely breath-taking and the client had been raving about how much he loved it, even though it wasn\u2019t finished. It took up his entire back and was very detailed, but very simplistic at the same time.</p> <p>Luke had gone home early to take Emma and Everly to the baby\u2019s doctor appointment. She was due to have shots today and, after Allie\u2019s unintelligible phone call to Emma after Liam\u2019s appointment last week, Luke wasn\u2019t letting Emma take her on her own. He said that Allie had been crying so hard about the fact that Liam had screamed when he got his shots, and that Jackson had to practically carry both the baby and Allie out of the office because she was crying so hard right along with him. I\u2019m assuming he gathered that much from Jackson on a separate call.</p><p>It\u2019d been three weeks since the \u201cincident\u201d as we referred to it. We\u2019d still not heard anything from Noah, other than the fact that everything did point right to Greg, because there\u2019d been nothing else to report. But that didn\u2019t mean that we weren\u2019t still very careful...or that I felt like I didn\u2019t have to look over my shoulder every five seconds if I was alone for just one minute.</p><p>The nightmare I had last night still lingered in my mind if I stopped to think for just a moment, so I\u2019d been trying to stay busy all day. Brandon had helped, giving me tasks that he and Luke usually did just to keep me occupied. Not to mention the way he\u2019d taken my mind off of it last night...</p><p>I walked around the corner and stopped behind the counter, the smile dropping from my face immediately as my nightmare came to life.</p><p>Standing before me, nonchalantly, like he had not a care in the world, was Greg. He leaned on the counter and smiled at me. It wasn\u2019t the menacing smile that haunted me; this was his All-American Boy smile that reeled me in to begin with.</p> <p>\u201cHey, sweetie! How\u2019ve you been?\u201d he said, brightly.</p><p>My vocal chords were frozen, and so was my body. I could only blink rapidly as I stared at him, terror rippling over every inch of me.</p><p>The smile turned down and, not quite frowning but close, he asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you glad to see me? I\u2019ve missed you so much, you know.\u201d</p><p>The silence was deafening as I stared at him. It was only broken by the very faint buzzing of Brandon\u2019s machine back in his studio. I was hoping that Greg would hear it and realize that I wasn\u2019t alone. Maybe he would leave...</p><p>He shifted, leaning forward on the counter. \u201cYou ready to come home now?\u201d</p><p>Pulse pounding, I finally found my voice. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not very friendly of you, Chloe. I thought after all this time you\u2019d be happy to see me, to get back to the way things were. I forgive you, you know. For throwing me in jail like I\u2019d really done something wrong.\u201d</p><p>A harsh laugh escaped my throat. \u201cYou practically cut my child from my body, Greg. You DID do something wrong! I don\u2019t know how you got out, but you need to leave now.\u201d Calling up false bravado, I straightened to my full (though not really threatening) height. \u201cThe cops are on their way.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNice try, sunshine,\u201d he said mockingly.</p><p>I gasped at the usage of my nickname from Brandon.</p><p>Greg\u2019s face crumpled, the rage I was so much more familiar with working its way to the surface.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know about your little fling with the pretty boy? Huh?\u201d He snarled, his fingers gripping the edge of the counter hard enough that the sturdy wood groaned. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve been letting him stick his Goddamned dick all up in your fuckin\u2019 cunt? You\u2019re a whore!\u201d</p><p>He roared the last bit and I cheered internally, knowing there was no way that Brandon didn\u2019t hear that. But I didn\u2019t think of the consequences.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think of the fact that Brandon would see red and come charging around the corner, past the counter full-tilt and tackle Greg to the ground. I didn\u2019t think of the fact that Greg could have been armed.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t think that Brandon could get hurt...until I saw the gun.</p><p>I heard the blast and saw Brandon flinch; I heard Greg yelling as he shoved Brandon off of him. I saw the blood bloom on Brandon\u2019s arm and I was fleetingly grateful to see it coming from the fleshy part of his shoulder, seeming more like a graze than anything. But then dread settled in the pit of my stomach as I saw Greg jump to his feet and level the gun at Brandon\u2019s head where he was moving to get up.</p><p>Brandon froze, his eyes trained on Greg, watching every move. I\u2019d come around the counter, moving instinctively toward them, to try to break them apart or something...I wasn\u2019t sure. Now, from my position, I could see the client Brandon had in his studio peering around the corner. He motioned carefully, staying hidden as much as possible, to let me know that he\u2019d called the cops.</p><p>Hope rose in my chest but I choked it down, refusing to let it show on my face. Brandon held his hands up, flinching as the muscle in his arm pulled at his wound, which was steadily oozing blood, the drops of bright red splattering on the floor in a gruesome masterpiece of horror.</p><p>Greg, without taking his eyes off of Brandon, barked, \u201cChloe. With me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in my eyes and spilled down my cheeks. The helplessness of the situation was killing me. There was no way I was risking Brandon\u2019s life by refusing, but I could see him shaking his head at me, pleading silently for me not to move.</p><p>I took a shaky step toward Greg, watching the anger and fear grow on Brandon\u2019s face. I could feel his desperation, knew that he was berating himself for attacking Greg without thinking, without assessing the situation.</p><p>Suddenly, Brandon\u2019s client stepped out, holding the phone out in front of him. \u201cI called the cops. They\u2019re on the way but you have time to leave. Just leave her alone and get the hell out of here, man.\u201d</p><p>I saw the color leech from Greg\u2019s face as he realized that there was someone else there. His hand holding the gun wavered briefly and I saw Brandon tense, readying himself to make a move. Greg saw it too, though, and shook his head at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking do it. You\u2019ll regret it, I promise you. I\u2019ll put a bullet in your brain faster than you can blink, mother fucker.\u201d He motioned with the gun. \u201cCrawl over there by Mr. Hero who called the cops. Don\u2019t do anything funny or you\u2019ll fucking regret it. Before I shoot you, I\u2019ll put a bullet straight through blondie\u2019s eye socket just to prove that you\u2019ll have her over her dead body.\u201d</p><p>Brandon\u2019s gaze flickered back and forth between me and Greg and I pleaded with him with my eyes to please not do anything stupid. After what seemed like an eternity, Brandon finally moved, carefully sliding himself along the floor awkwardly to avoid jarring his injured arm. Greg followed his every move with the gun, his gaze never wavering. He\u2019d apparently already assessed Brian, Brandon\u2019s client, and discounted him as a threat beyond the use of his cell phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Brandon had moved far enough away to satisfy Greg, he stepped forward and dug the fingers of his free hand into my upper arm, jerking me into his side. As soon as I was pressed against him, his arm moved, wrapping around my throat and trapping me in the crook of his elbow, the sinew of his forearm tightening against my windpipe threateningly. His other hand moved and then, horrifically, the barrel of the gun was pressed firmly against the underside of my jaw, digging in painfully.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Brandon shouted, unable to stay silent any longer. \u201cPlease, just let her go. I\u2019ll go with you instead, or you can just get out of here. Just leave and we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re never found. Just leave us alone, leave Chloe alone. Don\u2019t do this...\u201d</p><p>He was pleading and I hated it. I hated that I brought this to them, that this was my fault. I knew it as certainly as I took my next breath, difficult though it was. But I also knew that I was going to do everything in my power to make this disappear, even if it meant sacrificing myself, my happiness, to do so.</p><p>Greg laughed, the sound grating on my ears. He jiggled me in his arms. \u201cYou hear that? He\u2019s wanting me to trade him for you. He\u2019s such a dumbass, Chloe. What the fuck did you see in him?\u201d His mouth went slack and he said, mockingly in a high-pitched, whiny voice, \u201cNo, please Mr. Greg. Don\u2019t hurt my pansy ass, Mr. Greg. I wanna suck your dick, Mr. Greg!\u201d</p> <p>His face tightened with rage once more. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking disgrace you piece of shit! You don\u2019t deserve my Chloe and you damn sure will never touch her again, you fucking fuckwad!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>I choked as his arm tightened even more on my windpipe, cutting off all air. I struggled in his arms, seeing spots dance before my eyes. He jerked me around a bit, shaking me and yelling at me to knock it off, though his arm did loosen just enough so I could breathe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, douchebag. We\u2019re leaving before the cops get here, so say goodbye to your precious sunshine,\u201d he sneered.</p><p>He backed away from Brandon and Brian, pulling me along with him. We could hear sirens screaming through the air at this point and I dragged my feet, hoping to buy some time, but it didn\u2019t help. He picked me up by my throat, uncaring that my fingers were clawing at his forearm locked around my neck. He just jammed the gun deeper under my chin, effectively stilling me when it cocked, the sound loud and echoing in my ear.</p><p>I stumbled along with him, my eyes never leaving Brandon, who was almost vibrating with rage and helplessness as I was dragged further and further away from him. Greg hit the door with his back and pushed it open. I could feel him tense, readying himself to turn and run in a bid to get away before either of two things happened; 1. The cops showed up, or 2. Brandon managed to get up and make it outside.</p> <p>My feet dangled above the pavement as Greg lifted me by the throat again, running as fast as he could to a nondescript, older model car pulled along the side of the building. He wrenched the door open and released his arm, shoving me inside roughly. He turned the key, dropping the gun in his lap and reaching for me as I fell across the console into the passenger seat, my hand automatically going to the door handle.</p><p>He wrenched me up by my hair, jerking me back around as he threw the car into drive and punched the gas, never relinquishing his hold on my hair. Tires squealed as he peeled out of the parking lot, skidding sideways into the street. I was thrown into the door as the car fishtailed, my nails breaking as I scrabbled for the door handle again, but never made contact as I was thrown back across the car when the car shifted again.</p><p>I felt his hand release my hair and watched as he tossed a handful of golden strands into my lap. I became aware of a dull, stinging sensation on my head, but pushed it away as I reached for the door handle again. I grasped the cool medal in my hand and pulled desperately, a cry torn from my throat when I realized it was doing nothing.</p><p>A low, evil laugh sounded beside me. \u201cLike I was really gonna be stupid enough to give you a way out. Stupid little cunt.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the sirens of the police department, now following the erratic path of Greg\u2019s driving. Somehow, though, he managed to make it to the highway, merging onto I-70 like he was driving a tank. I was jarred, thoroughly shook up, when he sideswiped a car in the right lane as he shot past it, but he managed to keep control and floored it.</p><p>I cowered in the seat while I watched the speedometer climb, passing 65, flying by 75, shooting straight to 90 in a flash. I eyed the gun, tucked just under his thigh on the seat. My fingers twitched and I clenched them in my lap.</p> <p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Greg said, his tone menacing. \u201cGrab for this gun and I promise you, I\u2019ll break every single one of your fingers before I put you on your knees and shove my cock down your throat. I remember how much you liked that.\u201d</p><p>A police cruiser paced us, lights blazing, sirens wailing, but made no move to get up around us. Greg huffed. \u201cGoddamn asshole, fucking calling the cops. Now look what we have to deal with.\u201d He sighed and then, spying an exit, yelled, \u201cHold on!\u201d as he wrenched the wheel to the right, laughing maniacally as I screamed in terror.</p><p>Horns blared and tires squealed but we managed to barrel onto the exit ramp and down it without hitting anyone or anyone hitting us. I closed my eyes and tried to block everything out, almost willing the car to roll or something, anything to make it all stop. I didn\u2019t care about my own safety anymore; I just cared about stopping Greg once and for all.</p><p>We got to the bottom of the ramp and skidded sideways as Greg took a left; thankfully, there were no cars around for the moment. He sped up and I opened my eyes to peek at where we were. I saw a park coming up on the right and Greg must have, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, well. Guess this is where it\u2019ll play out, won\u2019t it, sweetheart?\u201d he leered, glaring at me as he wrenched the wheel of the car to the right and turned into the park at full speed.</p><p>The car fishtailed again and he lost control, spinning out, around and around and around, dirt and dust and smoke billowing all around us until I couldn\u2019t see. I braced myself as best I could, but it didn\u2019t help. I was thrown around the car, my head cracking against the side window hard enough that I saw stars.</p><p>I moaned at the pain in my head, but there was nothing I could do about it at the moment. I was too busy trying to keep myself from flying all around the car. With one last, shuddering crash, the car came to rest, by the grace of God, on all four wheels, lodged up against the, thankfully, empty playground. I heard more tires spinning and squealing, the sound of the sirens blaring all around us making my head pound even worse. I could feel a sticky dampness trickling down my ear and neck, and I knew then that I\u2019d busted my head pretty good on the window.</p><p>I heard a low groan beside me and saw Greg shaking his head. He didn\u2019t look like he was injured. I glanced down, holding my breath when I saw that the gun was no longer tucked under his thigh. Suddenly, a loudspeaker squawked and an officer called out, calling Greg by name and telling him to exit the vehicle with his hands up.</p> <p>\u201cMother fucker!\u201d Greg shouted, punching the steering wheel. His eyes were wild, his breathing erratic. \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d He jerked his head toward me and pinned me with a narrow stare. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re more fucking trouble than you\u2019re worth. I should have just killed you the day I cut that bastard outta you. Thought I did. And now look where it\u2019s got me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJ-just let me go, Greg,\u201d I stammered. \u201cThe car is surrounded by cops and you know they aren\u2019t going to just let you drive away.\u201d</p><p>He snarled and his hand shot out, catching the side of my face with a vicious backhand. I bit my lips hard enough to draw blood to keep from crying out. I didn\u2019t want to give him the satisfaction. As I slowly turned my head forward again, I saw him shift, reach behind his back and, to my chagrin, pulled another gun from the waistband of his jeans, pointing it in my direction.</p><p>\u201cGreg,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>The cops were ramping up their demands, the bullhorn echoing in the stillness surrounding us. It was like time had frozen; we were at a standoff and, at this point, I had no idea which way this would go. Regardless, I knew that it probably wouldn\u2019t end well.</p> <p>He cocked the gun just as I caught the glint of metal out of the corner of my eye. The gun that had been tucked under this leg was lying on the floor beside his foot, and he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to it. In that split second, I made a decision. It was reckless, but by the time I thought it all out, it was too late.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>I forced myself to go limp like I had passed out, flopping sideways toward Greg in the driver seat. Caught off guard, the hand holding the gun jerked and I went deaf as the blast echoed around the enclosed car when his finger tightened on the trigger. I heard glass shatter and chaos outside the vehicle, but I tuned it out as I let my arm flop down, my finger brushing against and then closing over the gun on the floorboard. Greg\u2019s hand fisted in my hair, sending sharp pain over my scalp.</p><p>Before I could do anything, another shot rang out and Greg yelled in rage. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears because all I could think is that I\u2019d been shot. My whole body was numb with a combination of shock and adrenaline. I could feel hot, wet tears coursing down my face as I sat up, Greg\u2019s fingers still tangled painfully in my hair. Without thinking, before the gun had even cleared the seat completely, I pulled the trigger, blindly aiming for his lap, just wanting some kind of distraction so I could get away.</p><p>Without waiting to see if I\u2019d actually hit him, I wrenched my head out of his grasping fingers, my eyes watering at the searing sting of hair being ripped free. I scrambled for the door, my fingers scrabbling at the lock, finally pulling it up, but before I could open the door, it was pulled from my grasp. I tumbled out of the car into the waiting arms of an officer, who rushed me away from the car and straight into an ambulance.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until later that I realized it wasn\u2019t tears running down my face. It was blood. And it wasn\u2019t mine.</p><p>It all happened in the blink of an eye. Just a fraction of my life that I will never, ever forget. Because I shot Greg that day.</p><p>Because Greg died that day.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cChloe.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head around, snapped out of my reverie by the quiet by firm sound of my name being called. From the tone, it was apparent that it wasn\u2019t the first time, either.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Sorry,\u201d I said, contrite. I slammed the flash book closed on the counter, where it\u2019d been laid out for the last client of the day.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Brandon asked.</p><p>I nodded and walked back into his studio, closing the door behind me. He gave me a second to change into a strapless shirt, just for the sake of the shop more than modesty. I mean, seriously. We live together, share a bed, and trust me...he\u2019s seen me naked. Lots.</p><p>With a brisk knock, he peeked his head in and grinned, joking, \u201cDamn! I missed the show!\u201d</p><p>I heard grumbling behind him and laughed, knowing that Luke must have been passing by the door.</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong that this has me a little excited?\u201d Brandon quipped, coming fully into the studio. He left the door open; it was after closing time on a Saturday night, so there was no one else coming in, we were closed the next day, and Luke was getting ready to leave. T.J. had been really distant, almost jumpy for a few days and then called that morning to say he had something to take care of and wouldn\u2019t be back for a couple weeks. Luke and Brandon were okay with him taking the time off, since they\u2019d cut him into the business like they\u2019d talked about, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d been asking.</p><p>It\u2019d been forty-two days since that fateful day when Greg walked into the shop and tried to kidnap me. Well, he did kidnap me, but...it wasn\u2019t for long.</p><p>I\u2019d ended up with six stitches in my head where it\u2019d busted open against the window. Other than that, I had some bruising and small scrapes and cuts, mostly from him hitting me or from me flying around the car while he drove like a maniac.</p> <p>They figured, from start to finish, the whole thing had taken about twenty minutes. I\u2019d only been in the car with him at the park, during the stand-off, for about five minutes. It seemed so much longer when I was trapped in there. Turns out I hadn\u2019t been shot; when I dropped down to reach for the gun, the wild shot from Greg\u2019s gun that shattered the windshield had also almost hit an officer standing outside his car.</p><p>Since I was down and there was a clear shot, they\u2019d fired back, hitting him in the chest, piercing his heart. He was already dying when I shot him. They did say that my shot made sure he\u2019d never have kids if he\u2019d survived; but I\u2019d also nicked his femoral artery, so his survival wasn\u2019t guaranteed, just by my hand alone.</p><p>The investigation was over, I was free. I felt guilt over the fact that I shot him; but at the same time, I was liberated by the fact that I would never have to watch over my shoulder again. Oddly enough, the nightmares had stopped completely about two weeks after the incident. Things were back to normal...well, as normal as could be with my group of family and friends.</p><p>I\u2019d finally given in to Brandon and had been talking to a counselor about everything that happened. I\u2019d been able to let go of the guilt I had harbored all those years, all the blame...and all the hurt, especially over what happened with my baby. Brandon had tattooed a small pink heart right above my hip bone for me, just as a little reminder of that little heart that had grown inside me, however so briefly.</p><p>But life was good.</p><p>And I was getting another tattoo.</p><p>\u201cWell, you get excited about weird things, so no, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not wrong. At least not for you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and bent to kiss my lips sweetly. \u201cPut your ass in my chair, woman!\u201d he growled, playfully smacking me on my ass.</p><p>I wiggled it at him and laughed as he shook his head in mock resignation.</p><p>\u201cSo fuckin\u2019 sassy...\u201d he grumbled, making me laugh even more as I got comfortable in his chair. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d he said, once I was settled. He pulled on rubber gloves with the whole \u2018comedic doctor\u2019 routine, snapping them around his wrists and waggling his eyebrows.</p><p>I just rolled my eyes and watched as he got down to business. He applied the transfer that he\u2019d drawn up for me last week, checked to make sure it was placed correctly and evenly where I wanted it and then had me double check. That done, he raised a brow at me questioningly, and at my nod, went to work.</p><p>I bit my lip at the sharp sting of the needle as he plied it smoothly along my skin, beginning the outline. I settled into the pain, breathing evenly and sitting completely still. He worked steadily, sure in his movements; I loved watching him work.</p><p>About an hour later, he was done, the shop was cleaned up, we were on our way home, and I was the proud owner of a new tattoo. It was beautiful; artful swirls of ink linking star-shaped flower blooms, almost like the ones found on a cypress vine, that trailed down and over my shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWant to stop at Griff\u2019s for dinner?\u201d he asked as we got closer to the bar and grill.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We pulled in and went inside to grab a table. I don\u2019t know how, maybe it\u2019s providence or just good luck but, like almost always, our usual table was open. I slid into the booth and Brandon followed me in.</p><p>I looked over at him with a raised brow, surprised that he didn\u2019t take the seat across from me. He winked and nodded his head toward the door, where Leah and Ian were coming in. I grinned and waved back at Leah, who was waving crazily at me from across the room. They made their way to the booth and sat down.</p> <p>\u201cHey! How\u2019d you guys know we were here?\u201d I asked Leah.</p><p>\u201cBrandon called us earlier and asked if we wanted to meet for dinner. He said you were bitching that you never got to see me anymore, so he figured he\u2019d take matters into his own hands.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, turning to scowl at Brandon who was shooting a \u2018how could you?\u2019 look in Leah\u2019s direction.</p><p>He sighed, muttering, \u201cWomen,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>Ian gave Brandon a sympathetic nod and smile, which earned him a sound thump under the table. \u201cOw!\u201d he shouted, glaring at Leah.</p> <p>She gave him a sweet smile and then turned to me. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about throwing a 4th of July party or an end of summer bash before I have to go back to school. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d I said, promptly. \u201cIt\u2019s about time for a party around here. I say we do both!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought!\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI know the guys will be in because they never turn down an opportunity to blow shit up. Then she clapped her hands excitedly. \u201cOoohh, today was the day, wasn\u2019t it? Did you get your new tattoo?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, and I\u2019m in love with it. He\u2019s got it covered right now until we get home, otherwise I\u2019d show you. So what have you been up to?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cNothing really, just enjoying what\u2019s left of my summer. Can you believe it\u2019s July already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s been a crazy year so far, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked, shaking my head. \u201cBut damn, woman, the fourth is in five days, you better get to planning your party!\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was gonna talk to you about! We can have the party out at Emma\u2019s because that way we\u2019re out of town and will be less likely to get busted for fireworks. I think Ian was gonna see if Brandon, Luke, and Jacks wanted to go with him to get fireworks, and I figured you\u2019d help me with the food. And Emma and Allie will, too, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask them about the party?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot yet. What are you doing tomorrow? Want to go over there for a girls\u2019 day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d I replied, smiling at her.</p><p>It was nice to be able to visit with her while we ate, and we had our own little conversations as Brandon and Ian talked shop beside us. She made sure to text her sister, who checked with Allie, as well, and everything was put in place for girls\u2019 day.</p><p>Suddenly, Ian swore and Leah jerked her head around to see why. My eyes followed by instinct to see what was wrong and my brows lifted when I saw an exotic looking woman totter into the bar on ridiculously high stilettos, wearing what amounted to nothing more than a couple of band-aids strapped across her breasts and groin area.</p><p>You\u2019d think I was exaggerating about her outfit, but you\u2019d be wrong. She seriously was wearing a micro-mini skirt that barely met the bottom of her vagina, and a crop top that was nothing more than a fancy bra. I was afraid that she\u2019d move wrong, or hell, even just sneeze, and everything would come busting out everywhere. She was pretty in a way, but it was more like she was helpless, completely vapid, yet very, very calculating.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to determine the reason Ian had sworn, either. Her eyes locked onto him like a heat-seeking missile. We didn\u2019t have to wonder how she even knew he was here because she played her cards for everyone to see, in a very loud way. She click-clacked over to us with mincing little footsteps,</p> <p>\u201cIAN! O.M.G! Why didn\u2019t you call me to go to the bar? You know I would have come with you,\u201d she pouted, shrilly. \u201cI drove by your house but you weren\u2019t there, and then I just happened to drive by Griff\u2019s and, uh, here you are! How could you forget to call your girlfriend, silly? At least just to let me know where you were.\u201d</p><p>I winced and glanced over at Leah, who straightened in her seat beside Ian. I could feel the tension rolling off of her in waves as she stared at the woman standing at the end of the table. I felt Brandon\u2019s hand slide over my thigh, squeezing gently. I covered his hand with mine, my anxiety level rising by the second.</p><p>\u201cVictoria...\u201d Ian growled, glaring at the woman.</p><p>Leah put her hand on his arm and said, sweetly, \u201cIan, introduce your girlfriend to your friends.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath as Brandon tensed beside me. Guess I wasn\u2019t the only one who heard the barely veiled threat in her tone.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s attention moved to the hand Leah had laid on Ian\u2019s shoulder. She giggled, a fake, saccharine sweet, but nauseating sound, before she snapped, \u201cYou can quit touching my man, now.\u201d Her eyes were flashing with jealousy and possession and it wasn\u2019t a good look on her. It made her look decidedly unbalanced.</p><p>Ian closed his eyes and sighed. He then slid out of the booth, pushing Victoria back gently at the same time. \u201cLook, Victoria. I don\u2019t want to do this here. Let me call your dad to come get you, or your brother. Which one do you want?\u201d</p><p>She pouted again, sticking her lip out like a child. \u201cYou take me home,\u201d she whined.</p><p>Leah caught my eye and I nodded, immediately knowing what she was asking. I tapped Brandon\u2019s thigh and jerked my head to get him to move. He complied, sliding out of the booth and taking my hand to help me out, even though I didn\u2019t need it. He\u2019s a gentleman like that.</p><p>Leah slid out as well, pushing past Ian without a word. I followed her as she intended. Brandon hurriedly tossed some bills on the table and caught up to me, taking my hand in his once more. He looked worried as he glanced back at Ian, who was standing there, stunned, in the same place Leah had left him.</p><p>When we got to the door, Ian hollered, \u201cWAIT! Leah!\u201d</p><p>She paused, looking over her shoulder, quirking her brow at him. I noticed we\u2019d gathered quite the crowd of on-lookers, especially Griff, who was standing behind the bar. Ian moved past Victoria, ignoring her gasp of outrage. He strode to the door, cupping his fingers gently around Leah\u2019s arm and pulling her to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t seriously believe that she\u2019s my girlfriend. Not after everything we\u2019ve shared these past months. I haven\u2019t seen anyone else besides you since I laid eyes on you, woman.\u201d His face was sincere, his tone soft and pleading.</p><p>\u201cThen why is she showing up here, calling herself your girlfriend and all that shit?\u201d Leah asked just as softly.</p><p>Ian blew out a breath on a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Can you give me a second to call someone to come get her? Then I promise, we\u2019ll go home and talk.\u201d</p><p>I blinked in surprise at the whole \u2018home\u2019 comment, because I wasn\u2019t aware that they\u2019d started living together. I knew that they spent a hell of a lot of time together because, let\u2019s face it, I hardly ever saw my best friend anymore. But I\u2019m not complaining, you know, \u2018cause obviously, I\u2019ve been pretty preoccupied myself. Wink wink...need I say more? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leah nodded shortly and Ian spun on his heel, already digging his phone out of his pocket. I touched her arm and she gave me a brief smile to let me know she was okay. In just a short time, Ian was back, Victoria mincing along behind him with a huge scowl plastered across her face.</p><p>\u201cHer brother was just down the street, so he\u2019ll be here in a couple of minutes. We can go ahead and go, though. Griff is gonna keep an eye on her,\u201d Ian told Leah. He turned to me and Brandon. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, guys. I hate that our night kind of went sour...\u201d he trailed off when Brandon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, man. I understand and I know things aren\u2019t what they seemed. Leah will, too, I\u2019m sure of it, once you\u2019ve explained. We\u2019re good, man. See ya later, okay?\u201d Brandon gave him a handshake/man hug thing that they always do.</p><p>I hugged Leah, whispering in her ear to call if she needed me. She nodded briefly, reminded me about girl\u2019s day, and stalked off to the car, leaving Ian to follow with a sad smile and a tired wave.</p><p>\u201cWell, that went to hell rather quickly, yeah?\u201d Brandon quipped, dropping his arm around my shoulders and pulling me into his side as we walked to his truck.</p><p>All I could do was nod.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Brandon was still sleeping when I came out of the bathroom in the morning. He was such a contradiction, lying on his back, tangled in my soft, white sheets, muted sunlight peeking through the curtains. The tattooed, tanned expanse of his body and his dark hair contrasted beautifully against the stark white background, but his face was softened with sleep, giving him an almost boyish look. But trust and believe, there was nothing boyish about that man.</p><p>His left arm was thrown above his head and his right was resting along his stomach, his long, tapered fingers pointing the way down to that sleeping piece of him that drove me nuts. Unable to resist, I crept up to the bed, gently tugged the sheet up and carefully slid under it, situating my still naked self in a straddle over his legs.</p><p>I let the sheet drape over my head and softly kissed his hip bone, breathing in the sultry, musky, all-male scent of him. My cheek brushed against the velvety-soft skin of his length, still impressive even when it wasn\u2019t engorged. I felt it twitch slightly, felt the slight change in Brandon\u2019s breathing, and, knowing he was waking up, took that moment to slide his softened flesh between my lips, taking him completely inside the hot, moistness of my mouth, sucking lightly.</p><p>I heard a gasp sound above my head, felt his hips arch up into me, and I pressed myself further down over him, breathing through my nose and enjoying the feel of him hardening against my tongue.</p><p>My name exploded from his lips on a strangled moan that sent shivers down my spine and a rush of moisture to the apex of my thighs. I pulled back, stroking the length of him with my tongue as I did so, running the tip of it around the thick ridge of him at the top before dipping it into the tiny slit pearled with a drop of pre-cum.</p><p>I moaned at his taste, smiling to myself as he groaned again in response, and then gave a half-shout as I enclosed him in my lips again. I bobbed my head over him, loving the glide of his silk-covered hardness over my tongue and against my lips. I brought my hand up to play, stroking him in counterpart to my mouth, sucking and licking every inch of him in turn.</p><p>On a growl, Brandon buried his hands in my hair and held my head still as he began moving, essentially fucking my mouth with sharp, short thrusts. His rhythm faltered and I knew he was close. I felt him tug gently on my hair in desperation, giving me ample warning, but I knew what I wanted...and what I wanted was to drive him absolutely wild.</p><p>I tightened my grip just a bit, twisting my hand on the upstroke while I slid my lips down to meet my fingers, moving faster, letting him know without words that I wasn\u2019t stopping. He was panting; I could hear it, but since the sheet was still over my head, I couldn\u2019t see him. Suddenly, one of his hands untangled from my hair and the sheet was wrenched away.</p><p>I deliberately cut my eyes up at him, letting him see the naked need in my gaze, the heat shining bright as he watched every move I made on him. His muscles tensed and I could feel his control shattering even more as he thrust wildly against my lips before he came on a shout, spilling salty-sweetness over my tongue, moaning as I drank him down.</p><p>I didn\u2019t remove my mouth until he was shuddering at every movement of my mouth over his over-sensitized flesh, and only then because he\u2019d fisted his hands in my hair once more and tugged until I released him with a soft pop.</p><p>I sat up and grinned at the panting, spent, gorgeous, and sleep-roughened male beneath me. \u201cGood morning,\u201d I said to him, my voice husky.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...fuckin\u2019 A that\u2019s a good morning, baby. What\u2019d I do to deserve that?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder and shifted so that I was lying on top of him, my chin propped up on my fists on his chest. His hand came up and pushed my hair back from my face, a tender, sweet gesture that made my heart thud just a little faster, even though it\u2019s something he did on a regular basis now.</p><p>He ran his thumb over my bottom lip softly, his heavy-lidded eyes gleaming at me with emotion. I kissed the tip of his thumb and whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, he cupped my face and whispered back, \u201cI love you more.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, smiling at him as I did. He nodded back and pulled me up until he could kiss me. When he released me, I asked, \u201cWhat do you have planned today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI figured since you guys were having a girls\u2019 day, Luke and I would hang out at Jacks\u2019s house. And just what are you girls gonna do during your girls\u2019 day?\u201d</p><p>I winked. \u201cGuess that\u2019s for me to know and you to not find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really,\u201d he growled, his hands reaching for my waist.</p><p>I shrieked and tried to jump up, knowing that he was going to tickle me, but I didn\u2019t get very far. His fingers dug in to my sides and I laughed uncontrollably, hating the fact that he knew my weak spots. I smacked at his hands and squirmed trying to get away but he was like an octopus. He managed to lean up and over me, pinning me to the bed as he straddled me legs and held me down, his fingers torturing my tender ribs and sides.</p><p>He paused for just a second, his eyes dancing with unholy glee and I felt his hands start sliding down.</p><p>\u201cNo...No...NO!\u201d I screamed as his fingers gently dug into the crease of my thigh, the absolute most ticklish spot on my body, twisting and turning, breathless with laughter. \u201cOkay, I give! I give! Brandon...please...ohmigod, I\u2019m gonna pee myself. Stop!\u201d</p><p>His fingers stopped and I looked at him, waiting to see what he was going to do. He leaned down and kissed me, his fingers moving down just a bit before sliding unerringly through my folds and then thrust inside me with no preamble.</p><p>\u201cOhhh...\u201d I groaned, the word bursting from my lips in surprised pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Is that right, sunshine?\u201d he whispered against my mouth, his thumb sliding against my clit, circling it as he hooked his fingers up to press against my g-spot, sending me straight to the edge in a hot second.</p><p>I arched my hips up, riding his hand, reaching for the orgasm that was shimmering just out of reach and then, sweet mother of heaven and everything good in this world, he twisted his fingers again, his thumb swiped over the beaded nubbin of my clit, and I exploded, raining warm honey over his fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shivered as he withdrew from my heat, my body spasming once more when he raised his hand to his mouth, sucking and licking my juices from his skin. I was panting, lust curling in my belly even after my release at the heat in his eyes as he stared down at me.</p><p>\u201cOver. Hands and knees. Now,\u201d Brandon said roughly.</p><p>His voice was dark, his gaze intent. My breath caught and I complied immediately, rolling over underneath him, pulling my knees up beneath me so my ass was in the air and my arms and cheek were pressed to the mattress. I felt him shift, moving his knees closer to my legs, pressing them together more rather than widening them. Before I could question, he ran his fingers along the dripping wet seam between my thighs, spearing his fingers in deep, once, twice, and then replaced them with his hardened length, pushing fully inside me in an unhurried thrust.</p><p>I groaned at the friction of him sliding inside me, the fullness of him seeming even larger and harder than ever with my thighs closed tight around him. He pulled back, almost completely out of me, and then thrust home again, harder than before. His hips slapped against my ass, making us both moan.</p> <p>On a muffled curse, his control snapped and he gripped my hips tight in his hands, fingers digging into my flesh as he began pounding into me, each deep slide of him inside me building the anticipation, my muscles tightening, quaking beneath him as he pushed me closer to the edge. His left hand let go of my hip, slid around and pressed in, his fingers brushing against my swollen clit and that was it.</p><p>I came, crying out as I tumbled over the edge into pure bliss, shouting Brandon\u2019s name as he slammed home one last time, locking himself as deep inside me as he could, and then filling me with the scalding heat of his seed. When the storm had passed, he pulled out and collapsed beside me, breathing heavy as he brushed my forehead with his lips.</p><p>\u201cI swear to fucking jeebus, babe, it gets better every time,\u201d he panted, quirking the corner of his lips up in a lopsided, half-goofy grin.</p><p>I laughed, cuddling into his side and kissing his chest. This was happiness.</p><p>I finally got out of bed again, showered and got ready to go. Brandon decided he\u2019d drop me off since we were pretty much going to the same place. We pulled up to Emma\u2019s house and I got out, waving to Brandon as he pulled away.</p> <p>Before I got to the door, it opened and Hayden, Emma\u2019s now 5 year old niece, came rushing out.</p><p>\u201cCwoey! Guess what? My mommy\u2019s gonna haved another baby!\u201d she crowed, her little pigtails flying behind her as she skidded to a stop in front of me.</p><p>I crouched down to her level (she was such a petite, cute little thing) and grabbed her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Hayden! Are you excited?\u201d</p><p>She nodded vigorously and spun on her heel, pulling away from me to run inside again. I followed, looking around to see where the dogs were, but they were conspicuously absent. Emma was in the kitchen loading the dishwasher, Allie was sitting cross legged on the couch, nursing Liam, and Jenna was sitting in the armchair, Everly in her lap. She was looking down into the baby\u2019s tiny little face and asking, \u201cWhat am I gonna do? Huh? Uncle Noah is an asshole and knocked me up and my God, this is nuts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Chloe,\u201d Emma called from the kitchen before adding, \u201cJenna, quit cussing at my child. You want to cuss at a kid, do it to your own. God knows they probably have a worse vocabulary than all of us combined,\u201d she finished, drolly.</p><p>\u201cHa ha ha,\u201d Jenna said, her tone heavy on the sarcasm. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get a chance to tell Noah myself, or you. I mean, I didn\u2019t even get to tell Chloe because Hayden has a big mouth!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMommy...\u201d Hayden scolded. \u201cYou hafta tawk nicewy now that you have a baby in your bewwy. And my mouf isn\u2019t big. Your mouf is big. I sawed it get big when you was in the cwoset with daddy and you had his-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lord, ohmigod, Hayden go outside!\u201d Jenna shrieked, startling the baby who started wailing. And of course, once Everly started, Liam felt left out, so he let go of Allie\u2019s breast to join in the fun.</p><p>Emma rolled her eyes, dried her hands on a dish towel and came into the room to take her baby from her sister. Allie was trying desperately not to laugh as she patted Liam\u2019s little bottom and bounced him a bit to calm him before switching him to the other side.</p><p>I was biting my lip to keep my own laughter at bay, waiting for Hayden to stomp out of the house onto the front porch before I looked at Jenna and said, \u201cWell, hiding in closets for clandestine blow jobs, are we?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her head in her hands and moaned as we all laughed.</p><p>We laughed even harder when Leah came in the door, cheeks completely red, sputtering in shock. \u201cDo you know what your daughter just told me?\u201d she asked Jenna, who\u2019d looked up when the opened.</p><p>Jenna dropped her head again, this time leaning forward and banging it on the coffee table repeatedly. Emma smacked her on the top of the head and told her to knock it off before she said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s one of two things at the moment; either you now know that our eldest sister is knocked up again, or you have been familiarized with Jenna\u2019s penchant for sucking penis in a hall closet. Am I close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, oh my God! She seriously just told me she saw Jenna with...wait, what? You\u2019re pregnant?\u201d she asked Jenna, incredulity coloring her words.</p> <p>Jenna brought her head up off the table and gave Leah a pathetic look and a nod. She stuck her lip out and pouted.</p><p>Leah just rolled her eyes at her. \u201cBitch, don\u2019t play me. We all know you are so absolutely in love with your husband and you are so in love with your kids and you\u2019re just as happy about this one as you were Jarrod and Hayden.\u201d</p><p>Jenna lost her pout and smiled. It was a small smile, but a smile nonetheless. \u201cI know. I am happy about it and you\u2019d think Noah was the one giving birth the way he\u2019s been preening. He\u2019s already told everyone down at the precinct-\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWait. You\u2019re telling me that Noah\u2019s cop buddies knew before your family did?\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed nervously, shooting Emma and Leah a sheepish look. \u201cHe works with them every day and...\u201d she trailed off. \u201cAt least I told you in person and we just found out yesterday. I took ten tests that all came out positive. I\u2019m making an appointment on Monday to go in to the doctor. You wanna come with me?\u201d she asked Leah.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Leah answered, and Emma smiled, her ire at not being told first disappearing.</p><p>I looked over at Allie who was sitting quietly, still nursing Liam. She grinned at me and shook her head, glancing over at Emma and her sisters with a fondness that only comes from years of friendship.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019re the dogs?\u201d I asked in the comfortable silence that had descended.</p><p>Emma and Allie both grinned evilly, Allie going as far as to cackle-like seriously cackle. I swear I wanted to look around for Nanny when she did, because she sounded just like her. But would I tell Allie that? Yeah, probably. Heeheehee...</p><p>\u201cI told Luke that he had to take them to Jacks\u2019 with him since it\u2019s girl\u2019s day,\u201d Emma answered. \u201cSo, since the babies have been fed, what do you guys think about going for some lunch?\u201d</p><p>Everyone answered in the affirmative. Jenna got up and called Hayden in to wash up because, in the ten minutes since she\u2019d sent her outside, she\u2019d managed to find a mud puddle somewhere (or made one, more likely) and had mud up to her elbows. Miraculously, she\u2019d kept most of the mud off her clothes, which is not the norm, so Jenna did a happy dance to celebrate.

The first time she\u2019d taken me to Manny\u2019s, she\u2019d told me about the first date Luke had taken her on; how she\u2019d eaten all of her pasta and then made love to a piece of cake. Of course, I was laughing my ass off by the end of the story because of how it ended with Leah\u2019s drunk ass being dropped off by Calland right before they got to the good stuff.</p><p>Manny himself came out and seated us, immediately swooping both babies up in his arms and taking them back to the kitchen with him, calling for his wife as he went. Emma and Allie just grinned indulgently, knowing that their babies were safe with Manny. The worst that would happen would be that Manny would spoil them more than they already were, and at four months old, they were pretty damn spoiled.</p><p>A waiter came over and took our orders, chuckling when we all ordered the same exact thing; salad with house Italian, fettuccine alfredo with chicken, and, of course, black tie mousse cake. As he walked away to put our orders in, Jenna was talking pregnancy with Allie and Emma, so I took the chance to ask Leah what had happened after we all left last night.</p><p>\u201cSo are you and Ian good?\u201d I asked, cautiously.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cYeah, I guess so. Apparently she\u2019s an old family friend who he went out with once and never took the hint after that he wasn\u2019t interested. I get the feeling that she\u2019s a little looney tunes.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYa think? There\u2019s something not right with her, that\u2019s for damn sure. You and Ian make up okay, though?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOf course. Hot, heavy make-up sex is the fucking best.\u201d</p><p>I pretended to plug my ears and sang, \u201cLa la la la,\u201d until she stopped, her words lost in laughter.</p><p>I heard Allie pipe up, \u201cOohh, Chloe is covering her ears, that means there\u2019s juicy gossip going down and I want in!\u201d</p> <p>Amid giggles, we filled them in on what happened last night, Emma and Jenna becoming properly outraged on behalf of their little sister. She was quick to defend Ian, though, so I guess everything was for sure good with them. I hoped so, anyway. I really liked the guy and he seemed really good to Leah. Only time will tell.</p><p>Our salads arrived, along with the babies, Manny holding Liam, his wife cuddling Everly. They both were sleeping peacefully, so they laid them in their carriers, patted each of them on the back, and headed back into the kitchen with Manny winking and quipping, \u201cGotta make sure your alfredo is perfect!\u201d</p><p>An hour and a half later, stuffed to the gills with the best Italian food you could ever ask for, we all headed back to Emma\u2019s house, but Leah and I stopped at the store to get a few girls\u2019 day staples that included the makings of special sundaes (we bought extra frozen yogurt for the nursing moms and newly pregnant to eat without the added booze), dried beef dip, and buffalo chicken dip. Yes, we all just got done eating, but when we do a girls\u2019 day, it\u2019s an all day thing, and always involves food. Don\u2019t judge us.</p><p>We were standing in the frozen food aisle at the store when Leah looked at me, tears filling her eyes. I dropped the carton of fro yo I was holding into the cart and pulled her into my arms. \u201cLeah, honey, what\u2019s wrong? I thought you said everything was okay?\u201d I held her back and looked at her with concern.</p><p>She gave a short laugh and dashed the tears from her eyes quickly. \u201cI am fine. It just...she keeps calling his phone. Her and some other number that doesn\u2019t have a name. I only know that one of them is Victoria because I answered it once. She got all huffy and told me to have him call her, that she wanted to thank him for the night before.\u201d She groaned and moved back, grabbing another carton of fro yo from the cooler, tossing it in the cart as she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I get so upset when she says stuff like that. He was with me at my house, we were in bed, and he was fucking my brains out, so I know he wasn\u2019t with her. But...\u201d</p><p>She dropped her eyes to her hands, twisting her fingers together agitatedly. \u201cI\u2019m all in on this one. He\u2019s it for me,\u201d she said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Leah...\u201d I answered softly. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right? You love him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cShort and simple. I do. God help me, but I do. Isn\u2019t it too soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I told her. \u201cI mean, look at your sister. Emma and Luke didn\u2019t know each other for that long and see how in love they are? You can\u2019t be within ten feet of either of them without getting hit by the waves of lust emanating from them both.\u201d</p><p>She let out a wry chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re totally right there. Did I tell you I walked in on them?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cWhat? Luke and Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Luke\u2019s so frickin\u2019 hot and all, but he\u2019s my brother-in-law. I didn\u2019t need to see that.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cHe had her bent over the back of the couch going to pound town and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Leah!\u201d I shouted, cutting her off. \u201cI so don\u2019t need to hear that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? How do you think I felt having to see it? I swear if there was a way to bleach my eyeballs, I would have!\u201d</p> <p>When we finally stopped laughing and moved on to the chip aisle, I asked her, \u201cSo why the tears, then?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. I don\u2019t know. I just get so upset because it\u2019s only been months that we\u2019ve been together. I don\u2019t know his past women, not really...he\u2019s talked about them, but...then Victoria pops up out of the blue and he\u2019s never talked about her before. Then there\u2019s this other number but when I asked him about it, he just blew me off like it was a wrong number. I just don\u2019t want to be made to look like a fool.\u201d</p><p>I patted her back in sympathy. \u201cI know. But at the same time, if you love him, and he loves you?\u201d I made it a question and waited to see what she would say.</p><p>She nodded shyly. \u201cHe said it a couple weeks ago. Told me out of the blue that he loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I nudged her with my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d I clapped my hands together. \u201cNow. Let\u2019s get this shit and get outta here so we can get some special sundaes in our bellies!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck, this is the funniest thing I think I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d Allie crowed, squishing closer to me as we all stared out the window into Emma\u2019s back yard.</p><p>We\u2019d been back from the store for a few hours now, the babies were both napping, we\u2019d all been snacking, and Hayden was coloring at the kitchen table when we heard shouting outside. Emma had jumped up and made a bee-line for the back door like her ass was on fire, locking the doggy-door shut and slumping in relief.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t had to say a word; she\u2019d taken one look at us all staring at her with mild amusement and explained, \u201cI know that sound. That\u2019s Luke\u2019s you-fucking-dog-you-got-sprayed-by-a-skunk-again yell.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d heard a gasp and then Hayden had piped up, \u201cAhhh...Aun\u2019 Emmy said a dirty word!\u201d</p><p>Emma had cringed and mouthed an apology to Jenna who just waved it off. \u201cShe\u2019s been in the garage with Dad, Noah, and Calland when they\u2019ve been \u2018fixing\u2019 something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019d all nodded sagely. When those three got together to \u2018fix\u2019 something, it usually ended up being worse than a drunken sailor/truck driver convention. Every other word out of their mouths was fuck, shit, damn, or asshole. And that\u2019s just when they first get there. I\u2019d walked in with Leah one morning for Sunday breakfast and they were taking apart a lawn mower...let\u2019s just say the air was blue, my ears were burning, and I learned new words that day.</p><p>Then we laughed when it hit us, after which we\u2019d crowded around the window to see Luke dragging the plastic pool into the yard from the garage. We hadn\u2019t budged, either, when Brandon had come in the back door near where we were all peeking out the window to get tomato juice from the massive stash of cans in the laundry room.</p><p>Emma had started stocking up on it when Doug had decided to become best friends with the skunk in the woods. It was kind of a one-sided relationship; Doug loved the skunk, the skunk hated Doug. And let him know it by spraying him at least once a week. Still.</p><p>Luke had tried everything to get rid of the thing, but to no avail. I guess running from the woods gagging about a half dozen times cured him of his ability to try; well, that and Emma laughing her ass off at him each time it happened.</p> <p>Brandon had shaken his head at us, smirked, loaded down a laundry basket with about a dozen and a half of the large cans of tomato juice, grabbed the can opener, and walked back outside without saying a word. We\u2019d found out, by watching out of the window, of course, that it wasn\u2019t just Doug that got sprayed this time.</p><p>Nope. This time, DJ had gotten it, too. We weren\u2019t too sure how Grady had managed to avoid it, but no way were any of us going outside to ask. Hayden had tried but Jenna had told her no. In fact, I think her words were, \u201cif you want to go outside and smell like a stinky skunk butt, then go ahead. But you\u2019ll have take a tomato juice bath outside just like the dogs.\u201d She\u2019d quickly lost interest then and had gone back to coloring.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d Emma shrieked, then laughed uncontrollably (and we did, too) as we all watched Luke make a dive for DJ, who\u2019d managed to get the front half of his body out of the pool, and miss, therefore belly flopping in the middle of the juice-filled pool. Which then, since he was kneeling on the other side of the pool dousing Doug with tomato juice, soaked Brandon with a tidal wave of juice, causing him to let go of Doug.</p><p>What ensued after could only be described as gut-wrenchingly hilarious; Luke and Brandon tried to wrangle the dogs back into the pool, rinse them off with the tomato juice, and then wash them with shampoo, while Jackson stood off to the side shouting directions. It ended with Luke, Brandon, and Jacks all dripping wet, their clothes stained red with tomato juice, and covered in suds. I say AND Jacks because Luke and Brandon got tired of him laughing, chased him down, and wrestled him into the juice pool.</p><p>And all the while, Grady was sitting in the shade a few feet away, watching everything with a grin on his little doggy lips.</p> <p>When everything was cleaned up, including the guys (thankfully Brandon still had a few clothes at Emma and Luke\u2019s), they talked us into merging girls\u2019 day with guys\u2019 day. Of course, we were pretty sure it was just so they could chow down on our munchies and didn\u2019t have to fend for themselves.</p><p>After they cleaned us out of pretty much everything we\u2019d made, except for special sundae makings, we all sat talking in the living room for a while, passing babies around and petting dogs that would come up for random loving. That\u2019s when the 4th of July party finally got mentioned.</p><p>My brother nodded immediately, as soon as Leah brought it up. \u201cHell yeah!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got dibs on fireworks!\u201d</p><p>Brandon and Luke both scowled at him. \u201cNo, fuck no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Luke hollered. \u201cThe last time you picked out the fireworks, you came home with pansy ass smoke bombs and sparklers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Emma cried. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with sparklers? I love sparklers!\u201d</p><p>Luke turned to her, his face softening. \u201cI know, sugar, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with sparklers.\u201d He turned his head and glanced at Jackson out of the corner of his eye. \u201cIf you\u2019re a girl.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI was 17 at the time and bought them at the grocery store. It was all they had,\u201d he grated out through clenched teeth.</p><p>Obviously, this was an argument that had been ongoing for some time. One I hadn\u2019t heard of, before, either.</p><p>Brandon jumped in. \u201cScrew you both, I\u2019m getting the fireworks this time, and I\u2019m taking Calland with me. No way in hell will he pick out anything pansy-assed like you two would,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>Geez. Boys and their explosives.</p><p>Allie clapped her hands to get their attention and said, sweetly, \u201cHow about all of you go together over to Shelton\u2019s and get them? But you better do it soon since we now have four days to get this thing planned.\u201d</p><p>She looked over at Leah. \u201cWhy the hell did you wait so long to plan this thing, anyway?\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Leah just smiled and shrugged. \u201cLast minute thing, but who cares? Let\u2019s plan this party!\u201d</p><p>We all got down to business then, the guys calling Calland to determine the best time to make the trip to get the fireworks, while we discussed food, drinks, and time.</p> <p>\u201cI say we just plan it for like three o\u2019clock. That way we can still do a cookout or whatever, we still have time to swim if we want,\u201d Emma paused, glancing at Allie for confirmation that swimming in their pool was an option.</p><p>Allie nodded. \u201cI was gonna say we could do most of it over at our house then, so we could swim and things.\u201d She sighed and stared off into space dreamily. \u201cI love having my own pool now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, moving on,\u201d Emma said, laughing. Allie laughed with her and nudged her shoulder. \u201cSince we pretty much live on the same property, our yards combine to be a pretty huge party platform, right?\u201d she asked Allie.</p><p>Allie nodded again, clearly wondering where Emma was going with this.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we did an old-fashioned picnic party with games and things?\u201d she said, excitedly.</p><p>Leah looked perplexed. \u201cWhat do you mean, old-fashioned?\u201d</p><p>Emma rolled her eyes. \u201cYou know, long table-cloth covered tables, pot-luck, tug-of-war, three-legged races...like they used to do back in the old days like you see on TV!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Luke broke in, shifting Everly down against his chest from where he\u2019d just had her lifted up in front of his face, kissing her chubby little cheeks. \u201cYou aren\u2019t planning on inviting the whole damn town like the old days, are you?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>Emma opened her mouth to answer but Allie cut her off. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching too many reruns of The Andy Griffith Show and you are now banned from watching To Wong Foo, too. Seriously, woman.\u201d Emma scowled but Allie continued, \u201cWe can play the games and everything, we can do the potluck, obviously, because what cookout party isn\u2019t a potluck? On a side note, I\u2019ll be asking Emma\u2019s mom to bring her homemade mac &amp; cheese because I\u2019ve been craving that shit-\u201d</p><p>Jackson jumped at this, swinging around, his eyes getting huge. \u201cCraving? Did you say craving?\u201d He glanced worriedly down at the content baby in his arms, but we could clearly see that he would be completely fine with knocking Allie up again. He loved being a dad. It was so cute! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allie snorted. \u201cHell, Jacks, don\u2019t panic, babe. I\u2019m not pregnant again...yet,\u201d she finished with a wink and a slightly evil grin.</p><p>He winked back at her.</p><p>A little voice broke into the conversation. \u201cMommy can bring Daddy\u2019s baby juice!\u201d</p><p>Total silence with the exception of Hayden\u2019s giggles. We all looked over at Jenna who had dropped her head in her hands again, shaking it, muttering, \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p> <p>Jackson cleared his throat and asked Hayden if she wanted to take the dogs outside with him. She jumped up and raced out the door, Jacks looking back at Jenna once and shaking his head, his shoulders jumping with silent laughter.</p><p>As soon as they cleared the door, Emma rounded on her sister. \u201cDaddy\u2019s baby juice? What the hell have you been teaching my niece, Jenna?\u201d She was trying hard not to laugh.</p><p>Jenna threw her hands up in the air. \u201cShe overheard us playing around one night when she was supposed to be in bed. It was after midnight, she\u2019d been asleep but had apparently woken up. Noah and I were...well, that\u2019s not important. We just were playing around and I teased him about giving me his...Jesus...baby juice. She knocked on the door but we didn\u2019t think she heard anything until the next morning when she asked for some baby juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Leah breathed. \u201cWhat the hell did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged helplessly. \u201cNothing. We just ignored it. She hasn\u2019t mentioned it since then but trust my daughter to open her mouth to embarrass me,\u201d she groaned.</p> <p>Jackson and Hayden came back inside with the dogs at which time Jenna decreed it was time to go. She packed up Hayden, gave everyone hugs and was out the door, asking Hayden exasperatedly, \u201cChild, what am I gonna do with you?\u201d</p><p>Our little get together wound down then, but we did finalize our plans for the party. The guys were gonna take off the next day after work to get the fireworks and everything else was set. I was a little excited about it, but hey, I\u2019m a sucker for parties.</p><p>Brandon and I left about half an hour later, right after Leah jetted out the door, which was point two seconds after Ian called her to see where she was. We barely got in the door when my phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacks,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHey. Got a question for you. Do you remember a little lullaby that mom would sing to us when we were young?\u201d</p><p>Immediately my thoughts turned dark, knowing exactly which lullaby he was talking about, the memories flooding my mind with all the times I sang that to myself to float away from what was really happening.</p> <p>I was silent for a long time, lost in my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cChloe?\u201d Jackson asked softly.</p><p>I blinked, trying to push everything away. \u201cYea-uh, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I glanced around the living room, shocked to see that I was barely inside the door. Brandon was standing in front of me, a worried look creasing his brow. I gave him a small smile and shook my head to let him know I was good as I answered Jackson.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. What made you ask about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie was singing some lullabies to Liam and I remembered that Mom used to sing one that she made up. I know it was your favorite, but I can\u2019t remember the song. Figured you would have, but...I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking that it might be something you would\u2019ve sang...that...\u201d he cleared his throat again, stumbling over his words.</p><p>\u201cJackson, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just...it doesn\u2019t bring back very good memories because I used to sing it to myself in my head when Greg would...\u201d I broke off, not willing to go there. \u201cBut I would love to teach it to Allie so she can sing it to Liam. It would be my honor.\u201d</p> <p>I could hear the emotion clogging his throat when he answered. \u201cGood. That\u2019s great.\u201d Then he added, \u201cChloe, I may not tell you very often, but I love you very much. And I\u2019m so sorry that I left you there and wasn\u2019t there to protect you. I know I\u2019ve told you that before, but...I just...I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jacks,\u201d I whispered into the phone. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and wiped the tears that had welled from my eyes. Brandon was immediately in front of me, enfolding me in his arms. I hugged him tightly, completely content and loving the strength he was giving me, even without asking for it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, you know. Just for the record.\u201d</p><p>I grinned up at him. \u201cYes, I do know that. And I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tip of my nose, pushed me back, and took off running toward the bedroom, yelling, \u201cLast one in bed has to give the other a full body massage with hot oil!\u201d</p><p>I gasped and shouted, \u201cYou cheating little ass!\u201d as I took off after him.</p><p>He made it to the bed before me.</p><p>But I got the massage...and then some.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>The day of the party was picture perfect. The weather was absolutely beautiful, everyone was in a great mood, and it all fell into place. The night before, we\u2019d gone a couple of towns over to hang out at the little festival they had and to watch the fireworks. Tonight, the guys had promised us a show to rival the one from last night.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t let any of us girls know what they had gotten from the fireworks store; in fact, Calland had taken everything to his apartment so we couldn\u2019t peek. So since we had no idea what they\u2019d gotten, I\u2019d run to the store and picked up a few boxes of sparklers, some smoke bombs, and some poppers for the kids. Well, and for us girls, because we loved sparklers, too.</p><p>And we didn\u2019t care if that was pansy-assed or not.</p><p>I got up early and made a big batch of my Italian-ranch, bacon, cheddar pasta salad and a double batch of mini cherry cheesecakes. I also made some double dipped strawberries, which I hadn\u2019t made in a very long time. I dipped them in white chocolate and then dipped them in dark chocolate, but before I did that, I injected them with 100 proof vodka. Well, half of them, anyway. I left the other half virgin for Allie, Emma, and Jenna.</p><p>Brandon walked into the kitchen as I was putting the finishing touches on the cheesecakes and looked around at the counters.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, woman! We feeding the whole town?\u201d</p><p>I cut my eyes up at him as I spooned a dab of cherry pie filling onto a cheesecake. \u201cWell, feeding you guys is like feeding a town, so we have to be prepared.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me playfully and I kept going. \u201cYou should have seen Allie at the grocery store. She had to buy thirty packs of hot dogs just to make sure we had enough,\u2019 I said, tongue in cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, now that\u2019s just not right, exaggerating like that. You know we only need twenty-five,\u201d Brandon said with a grin.</p><p>I slapped at him with my free hand and replied, \u201cGet out of my kitchen and go get ready!\u201d</p><p>He went, stealing a cheesecake as he did, peeling it from the wrapper and popping it in his mouth before dropping a kiss on my shoulder and strolling out of the kitchen. I laughed as he started singing Yankee Doodle as he left the room.</p><p>An hour and a half later we were on our way to Allie\u2019s house, a bag with our bathing suits and beach towels on the back seat, surrounded by platters and bowls of goodies. We pulled up to see that Allie\u2019s grandparents were there already, holding court on the front porch. I could see Luke walking across the yard from their house carrying a huge crockpot. Emma followed, Everly strapped to her chest in a baby sling, her hands full of bags of chips and what looked like plates and all that good stuff. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I got out and raced to help her, taking the bags from her hands so she could pull the baby out of the sling and set her in Nanny\u2019s lap, who was waiting on the porch in the rocking chair, arms outstretched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already gotten to hold Liam and he needed his butt changed. That\u2019s his momma\u2019s duty. I put my time in all them damn years ago, so now I just get to do the spoilin\u2019. You go on in there. I\u2019ll holler if she needs something,\u201d she cackled.</p><p>Poppy, sitting in the other rocker beside her, nodded his head, but I couldn\u2019t tell if he was really nodding or just couldn\u2019t keep his head still while he rocked.</p><p>I took the bags inside, following Luke and the crockpot. I peeked inside it to see it was full of Emma\u2019s chili con queso, a delicious blend of cheese, green chilies, salsa, hamburger, sausage, and other yummy things that you dip Doritos in. Sure, you could use regular tortilla chips, but I definitely recommend the Doritos. The cheese kind, not that yucky ranch stuff.</p> <p>\u201cChloe, don\u2019t touch the con queso!\u201d I heard Emma yell from the porch.</p><p>I jumped back, even though I was no where near...okay, so I was near it, but I had no intention of popping open the bag of chips and digging in at that exact moment. Not really, anyway.</p><p>Okay, maybe a little one.</p><p>\u201cChloe!\u201d she yelled again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming,\u201d I grumbled, making my way back outside to start getting stuff out of Brandon\u2019s truck.</p> <p>He passed me coming in the door. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not, sunshine. You\u2019re barely breathing hard.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and moved past him out the door, choosing not to engage in that particular conversation.</p><p>We made short work of getting everything in the kitchen and put away where it needed to be until it was time to eat. We\u2019d all decided to eat around four, which gave us an hour beforehand to just hang out, swim, and whatever.</p><p>I grabbed my bag with my swimsuit in it and went to go change. Brandon, seeing me grab the bag, followed me into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, no funny business,\u201d I scolded him, laughing as I dodged his questing fingers.</p><p>He pouted playfully, kissed me, and then grabbed his trunks and left me alone in the bathroom. By the time I got done changing, wrapped a towel around me, and headed out to the pool area, he was already wet from being in the pool and was currently on the diving board, challenging Jarrod to a cannon ball competition.</p> <p>He surfaced after a mega splash that got him yelled at by Jan, Emma\u2019s mom, because she happened to be walking by the edge of the pool at that moment. He gave her a sheepish grin, but it didn\u2019t matter that he had done it about two seconds later because Calland nonchalantly walked by and shoved his mom in.</p><p>Clothes and all.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Calland!\u201d she hollered, wiping water from her eyes as she surfaced and waded towards the steps.</p><p>\u201cSon, if I were you, I\u2019d be moving pretty quickly,\u201d Ben, Emma\u2019s dad said.</p><p>Calland shot a look to his mom, who was now out of the pool and sidling up to him on the sly, and then shouted, \u201cOh, shit!\u201d before he took off running to the other side of the pool.</p><p>Jenna came out then and hollered at the kids to come in and get dried off for some reason, even though they\u2019d only been in it for about half an hour at that point. They pouted but complied, then giggled as they watched their uncle run from their grandma like his ass was on fire.</p><p>I laughed along with them, then dropped my towel, preparing to get in the water myself. I stepped up to the side of the deep end and jumped in, splashing Brandon, who was still treading water. I smiled at him when I came up, flipping my hair out of my eyes. He didn\u2019t smile back.</p><p>My smile faded. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked him quietly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you wearing, sunshine?\u201d he asked, his voice low, tone rough.</p><p>I clutched the edge of the pool and crossed my other arm across my chest self-consciously. I swallowed hard, beating myself up for wearing a two piece bikini that showed my scars. Without a word, I moved to swim toward the steps to get out, but stopped when a heavy arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me back against a muscular, tattooed chest.</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting out to change,\u201d I replied, very softly.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d He arched his hips into my ass below the water, deliberately brushing the hardened length of his erection against me. \u201cYou look fucking amazing in the suit, baby. How am I ever supposed to get out of the water?\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head, indicating that maybe I had jumped to a conclusion in haste. Unable to help myself, I pushed back into him, rubbing my ass against his hardness. He groaned low in my ear, his fingers biting into my hips. His lips brushed against the outer shell of my ear as he leaned close and whispered, \u201cYou do that again and I\u2019m jerking your ass out of the pool, tossing you in the car, taking you home, and fucking the shit out of you all night long.\u201d</p><p>I snorted quietly, my eyes gleaming as I turned my head to meet his gaze. \u201cYou call that a threat?\u201d</p><p>He growled and his fingers tightened once more, preparing to pick me up, I would presume, but stopped when a throat cleared at the edge where we were standing.</p><p>Allie stood there, tapping her toes, waiting on us to look at her. As soon as we did, she said, brightly, \u201cExcuse me, you two hornballs, but would you mind not humping in my pool? K, thanks, bye,\u201d before she spun on her heel and headed back inside.</p><p>Jackson, who had just come outside, cracked up, laughing until tears formed in his eyes.</p><p>I got out of the pool, leaving Brandon to cool himself off until he could exit the water without giving everyone an eyeful, muttering to my brother, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that funny, dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, yes it was,\u201d he chuckled, then grabbed my shoulders and turned so that I could see Nanny sitting in the shade of the umbrella on the other side, craning her neck to get a peek at Brandon\u2019s you-know-what in its upright position. Noticing that we were watching her, she waved and winked before yelling at Brandon, \u201cHey, hotstuff! Come give granny a kiss! Is that a hot dog in your pocket or you just happy to see me? She cackled uncontrollably while Brandon just shook his head and grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord. Nanny\u2019s a perv,\u201d I mumbled to Jacks, grabbing my towel and walking inside.</p><p>As I walked away, Jackson called out, \u201cYou hadn\u2019t figured that out yet?\u201d</p><p>I just laughed and kept walking.</p><p>After I changed, I headed into the kitchen to help set things up while Jackson and Luke got the grill going. Calland, after apologizing to his mom, finally, motioned Brandon out of the pool and they took off in Calland\u2019s car, going to get the fireworks.</p><p>When Emma asked him why he didn\u2019t just bring them when he came, Calland just sniffed, put his nose in the air, and said, haughtily, \u201cCause you nosy bitches would have peeked.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him and punched him in the arm, making him laugh and pretend he got stung by a bee.</p><p>They were back in half an hour. By then the tables were laden with food, the grill was in full force firing up hot dogs, burgers, and brats, and they smelled delicious. There was probably way too much food, but it was a party, so that\u2019s kind of a prerequisite, right?</p><p>We had my goodies, Emma\u2019s con queso, Allie had the grilling items, Jan had brought her homemade mac &amp; cheese, of course, and Jenna and Noah brought a veggie and dip tray, as well as cheeses, crackers, and snack meats. Calland, God love him, brought four gigantic bags of different flavored potato chips because he, and I quote, \u201cdon\u2019t fucking cook. You want ramen? I\u2019ll cook. Grilled cheese? We\u2019re good. Burgers or steak on the grill? Yup. But I\u2019m not cooking a goddamned thing, so here\u2019s some chips.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord help the woman who ever settles him down. She\u2019s gonna need it.</p><p>Leah finally showed up with a fruit tray and cream cheese fruit dip, and Nanny had brought her famous pineapple upside down cake, so the way I saw it, all of our bases were covered. We had appetizers, main courses, snacks, and dessert; add in the fireworks (that they were still hiding from us), and we got dinner and a show! (Oh, yeah...Allie\u2019s mom Daisy showed up with some brownies, but told us they were for her and her alone. Allie said we should just listen to her and leave them alone. We figured out why later.)</p><p>We all piled our plates high and stuffed ourselves while we all sat around the pool, or at random tables the guys had set out for everyone. I popped the last bite of cheesecake in my mouth and stood, throwing my plate away and making my way to Allie, who was trying to hold a squirming Liam while she finished eating.</p><p>I wiggled my fingers at her. \u201cHere, let me see my nephew.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hesitate, just handed him over and dug in to the huge mound of mac &amp; cheese she had on her plate. I just shook my head at her, laughing in remembrance of the mini-scuffle she and Emma had gotten in about who was going to get to the mac &amp; cheese first. Allie won, practically shoving Emma under the table to do so, but Emma retaliated by hiding the pan from everyone so no one else could get any.</p><p>Thankfully, that only lasted until Jan gave her that \u201cmom\u201d look that said put-it-back-or-you\u2019re-gonna-get-it. Miraculously, it ended up back on the table within seconds. In her defense, though, Jan\u2019s homemade mac &amp; cheese was the freakin\u2019 bomb!</p><p>I held Liam up in front of my face, nuzzling his little nose with mine and kissing his cheeks before cradling him in my arms and moving to a lounger in the shade. I settled him in my lap, propping my feet on the lounger so he was reclining against my legs, his head against them, facing me, with his butt on my stomach and feet on my chest.</p><p>I pretended to gnaw on his tiny toes, making him gurgle, smile, and chuckle, which made me grin and laugh. We sat and played like that for a little bit when Brandon joined us, pulling the other lounger close and sitting on it, facing me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, just watched me.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t look at him as I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d was his immediate response. \u201cJust watching you with one of the cutest little babies, ever.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him and smiled. \u201cHe is pretty cute, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...but I kinda like looking at his aunt, better. She\u2019s pretty fuckin\u2019 beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath, feeling the effects of his words race along every nerve ending in my body, but I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to get you home tonight, sunshine. Make some fireworks of our own, what do you say?\u201d His voice was low, intimate, and sent even more shivers over me.</p> <p>The baby cooed and babbled in my lap and I grinned at him. \u201cYour Uncle Brandon is a perv, too, Liam. Just like your nanny!\u201d I sing-songed, making him giggle.</p><p>Brandon snorted and then sniffed, turning his nose up. \u201cPhew. I think someone just left a load in his diaper.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled and lifted the baby\u2019s leg to peek up the leg of his shorts and diaper to see if he really needed changed, or was just gassy. It wasn\u2019t just gas.</p><p>Brandon stood, plucked the baby from my arms, and handed him off to Jackson, who just happened to be walking towards the house. \u201cHere. Your kid needs changed and my woman is about to be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d I asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Brandon nodded to confirm his words before he grabbed my hands, pulled me off of the lounger, and dragged me off the deck and around the house.</p><p>We didn\u2019t even get all the way around front when he stopped, put a hand against my stomach, and pushed me back against the house. He followed, his body pressing me firmly against the unyielding wall, sliding his hand off to the side and down my hip, gripping it and pulling me tight against him.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, what are you doing?\u201d I whispered, our breath mingling as he dipped his head toward me.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to kiss you and I wanted to do it properly without everyone watching. Got a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope...\u201d I barely got the word out. His lips were coming closer and closer, brushing mine as he said, \u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed me. Deep. Hot. Wet.</p><p>He kissed me until we were both gasping for air, and without realizing it, my arms had wound around his neck and his hands had lifted me into the air, cupping my ass as my legs had wrapped around his waist.</p><p>\u201cWow...\u201d I breathed, smiling at him a bit dazedly.</p><p>He snickered. \u201cYou can say that again, sunshine...you can say that again.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Calland came around the corner shouting, \u201cDude, quit humping your woman against her brother\u2019s house and let\u2019s go blow shit up!\u201d</p><p>Almost immediately we heard, \u201cWho\u2019s humping who against my house?\u201d and pounding footsteps as Allie ran headlong around the corner. She stopped when she saw us, eyes narrowing. \u201cYou two...\u201d</p><p>I waved. What else could I do? I was literally still backed against the house, wrapped around Brandon, and from the way things were pressed against me...nice, long, hard things, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be putting me down just yet.</p><p>She quit glaring at us and laughed, a wicked gleam flickering in her eyes. \u201cCome on, Chloe. Come help me clean things up so we can get ready for the sparklers and things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh...\u201d I hedged, looking at Brandon.</p><p>He winked and dropped my legs, kissing my lips one last time briefly before turning away and adjusting himself as he walked around the side of the house in the direction Calland had gone.</p><p>I walked up to Allie and she slung her arm around my neck, squeezing me to her. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u2018Of course!\u201d I replied, wrapping my arm around her waist to squeeze her back.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s get this shit done so we can party!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Friday morning dawned brilliantly bright.</p><p>Like...the fire of a thousand suns bright. Of course, it could be the four shots of tequila and two firecrackers I drank last night. The firecrackers were another contribution of Calland. I don\u2019t know where he got the idea, the recipe, whatever...they were good. But...they were baaaad.</p><p>Firecrackers are a mixed drink made with dark rum, sloe gin, orange juice, and 151. I don\u2019t remember the drive home. See? Bad.</p><p>I do, however, remember chasing Calland and Brandon around with sparklers (don\u2019t ask why, I don\u2019t remember), I remember Allie (sober, of course...not sure if that makes it better or worse) lighting a smoke bomb and pretending to disappear into the smoke, complete with magic words and everything. I remember the fireworks display that the guys put on and I do have to admit, it was pretty epic. It was equally epic that the cops didn\u2019t show up, because I think they had more fireworks than the actual township did for their legal display.</p><p>And most of all, I remember laughing my ass off at Nanny, who\u2019d gotten into Daisy\u2019s brownies and eaten almost half of one before Daisy caught her. Did I mention they were POT brownies? Nanny got pretty loopy and started flashing everyone, giggling like a school girl in the process. Though I must say, the funniest part was when Allie had yelled, \u201cNanny! No one wants to see your little fried eggs! Put \u2018em away!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rolled over, my hand reaching for Brandon, but encountering empty sheets. I sat up, my hand going to my head immediately. Oy. Damn that hurt.</p><p>The bedroom door pushed open and Brandon came in holding a tray. \u201cHey, sunshine!\u201d he called, brightly.</p><p>I squinted and groaned. \u201cHeadache, babe. Please...\u201d I whined.</p><p>He chuckled and came to the side of the bed. \u201cScoot up so I can put the tray down.\u201d</p> <p>I complied, breathing in the scent of fresh coffee and buttered toast. I looked at the tray and discovered a cup of coffee, toast, scrambled eggs with cheese, a glass of ice water, and two Tylenol.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm...\u201d I sighed, sipping the rich, hot coffee and then inhaling it like the nectar of the Gods it was. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Brandon came around the bed and laid beside me, propping himself up on his elbow. \u201cHow are you feeling this morning?\u201d he asked. I could hear the mirth in his words.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him and picked up a triangle of toast, loaded a spoonful of eggs on it, and bit in. I chewed thoughtfully for a minute and then answered. \u201cI don\u2019t remember getting home. Everything before that, I\u2019m good. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember the drive home?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cSure about that, sunshine?\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed the Tylenol and downed most of the water before I continued eating while I racked my brain, trying to remember. I finally gave up and shrugged. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Brandon reached over and stole a piece of my toast, biting into it as he said, \u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, hmm?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He made another noncommittal noise in his throat and continued eating my toast. When he was done he said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I figured you would remember the festivities in the truck on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFestivities? What the hell are you--\u201d I paused, thinking hard. \u201cOh, shit! I totally gave you road head!\u201d I crowed, my jaw dropping in shock.</p><p>\u201cNow she remembers,\u201d Brandon said exasperatedly. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m pretty sure that the truck driver we passed gave me a thumbs up.\u201d He winked at me.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God...\u201d I groaned, closing my eyes in mortification.</p><p>The bed shook with Brandon\u2019s silent laughter, which turned into loud laughter when I gave him a wry look. I finished eating without saying another word. It\u2019s not that I was embarrassed that I did that...seriously, I do that for him all the time. But the fact that I did it shit faced and someone saw me do it? Oy.</p><p>Brandon laid beside me, fingers lazily tracing random patterns on my hip while I finished my coffee. That done, he jumped up, took the tray from me, kissed my forehead and ordered me to get dressed while he cleaned up.</p><p>Feeling marginally better, I took a quick shower, threw on some clothes, and padded barefoot into the living room to see what Brandon was doing. He met me in the hallway, wrapping his arms around me and kissing me deeply.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a proper good morning,\u201d he murmured against my lips.</p><p>I smiled and kissed him again, finally breaking the kiss to snuggle into his arms. I felt his chest rumble when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cLuke and I aren\u2019t going to be that busy today. Why don\u2019t you just stay home?\u201d</p><p>I tipped my head back and looked at him. \u201cWhy? You trying to get rid of me?\u201d I asked playfully.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cMy other girlfriend is coming in today, so I figured I\u2019d keep you two apart.\u201d</p><p>I growled at him and smacked his chest, smiling as he chuckled and hugged me tight to him again. \u201cMaybe I will stay home today,\u201d I replied. \u201cMight think of a surprise for you or something. You know, something I\u2019ll actually remember?\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened reflexively. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder and pulled away from him, putting a little extra sway in my hips as I walked into the kitchen, leaving him standing in the hall. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I grinned to myself and danced on the inside when I heard him swear under his breath as he stomped down the hall to the bedroom to get ready. I started to pop another k-cup into my machine when the doorbell rang.</p><p>I glanced at the clock, noticing that it was only quarter after eight as I went to open it. Brandon was coming down the hallway, looking at his watch as he did. \u201cWho the hell is coming over this early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I opened the door and gasped, hitting my knees as the room spun and started to go dark.</p><p>\u201cMother fucker!\u201d</p><p>I heard Brandon curse, but his voice was distant, seeming to get farther and farther away as he called my name and then...nothing. The darkness swallowed me down.</p><p>A hand shaking me woke me up. I didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but as soon as consciousness hit me, a scream worked its way up my throat, piercing the air around me before my eyes even opened.</p><p>I struggled against the hands touching me, fighting against memories, against the panic, against the pain. Brandon\u2019s voice finally cut through the terror coursing through me and my gaze landed on him, my hands latching onto his shoulders as he shook me gently, his hands gripping my upper arms, trying to calm me down.</p><p>\u201cNO! No, no, no, no, no...\u201d I was mumbling, my whole body shivering on the floor.</p><p>\u201cBaby, listen. Calm down. It\u2019s okay, I promise. Shhh...shhh...\u201d Brandon soothed, bending his face down close to mine, pressing his lips to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI saw-\u201d</p><p>He cut me off. \u201cChloe, listen to me. I know what you saw. But it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not what you think. I need you to sit up; there\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let him help me up, my head swiveling to take in the stranger sitting on my couch. Except, he was no stranger. Not really. He couldn\u2019t be...because he looked just like Greg.</p><p>But Greg was dead. Right?</p><p>He lifted a hand and gave a small wave. \u201cHey, Chloe. I know this must come as quite a shock, but I\u2019m Gage. Greg\u2019s twin brother, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve deduced by now.\u201d</p><p>Brandon reached his hand down to me and I took it, allowing him to pull me to my feet. He helped me over to the chair, my legs barely steady enough to support me, as I stared at Gage.</p><p>\u201cI...I thought...\u201d I hedged, uncertainly.</p><p>He nodded slightly. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry for that; I really am. I didn\u2019t know how else to do this so I just hopped on the plane, rented a car, and, well, here I am. Showing up at your door very early on a Friday morning to scare the living daylights out of you.\u201d He sighed and shook his head ruefully.</p><p>I clasped my hands together in my lap and took a deep breath. \u201cSo why are you here? No offense to you, but I didn\u2019t know he even had a twin. He mentioned a brother when I first met him, but said your parents were dead and that he didn\u2019t talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents are very much alive and extremely horrified by what transpired with Gregory. As for he and I, we hadn\u2019t spoken in quite a while because I didn\u2019t much care for things he was getting involved in.\u201d He blew out a breath, looked like he was steadying himself. \u201cI know there\u2019s no way to atone for what you went through. But please, accept my deepest and sincerest apologies, and that of my parents.\u201d</p><p>He stood and pulled something out of his pocket. He moved closer to me, stopping when I backed away instinctively, but reached out his hand for me to take what he had. I opened the long rectangle of paper, musing that it almost looked like a check, before I gasped and dropped the paper to the floor in front of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked, my voice shaking. \u201cYou think you can buy me? You think I want your blood money, is that what you came all this way for?\u201d My voice was rising, anger evident in every syllable I uttered.</p><p>Brandon moved to my side, his hand cupping my shoulder in a supportive, but calming, gesture.</p><p>Gage was shaking his head vigorously, beseeching me with his eyes to just give him a chance, to listen to what he had to say. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t wish to offend you, nor do I wish to insult you in any way. Neither do my parents. That money is the total of Greg\u2019s estate. He left it to me with very explicit instructions that you were not to receive a penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no use for the money, Chloe. Neither do my parents. But what I do intend with this gesture is to blatantly disregard my brother\u2019s wishes as he so blatantly disregarded your life and that of your child.\u201d</p><p>I flinched at this.</p><p>\u201cI apologize once again, but we were made aware of the total situation just recently. I hope he spins in his grave for all eternity because of what I\u2019m doing, and that he burns in hell for what he did to you. We want you to have this to do with as you please. We are hoping that you will use it for yourself, to make sure that you are provided for, for the rest of your life. If not, donate it, tear it up, burn it. I do not care.\u201d He moved to the door.</p><p>\u201cIt seems odd, me showing up here out of the blue and dropping a load of money in your lap, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded, completely confused by everything about this whole situation.</p> <p>\u201cI assure you, it\u2019s odd for me, too. But there was no way in hell I was abiding by my brother\u2019s wishes and there was nothing more that pleased me than to deliver his money to you personally with my deepest apologies, and those of my parents.\u201d He laid a card on the table by the door. \u201cIf you ever need anything, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d He inclined his head to me. \u201cI know you won\u2019t. It also seems like you\u2019re very well cared for and loved by this gentleman. That\u2019s good to know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, sharply, and then left, striding out the door without another word or a backward glance.</p><p>I looked up at Brandon, so totally perplexed it wasn\u2019t funny. \u201cDid...uh, did that just happen?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It sure did. At least I think so.\u201d He stooped to pick up the check from the carpet. \u201cHoly shit! Did you see this?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I really didn\u2019t look at it. I just saw that it was a check and dropped it. I don\u2019t want his money. It feels dirty to me, like they\u2019re paying me blood money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe, look at this,\u201d Brandon said, holding the check in front of my face.</p> <p>I glanced at it, did a double take, and then felt my eyes bug out of my head. \u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d I said breathlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s...that a five and one, two, three, four, five, six...six fucking zeros! That\u2019s...that\u2019s...I need to sit down.\u201d</p><p>Brandon chuckled. \u201cSunshine, you are sitting down.\u201d</p><p>I sat there dazed for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Brandon whispered back. He met my eyes, his gaze steady. His fingers shifted on the thin sheet of paper, poising to tear it up.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I stopped him. \u201cJust put it up for now. I can\u2019t just waste what could help so many other people who might need it. And that\u2019s something that he would have hated.\u201d</p><p>Brandon kissed my head and moved down the hallway. I don\u2019t know where he put the check, but it was gone from his hand when he returned. \u201cCome on, baby. I\u2019ve got to get to the shop and you\u2019re coming with me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no, I\u2019m fine. I actually have something I wanted to do today, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And when did that come about?\u201d he teased me.</p> <p>I let my smile shine. \u201cWhen you decided to let me stay home today and I told you I might have a surprise for you,\u201d I replied with a sassy wink.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d was all he said before he finished getting ready, kissed me goodbye, and left for work.</p><p>As soon as he was gone, I picked up the phone and called my mom, just needing to hear her voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie!\u201d she said happily when she answered. \u201cI was just thinking about you. How was your fourth party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. It was good. Missed you, though. Wish you would have just flown in and spent a couple of weeks with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe Jane, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, her voice sharp with worry.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Mom, can\u2019t a daughter just call her mother without there being a reason?\u201d I said it jokingly, but I know she didn\u2019t buy it. She confirmed it a second later.</p><p>\u201cNot really, Chloe, because I can hear it in your voice. Something\u2019s wrong. Now spill.\u201d</p><p>So I did. I laid everything from the last forty-five minutes out for her, ending with, \u201cI have no idea what to do.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a while before she said, \u201cWell, honey, you have to do whatever you think is best. It\u2019s a lot of money. We\u2019ve always been pretty fortunate and I never raised you kids to be materialistic, but that would make you comfortable for the rest of your life, if you did it right. On the other hand, I completely feel you about the whole not wanting anything from him thing. I\u2019d feel the same way. So, it\u2019s up to you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Mom, I just...\u201d I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want his money. But I can\u2019t just let it sit there and go to waste when it could help so many others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about donating it, then, to a charity or program that helps battered women and children?\u201d my mom said softly.</p><p>That idea struck me silent, surprised that I didn\u2019t think of it myself. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Mom. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. If I could help them have the resources they need to help just one woman, even, it would be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would. And I\u2019m proud of you, honey. You\u2019re a strong woman and I admire you greatly and I love you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strong because you taught me to be that way, Mom. I wasn\u2019t as strong as I should have been back then, but...anyway. It doesn\u2019t matter now. I love you, too, Mom.\u201d I said, feeling emotion clog my throat.</p><p>I heard a small sniff come across the line and laughed. \u201cKnock it off, ya big cry baby!\u201d I said, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>She laughed, too, just like I intended, and I felt much lighter than I did when I called her. \u201cBy the way,\u201d she began. \u201cI was going to call you today, anyway. You and Jackson both, actually. Guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, chicken butt?\u201d I said seriously, calling up an old joke.</p><p>\u201cGuess why?\u201d she said, playing along.</p><p>\u201cChicken thigh,\u201d I continued, giggling the same way I used to when I was younger.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Game\u2019s over. I can\u2019t wait anymore!\u201d she cried before yelling, \u201cI sold the house and already put a down payment on a place out by Jan and Ben!\u201d</p><p>I shrieked, literally jumping up and down around the living room. God knows if Brandon would have been home, he\u2019d have thought I was a lunatic for sure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome!\u201d I shouted, so excited to have my mom close again. I regretted the distance I put between us when I was with Greg, physically and emotionally, but then I couldn\u2019t really help it when I moved out here. But now, my family would be together again....just a little bit bigger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that was everything I ever dreamed of.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cChloe?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cChloe, sunshine, where are you?\u201d Brandon called.</p><p>I stayed still and quiet, waiting for him to find me. I heard the thud-thud of boots being dropped to the floor, so I knew that he\u2019d taken his shoes off. I heard the clink of his keys hitting the bowl on the table by the door. Then, finally, I heard soft footsteps coming down the hallway toward the bedroom, where I was waiting.</p><p>\u201cHey, do you want to go get some dinner or do something? Or are we staying in tonight?\u201d</p><p>His voice was right outside the door. I knew he was going to be surprised, even though I\u2019d warned him that I might have one for him when he got home. I also knew he wouldn\u2019t really be expecting this kind of surprise. And trust me, when he saw my surprise, even though it was only about four in the afternoon, we would definitely NOT be going anywhere.</p><p>He pushed open the door and I heard him suck in a loud breath, then let out a long, low whistle. \u201cFuck me...\u201d he groaned.</p><p>I let the corners of my mouth curve up slightly in a teasing smile. \u201cNo. Fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunshine...Christ you have no idea how fuckin\u2019 hot you look.\u201d</p><p>After my conversation with my mom, I\u2019d done a little shopping. Now I was kneeling at the foot of the bed, wearing an outfit that consisted of nothing more than a few strategically placed leather strips and lace panels. They revealed more than they concealed, but I knew it wasn\u2019t the outfit alone that had garnered that reaction from him.</p><p>No, it was probably the black satin blindfold I had tied around my eyes, my blond tresses pinned on top of my head in a haphazard knot so it wouldn\u2019t get tangled. It was probably, even more so, the padded leather cuffs I\u2019d snapped on my wrists, and the small array of items laid out on the bed behind me.</p><p>I\u2019d taken a drive down to Hustler and picked up a new bottle of warming lube; a slim, smooth, short, tapered vibrator; and a light weight riding crop. I knew what I was getting into, what I wanted him to do to me.</p><p>And I was shivering in anticipation of it.</p><p>I felt him move closer to me, his soft, quiet footsteps bringing him within touching range. But I didn\u2019t touch him. I could smell him, the warm, slightly musky, completely sexy and delicious scent of him, and I inhaled, breathing him in deeply.</p><p>I felt my pulse quicken at the rasp of a zipper. With the blindfold effectively cutting off my sight, my other senses were heightened, making this usually slight sound seem loud in the silence surrounding us. Every movement he made, every rustle of clothing, every jagged breath that left his lips stirred the stillness around me.</p><p>I could feel the anticipation like a living thing in the air, blanketing me until my skin tingled and my body vibrated; it was almost like having scuffed my feet across the carpet and gotten close to a metal surface afterward, that electrified sensation that comes before the shocking discharge.</p><p>I started as something soft touched my cheek, then lightly trailed across my lips. Unbidden, my lips parted and my tongue darted out, a low moan dragged from my throat as I tasted silky flesh and the unmistakable flavor that was Brandon before it was gone.</p><p>\u201cI think I like this surprise,\u201d he said, his voice gravelly and dark. \u201cWe playing by my rules, sunshine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d One word, whispered into the silence.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>I complied immediately, clasping my cuffed hands behind my back. He reached down and secured them together with the little metal clips hanging from them for that specific purpose. I felt him straighten again and the air stirred around me as he disrobed. I felt the small thump of his jeans hitting the carpet by my knees. I then heard the unmistakable sound of skin sliding on skin and gasped as I imagined him fisting himself, stroking the turgid length in front of me. The rough sigh of pleasure that sounded above my head confirmed it and my sex clenched in response.</p> <p>I felt his hand cup my cheek, his thumb caressing my skin before he hooked it into the corner of my mouth, gently forcing my lips open and sliding it inside over my tongue, tracing the slight saltiness of his skin over my taste buds. I closed my lips around it, sucking with firm pulls, letting my cheeks hollow with the movement.</p><p>He growled and curled his fingers around my chin, hooking his thumb inside my mouth and pressing down on my tongue, forcing my jaw open. He didn\u2019t hurt me; he was firm, a little rough, but in a good way. In a way that let me know he was in the moment with me, he was gonna give me what I wanted, let the darker side of him that I knew he had out to play.</p><p>\u201cOpen wide.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my jaw more as he moved his hand away, opening my mouth for the intrusion of his thickness. Moisture flooded my core and my mouth watered in anticipation. A moan worked past my lips as he slid the silken head against my bottom lip, leaving a trace of wetness behind that my tongue immediately sought.</p><p>\u201cYessss...\u201d he hissed as he followed my tongue, pushing the heated length of his hardness into the warmth of my mouth, stroking it against my tongue and lips in short, sharp thrusts. I worked to swallow around him, scraping him a bit with my teeth and I winced, thinking I\u2019d hurt him. I\u2019d used my teeth on him before, but not quite that hard.</p><p>\u201cChrist, that\u2019s good,\u201d he groaned. \u201cSuck me, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>I blinked in surprise behind the blindfold, then berated myself for being shocked. It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d bitten him or anything, but it was definitely enough to hurt him, I thought. Guess not. That turned things even warmer down below.</p><p>I closed my lips around him, leaning into him to take him deep. I felt the tip of him at the back of my throat and fought my gag reflex, pressing my tongue against the bottom of him as I breathed through my nose and swallowed. He jerked in my mouth, his hips thrusting helplessly as my throat muscles convulsed around him, massaging in counterpart to my suction.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s hands came up, one cradling my jaw, the other spearing into the knot of hair on top of my head as he pulled me back, sliding himself out of my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck your mouth, baby, okay?\u201d he asked, gruffly.</p><p>I nodded, my lips already parting to receive him once more. I groaned as he slid inside, smiling around his thickness as he swore under his breath again. He used his hands to guide me, once again gently hooking a thumb into the corner of my mouth to keep my jaw open as he began thrusting between my lips, sliding along my tongue with quick strokes.</p><p>I moaned at the feel of him, slick from my mouth, but also from the copious drops of moisture seeping from the tip, the taste lingering on my tongue making desire pool heavily between my thighs. He fucked my mouth roughly, all the while taking care not to hurt me. He grunted and groaned when his sensitive flesh scraped against my teeth, the slight edge of pain serving only to heighten his pleasure.</p><p>Finally, when his hips were moving rapidly, his thrusts becoming uneven and jerky, he thrust me away from him, depriving me of his release. I cried out and he shushed me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, I just wasn\u2019t ready to come yet. You okay? I wasn\u2019t too rough?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head immediately, though I did shift a little bit against the ache beginning to build in my knees and thighs from kneeling for so long on the floor. He must have noticed.</p><p>His hands reached down and gripped my waist, pulling me up off the floor and onto my feet in a fluid movement that only served to remind me of his strength. I loved it. I felt him reach behind me and unhook the cuffs, rubbing my hands to make sure I wasn\u2019t losing feeling in them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Brandon. I promise,\u201d I told him, leaning into the broad, muscular expanse of his chest. I kissed the naked skin of his chest because it was there, and because I could. His arms came around me and hugged me tightly to him. I could feel the hard length of him pressed against my stomach and my hand came up of its own volition, tracing my fingers over his hard stomach until I pushed between our bodies and encircled the hot thickness with my hand.</p><p>He sucked in a breath and released it on a whoosh before he pulled away, gently berating me. \u201cUh, uh, uh...all in good time. This is my surprise, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re playing by my rules?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cThen no touching. I\u2019m gonna cuff you again, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded once more.</p><p>I felt his lips lightly kiss each of my eyes through the blindfold, then touch briefly on the tip of my nose, before placing a gently kiss to my upturned lips. He grabbed me by the waist again and picked me up, tossing me carefully onto the bed. I rolled automatically, presenting him with my arms behind my back so he could hook the cuffs together again, but he only laughed under his breath and rolled me back over. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>He left the bed for a moment and I heard him rummaging through the drawer of my dresser, then a metallic clink. Then he was back on the bed with me and I heard the clicking noises of handcuffs being attached to the slatted bedframe behind me on either side. Once he\u2019d done that, he took each of my arms and attached the little hooks to the chain of the handcuffs, I would assume, because the hooks weren\u2019t large enough to go round the slats.</p> <p>That done, he traced his fingertips down each of my arms, leaving me gasping and squirming and finally, protesting and laughing when he got to my ticklish spots.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, no!\u201d I shouted shrilly, my voice still shaking with laughter.</p><p>I heard him chuckle and then murmur against my skin, \u201cOkay, okay...I won\u2019t.\u201d His lips touched mine sweetly and things turned serious again when mine parted and allowed his tongue to sweep inside to thrust and parry with mine, tasting and teasing each other, taking it deeper and deeper until we were desperate for each other.</p><p>His hands were all over me, sliding up and down my body, plucking at my nipples through the lace panels of the lingerie I wore. My back arched, my hands pulling at their bonds, my mouth wordlessly asking him for more.</p><p>\u201cAre you overly fond of this outfit?\u201d he asked me, his lips brushing against mine with every word.</p><p>\u201cI just...I just bought it today,\u201d I gasped as his fingers worked delicately over my breasts, flicking the already aching tips to almost painfully hard diamond points.</p> <p>He was up off the bed then, leaving me whimpering in his absence. He was back in a heartbeat though, his words brief and bitten out. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one,\u201d he growled, and then I felt something cool and sharp slide against my skin underneath the material. Suddenly, I was bare; he\u2019d cut the lingerie from me, the tattered remains of it falling down the sides of my body to lie on the bed.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re fucking gorgeous, sunshine. I love the way you look all spread out for me, your bare skin so soft and touchable...kissable.\u201d</p><p>I moaned at the ache twisting in my belly, the heavy curl of want, the sparking fire of need that raced along my skin at his words. My hips thrust toward him, asking for his touch, and I cursed the blindfold now, wanting to see him above me as he buried himself to the hilt inside my folds.</p><p>Like he knew my thoughts, the blindfold was wrenched away from my eyes and I blinked up into his face, his stormy eyes searching mine, blazing with a heat that left me breathless. He sat up and reached behind him, gathering up the items that were, miraculously, still lying on the bed despite my thrashing. He brought each of them up and held them in front of my face, lustful speculation creeping into his smile.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to turn you over, baby,\u201d he whispered, the words pebbling my skin instantly.</p><p>He unsnapped the leather cuffs and turned me, taking the time to move the handcuffs in closer together before snapping the leather cuffs back around my wrists, leaving me face down on the mattress, my hands circling the slats of the headboard, bound by the cuffs. He gripped my hips and pulled them up, my weight resting on my knees, cheek and forearms flat on the bed.</p><p>He spread my legs wider, his thumbs caressing the soft, damp folds between my thighs as he did. I jerked at his touch, wanting more, but he denied me.</p><p>Instead, he chuckled and moved away again. I turned my head a bit and watched him over my shoulder. His nostrils were flared, eyes flashing, and that gloriously hard part of him was jutting out from his hips, inducing another rush of wetness to my already swollen, glistening pink folds.</p> <p>Without warning, his hand swung and the supple leather tongue of the riding crop bit into the rounded globe of my ass, making me hiss at the sting. His hand was there, rubbing gently across the red mark, soothing it, before it was gone and the crop was back, stinging the other cheek this time.</p><p>Each strike was immediately smoothed, the same as he always did when he\u2019d spanked me with his hand. I loved it when he did that and this...well, this was like a velvet-edged sword, piercing my skin with sweet, sharp, stinging heat that dragged me deeper into subliminal bliss with every stroke. After five swats, each delivered perfunctorily to a new location each time, my ass was striped with small, quickly fading welts and I was wiggling uncontrollably, seeking relief from the aching pressure building and building in me.</p><p>Brandon stared down at his artwork, his eyes darkening even more, his jutting length twitching at the sight. \u201cI don\u2019t have the patience tonight to work you here,\u201d he said, softly, reaching out with his hand to press the pad of his thumb against the puckered hole peeking out from between my flushed rear cheeks.</p><p>I cried out at the feel of his hand on me, didn\u2019t matter where it was. My body was so tight, craving his touch so desperately it felt like my skin would split open without relief, and soon. He soothed me with gentle words and tender touches, stroking down the backs of my thighs with his fingers just seconds before I was bathed with his hot breath and then his mouth was there.</p><p>His hands moved to spread me open wider as his plunged his tongue into my slit from behind, lapping at my juices, sliding through the wet folds until he sucked the tiny pearl of my clit into his mouth, suckling with strong pulls that sent me crashing over the edge, straight into screaming, white hot, spine-tingling euphoria.</p><p>My hips bucked and twisted, riding out the waves of my release, but it never quite faded. It started building again almost immediately because Brandon was relentless with his mouth on my sex. He sucked at my clit, swirling his tongue around the sensitive nubbin until I was almost mindless before he licked into my entrance again, fucking me with his tongue until I came once more, shuddering and gasping as he lapped away every drop of warm honey that flooded my core.</p><p>There was no time for me to catch my breath, either, as he wrenched his mouth away, put one hand on the small of my back, dug his fingers in, and then slammed home, filling me with one hard, fluid movement. He was seated fully inside my wet, clenching heat, the swollen thickness of him stretching me almost painfully.</p><p>\u201cSo tight...\u201d he muttered, slipping out of me a little before sliding back inside. He did this several times, small, smooth thrusts that lessened the discomfort but built the ache returning full force between my thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled out almost all the way and I felt him shift a little before I felt liquid trickle over the puckered flesh he\u2019d pressed his thumb against earlier. \u201cI lied a little,\u201d he said breathlessly as he placed the tip of the vibrator against that entrance, \u201cI don\u2019t have the patience for you to take me, but you can take this.\u201d</p><p>I arched into him, pushing the tip of the vibrating toy just a bit deeper into the tight ring of muscle. \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d he moaned as he watched it disappear into my body, leaving only the thicker, knobby handle of it nestled between my cheeks. The pulsing of it sent waves of pleasure through me that shot sky high when Brandon started thrusting inside me again, his pelvis rocking the vibrator with every movement.</p><p>It was double nirvana until his hand slid over my hip and his fingers circled my clit, thereby taking it to a triple threat, a trifecta of ecstasy that brought me, screaming, lost in the throes of an orgasm so explosive that I lost my breath, my body spasming uncontrollably as wave after wave of unbridled rapture washed over me.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s thrusts became wild and his breathing erratic as he reached for release, finding it just seconds after mine, locking his hips tightly to mine as he came, pulsating as he filled me.</p> <p>It took a while for him to move, but it seemed like mere moments before everything (and everyone) was cleaned up, I was free, and we were snuggled together on top of the comforter, both still breathing like we\u2019d run a marathon.</p><p>\u201cThat...\u201d Brandon gasped, \u201cWas one hell of a surprise.\u201d</p><p>I could only nod and grin.</p><p>\u201cChloe?\u201d he asked, kissing my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou liked that riding crop.\u201d It was a statement, not a question.</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going shopping tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>My imagination went wild.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d was all I said.</p><p>Chapter 27</p> <p>Two Months Later</p><p>The moon is shining brightly</p><p>Over top your wee-bit head</p><p>So rest your eyes my little one</p><p>As Auntie tucks you into bed</p><p>Off to sleep now, off to dream</p><p>Snuggle in and hug me tight</p><p>I love you always and forever</p> <p>Go to sleep, little one, goodnight.</p><p>I finished singing the lullaby twice over as I stared down at a now sleeping Liam. I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up to see my brother smiling down at me. He reached down and took his sleeping son from my arms, kissing his forehead as he walked away to put him down for the night.</p><p>I stood and stretched, glancing out the French doors leading to the deck and the concrete apron of the pool beyond, where the usual suspects were before making my way out to join them. Allie was sitting on a lounger, laughing at something Emma had said. Luke was sitting on the lounger next to Allie\u2019s, but Emma was positioned between his legs, leaning back against his chest, his arms wrapped securely around her.</p><p>Everyone had been here today to celebrate Jarrod\u2019s birthday. He\u2019d turned nine and, knowing that Allie would never tell him no, had begged to have his birthday party at Allie and Jack\u2019s house so his friends could go swimming with him. Thankfully, that part had ended a couple of hours ago, leaving red plastic cups, paper plates, and pizza boxes scattered across every surface.</p><p>Jenna was exhausted, you could clearly tell. This pregnancy was doing a number on her. She\u2019d lamented long and hard about how easy both of her other pregnancies were compared to this one. She was sick pretty much all day, but had high hopes that her second trimester would be a little easier. Allie had commiserated with her since her early pregnancy with Liam hadn\u2019t been very pretty, either.</p><p>So we\u2019d cleaned up and sent them on their merry way, though I think Noah wanted to stay longer. I also think that\u2019s because they were letting five of Jarrod\u2019s friends sleep over and have a movie marathon and he, since he\u2019s the guy and not pregnant and hormonal, got to stay up and hang out with them. I\u2019m also pretty sure this was told to him in no uncertain terms.</p><p>Everly was asleep already in the pack-n-play in Liam\u2019s room, which is why her parents were free to snuggle and visit with friends. Allie had the baby monitor on the table beside her and was currently smiling as she listened to her husband, my brother, whisper to their son as he put him to bed.</p><p>Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that Allie and Jackson had finally gotten married? They took a weekend trip to Gatlinburg about three weeks ago and decided, while they were there, that they\u2019d get married. Turns out that it wasn\u2019t so much of a decide-while-you\u2019re-there-thing, but more of a planned-to-pretend-it-wasn\u2019t-planned thing. Allie\u2019s mom had cried because she didn\u2019t get to plan a perfect wedding for her daughter (which, by the way, was exactly the reason they decided to elope), and while the rest of us were disappointed we couldn\u2019t be there, we understood completely.</p><p>My mom, however sad she was that she missed it, actually applauded them for their decision. But that\u2019s because Daisy cornered her with some ideas for the wedding and they were...well, typical Daisy.</p><p>Leah and Ian had left a couple of hours ago to meet with Ian\u2019s parents for dinner. She\u2019d alluded to the fact that it was an invitation they couldn\u2019t refuse. Needless to say, she wasn\u2019t overly fond of Ian\u2019s parents, but she\u2019d been pretty tight-lipped about why. They were supposed to come back, though, and should be here any time.</p><p>Calland had just left, but he was headed down to Griff\u2019s to meet a group of his friends that he hadn\u2019t seen in a while. We\u2019d all been warned to keep our phones on just in case. When I asked why just in case, he\u2019d just shook his head and laughed.</p><p>Emma had rolled her eyes and commented, \u201cIt\u2019s just in case he gets a wild hair, does something stupid, and needs bail money. Or he just wants to drunk dial and needs to make sure his targets are available.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d gasped, looking at her in alarm. \u201cHe\u2019d really do something to get arrested?\u201d</p><p>Everyone in Emma\u2019s family had laughed and Jan had said, \u201cNo, honey, he wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a long running joke. We\u2019ll explain one day.\u201d</p><p>But now night was falling, the air was still warm, and I was surrounded by my closest friends, except for Leah. I looked around, smiling when my eyes came to rest on him.</p><p>Brandon. It\u2019d be safe to say that I\u2019ve fallen completely, irrevocably, and undeniably in love with that man. It\u2019d be safe to say because I\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s safer to say now. And it\u2019s even safer than that to say that the man loves me back with a passion that rivals any love story I\u2019ve ever read. I know this because he tells me all the time.</p><p>And because...I glanced down at the diamond winking in the dim light on my finger...he proposed. No, he didn\u2019t do it on bended knee (not his bended knees, anyway), and there were no flowery words and tears (I lied, I totally cried...but afterwards), because he\u2019d done it while I was straddling him where he sat on the couch, when he was buried deep inside me, making love to me. He\u2019d pulled my hand up, slid the ring on my finger, and nodded once, before he rocked my world. No words needed.</p><p>Not a story we can really tell anyone, but hey. It was perfect for me. (Wink wink) That had been the night that I\u2019d put in motion the plan I\u2019d made for the money Gage had dropped on me. I donated half of it to a couple different local charities that help battered women and children. The other half I kept, because I\u2019d been told by pretty much everyone that I would be nuts if I didn\u2019t have fun with at least a little of it. So I did. I sponsored a new football stadium for the high school, as well as some books that they needed but didn\u2019t have funding for. I also started college funds for Liam and Everly. See? Fun! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grinned back at me from the edge of the pool where he was leaning. \u201cCome on in, sunshine, the water\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, waggling his brows at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t, lover boy,\u201d Allie called from her chair. \u201cI know what happened last time you two were in my pool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I nearly got molested by your Nanny!\u201d Brandon yelled back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have liked it!\u201d a gravelly voice yelled out from the upstairs window.</p> <p>Every single one of us jumped and stared upwards to see Nanny\u2019s face, surrounded by a halo of frizzy hair, staring back down at us.</p><p>Jackson came outside laughing just then. Allie looked at him in confusion. \u201cI thought Nanny said good bye and left a couple hours ago?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe did say goodbye, but the only place she went was to the spare bedroom to take a nap. Poppy\u2019s up there, too. She just called me to tell me they\u2019re staying the night and we\u2019re to take them to Bob Evan\u2019s for breakfast in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called you from the house?\u201d Allie asked.</p><p>Jackson nodded again. \u201cYup. From your cell phone, too.\u201d</p> <p>Allie just sat there for a second before she jumped up in a panic. \u201cOhmigod, Jackson, my phone. My PHONE! She can\u2019t have my phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Allie, calm down, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything on there that...no. You\u2019ve gotta be fucking kidding me, right?\u201d Jackson said, dread lacing his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>Luke\u2019s shoulders were shaking behind her and I could hear Brandon laughing as well. I guess we were a little slower on the uptake but it all crystallized pretty quickly.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit the bed, Fred! Nice wanker, Jacks! Poppy, look here, Allie\u2019s got herself a biggun\u2019!\u201d Nanny hollered.</p><p>Allie groaned, Jackson snickered.</p> <p>Brandon, being Brandon, yelled back, \u201cHey, Nanny!\u201d</p><p>She popped her head back out the window. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, hotstuff?\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cMine\u2019s bigger.\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, she winked back. \u201cNah, you\u2019re pretty even. I was hiding in the shower when you changed.\u201d</p><p>I busted out laughing when Brandon started sputtering and Allie shrieked, \u201cNANNY! OH MY GOD!\u201d</p><p>Yep.
