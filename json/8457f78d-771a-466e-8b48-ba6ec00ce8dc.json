DON\u2019T PANIC. DON\u2019T panic. It\u2019s only a VISA bill. It\u2019s a piece of paper; a few numbers. I mean, just how scary can a few numbers be?</p><p>I stare out of the office window at a bus driving down Oxford Street, willing myself to open the white envelope sitting on my cluttered desk. It\u2019s only a piece of paper, I tell myself for the thousandth time. And I\u2019m not stupid, am I? I know exactly how much this VISA bill will be.</p><p>Sort of. Roughly.</p> <p>It\u2019ll be about. . \u00a3200. Three hundred, maybe. Yes, maybe \u00a3300. Three-fifty, max.</p><p>I casually close my eyes and start to tot up. There was that suit in Jigsaw. And there was dinner with Suze at Quaglinos. And there was that gorgeous red and yellow rug. The rug was \u00a3200, come to think of it. But it was definitely worth every penny \u2014 everyone\u2019s admired it. Or, at least, Suze has.</p><p>And the Jigsaw suit was on sale\u201430 percent off. So that was actually saving money.</p><p>I open my eyes and reach for the bill. As my fingers hit the paper I remember new contact lenses. Ninety-five pounds. Quite a lot. But, I mean, I had to get those, didn\u2019t I? What am I supposed to do, walk around in a blur?</p><p>And I had to buy some new solutions and a cute case and some hypoallergenic eyeliner. So that takes it up to. . \u00a3400?</p> <p>At the desk next to mine, Clare Edwards looks up from her post. She\u2019s sorting all her letters into neat piles, just like she does every morning. She puts rubber bands round them and puts labels on them saying things like \u201cAnswer immediately\u201d and \u201cNot urgent but respond.\u201d I loathe Clare Edwards.</p><p>\u201cOK, Becky?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cJust reading a letter.\u201d</p><p>I reach gaily into the envelope, but my fingers don\u2019t quite pull out the bill. They remain clutched around it while my mind is seized \u2014 as it is every month \u2014 by my secret dream.</p><p>Do you want to know about my secret dream? It\u2019s based on a story I once read in The Daily World about a mix-up at a bank. I loved this story so much, I cut it out and stuck it onto my wardrobe door. Two credit card bills were sent to the wrong people, and \u2014 get this \u2014 each person paid the wrong bill without realizing. They paid off each other\u2019s bills without even checking them.</p><p>And ever since I read that story, my secret fantasy has been that the same thing will happen to me. I mean, I know it sounds unlikely \u2014 but if it happened once, it can happen again, can\u2019t it? Some dotty old woman in Cornwall will be sent my humongous bill and will pay it without even looking at it. And I\u2019ll be sent her bill for three tins of cat food at fifty-nine pence each. Which, naturally, I\u2019ll pay without question. Fair\u2019s fair, after all.</p> <p>A smile is plastered over my face as I gaze out of the window. I\u2019m convinced that this month it\u2019ll happen \u2014 my secret dream is about to come true. But when I eventually pull the bill out of the envelope \u2014 goaded by Clare\u2019s curious gaze \u2014 my smile falters, then disappears. Something hot is blocking my throat. I think it could be panic.</p><p>The page is black with type. A series of familiar names rushes past my eyes like a mini shopping mall. I try to take them in, but they\u2019re moving too fast. Thorntons, I manage to glimpse. Thorntons Chocolates? What was I doing in Thorntons Chocolates? I\u2019m supposed to be on a diet. This bill can\u2019t be right. This can\u2019t be me. I can\u2019t possibly have spent all this money.</p><p>Don\u2019t panic! I yell internally. The key is not to panic. Just read each entry slowly, one by one. I take a deep breath and force myself to focus calmly, starting at the top. WH Smith (well, that\u2019s OK. Everyone needs stationery.)Boots (everyone needs shampoo)Specsavers (essential)Oddbins (bottle of wine \u2014 essential)Our Price (Our Price? Oh yes. The new Charlatans album. Well, I had to have that, didn\u2019t I?)Bella Pasta (supper with Caitlin)Oddbins (bottle of wine \u2014 essential)Esso (petrol doesn\u2019t count)Quaglinos (expensive \u2014 but it was a one-off)Pret \u00e0 Manger (that time I ran out of cash)Oddbins (bottle of wine \u2014 essential)Rugs to Riches (what? Oh yes. Stupid rug.)La Senza (sexy underwear for date with James)Agent Provocateur (even sexier underwear for date with James. Like I needed it.)Body Shop (that skin brusher thing which I must use)Next (fairly boring white shirt \u2014 but it was in the sale)Millets. .</p><p>I stop in my tracks. Millets? I never go into Millets. What would I be doing in Millets? I stare at the statement in puzzlement, wrinkling my brow and trying to think \u2014 and then suddenly, the truth dawns on me. It\u2019s obvious. Someone else has been using my card.</p><p>Oh my God. I, Rebecca Bloomwood, have been the victim of a crime.</p><p>Now it all makes sense. Some criminal\u2019s pinched my credit card and forged my signature. Who knows where else they\u2019ve used it? No wonder my statement\u2019s so black with figures! Someone\u2019s gone on a spending spree round London with my card \u2014 and they thought they would just get away with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how? I scrabble in my bag for my purse, open it \u2014 and there\u2019s my VISA card, staring up at me. I take it out and run my fingers over the glossy surface. Someone must have pinched it from my purse, used it \u2014 and then put it back. It must be someone I know. Oh my God. Who?</p><p>I look suspiciously round the office. Whoever it is, isn\u2019t very bright. Using my card at Millets! It\u2019s almost laughable. As if I\u2019d ever shop there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even been into Millets!\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>\u201cYes you have,\u201d says Clare.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turn to her. \u201cNo I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought Michael\u2019s leaving present from Millets, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I feel my smile disappear. Oh, bugger. Of course. The blue anorak for Michael. The blue sodding anorak from Millets.</p><p>When Michael, our deputy editor, left three weeks ago, I volunteered to buy his present. I took the brown envelope full of coins and notes into the shop and picked out an anorak (take it from me, he\u2019s that kind of guy). And at the last minute, now I remember, I decided to pay on credit and keep all that handy cash for myself.</p><p>I can vividly remember fishing out the four \u00a35 notes and carefully putting them in my wallet, sorting out the pound coins and putting them in my coin compartment, and pouring the rest of the change into the bottom of my bag. Oh good, I remember thinking. I won\u2019t have to go to the cash machine. I\u2019d thought that sixty quid would last me for weeks.</p> <p>So what happened to it? I can\u2019t have just spent sixty quid without realizing it, can I?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking, anyway?\u201d says Clare, and she leans forward. I can see her beady little X-ray eyes gleaming behind her specs. She knows I\u2019m looking at my VISA bill. \u201cNo reason,\u201d I say, briskly turning to the second page of my statement.</p><p>But I\u2019ve been put off my stride. Instead of doing what I normally do \u2014 look at the minimum payment required and ignore the total completely \u2014 I find myself staring straight at the bottom figure.</p><p>Nine hundred and forty-nine pounds, sixty-three pence. In clear black and white.</p><p>For thirty seconds I am completely motionless. Then, without changing expression, I stuff the bill back into the envelope. I honestly feel as though this piece of paper has nothing to do with me. Perhaps, if I carelessly let it drop down on the floor behind my computer, it will disappear. The cleaners will sweep it up and I can claim I never got it. They can\u2019t charge me for a bill I never received, can they?</p><p>I\u2019m already composing a letter in my head. \u201cDear Managing Director of VISA. Your letter has confused me. What bill are you talking about, precisely? I never received any bill from your company. I did not care for your tone and should warn you, I am writing to Anne Robinson of Watchdog.\u201d</p> <p>Or I could always move abroad.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d My head jerks up and I see Clare holding this month\u2019s news list. \u201cHave you finished the piece on Lloyds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly,\u201d I lie. As she\u2019s watching me, I feel forced to summon it up on my computer screen, just to show I\u2019m willing.</p><p>\u201cThis high-yield, 60-day access account offers tiered rates of interest on investments of over \u00a32,000,\u201d I type onto the screen, copying directly from a press release in front of me. \u201cLong-term savers may also be interested in a new stepped-rate bond which requires a minimum of \u00a35,000.\u201d</p><p>I type a full stop, take a sip of coffee, and turn to the second page of the press release.</p><p>This is what I do, by the way. I\u2019m a journalist on a financial magazine. I\u2019m paid to tell other people how to organize their money.</p><p>Of course, being a financial journalist is not the career I always wanted. No one who writes about personal finance ever meant to do it. People tell you they \u201cfell into\u201d personal finance. They\u2019re lying. What they mean is they couldn\u2019t get a job writing about anything more interesting. They mean they applied for jobs at The Times and The Express and Marie-Claire and Vogue and GQ, and all they got back was \u201cPiss off.\u201d</p><p>So they started applying to Metalwork Monthly and Cheesemakers Gazette and What Investment Plan? And they were taken on as the crappiest editorial assistant possible on no money whatsoever and were grateful. And they\u2019ve stayed on writing about metal, or cheese, or savings, ever since \u2014 because that\u2019s all they know. I myself started on the catchily titled Personal Investment Periodical. I learned how to copy out a press release and nod at press conferences and ask questions that sounded as though I knew what I was talking about. After a year and a half \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 I was head-hunted to Successful Saving.</p> <p>Of course, I still know nothing about finance. People at the bus stop know more about finance than me. Schoolchildren know more than me. I\u2019ve been doing this job for three years now, and I\u2019m still expecting someone to catch me out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That afternoon, Philip, the editor, calls my name, and I jump in fright.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d he says. \u201cA word.\u201d And he beckons me over to his desk. His voice seems lower all of a sudden, almost conspiratorial, and he\u2019s smiling at me, as though he\u2019s about to give me a piece of good news.</p><p>Promotion, I think. It must be. He read the piece I wrote on international equity securities last week (in which I likened the hunt for long-term growth to the hunt for the perfect pair of summer mules) and was bowled over by how exciting I made it all sound. He knows it\u2019s unfair I earn less than Clare, so he\u2019s going to promote me to her level. Or even above. And he\u2019s telling me discreetly so Clare won\u2019t get jealous.</p><p>A wide smile plasters itself over my face and I get up and walk the three yards or so to his desk, trying to stay calm but already planning what I\u2019ll buy with my raise. I\u2019ll get that swirly coat in Whistles. And some black high-heeled boots from Pied \u00e0 Terre. Maybe I\u2019ll go on holiday. And I\u2019ll pay off that blasted VISA bill once and for all. I feel buoyant with relief. I knew everything would be OK. .</p> <p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d He\u2019s thrusting a card at me. \u201cI can\u2019t make this press conference,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it could be quite interesting. Will you go? It\u2019s at Brandon Communications.\u201d</p><p>I can feel the elated expression falling off my face like jelly. He\u2019s not promoting me. I\u2019m not getting a raise. I feel betrayed. Why did he smile at me like that? He must have known he was lifting my hopes.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d inquires Philip.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I mutter. But I can\u2019t bring myself to smile. In front of me, my new swirly coat and high-heeled boots are disappearing into a puddle, like the Wicked Witch of the West. No promotion. Just a press conference about. . I turn over the card. About a new unit trust. How could anyone possibly describe that as interesting?</p><p>Two</p> <p>THERE\u2019S JUST ONE ESSENTIAL purchase I have to make on the way to the press conference \u2014 and that\u2019s the Financial Times. The FT is by far the best accessory a girl can have. Its major advantages are: 1. It\u2019s a nice color.2. It only costs eighty-five pence.3. If you walk into a room with it tucked under your arm, people take you seriously. With an FT under your arm, you can talk about the most frivolous things in the world, and instead of thinking you\u2019re an airhead, people think you\u2019re a heavyweight intellectual who has broader interests, too.</p><p>At my interview for Successful Saving, I went in holding copies of the Financial Times and the Investor\u2019s Chronicle \u2014 and I didn\u2019t get asked about finance once. As I remember it, we spent the whole time talking about holiday villas and gossiping about other editors.</p><p>So I stop at a newsstand and buy a copy of the FT. There\u2019s some huge headline about Rutland Bank on the front page, and I\u2019m thinking maybe I should at least skim it, when I catch my reflection in the window of Denny and George.</p><p>I don\u2019t look bad, I think. I\u2019m wearing my black skirt from French Connection, and a plain white T-shirt from Knickerbox, and a little angora cardigan which I got from M&amp;S but looks like it might be Agn\u00e8s b. And my new square-toed shoes from Hobbs. Even better, although no one can see them, I know that underneath I\u2019m wearing my gorgeous new matching knickers and bra with embroidered yellow rosebuds. They\u2019re the best bit of my entire outfit. In fact, I almost wish I could be run over so that the world would see them.</p><p>It\u2019s a habit of mine, itemizing all the clothes I\u2019m wearing, as though for a fashion page. I\u2019ve been doing it for years \u2014 ever since I used to read Just Seventeen. Every issue, they\u2019d stop a girl on the street, take a picture of her, and list all her clothes. \u201cT-Shirt: Chelsea Girl, Jeans: Top Shop, Shoes: borrowed from friend.\u201d I used to read those lists avidly, and to this day, if I buy something from a shop that\u2019s a bit uncool, I cut the label out. So that if I\u2019m ever stopped in the street, I can pretend I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from.</p><p>So anyway. There I am, with the FT tucked under my arm, thinking I look pretty good, and half wishing someone from Just Seventeen would pop up with a camera \u2014 when suddenly my eyes focus and snap to attention, and my heart stops. In the window of Denny and George is a discreet sign. It\u2019s dark green with cream lettering, and it says: sale.</p> <p>I stare at it, and my skin\u2019s all prickly. It can\u2019t be true. Denny and George can\u2019t be having a sale. They never have a sale. Their scarves and pashminas are so coveted, they could probably sell them at twice the price. Everyone I know in the entire world aspires to owning a Denny and George scarf. (Except my mum and dad, obviously. My mum thinks if you can\u2019t buy it at Bentalls of Kingston, you don\u2019t need it.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallow, take a couple of steps forward, then push open the door of the tiny shop. The door pings, and the nice blond girl who works there looks up. I don\u2019t know her name but I\u2019ve always liked her. Unlike some snotty cows in clothes shops, she doesn\u2019t mind if you stand for ages staring at clothes you really can\u2019t afford to buy. Usually what happens is, I spend half an hour lusting after scarves in Denny and George, then go off to Accessorize and buy something to cheer myself up. I\u2019ve got a whole drawerful of Denny and George substitutes.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, trying to stay calm. \u201cYou\u2019re. . you\u2019re having a sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The blond girl smiles. \u201cBit unusual for us.\u201d</p><p>My eyes sweep the room. I can see rows of scarves, neatly folded, with dark green \u201c50 percent off\u201d signs above them. Printed velvet, beaded silk, embroidered cashmere, all with the distinctive \u201cDenny and George\u201d signature. They\u2019re everywhere. I don\u2019t know where to start. I think I\u2019m having a panic attack.</p> <p>\u201cYou always liked this one, I think,\u201d says the nice blond girl, taking out a shimmering gray-blue scarf from the pile in front of her.</p><p>Oh God, yes. I remember this one. It\u2019s made of silky velvet, overprinted in a paler blue and dotted with iridescent beads. As I stare at it, I can feel little invisible strings, silently tugging me toward it. I have to touch it. I have to wear it. It\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. The girl looks at the label. \u201cReduced from \u00a3340 to \u00a3120.\u201d She comes and drapes the scarf around my neck and I gape at my reflection.</p><p>There is no question. I have to have this scarf. I have to have it. It makes my eyes look bigger, it makes my haircut look more expensive, it makes me look like a different person. I\u2019ll be able to wear it with everything. People will refer to me as the Girl in the Denny and George Scarf.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d snap it up if I were you.\u201d The girl smiles at me. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of these left.\u201d</p><p>Involuntarily, I clutch at it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it,\u201d I gasp. \u201cI\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019s laying it out on tissue paper, I take out my purse, open it up, and reach for my VISA card in one seamless, automatic action \u2014 but my fingers hit bare leather. I stop in surprise and start to rummage through all the pockets of my purse, wondering if I stuffed my card back in somewhere with a receipt or if it\u2019s hidden underneath a business card. . And then, with a sickening thud, I remember. It\u2019s on my desk.</p><p>How could I have been so stupid? How could I have left my VISA card on my desk? What was I thinking?</p><p>The nice blond girl is putting the wrapped scarf into a dark green Denny and George box. My mouth is dry with panic. What am I going to do?</p><p>\u201cHow would you like to pay?\u201d she says pleasantly.</p><p>My face flames red and I swallow hard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just realized I\u2019ve left my credit card at the office,\u201d I stutter.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says the girl, and her hands pause.</p><p>\u201cCan you hold it for me?\u201d The girl looks dubious.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow?\u201d I say desperately. Oh God. She\u2019s pulling a face. Doesn\u2019t she understand?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to reserve sale stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust until later this afternoon, then,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cWhat time do you close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p> <p>Six! I feel a combination of relief and adrenaline sweeping through me. Challenge, Rebecca. I\u2019ll go to the press conference, leave as soon as I can, then take a taxi back to the office. I\u2019ll grab my VISA card, tell Philip I left my notebook behind, come here, and buy the scarf.</p><p>\u201cCan you hold it until then?\u201d I say beseechingly. \u201cPlease? Please?\u201d The girl relents.</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll put it behind the counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I gasp. I hurry out of the shop and down the road toward Brandon Communications. Please let the press conference be short, I pray. Please don\u2019t let the questions go on too long. Please God, please let me have that scarf.</p><p>As I arrive at Brandon Communications, I can feel myself begin to relax. I do have three whole hours, after all. And my scarf is safely behind the counter. No one\u2019s going to steal it from me.</p><p>There\u2019s a sign up in the foyer saying that the Foreland Exotic Opportunities press conference is happening in the Artemis Suite, and a man in uniform is directing everybody down the corridor. This means it must be quite big. Not television-cameras-CNN-world\u2019s-press-on-tenterhooks big, obviously. But fairly-good-turnout big. A relatively important event in our dull little world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I enter the room, there\u2019s already a buzz of people milling around, and waitresses circulating with canap\u00e9s. The journalists are knocking back the champagne as if they\u2019ve never seen it before; the PR girls are looking supercilious and sipping water. A waiter offers me a glass of champagne and I take two. One for now, one to put under my chair for the boring bits.</p><p>In the far corner of the room I can see Elly Granger from Investor\u2019s Weekly News. She\u2019s been pinned into a corner by two earnest men in suits and is nodding at them, with a glassy look in her eye. Elly\u2019s great. She\u2019s only been on Investor\u2019s Weekly News for six months, and already she\u2019s applied for forty-three other jobs. What she really wants to be is a beauty editor on a magazine, and I think she\u2019d be really good at it. Every time I see her, she\u2019s got a new lipstick on \u2014 and she always wears really interesting clothes. Like today, she\u2019s wearing an orange chiffony shirt over a pair of white cotton trousers, espadrilles, and a big wooden necklace, the kind I could never wear in a million years.</p><p>What I really want to be is Fiona Phillips on GMTV. I could really see myself, sitting on that sofa, joshing with Eamonn every morning and interviewing lots of soap stars. Sometimes, when we\u2019re very drunk, we make pacts that if we\u2019re not somewhere more exciting in three months, we\u2019ll both leave our jobs. But then the thought of no money \u2014 even for a month \u2014 is almost more scary than the thought of writing about depository trust companies for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cRebecca. Glad you could make it.\u201d</p> <p>I look up, and almost choke on my champagne. It\u2019s Luke Brandon, head honcho of Brandon Communications, staring straight at me as if he knows exactly what I\u2019m thinking. Staring straight down at me, I should say. He must be well over six feet tall with dark hair and dark eyes and. . wow. Isn\u2019t that suit nice? An expensive suit like that almost makes you want to be a man. It\u2019s inky blue with a faint purple stripe, single-breasted, with proper horn buttons. As I run my eyes over it I find myself wondering if it\u2019s by Oswald Boateng, and whether the jacket\u2019s got a silk lining in some stunning color. If this were someone else, I might ask \u2014 but not Luke Brandon, no way.</p><p>I\u2019ve only met him a few times, and I\u2019ve always felt slightly uneasy around him. For a start, he\u2019s got such a scary reputation. Everyone talks all the time about what a genius he is, even Philip, my boss. He started Brandon Communications from nothing, and now it\u2019s the biggest financial PR company in London. A few months ago he was listed in The Mail as one of the cleverest entrepreneurs of his generation. It said his IQ was phenomenally high and he had a photographic memory.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just that. It\u2019s that he always seems to have a frown on his face when he\u2019s talking to me. It\u2019ll probably turn out that the famous Luke Brandon is not only a complete genius but he can read minds, too. He knows that when I\u2019m staring up at some boring graph, nodding intelligently, I\u2019m really thinking about a gorgeous black top I saw in Joseph and whether I can afford the trousers as well.</p><p>\u201cYou know Alicia, don\u2019t you?\u201d Luke is saying, and he gestures to the immaculate blond girl beside him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know Alicia, as it happens. But I don\u2019t need to. They\u2019re all the same, the girls at Brandon C, as they call it. They\u2019re well dressed, well spoken, are married to bankers, and have zero sense of humor. Alicia falls into the identikit pattern exactly, with her baby-blue suit, silk Herm\u00e8s scarf, and matching baby-blue shoes, which I\u2019ve seen in Russell and Bromley, and they cost an absolute fortune. (I bet she\u2019s got the bag as well.) She\u2019s also got a suntan, which must mean she\u2019s just come back from Mauritius or somewhere, and suddenly I feel a bit pale and weedy in comparison.</p> <p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d she says coolly, grasping my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re on Successful Saving, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I say, equally coolly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good of you to come today,\u201d says Alicia. \u201cI know you journalists are terribly busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say. \u201cWe like to attend as many press conferences as we can. Keep up with industry events.\u201d I feel pleased with my response. I\u2019m almost fooling myself.</p><p>Alicia nods seriously, as though everything I say is incredibly important to her.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, Rebecca. What do you think about today\u2019s news?\u201d She gestures to the FT under my arm. \u201cQuite a surprise, didn\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. What\u2019s she talking about?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly interesting,\u201d I say, still smiling, playing for time. I glance around the room for a clue, but there\u2019s nothing. What\u2019s she talking about? Have interest rates gone up or something? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to say, I think it\u2019s bad news for the industry,\u201d says Alicia earnestly. \u201cBut of course, you must have your own views.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me, waiting for an answer. I can feel my cheeks flaming bright red. How can I get out of this? After this, I promise myself, I\u2019m going to read the papers every day. I\u2019m never going to be caught out like this again.</p><p>\u201cI agree with you,\u201d I say eventually. \u201cI think it\u2019s very bad news.\u201d My voice feels strangled. I take a quick swig of champagne and pray for an earthquake.</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting it?\u201d Alicia says. \u201cI know you journalists are always ahead of the game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI. . I certainly saw it coming,\u201d I say, and I\u2019m pretty sure I sound convincing.</p><p>\u201cAnd now this rumor about Scottish Prime and Flagstaff Life going the same way!\u201d She looks at me intently. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s really on the cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s. . it\u2019s difficult to say,\u201d I reply, and take a gulp of champagne. What rumor? Why can\u2019t she leave me alone?</p><p>Then I make the mistake of glancing up at Luke Brandon. He\u2019s staring at me, his mouth twitching slightly. Oh shit. He knows I don\u2019t have a clue, doesn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d he says abruptly, \u201cthat\u2019s Maggie Stevens coming in. Could you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says, trained like a racehorse, and starts to move smoothly toward the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd Alicia\u2014\u201d adds Luke, and she quickly turns back. \u201cI want to know exactly who fucked up on those figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d gulps Alicia, and walks off.</p><p>God he\u2019s scary. And now we\u2019re on our own. I think I might quickly run away.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI must just go and. .\u201d</p><p>But Luke Brandon is leaning toward me.</p> <p>\u201cSBG announced that they\u2019ve taken over Rutland Bank this morning,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>And of course, now that he says it, I remember that front-page headline.</p><p>\u201cI know they did,\u201d I reply haughtily. \u201cI read it in the FT.\u201d And before he can say anything else, I walk off, to talk to Elly.</p><p>As the press conference is about to start, Elly and I sidle toward the back and grab two seats together. We\u2019re in one of the bigger conference rooms and there must be about a hundred chairs arranged in rows, facing a podium and a large screen. I open my notebook, write \u201cBrandon Communications\u201d at the top of the page, and start doodling swirly flowers down the side. Beside me, Elly\u2019s dialing her telephone horoscope on her mobile phone.</p><p>I take a sip of champagne, lean back, and prepare to relax. There\u2019s no point listening at press conferences. The information\u2019s always in the press pack, and you can work out what they were talking about later. In fact, I\u2019m wondering whether anyone would notice if I took out a pot of Hard Candy and did my nails, when suddenly the awful Alicia ducks her head down to mine.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say lazily.</p><p>\u201cPhone call for you. It\u2019s your editor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPhilip?\u201d I say stupidly. As though I\u2019ve a whole array of editors to choose from.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looks at me as though I\u2019m a moron and gestures to a phone on a table at the back. Elly gives me a questioning look and I shrug back. Philip\u2019s never phoned me at a press conference before.</p><p>I feel rather excited and important as I walk to the back of the room. Perhaps there\u2019s an emergency at the office. Perhaps he\u2019s scooped an incredible story and wants me to fly to New York to follow up a lead.</p><p>\u201cHello, Philip?\u201d I say into the receiver \u2014 then immediately I wish I\u2019d said something thrusting and impressive, like a simple \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca, listen, sorry to be a bore,\u201d says Philip, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got a migraine coming on. I\u2019m going to head off home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say puzzledly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I wondered if you could run a small errand for me.\u201d</p><p>An errand? If he wants somebody to buy him Tylenol, he should get a secretary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say discouragingly. \u201cI\u2019m a bit tied up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished there. The Social Security Select Committee is releasing its report at five o\u2019clock. Can you go and pick it up? You can go straight to Westminster from your press conference.\u201d</p><p>What? I stare at the phone in horror. No, I can\u2019t pick up a bloody report. I need to pick up my VISA card! I need to secure my scarf.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Clare go?\u201d I say. \u201cI was going to come back to the office and finish my research on. .\u201d What am I supposed to be writing about this month? \u201cOn mortgages.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClare\u2019s got a briefing in the City. And Westminster\u2019s on your way home to Trendy Fulham, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Philip always has to make a joke about me living in Fulham. Just because he lives in Harpenden and thinks anyone who doesn\u2019t live in lovely leafy suburbia is mad.</p><p>\u201cYou can just hop off the tube,\u201d he\u2019s saying, \u201cpick it up, and hop back on again.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I close my eyes and think quickly. An hour here. Rush back to the office, pick up my VISA card, back to Denny and George, get my scarf, rush to Westminster, pick up the report. I should just about make it.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cLeave it to me.\u201d</p><p>I sit back down, just as the lights dim and the words Far Eastern Opportunities appear on the screen in front of us. There is a colorful series of pictures from Hong Kong, Thailand, and other exotic places, which would usually have me thinking wistfully about going on holiday. But today I can\u2019t relax, or even feel sorry for the new girl from Portfolio Week, who\u2019s frantically trying to write everything down and will probably ask five questions because she thinks she should. I\u2019m too concerned about my scarf. What if I don\u2019t make it back in time? What if someone puts in a higher offer? The very thought makes me panic.</p><p>Then, just as the pictures of Thailand disappear and the boring graphs begin, I have a flash of inspiration. Of course! I\u2019ll pay cash for the scarf. No one can argue with cash. I can get \u00a3100 out on my cash card, so all I need is another \u00a320, and the scarf is mine.</p><p>I tear a piece of paper out of my notebook, write on it \u201cCan you lend me twenty quid?\u201d and pass it to Elly, who\u2019s still surreptitiously listening to her mobile phone. I wonder what she\u2019s listening to. It can\u2019t still be her horoscope, surely? She looks down, shakes her head, and writes, \u201cNo can do. Bloody machine swallowed my card. Living off luncheon vouchers at moment.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I hesitate, then write, \u201cWhat about credit card? I\u2019ll pay you back, honest. And what are you listening to?\u201d</p> <p>I pass the page to her and suddenly the lights go up. The presentation has ended and I didn\u2019t hear a word of it. People shift around on their seats and a PR girl starts handing out glossy brochures. Elly finishes her call and grins at me.</p><p>\u201cLove life prediction,\u201d she says, tapping in another number. \u201cIt\u2019s really accurate stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoad of old bullshit, more like.\u201d I shake my head disapprovingly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you go for all that rubbish. Call yourself a financial journalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Elly. \u201cDo you?\u201d And we both start to giggle, until some old bag from one of the nationals turns round and gives us an angry glare.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d A piercing voice interrupts us and I look up. It\u2019s Alicia, standing up at the front of the room. She\u2019s got very good legs, I note resentfully. \u201cAs you can see, the Foreland Exotic Opportunities Savings Plan represents an entirely new approach to investment.\u201d She looks around the room, meets my eye, and smiles coldly.</p><p>\u201cExotic Opportunities,\u201d I whisper scornfully to Elly and point to the leaflet. \u201cExotic prices, more like. Have you seen how much they\u2019re charging?\u201d</p> <p>(I always turn to the charges first. Just like I always look at the price tag first.)</p><p>Elly rolls her eyes sympathetically, still listening to the phone.</p><p>\u201cForeland Investments are all about adding value,\u201d Alicia is saying in her snooty voice. \u201cForeland Investments offer you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey charge more, you lose more,\u201d I say aloud without thinking, and there\u2019s a laugh around the room. God, how embarrassing. And now Luke Brandon\u2019s lifting his head, too. Quickly I look down and pretend to be writing notes.</p><p>Although to be honest, I don\u2019t know why I even pretend to write notes. It\u2019s not as if we ever put anything in the magazine except the puff that comes on the press release. Foreland Investments takes out a whopping double-page spread advertisement every month, and they took Philip on some fantastic research (ha-ha) trip to Thailand last year \u2014 so we\u2019re never allowed to say anything except how wonderful they are. Like that\u2019s really any help to our readers.</p><p>As Alicia carries on speaking, I lean toward Elly.</p><p>\u201cSo, listen,\u201d I whisper. \u201cCan I borrow your credit card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll used up,\u201d hisses Elly apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m up to my limit. Why do you think I\u2019m living off LVs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I need money!\u201d I whisper. \u201cI\u2019m desperate! I need twenty quid!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve spoken more loudly than I intended and Alicia stops speaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps you should have invested with Foreland Investments, Rebecca,\u201d says Alicia, and another titter goes round the room. A few faces turn round to gawk at me, and I stare back at them lividly. They\u2019re fellow journalists, for God\u2019s sake. They should be on my side. National Union of Journalists solidarity and all that.</p><p>Not that I\u2019ve ever actually got round to joining the NUJ. But still.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need twenty quid for?\u201d says Luke Brandon, from the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cI. . my aunt,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cShe\u2019s in hospital and I wanted to get her a present.\u201d</p> <p>The room is silent. Then, to my disbelief, Luke Brandon reaches into his pocket, takes out a \u00a320 note, and gives it to a guy in the front row of journalists. He hesitates, then passes it back to the row behind. And so it goes on, a twenty-quid note being passed from hand to hand, making its way to me like a fan at a gig being passed over the crowd. As I take hold of it, a round of applause goes round the room and I blush.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best wishes to your aunt,\u201d says Luke Brandon.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say again. Then I glance at Alicia, and feel a little dart of triumph. She looks utterly deflated.</p><p>Toward the end of the question-and-answer session, people begin slipping out to get back to their offices. This is usually when I slip out to go and buy a cappuccino and browse in a few shops. But today I don\u2019t. Today I decide I will stick it out until the last dismal question about tax structures. Then I\u2019ll go up to the front and thank Luke Brandon in person for his kind, if embarrassing, gesture. And then I\u2019ll go and get my scarf. Yippee!</p> <p>But to my surprise, after only a few questions, Luke Brandon gets up, whispers something to Alicia, and heads for the door.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter as he passes my chair, but I\u2019m not sure he even hears me.</p><p>The tube stops in a tunnel for no apparent reason. Five minutes go by, then ten minutes. I can\u2019t believe my bad luck. Normally, of course, I long for the tube to break down \u2014 so I\u2019ve got an excuse to stay out of the office for longer. But today I behave like a stressed businessman with an ulcer. I tap my fingers and sigh, and peer out of the window into the blackness.</p><p>Part of my brain knows that I\u2019ve got plenty of time to get to Denny and George before it closes. Another part knows that even if I don\u2019t make it, it\u2019s unlikely the blond girl will sell my scarf to someone else. But the possibility is there. So until I\u2019ve got that scarf in my hands I won\u2019t be able to relax.</p><p>As the train finally gets going again I sink into my seat with a dramatic sigh and look at the pale, silent man on my left. He\u2019s wearing jeans and sneakers, and I notice his shirt is on inside out. Gosh, I think in admiration, did he read the article on deconstructing fashion in last month\u2019s Vogue, too? I\u2019m about to ask him \u2014 then I take another look at his jeans (really nasty fake 501s) and his sneakers (very new, very white) \u2014 and something tells me he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d I say instead. \u201cI was getting desperate there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he agrees quietly.</p><p>\u201cThey just don\u2019t think, do they?\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, some of us have got crucial things we need to be doing. I\u2019m in a terrible hurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a hurry myself,\u201d says the man.</p><p>\u201cIf that train hadn\u2019t started moving, I don\u2019t know what I would have done.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cYou feel so. . impotent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you mean,\u201d says the man intensely. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that some of us. .\u201d He gestures toward me. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just idly traveling. It matters whether we arrive or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say. \u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s in labor,\u201d he says. \u201cOur fourth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWell. . Gosh. Congratulations. I hope you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe took an hour and a half last time,\u201d says the man, rubbing his damp forehead. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been on this tube for forty minutes already. Still. At least we\u2019re moving now.\u201d</p><p>He gives a little shrug, then smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cHow about you? What\u2019s your urgent business?\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cI. . ahm. . I\u2019m going to. .\u201d</p><p>I stop feebly and clear my throat, feeling rather sheepish. I can\u2019t tell this man that my urgent business consists of picking up a scarf from Denny and George.</p><p>I mean, a scarf. It\u2019s not even a suit or a coat, or something worthy like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that important,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d he says nicely.</p><p>Oh, now I feel awful. I glance up \u2014 and thank goodness, it\u2019s my stop.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d I say, hastily getting up. \u201cI really hope you get there in time.\u201d</p> <p>As I walk along the pavement I\u2019m feeling a bit shamefaced. I should have got out my 120 quid and given it to that man for his baby, instead of buying a pointless scarf. I mean, when you think about it, what\u2019s more important? Clothes \u2014 or the miracle of new life?</p><p>As I ponder this issue, I feel quite deep and philosophical. In fact, I\u2019m so engrossed, I almost walk past my turning. But I look up just in time and turn the corner \u2014 and feel a jolt. There\u2019s a girl coming toward me and she\u2019s carrying a Denny and George carrier bag. And suddenly everything is swept from my mind.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>What if she\u2019s got my scarf?</p><p>What if she asked for it specially and that assistant sold it to her, thinking I wasn\u2019t going to come back?</p> <p>My heart starts to beat in panic and I begin to stride along the street toward the shop. As I arrive at the door and push it open, I can barely breathe for fear. What if it\u2019s gone? What will I do?</p><p>But the blond girl smiles as I enter.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say in relief and subside weakly against the counter.</p><p>I honestly feel as though I\u2019ve run an obstacle course to get here. In fact, I think, they should list shopping as a cardiovascular activity. My heart never beats as fast as it does when I see a \u201creduced by 50 percent\u201d sign.</p><p>I count out the money in tens and twenties and wait, almost shivering as she ducks behind the counter and produces the green box. She slides it into a thick glossy bag with dark green cord handles and hands it to me, and I almost want to cry out loud, the moment is so wonderful.</p> <p>That moment. That instant when your fingers curl round the handles of a shiny, uncreased bag \u2014 and all the gorgeous new things inside it become yours. What\u2019s it like? It\u2019s like going hungry for days, then cramming your mouth full of warm buttered toast. It\u2019s like waking up and realizing it\u2019s the weekend. It\u2019s like the better moments of sex. Everything else is blocked out of your mind. It\u2019s pure, selfish pleasure.</p><p>I walk slowly out of the shop, still in a haze of delight. I\u2019ve got a Denny and George scarf. I\u2019ve got a Denny and George scarf! I\u2019ve got. .</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d A man\u2019s voice interrupts my thoughts. I look up and my stomach gives a lurch of horror. It\u2019s Luke Brandon.</p><p>Luke Brandon is standing on the street, right in front of me, and he\u2019s staring down at my carrier bag. I feel myself growing flustered. What\u2019s he doing here on the pavement anyway? Don\u2019t people like that have chauffeurs? Shouldn\u2019t he be whisking off to some vital financial reception or something?</p><p>\u201cDid you get it all right?\u201d he says, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt\u2019s present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, and swallow. \u201cYes, I. . I got it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d He gestures to the bag and I feel a guilty blush spread over my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say eventually. \u201cI thought a. . a scarf would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery generous of you. Denny and George.\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cYour aunt must be a stylish lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d I say, and clear my throat. \u201cShe\u2019s terribly creative and original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is,\u201d says Luke, and pauses. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I should have run as soon as I saw him, while I had a chance. Now I\u2019m paralyzed. I can\u2019t think of a single female name.</p><p>\u201cErm. . Ermintrude,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>\u201cAunt Ermintrude,\u201d says Luke thoughtfully. \u201cWell, give her my best wishes.\u201d</p><p>He nods at me, and walks off, and I stand, clutching my bag, trying to work out if he guessed or not.</p><p>ENDWICH BANK</p><p>FULHAM BRANCH 3 Fulham Road</p><p>London SW6 9JH</p><p>Ms. Rebecca BloomwoodFlat 24 Burney Rd.London SW6 8FD</p><p>17 November 1999</p><p>Dear Ms. Bloomwood: I am sorry to hear that you have glandular fever.When you have recovered, perhaps you would be kind enough to ring my assistant, Erica Parnell, and arrange a meeting to discuss your situation.Yours sincerely,Derek SmeathManager</p><p>ENDWICH \u2014 BECAUSE WE CARE</p><p>Three</p><p>I WALK THROUGH THE door of our flat to see Suze, my flatmate, sitting in one of her strange yoga positions, with her eyes closed. Her fair hair is scrunched up in a knot, and she\u2019s wearing black leggings together with the ancient T-shirt she always wears for yoga. It\u2019s the one her dad was wearing when he rowed Oxford to victory, and she says it gives her good vibes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment I\u2019m silent. I don\u2019t want to disturb her in case yoga is like sleepwalking and you\u2019re not meant to wake people when they\u2019re doing it. But then Suze opens her eyes and looks up \u2014 and the first thing she says is \u201cDenny and George! Becky, you\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cI bought myself a scarf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me!\u201d says Suze, unwinding herself from the floor. \u201cShow-me-show-me-show-me!\u201d She comes over and starts tugging at the strings of the carrier, like a kid. \u201cI want to see your new scarf! Show me!\u201d</p><p>This is why I love sharing a flat with Suze. Julia, my old flatmate, would have wrinkled her brow and said, \u201cDenny and who?\u201d or, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for a scarf.\u201d But Suze completely and utterly understands. If anything, she\u2019s worse than me.</p> <p>But then, she can afford to be. Although she\u2019s twenty-five, like me, her parents still give her pocket money. It\u2019s called an \u201callowance\u201d and apparently comes from some family trust \u2014 but as far as I can see, it\u2019s pocket money. Her parents also bought her a flat in Fulham as a twenty-first birthday present and she\u2019s been living in it ever since, half working and half dossing about.</p><p>She was in PR for a (very) short while, and that\u2019s when I met her, on a press trip to an offshore bank on Guernsey. As a matter of fact, she was working for Brandon Communications. Without being rude \u2014 she admits it herself \u2014 she was the worst PR girl I\u2019ve ever come across. She completely forgot which bank she was supposed to be promoting, and started talking enthusiastically about one of their competitors. The man from the bank looked crosser and crosser, while all the journalists pissed themselves laughing. Suze got in big trouble over that. In fact, that\u2019s when she decided PR wasn\u2019t the career for her. (The other way of putting it is that Luke Brandon gave her the sack as soon as they got back to London. Another reason not to like him.)</p><p>But the two of us had a whale of a time sloshing back wine until the early hours. Actually, Suze had a secret little weep at about two a.m. and said she was hopeless at every job she\u2019d tried and what was she going to do? I said I thought she was far too interesting and creative to be one of those snooty Brandon C girls. Which I wasn\u2019t just saying to be nice, it\u2019s completely true. I gave her a big hug and she cried some more, then we both cheered up and ordered another bottle of wine, and tried on all each other\u2019s clothes. I lent Suze my belt with the square silver buckle, which, come to think of it, she\u2019s never given back. And we kept in touch ever since.</p><p>Then, when Julia suddenly upped and ran off with the professor supervising her Ph.D. (she was a dark horse, that one), Suze suggested I move in with her. I\u2019m sure the rent she charges is too low, but I\u2019ve never insisted I pay the full market rate, because I couldn\u2019t afford it. As market rates go, I\u2019m nearer Elephant and Castle than Fulham on my salary. How can normal people afford to live in such hideously expensive places?</p><p>\u201cBex, open it up!\u201d Suze is begging. \u201cLet me see!\u201d She\u2019s grabbing inside the bag with eager long fingers, and I pull it away quickly before she rips it. This bag is going on the back of my door along with my other prestige carrier bags, to be used in a casual manner when I need to impress. (Thank God they didn\u2019t print special \u201cSale\u201d bags. I hate shops that do that. What\u2019s the point of having a posh bag with \u201cSale\u201d splashed all over it?)</p> <p>Very slowly, I take the dark green box out of the bag, remove the lid, and unfold the tissue paper. Then, almost reverentially, I lift up the scarf. It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s even more beautiful here than it was in the shop. I drape it around my neck and grin stupidly at Suze.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>For a moment we are both silent. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re communing with a higher being. The god of shopping.</p><p>Then Suze has to go and ruin it all.</p><p>\u201cYou can wear it to see James this weekend,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say almost crossly, taking it off again. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing him anymore.\u201d I try to give a nonchalant shrug.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWhy not? You didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I look away from her eager gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit. . awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you chuck him? You hadn\u2019t even shagged him!\u201d Suze\u2019s voice is rising in excitement. She\u2019s desperate to know. But am I desperate to tell? For a moment I consider being discreet. Then I think, oh, what the hell? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cThat was the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Suze leans forward. \u201cBex, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t fancy you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2014\u201d I close my eyes, barely able to believe this myself. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in sex before marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d I open my eyes to see Suze looking at me in horror \u2014 as if she\u2019s just heard the worst profanity known to mankind. \u201cYou are joking, Becky.\u201d She\u2019s actually pleading with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I manage a weak smile. \u201cIt was a bit embarrassing, actually. I kind of. . pounced on him, and he had to fight me off.\u201d</p><p>The cringingly awful memory which I had successfully suppressed starts to resurface. I\u2019d met James at a party a few weeks back, and this was the crucial third date. We\u2019d been out for a really nice meal, which he\u2019d insisted on paying for, and had gone back to his place, and had ended up kissing on the sofa.</p> <p>Well, what was I supposed to think? There he was, there I was \u2014 and make no mistake, if his mind was saying no, his body was certainly saying yes, yes, yes. So, being a modern girl, I reached for his trouser zip and began to pull it down. When he reached down and brushed me aside I thought he was playing games, and carried on, even more enthusiastically.</p><p>Thinking back, perhaps it took me longer than it should have to guess that he wasn\u2019t playing ball, so to speak. In fact, he actually had to punch me in the face to get me off him \u2014 although he was very apologetic about it afterward.</p><p>Suze is gazing at me incredulously. Then she breaks into gurgles of laughter.</p><p>\u201cHe had to fight you off? Bex, you man-eater!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d I protest, half laughing, half embarrassed. \u201cHe was really sweet about it. He asked, was I prepared to wait for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you said, not bloody likely!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSort of.\u201d I look away.</p><p>In fact, carried away with the moment, I seem to remember issuing him a bit of a challenge. \u201cResist me now if you can, James,\u201d I recall saying in a husky voice, gazing at him with what I thought were limpid, sexual eyes. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be knocking at my door within the week.\u201d</p><p>Well, it\u2019s been over a week now, and I haven\u2019t heard a peep. Which, if you think about it, is pretty unflattering.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s hideous!\u201d Suze is saying. \u201cWhat about sexual compatibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI guess he\u2019s willing to take that gamble.\u201d</p><p>Suze gives a sudden giggle. \u201cDid you get a look at his. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He wouldn\u2019t let me near it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut could you feel it? Was it tiny?\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes gleam wickedly. \u201cI bet it\u2019s teeny. He\u2019s hoping to kid some poor girl into marrying him and being stuck with a teeny todger all her life. Narrow escape, Bex!\u201d She reaches for her packet of Silk Cut and lights up.</p> <p>\u201cStay away!\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t want my scarf smelling of smoke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing this weekend?\u201d she asks, taking a drag. \u201cWill you be OK? Do you want to come down to the country?\u201d</p><p>This is how Suze always refers to her family\u2019s second home in Hampshire. The Country. As though her parents own some small, independent nation that nobody else knows about.</p><p>\u201cNo, \u2018s\u2019OK,\u201d I say, morosely picking up the TV guide. \u201cI\u2019m going to Surrey. Visit my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d says Suze. \u201cGive your mum my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you give my love to Pepper.\u201d</p><p>Pepper is Suze\u2019s horse. She rides him about three times a year, if that, but whenever her parents suggest selling him she gets all hysterical. Apparently he costs \u00a315,000 a year to run. Fifteen thousand pounds. And what does he do for his money? Just stands in a stable and eats apples. I wouldn\u2019t mind being a horse.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that reminds me,\u201d says Suze. \u201cThe council tax bill came in. It\u2019s three hundred each.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hundred pounds?\u201d I look at her in dismay. \u201cWhat, straight away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Actually, it\u2019s late. Just write me a check or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say airily. \u201cThree hundred quid coming up.\u201d</p><p>I reach for my bag and write a check out straight away. Suze is so generous about the rent, I always pay my share of the bills, and sometimes add a bit extra. But still, I\u2019m feeling cold as I hand it over. Three hundred pounds gone, just like that. And I\u2019ve still got that bloody VISA bill to think of. Not a great month. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, and someone called,\u201d adds Suze, and squints at a piece of paper. \u201cErica Parsnip. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErica Parsnip?\u201d Sometimes I think Suze\u2019s mind has been expanded just a little too often.</p><p>\u201cParnell. Erica Parnell from Endwich Bank. Can you call her.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Suze, frozen in horror.</p> <p>\u201cShe called here? She called this number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d My heart starts to thump. \u201cWhat did you say? Did you say I\u2019ve got glandular fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It\u2019s Suze\u2019s turn to stare. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t say you\u2019ve got bloody glandular fever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she ask about my leg? Anything about my health at all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! She just said where were you? And I said you were at work\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I wail in dismay.</p><p>\u201cWell, what was I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to say I was in bed with glandular fever and a broken leg!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for the warning!\u201d Suze gazes at me, eyes narrowed, and crosses her legs back into the lotus position. Suze has got the longest, thinnest, wiriest legs I\u2019ve ever known. When she\u2019s wearing black leggings she looks just like a spider. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, anyway?\u201d she says. \u201cAre you overdrawn?\u201d</p><p>Am I overdrawn?</p> <p>I smile back as reassuringly as I can. If Suze had any idea of my real situation, she\u2019d need more than yoga to calm her down.</p><p>\u201cJust a tad.\u201d I give a careless shrug. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work itself out. No need to worry!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and I look up to see Suze tearing up my check. For a moment I\u2019m completely silenced, then I stutter, \u201cSuze! Don\u2019t be stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay me back when you\u2019re in the black,\u201d she says firmly.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Suze,\u201d I say in a suddenly thickened voice \u2014 and as I give her a big hug I can feel tears jumping into my eyes. Suze has got to be the best friend I\u2019ve ever had.</p><p>But there\u2019s a tense feeling in my stomach, which stays with me all evening and is still there when I wake up the next morning. A feeling I can\u2019t even shift by thinking about my Denny and George scarf. I lie in bed staring up at the ceiling and, for the first time in months, calculate how much I owe to everybody. The bank, VISA, my Harvey Nichols card, my Debenhams card, my Fenwicks card. . And now Suze, too.</p><p>It\u2019s about. . let\u2019s think. . it\u2019s about \u00a36,000.</p><p>A cold feeling creeps over me as I contemplate this figure. How on earth am I going to find \u00a36,000? I could save \u00a36 a week for a thousand weeks. Or \u00a312 a week for five hundred weeks. Or. . or \u00a360 a week for a hundred weeks. That\u2019s more like it. But how the hell am I going to find \u00a360 a week?</p> <p>Or I could bone up on lots of general knowledge and go on a game show. Or invent something really clever. Or I could. . win the lottery. At the thought, a lovely warm glow creeps over me, and I close my eyes and snuggle back down into bed. The lottery is by far the best solution.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t aim to win the jackpot of course \u2014 that\u2019s completely unlikely. But one of those minor prizes. There seem to be heaps of those going around. Say, \u00a3100,000. That would do. I could pay off all my debts, buy a car, buy a flat. .</p><p>Actually, better make it \u00a3200,000. Or a quarter of a million.</p><p>Or, even better, one of those shared jackpots. \u201cThe five winners will each receive \u00a31.3 million.\u201d (I love the way they say that: \u201cOne point three.\u201d As if that extra \u00a3300,000 is a tiny, insignificant amount. As if you wouldn\u2019t notice whether it was there or not.)</p><p>One point three million should see me straight. And it\u2019s not being greedy, is it, to want to share your jackpot? Please, God, I think, let me win the lottery and I promise to share nicely.</p><p>And so, on the way down to my parents\u2019 house I stop off at a petrol station to buy a couple of lottery tickets. Choosing the numbers takes about half an hour. I know 44 always does well, and 42. But what about the rest? I write out a few series of numbers on a piece of paper and squint at them, trying to imagine them on the telly. 1 6 9 16 23 44</p><p>No! Terrible! What am I thinking of? One never comes up, for a start. And 6 and 9 look wrong, too. 3 14 21 25 36 44</p><p>That\u2019s a bit better. I fill in the numbers on the ticket. 5 11 18 27 28 42</p><p>I\u2019m quite impressed by this one. It looks like a winner. I can just imagine Moira Stewart reading it out on the news. \u201cOne ticket-holder, believed to live in southwest London, has won an estimated jackpot of \u00a310 million.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I feel faint. What\u2019ll I do with \u00a310 million? Where will I start? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, a huge party to begin with. Somewhere smart but cool, with loads of champagne and dancing and a taxi service so no one has to drive. And going-home presents, like really nice bubble bath or something. (Does Calvin Klein do bubble bath?)</p><p>Then I\u2019ll buy houses for all my family and friends, of course. I lean against the lottery stand and close my eyes to concentrate. Suppose I buy twenty houses at \u00a3250,000 each. That\u2019ll leave me. . 5 million. Plus about \u00a350,000 on the party.</p><p>So that\u2019s \u00a34,950,000. Oh, and I need \u00a36,000 to pay off all my credit cards and overdraft. Plus \u00a3300 for Suze. Call it \u00a37,000. So that leaves. . \u00a34,943,000.</p><p>Obviously, I\u2019ll do loads for charity. In fact, I\u2019ll probably set up a charitable foundation. I\u2019ll support all those unfashionable charities that get ignored, like skin diseases and home helps for the elderly. And I\u2019ll send a great big check to my old English teacher, Mrs. James, so she can restock the school library. Perhaps they\u2019ll even rename it after me. The Bloomwood Library.</p> <p>Oh, and \u00a3300 for that swirly coat in Whistles, which I must buy before they\u2019re all snapped up. So how much does that leave? Four million, nine hundred and forty-three thousand, minus\u2014</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d A voice interrupts me and I look up dazedly. The woman behind is trying to get at the pen.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, and politely make way. But the interruption has made me lose track of my calculations. Was it 4 million or 5 million?</p><p>Then, as I see the woman looking at my bit of paper covered in scribbled numbers, an awful thought strikes me. What if one of my rejected sets of numbers actually comes up? What if 1 6 9 16 23 44 comes up tonight and I haven\u2019t entered it? All my life, I\u2019d never forgive myself.</p><p>I quickly fill in tickets for all the combinations of numbers written on my bit of paper. That\u2019s nine tickets in all. Nine quid \u2014 quite a lot of money, really. I almost feel bad about spending it. But then, that\u2019s nine times as many chances of winning, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>And I now have a very good feeling about 1 6 9 16 23 44. Why has that particular set of numbers leapt into my mind and stayed there? Maybe someone, somewhere, is trying to tell me something.</p><p>Four</p><p>WHEN I ARRIVE AT my parents\u2019 house, they are in the middle of an argument. Dad is halfway up a stepladder in the garden, poking at the gutter on the side of the house, and Mum is sitting at the wrought-iron garden table, leafing through a Past Times catalogue. Neither of them even looks up when I walk through the patio doors.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that they should set a good example!\u201d Mum is exclaiming. She\u2019s looking good, I think as I sit down. New hair color \u2014 pale brown with just a hint of gray \u2014 and a very nice red polo-neck jumper. Perhaps I\u2019ll borrow that tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think exposing themselves to danger is a good example, is it?\u201d replies Dad, looking down from the ladder. He\u2019s got quite a few more gray hairs, I notice with a slight shock. Mind you, gray hair looks quite distinguished on him. \u201cYou think that would solve the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanger!\u201d says Mum derisively. \u201cDon\u2019t be so melodramatic, Graham. Is that the opinion you really have of British society?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Mum,\u201d I say. \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky agrees with me. Don\u2019t you, darling?\u201d says Mum, and points to a page of Past Times, full of 1930s reproduction jewelry and trinket boxes. \u201cLovely cardigan,\u201d she adds sotto voce. \u201cLook at that embroidery!\u201d I follow her gaze and see a long, purple coatlike garment covered in colorful Art Deco swirls. I\u2019d save the page and get it for her birthday \u2014 if I didn\u2019t know she\u2019ll probably have bought it herself by next week.</p><p>\u201cOf course Becky doesn\u2019t agree with you!\u201d retorts my dad. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ridiculous idea I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not!\u201d says Mum indignantly. \u201cBecky, you think it would be a good idea for the royal family to travel by public transport, don\u2019t you, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. .\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cI hadn\u2019t really. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the queen should travel to official engagements on the ninety-three bus?\u201d scoffs Dad.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not? Maybe then the ninety-three bus would become more efficient!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say, sitting down next to Mum. \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou realize this country is on the verge of gridlock?\u201d says Mum, as if she hasn\u2019t heard me. \u201cIf more people don\u2019t start using public transport, our roads are going to seize up.\u201d</p><p>My dad shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the queen traveling on the ninety-three bus would solve the problem. Never mind the security problems, never mind the fact that she\u2019d be able to do far fewer engagements. .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean the queen, necessarily,\u201d retorts Mum. \u201cBut some of those others. Princess Michael of Kent, for example. She could travel by tube, every so often, couldn\u2019t she? These people need to learn about real life.\u201d</p><p>The last time my mum traveled on the tube was about 1983.</p><p>\u201cShall I make some coffee?\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, this gridlock business is utter nonsense,\u201d says my dad. He jumps down from the stepladder and brushes the dirt off his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s all propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPropaganda?\u201d exclaims my mum in outrage.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll go and put the kettle on.\u201d</p><p>I walk back into the house, flick the kettle on in the kitchen, and sit down at the table in a nice patch of sunshine. I\u2019ve already forgotten what my mum and dad are arguing about. They\u2019ll just go round and round in circles and agree it\u2019s all the fault of Tony Blair. Anyway, I\u2019ve got more important things to think about. I\u2019m trying to figure out exactly how much I should give to Philip, my boss, after I win the lottery. I can\u2019t leave him out, of course \u2014 but is cash a bit tacky? Would a present be better? Really nice cufflinks, perhaps. Or one of those picnic hampers with all the plates inside. (Clare Edwards, obviously, will get nothing.)</p><p>Sitting alone in the sunny kitchen, I feel as though I have a little glowing secret inside me. I\u2019m going to win the lottery. Tonight, my life is going to change. God, I can\u2019t wait. Ten million pounds. Just think, tomorrow I\u2019ll be able to buy anything I want. Anything!</p><p>The newspaper\u2019s open in front of me at the property section and I carelessly pick it up to peruse expensive houses. Where shall I live? Chelsea? Notting Hill? Mayfair? Belgravia, I read. Magnificent seven-bedroom detached house with staff annex and mature garden. Well, that sounds all right. I could cope with seven bedrooms in Belgravia. My eye flicks complacently down to the price and stops still with shock. Six point five million pounds. That\u2019s how much they\u2019re asking. Six and a half million.</p> <p>I feel stunned and slightly angry. Are they serious? I haven\u2019t got anything like \u00a36.5 million. I\u2019ve only got about. . 4 million left. Or was it 5? I stare at the page, feeling cheated. Lottery winners are supposed to be able to buy anything they want \u2014 but already I\u2019m feeling poor and inadequate.</p><p>I shove the paper aside and reach for a freebie brochure full of gorgeous white duvet covers at \u00a3100 each. That\u2019s more like it. When I\u2019ve won the lottery I\u2019ll only ever have crisp white duvet covers, I decide. And I\u2019ll have a white cast-iron bed and painted wooden shutters and a fluffy white dressing gown. .</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s the world of finance?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice interrupts me and I look up. She\u2019s bustling into the kitchen, still holding her Past Times catalogue. \u201cHave you made the coffee? Chop chop, darling!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to,\u201d I say, and make a half move from my chair. But, as always, Mum\u2019s there before me. She reaches for a ceramic storage jar I\u2019ve never seen before and spoons coffee into a new gold caf\u00e9ti\u00e8re.</p><p>Mum\u2019s terrible. She\u2019s always buying new stuff for the kitchen \u2014 and she just gives the old stuff to charity shops. New kettles, new toasters. . We\u2019ve already had three new rubbish bins this year \u2014 dark green, then chrome, and now yellow translucent plastic. I mean, what a waste of money.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice skirt!\u201d she says, looking at me as though for the first time. \u201cWhere\u2019s that from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDKNY,\u201d I mumble back.</p><p>\u201cVery pretty,\u201d she says. \u201cWas it expensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cAbout fifty quid.\u201d</p><p>This is not strictly true. It was nearer 150. But there\u2019s no point telling Mum how much things really cost, because she\u2019d have a coronary. Or, in fact, she\u2019d tell my dad first \u2014 and then they\u2019d both have coronaries, and I\u2019d be an orphan.</p><p>So what I do is work in two systems simultaneously. Real prices and Mum prices. It\u2019s a bit like when everything in the shop is 20 percent off, and you walk around mentally reducing everything. After a while, you get quite practiced.</p><p>The only difference is, I operate a sliding-scale system, a bit like income tax. It starts off at 20 percent (if it really cost \u00a320, I say it cost \u00a316) and rises up to. . well, to 90 percent if necessary. I once bought a pair of boots that cost \u00a3200, and I told Mum they were \u00a320 in the sale. And she believed me.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you looking for a flat?\u201d she says, glancing over my shoulder at the property pages.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say sulkily, and flick over a page of my brochure. My parents are always on at me to buy a flat. Do they know how much flats cost?</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cApparently, Thomas has bought a very nice little starter home in Reigate,\u201d she says, nodding toward our next-door neighbors. \u201cHe commutes.\u201d She says this with an air of satisfaction, as though she\u2019s telling me he\u2019s won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t afford a flat,\u201d I say. \u201cOr a starter home.\u201d</p><p>Not yet, anyway, I think. Not until eight o\u2019clock tonight. Hee hee hee.</p><p>\u201cMoney troubles?\u201d says Dad, coming into the kitchen. \u201cYou know, there are two solutions to money troubles.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes are twinkling, and I just know he\u2019s about to give me some clever little aphorism. Dad has a saying for every subject under the sun \u2014 as well as a wide selection of limericks and truly terrible jokes. Sometimes I like listening to them. Sometimes I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cC.B.,\u201d says Dad, his eyes twinkling. \u201cOr M.M.M.\u201d</p><p>He pauses for effect and I turn the page of my brochure, pretending I can\u2019t hear him.</p><p>\u201cCut Back,\u201d says my dad, \u201cor Make More Money. One or the other. Which is it to be, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, both, I expect,\u201d I say airily, and turn another page of my brochure. To be honest, I almost feel sorry for Dad. It\u2019ll be quite a shock for him when his only daughter becomes a multimillionaire overnight.</p> <p>After lunch, Mum and I go along to a craft fair in the local primary school. I\u2019m really just going to keep Mum company, and I\u2019m certainly not planning to buy anything \u2014 but when we get there, I find a stall full of amazing handmade cards, only \u00a31.50 each! So I buy ten. After all, you always need cards, don\u2019t you? There\u2019s also a gorgeous blue ceramic plant holder with little elephants going round it \u2014 and I\u2019ve been saying for ages we should have more plants in the flat. So I buy that, too. Only fifteen quid. Craft fairs are such a bargain, aren\u2019t they? You go along thinking they\u2019ll be complete rubbish \u2014 but you can always find something you want.</p><p>Mum\u2019s really happy, too, as she\u2019s found a pair of candlesticks for her collection. She\u2019s got collections of candlesticks, toast racks, pottery jugs, glass animals, embroidered samplers, and thimbles. (Personally, I don\u2019t think the thimbles count as a proper collection, because she got the whole lot, including the cabinet, from an ad at the back of the Mail on Sunday magazine. But she never tells anybody that. In fact, I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it.)</p><p>So anyway, we\u2019re both feeling rather pleased with ourselves, and decide to go for a cup of tea. Then, on the way out, we pass one of those really sad stalls which no one is going near; the kind people glance at once, then quickly walk past. The poor guy behind it looks really sorry for himself, so I pause to have a look. And no wonder no one\u2019s stopping. He\u2019s selling weird-shaped wooden bowls, and matching wooden cutlery. What on earth is the point of wooden cutlery?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice!\u201d I say brightly, and pick one of the bowls up.</p><p>\u201cHand-crafted applewood,\u201d he says. \u201cTook a week to make.\u201d</p><p>Well, it was a waste of a week, if you ask me. It\u2019s shapeless and the wood\u2019s a nasty shade of brown. But as I go to put it back down again, he looks so doleful I feel sorry for him and turn it over to look at the price, thinking if it\u2019s a fiver I\u2019ll buy it. But it\u2019s eighty quid! I show the price to Mum, and she pulls a little face.</p> <p>\u201cThat particular piece was featured in Elle Decoration last month,\u201d says the man mournfully, and produces a cutout page. And at his words, I freeze. Elle Decoration? Is he joking?</p><p>He\u2019s not joking. There on the page, in full color, is a picture of a room, completely empty except for a suede beanbag, a low table, and a wooden bowl. I stare at it incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWas it this exact one?\u201d I ask, trying not to sound too excited. \u201cThis exact bowl?\u201d As he nods, my grasp tightens round the bowl. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m holding a piece of Elle Decoration. How cool is that? Now I feel incredibly stylish and trendy \u2014 and wish I were wearing white linen trousers and had my hair slicked back like Yasmin Le Bon to match.</p><p>It just shows I\u2019ve got good taste. Didn\u2019t I pick out this bowl \u2014 sorry, this piece \u2014 all by myself? Didn\u2019t I spot its quality? Already I can see our sitting room redesigned entirely around it, all pale and minimalist. Eighty quid. That\u2019s nothing for a timeless piece of style like this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it,\u201d I say determinedly, and reach inside my bag for my checkbook. The thing is, I remind myself, buying cheap is actually a false economy. It\u2019s much better to spend a little more and make a serious purchase that\u2019ll last for a lifetime. And this bowl is quite clearly a classic. Suze is going to be so impressed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When we get back home, Mum goes straight inside, but I stay in the driveway, carefully transferring my purchases from her car to mine.</p><p>\u201cBecky! What a surprise!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. It\u2019s Martin Webster from next door, leaning over the fence with a rake in his hand and a huge friendly smile on his face. Martin has this way of always making me feel guilty, I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>Actually I do know why. It\u2019s because I know he was always hoping I would grow up and marry Tom, his son. And I haven\u2019t. The history of my relationship with Tom is: he asked me out once when we were both about sixteen and I said no, I was going out with Adam Moore. That was the end of it and thank God for that. To be perfectly honest, I would rather marry Martin himself than marry Tom.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say overenthusiastically. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re all doing well,\u201d says Martin. \u201cYou heard Tom\u2019s bought a house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cIn Reigate. Fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got two bedrooms, shower room, reception room, and open-plan kitchen,\u201d he recites. \u201cLimed oak units in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d I say. \u201cHow fab.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTom\u2019s thrilled with it,\u201d says Martin. \u201cJanice!\u201d he adds in a yell. \u201cCome and see who\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Janice appears on the front doorstep, wearing her floral apron.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d she says. \u201cWhat a stranger you\u2019ve become! How long is it?\u201d</p><p>Now I feel guilty for not visiting my parents more often.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, trying to give a nonchalant smile. \u201cYou know. I\u2019m quite busy with my job and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Janice, giving an awestricken nod. \u201cYour job.\u201d</p> <p>Somewhere along the line, Janice and Martin have got it into their heads that I\u2019m this high-powered financial whiz kid. I\u2019ve tried telling them that really, I\u2019m not \u2014 but the more I deny it, the more high powered they think I am. It\u2019s a catch-22. They now think I\u2019m high powered and modest.</p><p>Still, who cares? It\u2019s actually quite fun, playing a financial genius.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually we\u2019ve been quite busy lately,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cWhat with the merger of SBG and Rutland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d breathes Janice.</p><p>\u201cYou know, that reminds me,\u201d says Martin suddenly. \u201cBecky, wait there. Back in two ticks.\u201d He disappears before I can say anything, and I\u2019m left awkwardly with Janice.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say inanely. \u201cI hear Tom\u2019s got limed oak units in his kitchen!\u201d</p><p>This is literally the only thing I can think of to say. I smile at Janice, and wait for her to reply. But instead, she\u2019s beaming at me delightedly. Her face is all lit up \u2014 and suddenly I realize I\u2019ve made a huge mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned Tom\u2019s bloody starter home. I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the limed oak units. She\u2019ll think I suddenly fancy Tom, now he\u2019s got a starter home to his name.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s limed oak and Mediterranean tiles,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt was a choice of Mediterranean or Farmhouse Quarry, and Tom chose Mediterranean.\u201d</p> <p>For an instant I consider saying I would have chosen Farmhouse Quarry. But that seems a bit mean.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd two bedrooms!\u201d</p><p>Why can\u2019t I get off the subject of this bloody starter home?</p><p>\u201cHe wanted two bedrooms,\u201d says Janice. \u201cAfter all, you never know, do you?\u201d She smiles coyly at me, and ridiculously, I feel myself start to blush. Why am I blushing? This is so stupid. Now she thinks I fancy Tom. She\u2019s picturing us together in the starter home, making supper together in the limed oak kitchen.</p><p>I should say something. I should say, \u201cJanice, I don\u2019t fancy Tom. He\u2019s too tall and his breath smells.\u201d But how on earth can I say that?</p><p>\u201cWell, do give him my love,\u201d I hear myself saying instead.</p><p>\u201cI certainly will,\u201d she says, and pauses. \u201cDoes he have your London number?\u201d</p><p>Aarrgh!</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I lie, smiling brightly. \u201cAnd he can always get me here if he wants.\u201d Now everything I say sounds like some saucy double entendre. I can just imagine how this conversation will be reported back to Tom. \u201cShe was asking all about your starter home. And she asked you to call her!\u201d</p><p>Life would be a lot easier if conversations were rewindable and erasable, like videos. Or if you could instruct people to disregard what you just said, like in a courtroom. Please strike from the record all references to starter homes and limed oak kitchens.</p><p>Luckily, at that moment, Martin reappears, clutching a piece of paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThought you might cast your eye over this,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this with-profits fund with Flagstaff Life for fifteen years.

But there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll believe that I\u2019m not a financial genius \u2014 so I\u2019ll just have to do the best I can.</p><p>I run my eye over the piece of paper in what I hope looks like a knowledgeable fashion and nod several times. It\u2019s a letter making some kind of special offer if investors switch to this new fund.

I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve heard something about them recently. Which ones are Flagstaff Life? Oh yes! They\u2019re the ones who threw a champagne party at Soho Soho. That\u2019s right. And Elly got incredibly pissed and told David Salisbury from The Times that she loved him. It was a bloody good party, come to think of it. One of the best.</p><p>Hmm. But wasn\u2019t there something else? Something I\u2019ve heard recently? I wrinkle my nose, trying to remember. . but it\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve probably got it wrong, anyway.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you rate them as a company?\u201d says Martin.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, looking up. \u201cThey\u2019re very well regarded among the profession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d says Martin, looking pleased. \u201cIf Becky thinks it\u2019s a good idea. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, I really wouldn\u2019t just listen to me!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI mean, a financial adviser or someone would know far more. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to her!\u201d says Martin with a little chuckle. \u201cThe financial expert herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Tom sometimes buys your magazine,\u201d puts in Janice. \u201cNot that he\u2019s got much money now, what with the mortgage and everything. . But he says your articles are very good! Tom says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice!\u201d I cut in. \u201cWell, look, I really must go. Lovely to see you. And love to Tom!\u201d</p> <p>And I turn into the house so quickly, I bump my knee on the door frame. Then I feel a bit bad, and wish I\u2019d said good-bye nicely. But honestly! If I hear one more word about bloody Tom and his bloody kitchen, I\u2019ll go mad.</p><p>By the time I sit down in front of the National Lottery, however, I\u2019ve forgotten all about them. We\u2019ve had a nice supper \u2014 chicken Proven\u00e7ale from Marks and Spencer, and a nice bottle of Pinot Grigio, which I brought. I know the chicken Proven\u00e7ale comes from Marks and Spencer because I\u2019ve bought it myself, quite a few times. I recognized the sun-dried tomatoes and the olives, and everything. Mum, of course, still acted like she\u2019d made it from scratch, from her own recipe.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why she bothers. It isn\u2019t like anyone would care \u2014 especially when it\u2019s just me and Dad. And I mean, it\u2019s pretty obvious that there are never any raw ingredients in our kitchen. There are lots of empty cardboard boxes and lots of fully prepared meals \u2014 and nothing in between. But still Mum never ever admits she\u2019s bought a ready-made meal, not even when it\u2019s a pie in a foil container. My dad will eat one of those pies, full of plastic mushrooms and gloopy sauce, and then say, with a perfectly straight face, \u201cDelicious, my love.\u201d And my mum will smile back, looking all pleased with herself.</p><p>But tonight it\u2019s not foil pie, it\u2019s chicken Proven\u00e7ale. (To be fair, I suppose it almost does look homemade \u2014 except no one would ever cut a red pepper up that small for themselves, would they? People have more important things to do.) So anyway, we\u2019ve eaten it and we\u2019ve drunk a fair amount of the Pinot Grigio, and there\u2019s an apple crumble in the oven \u2014 and I\u2019ve suggested, casually, that we all go and watch telly. Because I know from looking at the clock that the National Lottery program has already started. In a matter of minutes, it\u2019s all going to happen. I cannot wait.</p><p>Luckily, my parents aren\u2019t the sort who want to make conversation about politics or talk about books. We\u2019ve already caught up with all the family news, and I\u2019ve told them how my work\u2019s going, and they\u2019ve told me about their holiday in Corsica \u2014 so by now, we\u2019re grinding to a bit of a halt. We need the telly on, if only as a conversational sounding board. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So we all troop into the sitting room, and my dad lights the gas flame-effect fire and turns on the telly. And there it is! The National Lottery, in glorious Technicolor. The lights are shining, and Dale Winton is joshing with Tiffany from EastEnders, and every so often the audience gives an excited whoop. My stomach\u2019s getting tighter and tighter, and my heart\u2019s going thump-thump-thump. Because in a few minutes those balls are going to fall. In a few minutes I\u2019m going to be a millionaire. I just know I am.</p><p>I lean calmly back on the sofa and think what I\u2019ll do when I win. At the very instant that I win, I mean. Do I scream? Do I keep quiet? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t tell anyone for twenty-four hours. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t tell anyone at all.</p><p>This new thought transfixes me. I could be a secret winner! I could have all the money and none of the pressure. If people asked me how I could afford so many designer clothes I\u2019d just tell them I was doing lots of freelance work. Yes! And I could transform all my friends\u2019 lives anonymously, like a good angel.</p><p>I\u2019m just working out how big a house I could manage to buy without everyone twigging, when a voice on the screen alerts me.</p> <p>\u201cQuestion to number three.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cMy favorite animal is the flamingo because it\u2019s pink, fluffy, and has long legs.\u201d The girl sitting on the stool excitedly unwinds a pair of long glossy legs, and the audience goes wild. I stare at her dazedly. What\u2019s going on? Why are we watching Blind Date?</p><p>\u201cNow, this show used to be fun,\u201d says Mum. \u201cBut it\u2019s gone downhill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call this rubbish fun?\u201d retorts my dad incredulously.</p> <p>\u201cListen, Dad, actually, could we turn back to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was fun now. I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I say, trying not to sound too panicky. \u201cCould we just go back to BBC1 for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Blind Date disappears and I sigh with relief. The next moment, an earnest man in a suit fills the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat the police failed to appreciate,\u201d he says in a nasal voice, \u201cis that the witnesses were not sufficiently\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the television guide?\u201d he says impatiently. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the lottery!\u201d I almost scream. \u201cI want to watch the lottery!\u201d</p><p>I know strictly speaking that whether I watch it or not won\u2019t affect my chances of winning \u2014 but I don\u2019t want to miss the great moment, do I? You might think I\u2019m a bit mad, but I feel that if I watch it, I can kind of communicate with the balls through the screen. I\u2019ll stare hard at them as they get tossed around and silently urge on my winning numbers. It\u2019s a bit like supporting a team. Team 1 6 9 16 23 44.</p><p>Except the numbers never come out in order, do they?</p><p>Team 44 1 23 6 9 16. Possibly. Or Team 23 6 1. .</p><p>Suddenly there\u2019s a round of applause and Martine McCutcheon\u2019s finished her song. Oh my God. It\u2019s about to happen. My life is about to change.</p><p>\u201cThe lottery\u2019s become terribly commercialized, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d says my mum, as Dale Winton leads Martine over to the red button. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s become commercialized?\u201d retorts my dad.</p> <p>\u201cPeople used to play the lottery because they wanted to support the charities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they didn\u2019t! Don\u2019t be ridiculous! No one gives a fig about the charities. This is all about self, self, self.\u201d Dad gestures toward Dale Winton with the remote control and the screen goes dead.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I wail.</p><p>\u201cSo you think no one cares about the charities?\u201d says my mum into the silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad! Put it back on!\u201d I screech. \u201cPut-it-back-on!\u201d I\u2019m about to wrestle him for the remote control when he flicks it back on again.</p><p>I stare at the screen in utter disbelief. The first ball has already dropped. And it\u2019s 44. My number 44.</p><p>\u201c. . last appeared three weeks ago. And here comes the second ball. . And it\u2019s number 1.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t move. It\u2019s taking place, before my very eyes. I\u2019m actually winning the lottery. I\u2019m winning the bloody lottery!</p><p>Now that it\u2019s happening, I feel surprisingly calm about it. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve known, all my life, that this would happen. Sitting here silently on the sofa, I feel as though I\u2019m in a fly-on-the-wall documentary about myself. \u201cBecky Bloomwood always secretly knew she would win the lottery one day. But on the day it happened, even she couldn\u2019t have predicted. .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd another low one. Number 3.\u201d</p><p>What? My mind snaps to and I stare perplexedly at the screen. That can\u2019t be right. They mean 23.</p><p>\u201cAnd number 2, last week\u2019s bonus ball.\u201d</p><p>I feel cold all over. What the hell is going on? What are these numbers?</p> <p>\u201cAnd another low one! Number 4. A popular number \u2014 it\u2019s had twelve appearances so far this year. And finally. . number 5! Well, I never! This is a bit of a first! Now, lining them up in order. .\u201d</p><p>No. This can\u2019t be serious. This has to be a mistake. The winning lottery numbers cannot possibly be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 44. That\u2019s not a lottery combination, it\u2019s a. . it\u2019s an act of torture.</p><p>And I was winning. I was winning.</p><p>\u201cLook at that!\u201d my mum\u2019s saying. \u201cAbsolutely incredible! One \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 four \u2014 five \u2014 forty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why should that be incredible?\u201d replies Dad. \u201cIt\u2019s as likely as any other combination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, do you know anything about the laws of probability?\u201d</p><p>Quietly I get up and leave the room, as the National Lottery theme tune blares out of the telly. I walk into the kitchen, sit down at the table, and bury my head in my hands. I feel slightly shaky, to tell you the truth. How could I lose? I was living in a big house and going on holiday to Barbados with all my friends, and walking into Agn\u00e8s b and buying anything I wanted. It felt so real.</p><p>And now, instead, I\u2019m sitting in my parents\u2019 kitchen, and I can\u2019t afford to go on holiday and I\u2019ve just spent eighty quid on a wooden bowl I don\u2019t even like.</p><p>Miserably, I turn on the kettle, pick up a copy of Woman\u2019s Journal lying on the counter, and flick through it \u2014 but even that doesn\u2019t cheer me up. Everything seems to remind me of money. Maybe my dad\u2019s right, I find myself thinking dolefully. Maybe Cut Back is the answer. Suppose. . suppose I cut back enough to save sixty quid a week. I\u2019d have \u00a36,000 in a hundred weeks.</p><p>And suddenly my brain is alert. Six thousand quid. That\u2019s not bad, is it? And if you think about it, it can\u2019t be that hard to save sixty quid a week. It\u2019s only the same as a couple of meals out. I mean, you\u2019d hardly notice it.</p> <p>God, yes. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. Sixty quid a week, every week. Maybe I\u2019ll even pay it into a special account. That new Lloyds high-yield sixty-day access account with the tiered interest rates. It\u2019ll be fantastic! I\u2019ll be completely on top of my finances \u2014 and when I\u2019ve paid off my bills I\u2019ll just keep saving. It\u2019ll become a habit to be frugal. And at the end of every year I\u2019ll splash out on one classic investment like an Armani suit. Or maybe Christian Dior. Something really classy, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019ll start on Monday, I think excitedly, spooning chocolate Ovaltine into a cup. What I\u2019ll do is, I just won\u2019t spend anything. All my spare money will mount up, and I\u2019ll be rich. This is going to be so great.</p><p>OCTAGON \u2014 flair style \u2022 vision</p><p>Financial Services Department</p><p>8th Floor, Tower House</p><p>London Road, Winchester SO44 3DR</p><p>Ms. Rebecca Bloomwood Charge Card Number 7854 4567Flat 24 Burney Rd.London SW6 8FD</p><p>2 March 2000</p> <p>Dear Ms. Bloomwood: Our records suggest that we have not received payment for your latest Octagon Silver Card bill.

SIMPLICITY. THESE ARE my new watchwords. A new, uncluttered, Zen-like life, in which I spend nothing. Spend nothing. I mean, when you think about it, how much money do we all waste every day? No wonder I\u2019m in a little bit of debt. And really, it\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019ve merely been succumbing to the Western drag of materialism \u2014 which you have to have the strength of elephants to resist. At least, that\u2019s what it says in my new book.</p><p>You see, yesterday, when Mum and I went into Waterstone\u2019s to buy her paperback for the week, I sidled off to the self-help section and bought the most wonderful book I\u2019ve ever read. Quite honestly, it\u2019s going to change my life. I\u2019ve got it now, in my bag. It\u2019s called Controlling Your Cash by David E. Barton, and it\u2019s fantastic. What it says is that we can all fritter away money without realizing it, and that most of us could easily cut our cash consumption by half in just one week.</p><p>In one week!</p> <p>You just have to do things like make your own sandwiches instead of eating in restaurants and ride a bike to work instead of taking the tube. When you start thinking about it, you can save money everywhere. And as David E. Barton says, there are lots of free pleasures which we forget because we\u2019re so busy spending money, like parks and museums and the simple joy of a country walk.</p><p>Come to think of it, why don\u2019t we put information like this in Successful Saving? It\u2019s so much more useful than knowing about some fancy new unit trust which might make a profit or might not. I mean, with this scheme you start making money straight away!</p><p>It\u2019s all so easy and straightforward. And the best thing is, you have to start out by going shopping! The book says you should begin by itemizing every single purchase in a single normal spending day and plot it on a graph. It stresses that you should be honest and not suddenly curtail or alter your spending pattern \u2014 which is lucky, because it\u2019s Suze\u2019s birthday on Friday and I\u2019ve got to get her a present.</p><p>So on Monday morning, I stop off at Lucio\u2019s on the way into work and buy an extralarge cappuccino and a chocolate muffin, just like I usually do. I have to admit I feel a bit sorrowful as I hand over my money, because this is my last-ever cappuccino and my last-ever chocolate muffin. My new frugality starts tomorrow \u2014 and cappuccinos aren\u2019t allowed. David E. Barton says if you have a coffee habit you should make it at home and take it into the office in a flask, and if you like eating snacks you should buy cheap cakes from the supermarket. \u201cThe coffee merchants are fleecing you for what is little more than hot water and polystyrene,\u201d he points out \u2014 and I suppose he\u2019s right. But I will miss my morning cappuccino. Still, I\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019ll follow the rules of the book \u2014 and I will.</p><p>As I come out of the coffee shop, clutching my last-ever cup, I realize I don\u2019t actually have a flask for coffee. But that\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll buy one. There are some lovely sleek chrome ones in Habitat. Flasks are actually quite trendy these days. I think Alessi might even do one. Wouldn\u2019t that be cool? Drinking coffee out of an Alessi flask. Much cooler than a takeaway cappuccino.</p> <p>So I\u2019m feeling quite happy as I walk along the street. When I get to Smiths I pop in and stock up on a few magazines to keep me going \u2014 and I also buy a sweet little silver notebook and pen to write down everything I spend. I\u2019m going to be really rigorous about this, because David E. Barton says the very act of noting down purchases should have a curtailing effect. So when I get into work, I start my list. Cappuccino \u00a31.50Muffin \u00a31.00Notebook \u00a33.99Pen \u00a31.20Magazines \u00a36.40</p><p>Which makes a grand total so far of. . \u00a314.09.</p><p>Gosh. I suppose that\u2019s quite a lot, bearing in mind it\u2019s only nine-forty in the morning.</p><p>But the notebook and pen don\u2019t count, do they? They\u2019re like course requirements. I mean, how on earth are you supposed to note down all your purchases without a notebook and pen? So I subtract both of those, and now my total comes to. . \u00a38.90. Which is much better.</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019m at work now. I probably won\u2019t spend anything else all day.</p><p>But somehow, spending nothing is absolutely impossible. First of all, Guy from Accounts comes round with yet another leaving present to give to. Then I have to go out and get some lunch. I\u2019m very restrained with my sandwich \u2014 I choose egg and cress, which is the cheapest one at Boots, and I don\u2019t even like egg and cress.</p> <p>David E. Barton says that when you make a real effort, particularly in the early stages, you should reward yourself \u2014 so I pick up some coconut bath oil from the Natural range as a little treat. Then I notice there are double advantage points on the moisturizer I use. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I love advantage points. Aren\u2019t they a wonderful invention? If you spend enough, you can get really good prizes, like a beauty day at a hotel. Last Christmas I was really canny \u2014 I let my points build up until I\u2019d accumulated enough to buy my granny\u2019s Christmas present. What happened in fact was, I\u2019d already built up 1,653 points \u2014 and I needed 1,800 to buy her a heated roller set. So I bought myself a great big bottle of Samsara perfume, and that gave me 150 extra points on my card \u2014 and then I got the heated roller set absolutely free! The only thing is, I don\u2019t much like Samsara perfume \u2014 but I didn\u2019t realize that until I got home. Still, never mind.</p><p>The clever way to use advantage points \u2014 as with all special offers \u2014 is to spot the opportunity and use it, because it may not come your way again. So I grab three pots of moisturizer and buy them. Double advantage points! I mean, it\u2019s just free money, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Then I have to get Suze\u2019s birthday present. I\u2019ve actually already bought her a set of aromatherapy oils \u2014 but the other day I saw this gorgeous pink angora cardigan in Benetton, and I know she\u2019d love it. I can always take the aromatherapy oils back or give them to someone for Christmas.</p><p>So I go into Benetton and pick up the pink cardigan. I\u2019m about to pay. . when I notice they\u2019ve got it in gray as well. The most perfect, soft, dove-gray angora cardigan, with little pearly buttons.</p> <p>Oh God. You see, the thing is, I\u2019ve been looking for a nice gray cardigan for ages. Honestly, I have. You can ask Suze, my mum, anybody. And the other thing is, I\u2019m not actually on my new frugal regime yet, am I? I\u2019m just monitoring myself.</p><p>David E. Barton says I should act as naturally as possible. So really, I ought to act on my natural impulses and buy it. It would be false not to. It would ruin the whole point.</p><p>It only costs forty-five quid. And I can put it on VISA.</p><p>Look at it another way \u2014 what\u2019s forty-five quid in the grand scheme of things? I mean, it\u2019s nothing, is it?</p><p>So I buy it. The most perfect little cardigan in the world. People will call me the Girl in the Gray Cardigan. I\u2019ll be able to live in it. Really, it\u2019s an investment.</p> <p>After lunch, I have to go and visit Image Store to choose a front-cover picture for the next issue. This is my absolute favorite job \u2014 I can\u2019t understand why Philip always offloads it onto someone else. It basically means you get to go and sit drinking coffee all afternoon, looking at rows and rows of transparencies.</p><p>Because, of course, we don\u2019t have the editorial budget to create our own front covers. God, no. When I first started out in journalism, I thought I\u2019d be able to go to shoots, and meet models, and have a really glamorous time. But we don\u2019t even have a cameraman. All our sorts of magazines use picture libraries like Image Store, and the same images tend to go round and round. There\u2019s a picture of a roaring tiger that\u2019s been on at least three personal finance covers in the last year. Still, the readers don\u2019t mind, do they? They\u2019re not exactly buying the magazines to look at Kate Moss.</p><p>The good thing is that Elly\u2019s editor doesn\u2019t like choosing front covers either \u2014 and they use Image Store, too. So we always try to work it that we\u2019ll go together and have a good natter over the pics. Even better, Image Store is all the way over in Notting Hill Gate, so you can legitimately take ages getting there and back. Usually I don\u2019t bother going back to the office. Really, it\u2019s the perfect way to spend a weekday afternoon.</p><p>I get there before Elly and mutter, \u201cBecky Bloomwood from Successful Saving,\u201d to the girl at reception, wishing I could say \u201cBecky Bloomwood from Vogue\u201d or \u201cBecky Bloomwood from Wall Street Journal.\u201d Then I sit on a squashy black leather chair, flicking through a catalogue of pictures of glossy happy families, until one of the trendy young men who works there comes and leads me to my own illuminated table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Paul,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019ll be looking after you today. Do you know what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. .\u201d I say, and pull out my notebook. We had a meeting about the cover yesterday and eventually decided on \u201cPortfolio Management: Getting the Right Balance.\u201d And before your head falls off with boredom, let me just point out that last month, the cover line was \u201cDeposit Accounts: Put to the Test.\u201d</p> <p>Why can\u2019t we just once put self-tanning creams to the test instead? Oh well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for pictures of scales,\u201d I say, reading off my list. \u201cOr tightropes, unicycles. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBalancing images,\u201d says Paul. \u201cNo problem.

She\u2019s looking really smart, in an aubergine-colored suit and high heels.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s swimmers, boats, and European images,\u201d says Paul to her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d says Elly, and sinks into the chair beside me.</p> <p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d I say. \u201cSomething about floating currencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d says Elly. \u201cActually, it\u2019s \u2018Europe: Sink or Swim\u2019?\u201d She says it in an incredibly dramatic voice, and Paul and I both start giggling. When he\u2019s walked away, I look her up and down.</p><p>\u201cSo how come you\u2019re so smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always look smart,\u201d she parries. \u201cYou know that.\u201d Paul\u2019s already wheeling trolley-loads of transparencies toward us and she looks over at them. \u201cAre these yours or mine?\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s avoiding the subject. What\u2019s going on?</p> <p>\u201cHave you got an interview?\u201d I say, in a sudden flash of genius. She looks at me, flushes, then pulls a sheet of transparencies out of the trolley.</p><p>\u201cCircus acts,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople juggling. Is that what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElly! Have you got an interview? Tell me!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while. Elly stares down at the sheet, then looks up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, and bites her lip. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d I exclaim, and a couple of smooth-looking girls in the corner look up. \u201cWho for?\u201d I say more quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not Cosmo, is it?\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re interrupted by Paul, who comes over with a coffee and puts it in front of Elly.</p><p>\u201cSwimmers coming up,\u201d he says, then grins and walks off.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it for?\u201d I repeat. Elly applies for so many jobs, I lose track.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wetherby\u2019s,\u201d she says, and a pink flush creeps over her face.</p><p>\u201cWetherby\u2019s Investments?\u201d She gives a very slight nod, and I frown in bemusement. Why is she applying to Wetherby\u2019s Investments? \u201cHave they got an in-house magazine or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not applying to be a journalist,\u201d she says in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m applying to be a fund manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, appalled.</p><p>I know friends should be supportive of each other\u2019s life decisions and all that. But I\u2019m sorry, a fund manager?</p> <p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t even get it,\u201d she says, and looks away. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m speechless. How can Elly even be thinking of becoming a fund manager? Fund managers aren\u2019t real people. They\u2019re the characters we laugh at on press trips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an idea,\u201d she says defensively. \u201cMaybe I want to show Carol I can do something else. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like. . a bargaining tool?\u201d I hazard.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, and gives a little shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s it. A bargaining tool.\u201d</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t sound exactly convinced \u2014 and she\u2019s not nearly as chatty as usual during the rest of the afternoon. What\u2019s happened to her? I\u2019m still puzzling over it as I make my way home from Image Store. I walk down to High Street Kensington, cross over the road, and hesitate in front of Marks and Spencer.</p><p>The tube is to my right. The shops are to my left.</p><p>I must ignore the shops. I must practice frugality, go straight home, and plot my expenditure graph. If I need entertainment, I can watch some nice free television and perhaps make some inexpensive, nutritious soup.</p><p>But there\u2019s nothing good on tonight, at least not until EastEnders. And I don\u2019t want soup. I really feel as if I need something to cheer me up. And besides \u2014 my mind\u2019s working fast \u2014 I\u2019ll be giving it all up tomorrow, won\u2019t I? It\u2019s like the beginning of Lent. This is my Shopping Pancake Day. I need to cram it all in before the fast begins.</p><p>With a surge of excitement I hurry toward the Barkers Centre. I won\u2019t go mad, I promise myself. Just one little treat to see me through. I\u2019ve already got my cardigan \u2014 so not clothes. . and I bought some new kitten heels the other day \u2014 so not that. . although there are some nice Prada-type shoes in Hobbs. . Hmm. I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>I arrive at the cosmetics department of Barkers and suddenly I know. Makeup! That\u2019s what I need. A new mascara, and maybe a new lipstick. Happily I start to wander around the bright, heady room, dodging sprays of perfume and painting lipsticks onto the back of my hand. I want a really pale lipstick, I decide. Sort of nudey beige/pink, and a lip liner to go with it. . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the Clarins counter, my attention is grabbed by a big promotional sign. BUY TWO SKIN-CARE PRODUCTS, AND RECEIVE FREE BEAUTY BAG, CONTAINING TRIAL-SIZE CLEANSER, TONER, AND MOISTURIZER, AUTUMN BLAZE LIPSTICK, EXTRA STRENGTH MASCARA AND SAMPLE-SIZE EAU DYNAMISANTE. STOCKS LIMITED SO HURRY.</p><p>But this is fantastic! Do you know how much Clarins lipstick usually costs? And here they are, giving it away! Excitedly I start rooting through all the skin-care products, trying to decide which two to buy. How about some neck cream? I\u2019ve never used that before. And some of this Revitalizing Moisturizer. And then I\u2019ll get a free lipstick! It\u2019s a complete bargain.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say to the woman in the white uniform. \u201cI\u2019d like the Neck Cream and the Revitalizing Moisturizer. And the beauty bag,\u201d I add, suddenly petrified that I might be too late; that the limited stocks might have run out.</p><p>But they haven\u2019t! Thank God. As my VISA card\u2019s processing, the woman hands me my shiny red beauty bag (which I have to admit is a bit smaller than I was expecting) and I excitedly open it up. And there, sure enough, is my free lipstick!</p> <p>It\u2019s a kind of browny-red color. A bit weird, actually. But if I mix it up a bit with some of my others and add a bit of lip gloss, it\u2019ll look really good.</p><p>By the time I get home, I\u2019m exhausted. I open the door to the flat and Suze comes rushing up, like a puppy.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you get?\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d I cry back. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to look! It\u2019s your present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy present!\u201d Suze gets overexcited about birthdays. Well, to be honest, so do I.</p> <p>I hurry into my bedroom and hide the Benetton bag in the wardrobe. Then I unpack all the rest of my shopping and get out my little silver notebook to itemize my purchases. David E. Barton says this should be done straight away, before items can be forgotten.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want a drink?\u201d comes Suze\u2019s voice through the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d I shout back, writing in my book, and a moment later she comes in with a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cEastEnders in a minute,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say absently, and keep on writing. I\u2019m following the rules of the book exactly, taking out all my receipts and writing them all down, and I\u2019m feeling really pleased with myself. It just shows, as David E. Barton says, that with a bit of application, anyone can gain control of their finances.</p><p>Come to think of it, I\u2019ve bought quite a lot of moisturizer today, haven\u2019t I? To be honest, when I was at the Clarins counter, buying my Revitalizing Moisturizer, I forgot about all those pots I\u2019d bought at Boots. Still, never mind. You always need moisturizer. It\u2019s a staple, like bread and milk, and David E. Barton says you should never scrimp on staples. And apart from that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done too badly. Of course I haven\u2019t added it all up yet, but. .</p> <p>OK. So here is my final and complete list: Cappuccino \u00a31.50Muffin \u00a31.00Notebook \u00a33.99Pen \u00a31.20Magazines \u00a36.40Leaving present \u00a34.00Egg and cress sandwich 99pCoconut bath oil \u00a32.55Boots Moisturizers \u00a320.97Two cardigans \u00a390.00Evening Standard 35pClarins Neck Cream \u00a314.5 \u00b0Clarins Moisturizer \u00a332.50Beauty Bag Free!Banana smoothie \u00a32.0 \u00b0Carrot cake \u00a31.20</p><p>And that comes to a grand total of. . \u00a3177.96</p><p>I stare at this figure in utter shock.</p><p>No, I\u2019m sorry, that just can\u2019t be right. It can\u2019t be right. I can\u2019t have spent over \u00a3170 in one day.</p><p>I mean, it isn\u2019t even the weekend. I\u2019ve been at work. I wouldn\u2019t have had time to spend that much. There has to be something wrong somewhere. Maybe I haven\u2019t added it up right. Or maybe I\u2019ve entered something twice.</p><p>My eye runs more carefully down the list and suddenly stops in triumph. \u201cTwo cardigans.\u201d I knew it! I only bought. .</p><p>Oh yes. I did buy two, didn\u2019t I? Blast. Oh, this is too depressing.

The thing is not to get freaked out by how much I happened to spend yesterday. It\u2019s water under the bridge. The point is, today is the beginning of my new frugal life. From now on, I\u2019m just going to spend absolutely nothing. David E. Barton says you should aim to cut your expenditure by half in the first week, but I reckon I can do much better than that. I mean, not wanting to be rude, but these self-help books are always for people with absolutely zero self-control, aren\u2019t they? And I gave up smoking easily enough. (Except socially, but that doesn\u2019t count.)</p><p>I feel quite exhilarated as I make myself a cheese sandwich and wrap it up in tinfoil. I\u2019ve already saved a couple of quid, just by doing that! I haven\u2019t got a flask (must buy one at the weekend), so I can\u2019t take in coffee, but there\u2019s a bottle of Peach Herbal Blast in the fridge so I decide I\u2019ll take that instead. It\u2019ll be healthier, too.</p><p>In fact, it makes you wonder why people buy shop-made sandwiches at all. Look how cheap and easy it is to make your own. And it\u2019s the same with curries. David E. Barton says instead of forking out for expensive takeaway meals you should learn how to make your own curries and stir-fries, for a fraction of the cost. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do this weekend, after I\u2019ve been to a museum or maybe just walked along the river, enjoying the scenery.</p><p>As I walk along to the tube I feel pure and refreshed. Stern, almost. Look at all these people on the street, scurrying around, thinking about nothing but money. Money, money, money. It\u2019s an obsession. But once you relinquish money altogether, it ceases to have any relevance. Already I feel I\u2019m in a completely different mindset. Less materialistic, more philosophical. More spiritual. As David E. Barton says, we all fail to appreciate each day just how much we already possess. Light, air, freedom, the companionship of friends. . I mean, these are the things that matter, aren\u2019t they?</p><p>It\u2019s almost frightening, the transformation that\u2019s already occurred within me. For example, I walk past the magazine kiosk at the tube station and idly glance over, but I don\u2019t feel the slightest desire to buy any of the magazines. Magazines are irrelevant in my new life. (Plus I\u2019ve already read most of them.)</p> <p>So I get on the tube feeling serene and impervious, like a Buddhist monk. When I get off the tube at the other end, I walk straight past the discount shoe shop without even looking, and straight past Lucio\u2019s, too. No cappuccino today. No muffin. No spending at all \u2014 just straight to the office.</p><p>It\u2019s quite an easy time of the month for Successful Saving. We\u2019ve only just put the latest issue of the magazine to bed, which basically means we can laze around for a few days doing nothing, before getting our acts together for the next issue. Of course, we\u2019re meant to be starting on research for next month\u2019s article. In fact, I\u2019m supposed to be making phone calls to a list of stockbrokers today, asking for their investment tips for the next six months. But I already know what they\u2019re all going to say. Jon Burrins will go on about the problems with e-commerce stocks, George Steadman will enthuse about some tiny biotechnology company, and Steve Fox will tell me how he wants to get out of the stockbroking game and start an organic farm.</p><p>Somehow the whole morning goes by and I haven\u2019t done anything, just changed the screen saver on my computer to three yellow fish and an octopus, and written out an expense claim form. To be honest, I can\u2019t really concentrate on proper work. I suppose I\u2019m too exhilarated by my new pure self. I keep trying to work out how much I\u2019ll have saved by the end of the month and what I\u2019ll be able to afford in Jigsaw.</p><p>At lunchtime I take out my sandwich wrapped in foil \u2014 and for the first time that day, I feel a bit depressed. The bread\u2019s gone all soggy, and some pickle\u2019s leaked out onto the foil, and it really doesn\u2019t look very appetizing at all. What I crave at that moment is Pret \u00e0 Manger walnut bread and a chocolate brownie.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it, I instruct myself firmly. Think how much money you\u2019re saving. So somehow I force myself to eat my soggy effort, and swig down some Peach Herbal Blast. When I\u2019ve finished, I throw away my foil, screw the top back on the Peach Herbal Blast bottle, and put it in our tiny office fridge. And that\u2019s about. . five minutes of my lunch break gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So what am I supposed to do next? Where am I supposed to go?</p><p>I slump miserably at my desk. God, this frugality is hard going. I leaf dispiritedly through a few folders. . then raise my head and stare out of the window, at all the busy Oxford Street shoppers clutching carrier bags. I want to get out there so desperately, I\u2019m actually leaning forward in my chair, like a plant toward the light. I\u2019m craving the bright lights and warm air, the racks of merchandise, even the bleep of the cash registers. But I can\u2019t go. This morning I told myself that I wouldn\u2019t go near the shops all day. I promised myself \u2014 and I can\u2019t break my own promise.</p><p>Then a brilliant thought occurs to me. I need to get a curry recipe for my homemade takeaway, don\u2019t I? David E. Barton says recipe books are a waste of money. He says you should use the recipes printed on the sides of food packets, or take books out of the library. But I\u2019ve got an even better idea. I\u2019ll go into Smith\u2019s and copy out a curry recipe to make on Saturday night. That way, I can go into a shop, but I don\u2019t need to spend any money. Already I\u2019m scrambling to my feet, reaching for my coat. Shops, here I come!</p><p>As I walk into Smith\u2019s I feel my whole body expand in relief. There\u2019s a thrill about walking into a shop \u2014 any shop \u2014 which you can\u2019t beat. It\u2019s partly the anticipation, partly the buzzy, welcoming atmosphere, partly just the lovely newness of everything. Shiny new magazines, shiny new pencils, shiny new protractors. Not that I\u2019ve needed a protractor since I was eleven \u2014 but don\u2019t they look nice, all clean and unscratched in their packets? There\u2019s a new range of leopard-print stationery that I haven\u2019t seen before, and for a moment I\u2019m almost tempted to linger. But instead I force myself to stride on past, down to the back of the shop where the books are stacked.</p> <p>There\u2019s a whole array of Indian recipe books, and I pick up one at random, flicking over the pages and wondering what sort of recipe I should go for. I hadn\u2019t realized quite how complicated this Indian cookery is. Perhaps I should write down a couple, to be on the safe side.</p><p>I look around cautiously and take out my notebook and pen. I\u2019m a bit wary, because I know Smith\u2019s doesn\u2019t like you copying down stuff out of their books. The reason I know this is because Suze once got asked to leave the Smith\u2019s in Victoria. She was copying out a page of the street atlas, because she\u2019d forgotten hers \u2014 and they told her she had to either buy it or leave. (Which doesn\u2019t make any sense, because they let you read the magazines for free, don\u2019t they?)</p><p>So anyway, when I\u2019m sure no one\u2019s looking, I start copying out the recipe for \u201cTiger Prawn Biriani.\u201d I\u2019m halfway through the list of spices when a girl in WHSmith uniform comes round the corner, so I quickly close the book and walk off a little, pretending I\u2019m browsing. When I think I\u2019m safe, I open it again \u2014 but before I can write anything down, an old woman in a blue coat says loudly, \u201cIs that any good, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThe book!\u201d She gestures to the recipe book with her umbrella. \u201cI need a present for my daughter-in-law, and she comes from India. So I thought I\u2019d get a nice Indian recipe book. Is that a good one, would you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cI haven\u2019t read it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, and starts to wander off. And I ought to keep my mouth shut and mind my own business \u2014 but I just can\u2019t leave it there, I have to clear my throat and say, \u201cExcuse me \u2014 but doesn\u2019t she have lots of Indian recipes already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, dear?\u201d says the woman, turning round.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter-in-law!\u201d Already I\u2019m regretting this. \u201cIf she\u2019s Indian, doesn\u2019t she already know how to cook Indian food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says the old woman. She seems completely flummoxed. \u201cWell, what should I get, then?\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe a book on. . on something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea!\u201d she says brightly, and comes toward me. \u201cYou show me, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, looking helplessly around the racks of books. \u201cWhat\u2019s she interested in? Does she. . have any particular hobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes the fresh air,\u201d says the woman thoughtfully. \u201cWalking in the countryside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d I say in relief. \u201cWhy not try the travel section for a walking book?\u201d</p><p>I point the woman in the right direction, then hurry off to do my copying. I reach the CD and video section, which is always quite empty, and hide behind a rack of Teletubbies videos. I glance around and check no one\u2019s about, then open the book again. Okay, turn to page 214, \u201cTiger Prawn Biriani\u201d. . I start copying again, and I\u2019ve just got to the end of the list of spices, when a stern voice says in my ear, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m so startled, my pen jerks off my notebook and, to my horror, makes a blue line, straight across a photograph of perfectly cooked basmati rice.

Slowly he opens the book out again and we both stare at my blue Biro line.</p><p>\u201cBrowsing is one thing,\u201d says the man sternly. \u201cDefacing shop stock is another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d I say. \u201cYou startled me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d says the man, and gives me a hard stare. \u201cWere you actually intending to buy this book? Or any book?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 then, rather shamefacedly, I say, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says the man, tightening his lips. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid this matter will have to go to the manager. Obviously, we can\u2019t sell this book now, so it\u2019s our loss. If you could come with me and explain to her exactly what you were doing when the defacement occurred. .\u201d</p><p>Is he serious? Isn\u2019t he just going to tell me kindly that it doesn\u2019t matter and would I like a loyalty card? My heart starts to thud in panic. What am I going to do? Obviously, I can\u2019t buy the book, under my new frugal regime. But I don\u2019t want to go and see the manager, either.</p> <p>\u201cLynn?\u201d the man\u2019s calling to an assistant at the pen counter. \u201cCould you page Glenys for me, please?\u201d</p><p>He really is serious. He\u2019s looking all pleased with himself, as though he\u2019s caught a shoplifter. Can they prosecute you for making Biro marks in books? Maybe it counts as vandalism. I\u2019ll have a criminal record. I won\u2019t ever be able to go to America.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll buy it, okay?\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ll buy the bloody book.\u201d I wrench it from the man\u2019s grasp and hurry off to the checkout before he can say anything else.</p><p>Standing at the next checkout is the old woman in the blue coat, and she calls triumphantly, \u201cI took your advice! I\u2019ve got her one of those traveling books. I think she\u2019ll really like it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good,\u201d I reply, handing my recipe book over to be scanned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called The Rough Guide to India,\u201d says the old woman, showing me the fat blue paperback. \u201cHave you heard of it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u00a324.99, please,\u201d says the girl at my till.</p><p>What? I look at the girl in dismay. Twenty-five quid, just for recipes? Why couldn\u2019t I have picked up some cheap paperback? Damn. Damn. Very reluctantly, I take out my credit card and hand it over. Shopping is one thing, being forced into purchases against your will is something else. I mean, I could have bought some nice underwear with that twenty-five quid.</p><p>On the other hand, I think as I walk away, that\u2019s quite a lot of new points on my Club Card. The equivalent to. . fifty pence! And now I\u2019ll be able to make loads of delicious, exotic curries and save all that wasted takeaway money. Really, I\u2019ve got to think of this book as an investment.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to boast, but apart from that one purchase, I do incredibly well over the next couple of days. The only things I buy are a really nice chrome flask to take coffee into the office. (And some coffee beans and an electric grinder.) And some flowers and champagne for Suze\u2019s birthday.</p><p>But I\u2019m allowed to get those, because, as David E. Barton says, you must treasure your friends. He says the simple act of breaking bread with friends is one of the oldest, most essential parts of human life. \u201cDo not stop giving your friends gifts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey need not be extravagant \u2014 use your creativity and try making them yourself.\u201d</p><p>So I\u2019ve bought Suze a half bottle of champagne instead of a whole one \u2014 and instead of buying expensive croissants from the patisserie, I\u2019m going to make them out of that special dough you get in tubes.</p><p>In the evening we\u2019re going out to Terrazza for supper with Suze\u2019s cousins Fenella and Tarquin \u2014 and, to be honest, it might be quite an expensive evening. But that\u2019s OK, because it counts as breaking bread with friends. (Except the bread at Terrazza is sun-dried tomato focaccia and costs \u00a34.50 a basket.)</p> <p>Fenella and Tarquin arrive at six o\u2019clock, and as soon as she sees them, Suze starts squealing with excitement. I stay in my bedroom and finish my makeup, putting off the moment of having to go out and say hello. I\u2019m not that keen on Fenella and Tarquin. In fact, to be honest with you, I think they\u2019re a bit weird. For a start, they look weird. They\u2019re both very skinny, but in a pale, bony way, and have the same slightly protruding teeth. Fenella does make a bit of an effort with clothes and makeup, and doesn\u2019t look too bad. But Tarquin, frankly, looks just like a stoat. Or a weasel. Some bony little creature, anyway. They do strange things, too. They ride around on a tandem and wear matching jumpers knitted by their old nanny and have this family language which no one else can understand. Like they call sandwiches \u201cwitchies.\u201d And a drink is a \u201ctitchy\u201d (except if it\u2019s water, which is \u201cHo\u201d). Take it from me, it gets irritating after a while. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Suze loves them. She spent all her childhood summers with them in Scotland and she just can\u2019t see that they\u2019re a bit strange. The worst thing is, she starts talking about witchies and titchies when she\u2019s with them.</p><p>Still, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it \u2014 they\u2019re here now. I finish brushing on my mascara and stand up, looking at my reflection. I\u2019m pretty pleased with what I see. I\u2019m wearing a really simple black top and black trousers \u2014 and, tied loosely round my neck, my gorgeous, gorgeous Denny and George scarf. God, that was a good buy. It looks fantastic.</p><p>I linger a bit, then resignedly open my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bex!\u201d says Suze, looking up with bright eyes. She\u2019s sitting cross-legged on the floor of the corridor, ripping open a present, while Fenella and Tarquin stand nearby, looking on. They\u2019re not wearing matching jumpers today, thank God, but Fenella\u2019s wearing a very odd red skirt made out of hairy tweed, and Tarquin\u2019s double-breasted suit looks as if it were tailored during the First World War.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, and kiss each of them politely.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow!\u201d cries Suze, as she pulls out a picture in an old gilt frame. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d She\u2019s looking from Tarquin to Fenella with shining eyes, and I look at the picture interestedly over her shoulder. But to be honest, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed. For a start it\u2019s really dingy \u2014 all sludgy greens and browns \u2014 and for another start, it just shows a horse standing still in a field. I mean, couldn\u2019t it have been jumping over a fence or rearing up or something? Or maybe trotting along in Hyde Park, ridden by a girl in one of those lovely Pride and Prejudice dresses.</p><p>\u201cHappy Bad Day!\u201d Tarquin and Fenella chime in unison. (That\u2019s another thing. They call birthdays bad days, ever since. . Oh God. It really is too boring to explain.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely gorgeous!\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cAbsolutely beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Tarquin earnestly. \u201cJust look at those colors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm, lovely,\u201d I say, nodding.</p><p>\u201cAnd the brushwork. It\u2019s exquisite. We were thrilled when we came across it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really wonderful picture,\u201d I say. \u201cMakes you want to just. . gallop off over the downs!\u201d</p><p>What is this drivel I\u2019m coming out with? Why can\u2019t I just be honest and say I don\u2019t like it?</p><p>\u201cDo you ride?\u201d says Tarquin, looking up at me in slight surprise.</p><p>I\u2019ve ridden once. On my cousin\u2019s horse. And I fell off and vowed never to do it again. But I\u2019m not going to admit that to Mr. Horse of the Year.</p> <p>\u201cI used to,\u201d I say, and give a modest little smile. \u201cNot very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d get back into it,\u201d says Tarquin, gazing at me. \u201cHave you ever hunted?\u201d</p><p>Hunted? Little furry foxes? Is he joking?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d says Suze, fondly propping the picture against the wall. \u201cShall we have a titchy before we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, turning quickly away from Tarquin. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, yes,\u201d says Fenella. \u201cHave you got any champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have,\u201d says Suze, and goes into the kitchen. At that moment the phone rings and I go to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, may I speak to Rebecca Bloomwood?\u201d says a strange woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say idly. I\u2019m listening to Suze opening and shutting cupboard doors in the kitchen and wondering if we have actually got any champagne, apart from the dregs of the half bottle we drank for breakfast. . \u201cSpeaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Bloomwood, this is Erica Parnell from Endwich Bank,\u201d says the voice, and I freeze.</p><p>Shit. It\u2019s the bank. Oh God, they sent me that letter, didn\u2019t they, and I never did anything about it.</p><p>What am I going to say? Quick, what am I going to say?</p><p>\u201cMs. Bloomwood?\u201d says Erica Parnell.</p><p>OK, what I\u2019ll say is, I\u2019m fully aware that my overdraft is slightly larger than it should be, and I\u2019m planning to take remedial action within the next few days. Yes, that sounds good. \u201cRemedial action\u201d sounds very good. OK \u2014 go.</p><p>Firmly I tell myself not to panic \u2014 these people are human \u2014 and take a big breath. And then, in one seamless, unplanned movement, my hand puts down the receiver.</p><p>I stare at the silent phone for a few seconds, not quite able to believe what I\u2019ve just done. What did I do that for? Erica Parnell knew it was me, didn\u2019t she? Any minute, she\u2019ll ring back. She\u2019s probably pressing redial now, and she\u2019ll be really angry. . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quickly I take the phone off the hook and hide it under a cushion. Now she can\u2019t get me. I\u2019m safe.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d says Suze, coming into the room.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I say, and force a bright smile. I don\u2019t want to spoil Suze\u2019s birthday with my stupid problems. \u201cJust a wrong. . Listen, let\u2019s not have drinks here. Let\u2019s go out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Suze. \u201cOK!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuch more fun,\u201d I gabble, trying to head her away from the phone. \u201cWe can go to some really nice bar and have cocktails, and then go on to Terrazza.\u201d</p><p>What I\u2019ll do in future, I\u2019m thinking, is screen all my calls. Or answer in a foreign accent. Or, even better, change the number. Go ex-directory.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d says Fenella, appearing at the door.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I hear myself say. \u201cWe\u2019re going out for a titchy and then on to sups.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m turning into one of them.</p> <p>As we arrive at Terrazza, I\u2019m feeling a lot calmer. Of course, Erica Parnell will have thought we were cut off by a fault on the line or something. She\u2019ll never have thought I put the phone down on her. I mean, we\u2019re two civilized adults, aren\u2019t we? Adults just don\u2019t do things like that.</p><p>And if I ever meet her, which I hope to God I never do, I\u2019ll just keep very cool and say, \u201cIt was odd what happened, that time you phoned me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Or even better, I\u2019ll accuse her of putting the phone down on me. (In a jokey way, of course.)</p><p>Terrazza is full, buzzing with people and cigarette smoke and chatter, and as we sit down with our huge silver menus I feel myself relax even more. I love eating out. And I reckon I deserve a real treat, after being so frugal over the last few days. It hasn\u2019t been easy, keeping to such a tight regime, but somehow I\u2019ve managed it. I\u2019m keeping to it so well! On Saturday I\u2019m going to monitor my spending pattern again, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll have gone down by at least 70 percent.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we have to drink?\u201d says Suze. \u201cTarquin, you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look!\u201d shrieks Fenella. \u201cThere\u2019s Eddie Lazenby! I must just say hello.\u201d She leaps to her feet and makes for a balding guy in a blazer, ten tables away. How she spotted him in this throng, I\u2019ve no idea.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d cries another voice, and we all look up. A blond girl in a tiny pastel-pink suit is heading toward our table, arms stretched out for a hug. \u201cAnd Tarkie!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, Tory,\u201d says Tarquin, getting to his feet. \u201cHow\u2019s Mungo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over there!\u201d says Tory. \u201cYou must come and say hello!\u201d</p><p>How is it that Fenella and Tarquin spend most of their time in the middle of Perthshire, but the minute they set foot in London, they\u2019re besieged by long-lost friends?</p><p>\u201cEddie says hi,\u201d announces Fenella, returning to the table. \u201cTory! How are you? How\u2019s Mungo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s fine,\u201d says Tory. \u201cBut listen, have you heard? Caspar\u2019s back in town!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d everyone exclaims, and I\u2019m almost tempted to join in. No one has bothered to introduce me to Tory, but that\u2019s the way it goes. You join the gang by osmosis. One minute you\u2019re a complete stranger, the next you\u2019re shrieking away with the rest of them, going \u201cDid you hear about Venetia and Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we must order,\u201d says Suze. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and say hello in a minute, Tory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, ciao,\u201d says Tory, and she sashays off.</p> <p>\u201cSuze!\u201d cries another voice, and a girl in a little black dress comes rushing up. \u201cAnd Fenny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilla!\u201d they both cry. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s Benjy?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, it just doesn\u2019t stop. Here I am, staring at the menu, pretending to be really interested in the starters but really feeling like some utter loser that no one wants to talk to. It\u2019s not fair. I want to table-hop, too. I want to bump into old friends I\u2019ve known since babyhood. (Although to be honest, the only person I\u2019ve known that long is Tom from next door, and he\u2019ll be in his limed oak kitchen in Reigate.)</p><p>But just in case, I lower my menu and gaze hopefully around the restaurant. Please, God, just once, let there be someone I recognize. It doesn\u2019t have to be anyone I like, or even know that well \u2014 just someone I can rush up to and go mwah mwah and shriek, \u201cWe must do lunch!\u201d Anyone\u2019ll do. Anyone at all. .</p><p>And then, with a disbelieving thrill, I spot a familiar face, a few tables away! It\u2019s Luke Brandon, sitting at a table with a smartly dressed older man and woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, he\u2019s not exactly an old friend \u2014 but I know him, don\u2019t I? And I so want to table-hop like the others.</p><p>\u201cOh look, there\u2019s Luke!\u201d I shriek (quietly, so he doesn\u2019t hear). \u201cI simply must go and say hello!\u201d</p><p>As the others look at me in surprise, I toss my hair back, leap to my feet, and hurry off, full of a sudden exhilaration. I can do it, too! I\u2019m table-hopping at Terrazza. I\u2019m an It-girl!</p><p>It\u2019s only when I get within a few feet of his table that I slow down and wonder what I\u2019m actually going to say to him.</p> <p>Well. . I\u2019ll just be polite. Say hello and \u2014 ah, genius! I can thank him again for his kind loan of twenty quid.</p><p>Shit, I did pay him back, didn\u2019t I?</p><p>Yes. Yes, I sent him that nice recycled card with poppies on it and a check. That\u2019s right. Now don\u2019t panic, just be cool and It.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say as soon as I get within earshot of his table, but the hubbub around us is so loud, he doesn\u2019t hear me. No wonder all Fenella\u2019s friends have got such screechy voices. You need about sixty-five decibels, just to be heard. \u201cHi!\u201d I try again, louder, but still no response. Luke is talking earnestly to the older man, and the woman\u2019s listening intently. None of them even glances up.</p><p>This is getting a bit embarrassing. I\u2019m standing, marooned, being utterly ignored by the person I want to table-hop with. Nobody else ever seems to have this problem. Why isn\u2019t he leaping up, shrieking \u201cHave you heard about Foreland Investments?\u201d It\u2019s not fair. What shall I do? Shall I just creep away? Shall I pretend I was heading toward the Ladies\u2019?</p> <p>A waiter barges past me with a tray, and I\u2019m pushed helplessly forward, toward Luke\u2019s table \u2014 and at that moment, he looks up. He stares at me blankly as though he doesn\u2019t even know who I am, and I feel my stomach give a little flip of dismay. But I\u2019ve got to go through with it now.</p><p>\u201cHi, Luke!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d say. . hello!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hello,\u201d Luke says eventually. \u201cMum, Dad, this is Rebecca Bloomwood. Rebecca \u2014 my parents.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. What have I done? I\u2019ve table-hopped an intimate family gathering. Leave, quick.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say, and give a feeble smile. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t keep you from. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do you know Luke?\u201d inquires Mrs. Brandon.</p> <p>\u201cRebecca is a leading financial journalist,\u201d says Luke, taking a sip of wine. (Is that really what he thinks? Gosh, I must drop that into a conversation with Clare Edwards. And Philip, come to that.)</p><p>I grin confidently at Mr. Brandon, feeling like a mover and a shaker. I\u2019m a leading financial journalist hobnobbing with a leading entrepreneur at a leading London restaurant. How cool is that?</p><p>\u201cFinancial journalist, eh?\u201d grunts Mr. Brandon, and lowers his reading glasses to have a better look at me. \u201cSo what do you think of the chancellor\u2019s announcement?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m never going to table-hop again. Never.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I begin confidently, wondering if I could suddenly pretend to spot an old friend across the room.</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m sure Rebecca doesn\u2019t want to talk shop,\u201d says Luke, his lips twitching slightly.</p><p>\u201cQuite right!\u201d says Mrs. Brandon, and smiles at me. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely scarf, Rebecca. Is it Denny and George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is!\u201d I say brightly, full of relief. \u201cI was so pleased, I got it last week in the sale!\u201d</p> <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I can see that Luke Brandon is staring at me with an odd expression. Why? Why is he looking so. .</p><p>Oh fuck. How can I be so stupid?</p><p>\u201cIn the sale. . for my aunt,\u201d I continue, trying to think as quickly as I can. \u201cI bought it for my aunt, as a present.

I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say, starting to back away. Why didn\u2019t I just say she gave me the bloody scarf? \u201cAnyway, lovely to see you, Luke. Must dash, my friends will be missing me!\u201d</p><p>I give a nonchalant kind of wave without quite looking Luke in the eye and then quickly turn round and walk back to Suze, my legs trembling and my fingers twisted tightly by my sides. God, what a fiasco.</p><p>I\u2019ve managed to recompose myself by the time our food arrives. The food! I\u2019ve ordered grilled scallops and as I take my first bite, I nearly swoon. After so many torturous days of cheap, functional food, this is like going to heaven. I feel almost tearful \u2014 like a prisoner returning to the real world, or children after the war, when rationing stopped. After my scallops I have steak b\u00e9arnaise and chips \u2014 and when all the others say no thanks to the pudding menu, I order chocolate mousse. Because who knows when I\u2019m next going to be in a restaurant like this? There could be months ahead of cheese sandwiches and homemade coffee in a flask, with nothing to relieve the monotony.</p><p>While I\u2019m waiting for my chocolate mousse, Suze and Fenella decide they simply must go and talk to Benjy, on the other side of the room. So they leap up, both lighting cigarettes as they do so, and Tarquin stays behind to keep me company. He doesn\u2019t seem quite as into table-hopping as the others. In fact, he\u2019s been pretty quiet all evening. I\u2019ve also noticed that he\u2019s drunk more than any of us. Any moment I\u2019m expecting his head to land on the table.</p> <p>For a while there\u2019s silence between us. To be honest, Tarquin is so weird, I don\u2019t know how to talk to him. Then, suddenly, he says, \u201cDo you like Wagner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say at once. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever heard any Wagner, but I don\u2019t want to sound uncultured. And I have been to the opera before, though I think that was Mozart.</p><p>\u201c \u2018The Liebestod\u2019 from Tristan,\u201d he says, and shakes his head. \u201c \u2018The Liebestod.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I say, and nod in what I hope is an intelligent manner. I pour myself some wine, fill his glass up, too, and look around to see where Suze has got to. Typical of her just to disappear off and leave me with her drunken cousin.</p><p>\u201cDah-dah-dah-dah, daaaah dah dah. .\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God, now he\u2019s singing. Not loudly, but really intensely. And he\u2019s staring into my eyes as though he expects me to join in.</p><p>\u201cDah-dah-dah-dah. .\u201d</p><p>Now he\u2019s closed his eyes and is swaying. This is getting embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cDa diddle-idy da-a-da-a daaaah dah. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Wagner, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTristan,\u201d he says. \u201cUnd Isolde.\u201d He opens his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d make a beautiful Isolde.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d make a what? While I\u2019m still staring at him, he lifts my hand to his lips and starts kissing it. For a few seconds I\u2019m too shocked to move.</p><p>\u201cTarquin,\u201d I say as firmly as I can, trying to pull my hand away. \u201cTarquin, please\u2014\u201d I look up and desperately scan the room for Suze \u2014 and, as I do so, meet the eye of Luke Brandon, making his way out of the restaurant. He frowns slightly, lifts his hand in farewell, then disappears out of the door.</p><p>\u201cYour skin smells like roses,\u201d murmurs Tarquin against my skin.</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d I say crossly, and yank my hand out of his grasp so hard I get a row of teeth marks on my skin. \u201cJust leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>I would slap him, but he\u2019d probably take it as a come-on.</p><p>Just then, Suze and Fenella arrive back at the table, full of news about Binky and Minky \u2014 and Tarquin reverts into silence. And for the rest of the evening, even when we say good-bye, he barely looks at me. Thank God. He must have got the message.</p><p>Seven</p><p>IT DOESN\u2019T SEEM HE has, though, because on Saturday, I receive a card of a pre-Raphaelite girl looking coyly over her shoulder. Inside, Tarquin has written: Many apologies for my uncouth behavior. I hope to make it up to you. Tickets to Bayreuth \u2014 or, failing that, dinner?Tarquin.</p> <p>Dinner with Tarquin. Can you imagine? And what\u2019s he going on about, anyway? I\u2019ve never heard of Bayreuth. Is it a new show or something? Or does he mean Beirut? Why would we want to go to Beirut, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019ve got more important things to think about today. This is my sixth day of Cutting Back \u2014 and, crucially, my first weekend. David E. Barton says this is often when one\u2019s frugal regime cracks, as the office routine is no longer there as a distraction and the day stretches empty, waiting to be filled with the familiar comfort of shopping.</p><p>But I\u2019m too strong-willed to crack. I\u2019ve got my day completely sussed \u2014 and I\u2019m not going near any shops. This morning I\u2019m going to visit a museum and then tonight, instead of wasting lots of money on an expensive takeaway, I\u2019m cooking a homemade curry for me and Suze. I\u2019m actually quite excited about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My entire budget for today is as follows: Travel to museum: free (I already have a travelcard)Museum: freeCurry: \u00a32.50 (David E. Barton says you can make a wonderful curry for four people for less than \u00a35.00\u2014and there are only two of us.)Total daily expenditure: \u00a32.50</p><p>That\u2019s more like it. Plus I get to experience culture instead of mindless materialism. I have chosen the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum because I have never been to it before. In fact, I\u2019m not even sure what they have in it. Statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, or something?</p><p>Anyway, whatever they have, it will be very interesting and stimulating, I\u2019m sure. And above all, free!</p><p>As I come out of South Kensington tube, the sun\u2019s shining brightly and I stride along, feeling pleased with myself. Normally I waste my Saturday mornings watching Live and Kicking and getting ready to go to the shops. But look at this! I suddenly feel very grown-up and metropolitan, like someone in a Woody Allen film. I just need a long woolly scarf and some sunglasses and I\u2019ll look like Diane Keaton.</p> <p>And on Monday, when people ask me how my weekend was, I\u2019ll be able to say, \u201cActually, I went to the V&amp;A.\u201d No, what I\u2019ll say is \u201cI caught an exhibition.\u201d That sounds much cooler. (Why do people say they \u201ccaught\u201d an exhibition, by the way? It\u2019s not as though all the paintings were thundering past like bulls at Pamplona.) Then they\u2019ll say, \u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know you were into art, Rebecca.\u201d And I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh yes. I spend most of my free time at museums.\u201d And they\u2019ll give me an impressed look and say. .</p><p>Come to think of it, I\u2019ve walked straight past the entrance. Silly me. Too busy thinking about the conversation between me and. . actually, the person I realize I\u2019ve pictured in this little scene is Luke Brandon. How weird. Why should that be? Because I table-hopped with him, I suppose. Anyway. Concentrate. Museum.</p><p>Quickly I retrace my steps and walk nonchalantly into the entrance hall, trying to look as though I come here all the time. Not like that bunch of Japanese tourists clustering round their guide. Ha! I think proudly, I\u2019m no tourist. This is my heritage. My culture. I pick up a map carelessly as though I don\u2019t really need it, and look at a list of talks on things like Ceramics of the Yuan and Early Ming Dynasties. Then, casually, I begin to walk through to the first gallery.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A woman at a desk is calling to me. \u201cHave you paid?\u201d</p><p>Have I what? You don\u2019t have to pay to get into museums! Oh, of course \u2014 she\u2019s just joking with me. I give a friendly little laugh, and carry on.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d she says, in a sharper voice, and a bloke in security uniform appears out of nowhere. \u201cHave you paid for admission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s free!\u201d I say in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d she says, and points to a sign behind me. I turn to read it, and nearly keel over in astonishment.</p><p>Admission \u00a35.00.</p><p>I feel quite faint with shock. What\u2019s happened to the world? They\u2019re charging for admission to a museum. This is outrageous. Everyone knows museums are supposed to be free. If you start charging for museums, no one will ever go! Our cultural heritage will be lost to a whole generation, excluded by a punitive financial barrier. The nation will be dumbed down still further, and civilized society will face the very brink of collapse. Is that what you want, Tony Blair?</p><p>Plus, I don\u2019t have \u00a35. I deliberately came out with no cash except \u00a32.50 for my curry ingredients. Oh God, this is annoying. I mean, here I am, all ready for some culture. I want to go in and look at. . well, whatever\u2019s in there \u2014 and I can\u2019t!</p> <p>Now all the Japanese tourists are staring at me, as if I\u2019m some sort of criminal. Go away! I think crossly. Go and look at some art.</p><p>\u201cWe take credit cards,\u201d says the woman. \u201cVISA, Switch, American Express.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell. . OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe season ticket is \u00a315,\u201d she says, as I reach for my purse, \u201cbut it gives you unlimited access for a year.\u201d</p><p>Unlimited access for a year! Now wait just a minute. David E. Barton says what you\u2019re supposed to do, when you make any purchase, is estimate the \u201ccost per use,\u201d which you get by dividing the price by the number of times you use it. Let\u2019s suppose that from now on I come to the V&amp;A once a month. (I should think that\u2019s quite realistic.) If I buy a season ticket, that\u2019s only. . \u00a31.25 a visit.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s a bargain, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s actually a very good investment, when you come to think of it.</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll have the season ticket,\u201d I say, and hand over my VISA card. Hah! Culture here I come. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I start off really well. I look at my little map, and peer at each exhibit, and carefully read all the little cards.</p><p>Chalice made from silver, Dutch, 16th century</p><p>Plaque depicting Holy Trinity, Italian mid\u201315th century</p><p>Blue and white earthenware bowl, early 17th century</p> <p>That bowl\u2019s really nice, I find myself thinking in sudden interest, and wonder how much it is. It looks quite expensive. . I\u2019m just peering to see if there\u2019s a price tag when I remember where I am. Of course. There aren\u2019t any prices here.</p><p>Which is a bit of a mistake, I think. Because it kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn\u2019t it? You wander round, just looking at things, and it all gets a bit boring after a while. Whereas if they put price tags on, you\u2019d be far more interested. In fact, I think all museums should put prices on their exhibits. You\u2019d look at a silver chalice or a marble statue or the Mona Lisa or whatever, and admire it for its beauty and historical importance and everything \u2014 and then you\u2019d reach for the price tag and gasp, \u201cHey, look how much this one is!\u201d It would really liven things up.</p><p>I might write to the Victoria &amp; Albert and suggest this to them. I am a season-ticket holder, after all. They should listen to my opinion.</p><p>In the meantime, let\u2019s move on to the next glass case.</p><p>Carved goblet, English, mid\u201315th century</p> <p>God, I could die for a cup of coffee. How long have I been here? It must be. .</p><p>Oh. Only fifteen minutes.</p><p>When I get to the gallery showing a history of fashion, I become quite rigorous and scholarly. In fact, I spend longer there than anywhere else. But then the dresses and shoes come to an end and it\u2019s back to more statues and little fiddly things in cases. I keep looking at my watch, and my feet hurt. . and in the end I sink down onto a sofa.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like museums. I do. And I\u2019m really interested in Korean art. It\u2019s just that the floors are really hard, and I\u2019m wearing quite tight boots, and it\u2019s hot so I\u2019ve taken off my jacket but now it keeps slithering around in my arms. And it\u2019s weird, but I keep thinking I can hear the sound of a cash till. It must be in my imagination.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting blankly, wondering if I can summon the energy to stand up again, when the group of Japanese tourists comes into the gallery, and I feel compelled to get to my feet and pretend I\u2019m looking at something. I peer vaguely at a piece of tapestry, then stride off down a corridor lined with exhibits of old Indian tiles. I\u2019m just thinking that maybe we should get the Fired Earth catalogue and retile the bathroom, when I glimpse something through a metal grille and stop dead with shock.</p><p>Am I dreaming? Is it a mirage? I can see a cash register, and a queue of people, and a display cabinet with price tags. .</p> <p>Oh my God, I was right! It\u2019s a shop! There\u2019s a shop, right there in front of me!</p><p>Suddenly my steps have more spring in them; my energy has miraculously returned. Following the bleeping sound of the cash register, I hurry round the corner to the shop entrance and pause on the threshold, telling myself not to raise my hopes, not to be disappointed if it\u2019s just bookmarks and tea towels.</p><p>But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s bloody fantastic! Why isn\u2019t this place better known? There\u2019s a whole range of gorgeous jewelry, and loads of really interesting books on art, and there\u2019s all this amazing pottery, and greeting cards, and. .</p><p>Oh. But I\u2019m not supposed to be buying anything today, am I? Damn.</p><p>This is awful. What\u2019s the point of discovering a new shop and then not being able to buy anything in it? It\u2019s not fair. Everyone else is buying stuff, everyone else is having fun. For a while I hover disconsolately beside a display of mugs, watching as an Australian woman buys a pile of books on sculpture. She\u2019s chatting away to the sales assistant, and suddenly I hear her say something about Christmas. And then I have a flash of pure genius.</p><p>Christmas shopping! I can do all my Christmas shopping here! I know March is a bit early, but why not be organized? And then when Christmas arrives I won\u2019t have to go near the horrible Christmas crowds. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t thought of doing this before. And it\u2019s not breaking the rules, because I\u2019d have to buy Christmas presents sometime, wouldn\u2019t I? All I\u2019m doing is shifting the buying process forward a bit. It makes perfect sense.</p><p>And so, about an hour later, I emerge happily with two carrier bags. I\u2019ve bought a photograph album covered in William Morris print, an old-fashioned wooden jigsaw puzzle, a book of fashion photographs, and a fantastic ceramic teapot. God, I love Christmas shopping. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll give to who \u2014 but the point is, these are all timeless and unique items that would enhance any home. (Or at least the ceramic teapot is, because that\u2019s what it said on the little leaflet.) So I reckon I\u2019ve done really well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In fact, this morning has been a great success. As I emerge from the museum, I feel incredibly content and uplifted. It just shows the effect that a morning of pure culture has on the soul. From now on, I decide, I\u2019m going to spend every Saturday morning at a museum.</p><p>When I get back home, the second post is on the doormat and there\u2019s a square envelope addressed to me in writing I don\u2019t recognize. I rip it open as I lug my carrier bags to my room \u2014 and then stop in surprise. It\u2019s a card from Luke Brandon. How did he get my home address? Dear Rebecca, it says, It was good to bump into you the other night, and I do hope you had an enjoyable evening. I now realize that I never thanked you for the prompt repayment of my loan. Much appreciated.With all best wishes \u2014 and, of course, deepest sympathy on the loss of your Aunt Ermintrude. (If it\u2019s any consolation, I can\u2019t imagine that scarf could suit anyone better than you.)</p><p>Luke.</p><p>For a while I stare at it silently. I\u2019m quite taken aback. Gosh, I think cautiously. It\u2019s nice of him to write, isn\u2019t it? A nice handwritten card like this, just to thank me for my card. I mean, he\u2019s not just being polite, is he? You don\u2019t have to send a thank-you card to someone just because they repaid your twenty quid.</p> <p>Or do you? Maybe, these days, you do. Everyone seems to send cards for everything. I haven\u2019t got a clue what\u2019s done and what\u2019s not anymore. (I knew I should have read that etiquette book I got in my stocking.) Is this card just a polite thank-you? Or is it something else? And if so. . what?</p><p>Is he taking the piss?</p><p>Oh God, that\u2019s it. He knows Aunt Ermintrude doesn\u2019t exist. He\u2019s just pulling my leg to embarrass me.</p><p>But then. . would he go to all the trouble of buying a card, writing in it, and sending it, just to pull my leg?</p><p>Oh, I don\u2019t know. Who cares? I don\u2019t even like him, anyway.</p> <p>Having been so cultured all morning, I deserve a bit of a treat in the afternoon, so I buy myself Vogue and a bag of Minstrels, and lie on the sofa for a bit. God, I\u2019ve missed little treats like this. I haven\u2019t read a magazine for. . well, it must be a week, except Suze\u2019s copy of Cosmo yesterday. And I can\u2019t remember the last time I tasted chocolate.</p><p>I can\u2019t spend too long enjoying myself, though, because I\u2019ve got to go out and buy the stuff for our homemade curry. So after I\u2019ve read my horoscope, I close Vogue and get out my new Indian recipe book. I\u2019m quite excited, actually. I\u2019ve never made curry before.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone off the tiger prawn recipe because it turns out tiger prawns are very expensive. So what I\u2019m going to make instead is chicken and mushroom Balti. It all looks very cheap and easy, and I just need to write out my shopping list.</p><p>When I\u2019ve finished I\u2019m a bit taken aback. The list is quite a lot longer than I\u2019d thought it would be. I hadn\u2019t realized you needed so many spices just to make one curry. I\u2019ve just looked in the kitchen, and we don\u2019t have a Balti pan, or a grinder for grinding spices, or a blender for making the aromatic paste. Or a wooden spoon or any scales that work.</p><p>Still, never mind. What I\u2019ll do is quickly go to Peter Jones and buy all the equipment we need for the kitchen, and then I\u2019ll get the food and come back and start cooking. The thing to remember is, we only have to buy all this stuff once \u2014 and then we\u2019re fully equipped to make delicious curries every night. I\u2019ll just have to think of it as an investment.</p><p>By the time Suze arrives back from Camden Market that evening, I am dressed in my new stripy apron, grinding up roasted spices in our new grinder.</p> <p>\u201cPhew!\u201d she says, coming into the kitchen. \u201cWhat a stink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s aromatic spices,\u201d I say a bit crossly, and take a swig of wine. To be honest, this is all a bit more difficult than I\u2019d thought. I\u2019m trying to make something called Balti masala mix, which we will be able to keep in a jar and use for months, but all the spices seem to be disappearing into the grinder and refusing to come back out. Where are they going?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely starving,\u201d says Suze, pouring herself a glass of wine. \u201cWill it be ready soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, peering into the grinder. \u201cIf I can just get these bloody spices out. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d says Suze. \u201cI might just make some toast.\u201d She pops a couple of pieces of bread in the toaster and then starts picking up all my little bags and pots of spices and looking at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s allspice?\u201d she says, holding up a pot curiously. \u201cIs it all the spices, mixed together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, banging the grinder on the counter. A tiny dusting of powder falls out and I stare at it angrily. What happened to a whole jarful that I could keep for months? Now I\u2019ll have to roast some more of the bloody things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause if it is, couldn\u2019t you just use that and forget all the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m making a fresh and distinct Balti blend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Suze, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re the expert.\u201d</p><p>Right, I think, taking another swig of wine. Start again. Coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, peppercorns. . By this time, I\u2019ve given up measuring, I\u2019m just throwing everything in. They say cooking should be instinctive, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d says Suze, looking at Luke Brandon\u2019s card on the kitchen table. \u201cLuke Brandon? How come he sent you a card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d I say, shrugging casually. \u201cHe was just being polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolite?\u201d Suze wrinkles her brow, turning the card over in her hands. \u201cNo way. You don\u2019t have to send a card to someone just because they returned your twenty quid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d My voice is slightly higher than usual, but that must be because of the roasting aromatic spices. \u201cI thought maybe that\u2019s what people did these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d says Suze assuredly. \u201cWhat happens is, the money\u2019s lent, it\u2019s returned with a thank-you letter, and that\u2019s the end of the matter. This card\u201d\u2014 she waves it at me \u2014\u201cthis is something extra.\u201d</p> <p>This is why I love sharing a flat with Suze. She knows stuff like this, because she mixes in the right social circles. You know she once had dinner with the duchess of Kent? Not that I\u2019m boasting, or anything.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think it means?\u201d I say, trying not to sound too tense.</p><p>\u201cI reckon he\u2019s being friendly,\u201d she says, and puts the card back on the table.</p><p>Friendly. Of course, that\u2019s it. He\u2019s being friendly. Which is a good thing, of course. So why do I feel ever so slightly disappointed? I stare at the card, which has a face by Picasso on the front. What does that mean?</p><p>\u201cAre those spices supposed to be going black, by the way?\u201d says Suze, spreading peanut butter on her toast.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d I whip the Balti pan off the stove and look at the blackened coriander seeds. This is driving me crazy. Okay, tip them away and start again. Coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, peppercorns, bay leaves. That\u2019s the last of the bay leaves. This one had better not go wrong.</p> <p>Somehow, miraculously, it doesn\u2019t. Forty minutes later, I actually have a curry bubbling away in my Balti pan! This is fantastic! It smells wonderful, and it looks just like it does in the book \u2014 and I didn\u2019t even follow the recipe very carefully. It just shows, I have a natural affinity with Indian cookery. And the more I practice, the more accomplished I\u2019ll become. Like David E. Barton says, I\u2019ll be able to knock up a quick, delicious curry in the time it takes to call the delivery firm. And look how much money I\u2019ve saved!</p><p>Triumphantly I drain my basmati rice, take my ready-made nans out of the oven, and serve everything out onto plates. Then I sprinkle chopped fresh coriander over everything \u2014 and honestly, it looks like something out of Marie-Claire. I carry the plates through and put one in front of Suze.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d she says. \u201cThis looks fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say proudly, sitting down opposite her. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>I watch as she takes her first forkful \u2014 then put a forkful into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMmm! Delicious!\u201d says Suze, chewing with relish. \u201cQuite hot,\u201d she adds after a while.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got chili powder in,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd fresh chilies. But it\u2019s nice, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful!\u201d says Suze. \u201cBex, you\u2019re so clever! I could never make this in a million years!\u201d</p> <p>But as she\u2019s chewing, a slightly strange expression is coming over her face. To be honest, I\u2019m feeling a bit breathless, too. This curry is quite hot. In fact, it\u2019s bloody hot.</p><p>Suze has put down her plate and is taking a large slug of wine. She looks up, and I see her cheeks are red.</p><p>\u201cOK?\u201d I say, forcing myself to smile through the pain in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, great!\u201d she says, and takes a huge bite of nan. I look down at my plate and resolutely take another forkful of curry. Immediately, my nose starts to run. Suze is sniffing, too, I notice, but as I meet her eye she smiles brightly.</p><p>Oh God, this is hot. My mouth can\u2019t stand it. My cheeks are burning, and my eyes are starting to water. How much chili powder did I put in this bloody thing? Only about one teaspoonful. . or maybe it was two. I just kind of trusted my instincts and chucked in what looked about right. Well, so much for my instincts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears start running down my face, and I give an enormous sniff.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d says Suze in alarm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I say, putting down my fork. \u201cJust. . you know. A bit hot.\u201d</p><p>But actually, I\u2019m not OK. And it\u2019s not just the heat that\u2019s making tears run down my face. Suddenly I feel like a complete failure. I can\u2019t even get a quick and easy curry right. And look how much money I spent on it, with the Balti pan and the apron and all the spices. . Oh, it\u2019s all gone wrong, hasn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t Cut Back at all. This week\u2019s been a complete disaster.</p> <p>I give a huge sob and put my plate on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible!\u201d I say miserably, and tears begin to stream down my face. \u201cDon\u2019t eat it, Suze. It\u2019ll poison you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex! Don\u2019t be silly!\u201d says Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic!\u201d She looks at me, then puts her own plate on the floor. \u201cOh, Bex.\u201d She shuffles across the floor, reaches up, and gives me a hug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just a bit hot. But otherwise, it\u2019s brilliant! And the nan is delicious! Honestly. Don\u2019t get upset.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to reply, and instead hear myself giving another huge sob.</p><p>\u201cBex, don\u2019t!\u201d wails Suze, practically crying herself. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious! It\u2019s the most delicious curry I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the curry!\u201d I sob, wiping my eyes. \u201cThe point was, I was supposed to be Cutting Back. This curry was only supposed to cost \u00a32.50.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. . why?\u201d asks Suze perplexedly. \u201cWas it a bet, or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I wail. \u201cIt was because I\u2019m in debt! And my dad said I should Cut Back or Make More Money. So I\u2019ve been trying to Cut Back. But it hasn\u2019t worked. .\u201d I break off, shuddering with sobs. \u201cI\u2019m just a complete failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not a failure!\u201d says Suze at once. \u201cBex, you\u2019re the opposite of a failure. It\u2019s just. .\u201d She hesitates. \u201cIt\u2019s just that maybe. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, then Suze says seriously, \u201cI think you might have chosen the wrong option, Becky. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a Cut Back kind of person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I sniff, and wipe my eyes. \u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should go for Make More Money instead.\u201d Suze pauses thoughtfully. \u201cIn fact, to be honest, I don\u2019t know why anyone would choose Cut Back. I think Make More Money is a much better option. If I ever had to choose, that\u2019s definitely the one I\u2019d go for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cYes, maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe that\u2019s what I should do.\u201d I reach down with a shaky hand and take a bite of warm nan \u2014 and Suze is right. Without the curry, it\u2019s delicious. \u201cBut how shall I do it?\u201d I say eventually. \u201cHow shall I make more money?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while, with both of us thoughtfully chewing on nan. Then Suze brightens.</p><p>\u201cI know. Look at this!\u201d She reaches for a magazine and flips to the classified ads at the back. \u201cLook what it says here. \u2018Need extra money? Join the Fine Frames family. Make thousands, working from home in your spare time. Full kit supplied.\u2019 You see? It\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>Wow. I\u2019m quite impressed. Thousands. That\u2019s not bad.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say shakily, \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could invent something,\u201d says Suze.</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, anything,\u201d she says confidently. \u201cYou\u2019re really clever. Remember when the coffee filter broke, and you made a new one out of a knee-high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and a tiny glow of pride spreads over me. \u201cYes, I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could easily be an inventor. Or. . I know! Set up an Internet company. They\u2019re worth millions!\u201d</p><p>You know, she\u2019s right. There\u2019s loads of things I could do to Make More Money. Loads of things! It\u2019s just a question of lateral thinking. Suddenly I feel a lot better. Suze is such a good friend. I reach forward and give her a hug.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Suze,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re a star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she says, and hugs me back. \u201cSo, you cut out this ad and start making your thousands. .\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll go and phone up for a takeaway curry, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes please,\u201d I say in a small voice. \u201cA takeaway would be lovely.\u201d</p><p>REBECCA BLOOMWOOD\u2019S CUT-BACK PROJECT</p><p>HOMEMADE CURRY, SATURDAY 24TH MARCH </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Proposed Budget: \u00a32.50</p><p>Actual Expenditure:</p><p>Balti pan \u00a315.00</p><p>Electric grinder \u00a314.99</p> <p>Blender \u00a318.99</p><p>Wooden spoon 35p</p><p>Apron \u00a39.99</p><p>Two chicken breasts \u00a31.98</p><p>300g mushrooms 79p</p> <p>Onion 29p</p><p>Coriander seeds \u00a31.29</p><p>Fennel seeds \u00a31.29</p><p>Allspice \u00a31.29</p><p>Cumin seeds \u00a31.29</p><p>Cloves \u00a31.39</p> <p>Ground ginger \u00a31.95</p><p>Bay leaves \u00a31.40</p><p>Chili powder</p><p>OH GOD, FORGET IT.</p><p>PGNI FIRST BANK VISA 7 Camel Square</p><p>Liverpool L1 5NP</p><p>Ms. Rebecca Bloomwood</p><p>Flat 24 Burney Rd.London SW6 8FD</p> <p>6 March 2000</p><p>Dear Ms. Bloomwood: PGNI First Bank VISA Card No. 1475839204847586 Thank you for your letter of 2 March.I can assure you that our computers are regularly checked, and that the possibility of a \u201cglitch,\u201d as you put it, is remote.

But it doesn\u2019t matter, because that\u2019s all in the past. That was negative thinking \u2014 now I\u2019m seriously into positive thinking. Onward and upward. Growth and prosperity. M.M.M. It\u2019s the obvious solution, when you think about it. And you know what? Suze is absolutely right. Making More Money suits my personality far better than Cutting Back did. I\u2019m already feeling much happier. Just the fact that I don\u2019t have to make any more grotty cheese sandwiches, or go to any more museums, has lifted a huge weight off my soul. And I\u2019m allowed to buy all the cappuccinos I like, and start looking in shop windows again. Oh, the relief! I\u2019ve even chucked Controlling Your Cash in the bin. I never did think it was any good.</p><p>The only small thing \u2014 tiny niggle \u2014 is I\u2019m not quite sure how I\u2019m going to do it. Make More Money, I mean. But now I\u2019ve decided to go ahead with it, something will turn up. I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>When I get into work on Monday, Clare Edwards is already at her desk \u2014 surprise \u2014 and on the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she\u2019s saying softly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly been a wonderful first year.\u201d</p><p>When she sees me, to my surprise, she blushes a faint pink and turns away slightly. \u201cYes, I understand,\u201d she whispers, scribbling in her notepad. \u201cBut what about the future?\u201d</p><p>God knows why she\u2019s being so secretive. As if I\u2019m interested in her tedious life. I sit down at my desk, briskly flip on my computer, and open my diary. Oh goody, I\u2019ve got a press conference in the City. Even if it is some boring old pensions launch, at least it means a trip out of the office and, with any luck, a nice glass of champagne. Work can be quite fun, sometimes. And Philip isn\u2019t in yet, which means we can sit and gossip for a while.</p><p>\u201cSo, Clare,\u201d I say, as she puts the phone down, \u201chow was your weekend?\u201d</p><p>I look over, expecting to hear the usual thrilling account of what shelf she put up where with her boyfriend \u2014 but Clare doesn\u2019t even seem to have heard what I said.</p><p>\u201cClare?\u201d I say puzzledly. She\u2019s staring at me with pink cheeks, as though I\u2019ve caught her stealing pens from the stationery cupboard.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d she says in a rush. \u201cThat conversation you heard me having just now. . could you not mention it to Philip?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in bemusement. What\u2019s she talking about? Oh wow \u2014 is she having an affair? But then, why should Philip care? He\u2019s her editor, not her\u2014</p><p>Oh my God. She\u2019s not having an affair with Philip, is she?</p><p>\u201cClare, what\u2019s going on!\u201d I say excitedly.</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, as Clare blushes deep red. I can\u2019t believe this. A piece of office scandal at last! And involving Clare Edwards, of all people!</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Clare,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou can tell me. I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d I lean forward sympathetically. \u201cI might even be able to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Clare, rubbing her face. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true. I could do with a bit of advice. The pressure\u2019s starting to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart from the beginning,\u201d I say calmly, just like Dear Abby. \u201cWhen did it all begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d whispers Clare, and looks nervously about. \u201cIt was about. . six months ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all began on that Scottish press trip,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cI was away from home. . I said yes without even thinking. I suppose I was flattered, more than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the old story,\u201d I say wisely. God, I\u2019m enjoying this.</p><p>\u201cIf Philip knew what I was doing, he\u2019d go crazy,\u201d she says despairingly. \u201cBut it\u2019s just so easy. I use a different name \u2014 and no one knows!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou use a different name?\u201d I say, impressed in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cSeveral,\u201d she says, and gives a bitter little laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably seen some of them around.\u201d She exhales sharply. \u201cI know I\u2019m taking a risk \u2014 but I can\u2019t stop. To be honest, you get used to the money.\u201d</p><p>Money? Is she a prostitute?</p><p>\u201cClare, what exactly are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first it was just a little piece on mortgages in The Mail,\u201d she says, as though she hasn\u2019t heard me. \u201cI thought I could handle it. But then I was asked to do a full-length feature on life insurance in The Sunday Times. Then Pension and Portfolio got in on the act. And now it\u2019s about three articles every week. I have to do it all in secret, try to act normally. .\u201d She breaks off and shakes her head. \u201cSometimes it gets me down. But I just can\u2019t say no anymore. I\u2019m hooked.\u201d</p> <p>I do not believe it. She\u2019s talking about work. Work! There I was, thinking she was having a steamy affair, ready to hear all the exciting details \u2014 and all the time it was just boring old. .</p><p>Then something she\u2019s just said tweaks at my mind.</p><p>\u201cDid you say the money was good?\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she says. \u201cAbout three hundred quid a piece. That\u2019s how we could afford our flat.\u201d</p><p>Three hundred quid!</p><p>Nine hundred quid a week! Bloody hell!</p> <p>This is the answer. It\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll become a high-flying freelance journalist, just like Clare, and earn nine hundred quid a week. What I have to do is start networking and making contacts at events instead of always sitting at the back with Elly. I must shake hands firmly with all the finance editors of the nationals and wear my name badge prominently instead of putting it straight in my bag, and then phone them up with ideas when I get back to the office. And then I\u2019ll have \u00a3900 a week. Hah!</p><p>So when I arrive at the press conference, I pin my name badge on firmly, take a cup of coffee (no champagne \u2014 blast), and head toward Moira Channing of the Daily Herald.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say, nodding in what I hope is a serious manner. \u201cBecky Bloomwood, Successful Saving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she says without interest, and turns back to the other woman in the group. \u201cSo we had the second lot of builders back, and really read them the riot act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Moira, you poor thing,\u201d says the other woman. I squint at her badge and see that she\u2019s Lavinia Bellimore, freelance. Well, there\u2019s no point impressing her \u2014 she\u2019s the competition.</p><p>Anyway, she doesn\u2019t give me a second glance. The two chat away about extensions and school fees, completely ignoring me \u2014 and after a bit I mutter, \u201cGood to meet you,\u201d and creep away. God, I\u2019d forgotten how unfriendly they are. Still, never mind. I\u2019ll just have to find someone else.</p><p>So after a bit I sidle up to a very tall guy on his own, and smile at him.</p><p>\u201cBecky Bloomwood, Successful Saving,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cGeoffrey Norris, freelance,\u201d he says, and flashes his badge at me. Oh for God\u2019s sake. The place is crawling with freelancers!</p><p>\u201cWho do you write for?\u201d I ask politely, thinking at least I might pick up some tips.</p><p>\u201cIt depends,\u201d he says shiftily. His eyes keep darting backward and forward, and he\u2019s refusing to meet my eye. \u201cI used to be on Monetary Matters. But they sacked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bastards over there,\u201d he says, and drains his coffee. \u201cBastards! Don\u2019t go near them. That\u2019s my advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ll remember that!\u201d I say brightly, edging away. \u201cActually, I just have to. .\u201d And I turn, and walk quickly away. Why do I always find myself talking to weirdos?</p><p>Just then, a buzzer goes off, and people start to find their seats. Deliberately, I head for the second row, pick up the glossy brochure that\u2019s waiting for me on my seat, and take out my notebook. I wish I wore glasses, then I\u2019d look even more serious. I\u2019m just writing down Sacrum Asset Management Pension Fund Launch in capitals at the top of the page, when a middle-aged man I\u2019ve never seen before plonks himself down next to me. He\u2019s got disheveled brown hair and smells of cigarettes, and is wearing an old-looking jacket over a dark red shirt with no tie. Plus, I suddenly notice, sneakers on his feet. Sneakers to a press conference? He sits down, leans back comfortably, and looks around with twinkling brown eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he murmurs, then meets my eye. \u201cAll this gloss.

Another weirdo.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I say politely, and look for his name badge, but I can\u2019t see one.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d says the man, and shakes his head. \u201cBloody fat cats.\u201d He gestures to the front, where three men in expensive suits are sitting down behind the table. \u201cYou won\u2019t find them surviving on fifty quid a week, will you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell. . no,\u201d I say. \u201cMore like fifty quid a minute.\u201d The man gives an appreciative laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good line. I might use that.\u201d He extends his hand. \u201cEric Foreman, Daily World.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaily World?\u201d I say, impressed in spite of myself. Gosh, The Daily World. I have to confess a little secret here \u2014 I really like The Daily World. I know it\u2019s only a tabloid, but it\u2019s so easy to read, especially if you\u2019re on a train. (My arms must be very weak or something, because holding The Times makes them ache after a while. And then all the pages get messed up. It\u2019s a nightmare.) And some of the articles in the \u201cFemale World\u201d section are actually rather interesting.</p><p>But hang on \u2014 surely I\u2019ve met The Daily World\u2019s personal finance editor. Surely it\u2019s that drippy woman called Marjorie? So who\u2019s this guy?</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you around before,\u201d I say casually. \u201cAre you new?\u201d</p> <p>Eric Foreman gives a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the paper for ten years. But this finance stuff isn\u2019t usually my scene.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cI\u2019m here to stir up a bit of trouble, as it goes. The editor\u2019s brought me on board for a new campaign we\u2019re running, \u2018Can We Trust the Money Men?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He even talks in a tabloid voice.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCould be, could be. As long as I can get past all this technical stuff.\u201d He pulls a face. \u201cNever been good at figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually need to know very much. You\u2019ll soon pick up what\u2019s important. Basically, these guys are launching a new pension plan. .\u201d I glance at the brochure \u201c. . and the gimmick is, there\u2019s a discount for investors under the age of twenty-five. Which makes sense, of course, because the sooner you start retirement planning, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely,\u201d echoes Eric Foreman, a tiny smile at his mouth. \u201cMay I ask, do you have a pension?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell. . no,\u201d I admit. \u201cI don\u2019t at the moment. . but I\u2019m absolutely intending to, as soon as I decide which one.\u201d</p><p>Which is true. As soon as I clear all my debts, I\u2019m going to start a pension plan, and also invest in a long-term equity-based investment fund. I may even put some spare money into emerging markets. I mean, it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d says Eric Foreman, grinning. \u201cVery wise of you.\u201d He peers at my name badge. \u201cAnd you are. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca Bloomwood, Successful Saving,\u201d I say, in my best networking manner.</p><p>\u201cGlad to meet you, Rebecca,\u201d he says, and fishes in his pocket for a business card.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say, hastily reaching into my bag for my own business cards. Yes! I think triumphantly as I hand it over. I\u2019m networking with the national newspapers! I\u2019m swapping business cards!</p><p>Just then the microphones all come on with a screech of feedback, and a dark-haired girl at the podium clears her throat. Behind her is a lit-up screen, with the words Sacrum Asset Management against a sunset.</p><p>I remember this girl now. She was really snotty to me at a press briefing last year. But Philip likes her, because she sends him a bottle of champagne every Christmas, so I\u2019ll have to give this new pension plan a nice write-up.</p> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d she says. \u201cMy name is Maria Freeman, and I\u2019m delighted to welcome you all to the launch of the Sacrum Asset Management Pension Series. This is an innovative range of products designed to combine flexibility and security with the powerful performance associated with Sacrum.\u201d</p><p>A graph appears on the screen before us, with a wiggly red line rising and falling above a thinner black one.</p><p>\u201cAs Graph 1 shows,\u201d says Maria Freeman confidently, pointing to the wiggly red line, \u201cour UK Enterprise Fund has consistently outperformed the rest of its particular sector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d murmurs Eric Foreman to me, frowning at his brochure. \u201cSo, what\u2019s going on here, then? I heard a rumor that Sacrum Asset Management wasn\u2019t doing too well.\u201d He jabs at the graph. \u201cBut look at this. Outperforming the sector.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d I murmur back. \u201cAnd what sector would that be? The Crap Investments Sector? The Lose All Your Money Sector?\u201d</p><p>Eric Foreman looks at me and his mouth twists slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ve fiddled their figures?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly fiddling,\u201d I explain. \u201cThey just compare themselves to whoever\u2019s worse than themselves, and then call themselves the winners.\u201d I point to the graph in the brochure. \u201cLook. They haven\u2019t actually specified what this so-called sector is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, blow me,\u201d says Eric Foreman, and looks up at the Sacrum team sitting on the platform. \u201cThey\u2019re canny bastards, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Really, this guy has no idea. I feel almost sorry for him.</p><p>Maria Freeman is droning on again, and I stifle a yawn. The trouble with sitting near the front is you have to pretend to look interested and be writing notes. \u201cPensions,\u201d I write, and draw a swirly line underneath. Then I make the line into the stem of a vine and start drawing little bunches of grapes and leaves all the way along.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment I\u2019ll be introducing Mike Dillon, who heads up the investment team, and he\u2019ll be telling you a little about their methods. In the meantime, if there are any questions. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Eric Foreman. \u201cI\u2019ve got a question.\u201d I look up from my grapevine, slightly surprised.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d Maria Freeman smiles sweetly at him. \u201cAnd you are. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric Foreman, Daily World. I\u2019d like to know, how much do you all get paid?\u201d He gestures with his hand along the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Maria Freeman turns pink, then regains her composure. \u201cOh, you mean charges. Well, we\u2019ll be dealing with those. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean charges,\u201d says Eric Foreman. \u201cI mean, how-much-do-you-get-paid? You, Mike Dillon.\u201d He jabs at him with his finger. \u201cWhat are you on? Six figures, is it? And bearing in mind what a disaster the performance of Sacrum Asset Management was last year \u2014 shouldn\u2019t you be out on the streets?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m absolutely stunned. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this at a press conference. Never!</p><p>There\u2019s a kerfuffle at the table, and then Mike Dillon leans forward toward his microphone.</p> <p>\u201cIf we could get on with the presentation,\u201d he says, \u201cand. . and leave other questions for later.\u201d He\u2019s looking decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cJust one more thing,\u201d says Eric Foreman. \u201cWhat would you say to one of our readers who invested in your Safe Prospects plan and lost ten grand?\u201d He glances briefly at me and winks. \u201cShow them a nice reassuring graph like that one, would you? Tell them you were \u2018top of the sector\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Oh, this is fantastic! All the Sacrum people look like they want to die.</p><p>\u201cA press release on the subject of Safe Prospects was issued at the time,\u201d says Maria and smiles icily at Eric. \u201cHowever, this press conference is restricted to the subject of the new Pension Series. If you could just wait until the presentation is over. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d says Eric Foreman comfortably. \u201cI won\u2019t be staying to hear the bullshit. I reckon I\u2019ve got everything I need already.\u201d He stands up and grins at me. \u201cGood to meet you, Rebecca,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cAnd thanks for your expertise.\u201d He extends his hand and I shake it, without quite knowing what I\u2019m doing. And then, as everyone is turning in their seats and whispering, he makes his way along the row and out of the room.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d says Maria Freeman, two bright spots burning on her cheeks. \u201cDue to this. . disturbance, we will have a short break before we resume. Please help yourself to tea and coffee. Thank you.\u201d She turns off the microphone, climbs down from the podium, and hurries over to the huddle of Sacrum Asset Management personnel.</p><p>\u201cYou should never have let him in!\u201d I hear one of them saying.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was!\u201d replies Maria defensively. \u201cHe said he was a stringer for The Wall Street Journal!\u201d</p> <p>Well, this is more like it! I haven\u2019t seen so much excitement since Alan Derring from the Daily Investor stood up at a Provident Assurance press conference and told everyone he was becoming a woman and wanted us all to call him Andrea.</p><p>I head toward the back to get another cup of coffee, and find Elly standing by the coffee table. Excellent. I haven\u2019t seen Elly for ages.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she grins. \u201cI like your new friend. Very entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say delightedly. \u201cIsn\u2019t he cool?\u201d I reach for a posh chocolate biscuit wrapped in gold foil, and give my cup to the waitress to be refilled. Then I take another couple of biscuits and pop them in my bag.

It said it was essential to have experience on a consumer title, but I thought you could say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d interrupts Elly in an odd voice, \u201cyou know which job I\u2019ve been going for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cNot that fund manager job. But that wasn\u2019t serious. That was just a bargaining tool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI took it,\u201d she says, and I gaze at her in shock.</p><p>Suddenly a voice comes from the podium, and we both look up.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d Maria is saying. \u201cIf you would like to resume your seats. .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t go and sit back down there. I have to hear about this.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say quickly to Elly. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to stay. We\u2019ve got our press packs. Let\u2019s go and have lunch.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 and for an awful moment I think she\u2019s going to say no, she wants to stay and hear about personal pensions. But then she grins and takes my arm \u2014 and to the obvious dismay of the girl at the door, we waltz out of the room.</p><p>There\u2019s a Caf\u00e9 Rouge around the corner, and we go straight in and order a bottle of white wine. I\u2019m still in slight shock, to tell you the truth. Elly Granger is going to become a Wetherby\u2019s fund manager. She\u2019s deserting me. I won\u2019t have anyone to play with anymore.</p><p>And how can she? She wanted to be beauty editor on Marie-Claire, for God\u2019s sake!</p><p>\u201cSo, what decided you?\u201d I say cautiously as our wine arrives.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, and sighs. \u201cI just kept thinking, where am I going? You know, I keep applying for all these glam jobs in journalism and never even getting an interview. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have got one eventually,\u201d I say robustly. \u201cI know you would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says. \u201cOr maybe not. And in the meantime, I\u2019m writing about all this boring financial stuff \u2014 and I suddenly thought, why not just sod it and do boring financial stuff? At least I\u2019ll have a proper career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a proper career!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I wasn\u2019t, I was hopeless! I was paddling around with no aim, no game plan, no prospects. .\u201d Elly breaks off as she sees my face. \u201cI mean, I was quite different from you,\u201d she adds hurriedly. \u201cYou\u2019re much more sorted out than I was.\u201d</p><p>Sorted out? Is she joking?</p><p>\u201cSo when do you start?\u201d I say, to change the subject \u2014 because to be honest, I feel a bit thrown by all this. I don\u2019t have a game plan, I don\u2019t have prospects. Maybe I\u2019m hopeless, too. Maybe I should rethink my career. Oh God, this is depressing.</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d says Elly, and takes a swig of wine. \u201cI\u2019m going to be based at the Silk Street office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say miserably.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve had to buy loads of new clothes,\u201d she adds, and pulls a little face. \u201cThey\u2019re all really smart at Wetherby\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>New clothes? New clothes? Right, now I really am jealous.</p><p>\u201cI went into Karen Millen and practically bought it out,\u201d she says, eating a marinated olive. \u201cSpent about a thousand quid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlimey,\u201d I say, feeling slightly awestricken. \u201cA thousand quid, all at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had to,\u201d she says apologetically. \u201cAnd anyway, I\u2019ll be earning more now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, and gives a little laugh. \u201cLots more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike. . how much?\u201d I ask, feeling tweaks of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting off on forty grand,\u201d she says, and gives a careless shrug. \u201cAfter that, who knows? What they said is. .\u201d</p><p>And she starts talking about career structures and ladders and bonuses. But I can\u2019t hear a word, I\u2019m too shell-shocked.</p><p>Forty grand?</p><p>Forty grand? But I only earn\u2014</p><p>Actually, should I be telling you how much I earn? Isn\u2019t it one of those things like religion, you\u2019re not supposed to mention in polite company? Or maybe we\u2019re all allowed to talk about money these days. Suze would know.</p><p>Oh well, sod it. You know everything else, don\u2019t you? The truth is, I earn \u00a321,000. And I thought that was a lot! I remember really well, when I moved jobs, I jumped from \u00a318,000 to \u00a321,000, and I thought I\u2019d made the big time. I was so excited about it, I used to write endless lists of what I would buy with all that extra money. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But now it sounds like nothing. I should be earning forty grand, like Elly, and buying all my clothes at Karen Millen. Oh, it\u2019s not fair. My life\u2019s a complete disaster.</p><p>As I\u2019m walking back to the office, I feel pretty morose. Maybe I should give up journalism and become a fund manager, too. Or a merchant banker. They earn a pretty good whack, don\u2019t they? Maybe I could join Goldman Sachs or somewhere. They earn about a million a year, don\u2019t they? God, that would be good. I wonder how you get a job like that.</p><p>But on the other hand. . do I really want to be a banker? I wouldn\u2019t mind the clothes-from-Karen-Millen part of it. In fact, I think I\u2019d do that really well. But I\u2019m not so sure about the rest. The getting-up-early-and-working-hideously-hard part. Not that I\u2019m lazy or anything \u2014 but I quite like the fact that I can go and spend the afternoon at Image Store, or flick through the papers pretending to be doing research, and no one gives me a hard time. It doesn\u2019t sound as if Elly will be doing much of that in her new job. In fact, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything remotely fun or creative about it. And aren\u2019t bankers rather humorless? Their press conferences certainly are \u2014 so imagine working with them. It all sounds quite scary.</p><p>Hmm. If only there were some way that I could get all the nice clothes \u2014 but not have to do the dreary work. One but not the other. If only there were a way. . My eyes are automatically flicking into all the shop windows as I pass, checking out the displays \u2014 and suddenly I stop in my tracks.</p> <p>This is a sign from God. It has to be.</p><p>I\u2019m standing outside Ally Smith \u2014 which has some gorgeous full-length coats in the window \u2014 and there\u2019s a handwritten sign in the glass pane of the door. \u201cWanted. Saturday sales assistants. Inquire within.\u201d</p><p>I almost feel faint as I stare at the sign. It\u2019s as though lightning has struck, or something. Why on earth haven\u2019t I thought of this before? It\u2019s pure genius. I\u2019ll get a Saturday job! I\u2019ll work in a clothes shop! That way, I\u2019ll make loads of extra money and I\u2019ll get a discount on all the clothes! And let\u2019s face it, working in a shop has got to be more fun than becoming a fund manager, hasn\u2019t it? I can choose all my own clothes as I help the customers. I\u2019ll actually be getting paid to go shopping!</p><p>This is bloody fantastic, I think, striding into the shop with a friendly smile on my face. I knew something good was going to happen today. I just had a feeling about it.</p><p>Half an hour later, I come out with an even bigger smile on my face. I\u2019ve got a job! I\u2019ve got a Saturday job! I\u2019m going to work from eight-thirty to five-thirty every Saturday, and get \u00a34.80 an hour, and 10 percent off all the clothes! And after three months, it goes up to 20 percent! All my money troubles are over.</p> <p>Thank God it was a quiet afternoon. They let me fill in the application form on the spot, and Danielle, the manager, gave me an interview straight away. At first, she looked a bit dubious \u2014 especially when I said I had a full-time job as a financial journalist and was doing this to get extra money and clothes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard work,\u201d she kept saying. \u201cYou do realize that? It\u2019ll be very hard work.\u201d But I think what changed her mind was when we started talking about the stock. I love Ally Smith \u2014 so of course I knew the price of every single item in the shop and whether they have anything similar in Jigsaw or French Connection. Eventually Danielle gave me a funny look and said, \u201cWell, you obviously like clothes.\u201d And then she gave me the job! I can\u2019t wait. I start this Saturday. Isn\u2019t it great?</p><p>As I arrive back at the office I feel exhilarated with my success. I look around \u2014 and suddenly this mundane office life seems far too boring and limited for a creative spirit like mine. I don\u2019t belong here, among fusty piles of press releases and grimly tapping computers. I belong out there, among the bright spotlights and cashmere cardigans of Ally Smith. Maybe I\u2019ll go into retail full time, I think, as I sit back down at my desk. Maybe I\u2019ll start my own chain of designer stores! I\u2019ll be one of those people featured in articles about incredibly successful entrepreneurs. \u201cBecky Bloomwood was working as a financial journalist when she devised the innovative concept of Bloomwood Stores.

I\u2019m so shocked, I drop the phone onto my desk with a clatter and have to scrabble around to pick it up. All the while, my heart\u2019s thumping like a rabbit.

It cost me \u00a3100 to buy, which is quite expensive, but apparently it will give you a return of \u00a3300 in only a few hours. Inside the package there\u2019s a leaflet full of photographs of people who make fortunes from doing Fine Frames \u2014 some of them make a hundred thousand a year! It makes me wonder what I\u2019m doing, being a journalist.</p><p>So after supper, I sit down in front of Changing Rooms and open the kit. Suze is out tonight, so it\u2019s nice and easy to concentrate.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the best-kept secret in Britain. .\u201d says the leaflet. \u201cThe Fine Frames homeworking family!

Why on earth haven\u2019t I done this before? This is a fantastic scheme! I\u2019ll work incredibly hard for two weeks, then pay off all my debts, go on holiday, and buy loads of new clothes.</p><p>I start ripping at the packaging, and suddenly a pile of fabric strips falls onto the floor. Some are plain, and some are a flowered pattern. It\u2019s a pretty hideous pattern actually \u2014 but then, who cares? My job is just to make the frames and collect the money. I reach for the instructions and find them under a load of cardboard pieces. And sure enough, they\u2019re incredibly simple. What you have to do is glue wadding onto the cardboard frame, put the fabric over the top for that luxury upholstered effect, then glue braid along the back to hide the join. And that\u2019s it! It\u2019s completely simple and you get \u00a32 a frame. There are 150 in the package \u2014 so if I do thirty a night for a week I\u2019ll have made three hundred quid just like that in my spare time!</p><p>OK, let\u2019s get started. Frame, wadding, glue, fabric, braid.</p><p>Oh God. Oh God. Who designed these bloody things? There just isn\u2019t enough fabric to fit over the frame and the wadding. Or at least you have to stretch it really hard \u2014 and it\u2019s such flimsy fabric, it rips. I\u2019ve got glue on the carpet, and I\u2019ve bent two of the cardboard frames from pulling them, and the only frame I\u2019ve actually completed looks really wonky. And I\u2019ve been doing it for. .</p> <p>I yawn, look at the time, and feel a jolt of shock. It\u2019s eleven-thirty, which means I\u2019ve been working for three hours. In that time I\u2019ve made one dodgy-looking frame which I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll accept, and ruined two. And I was supposed to be making thirty!</p><p>At that moment the door opens and Suze is back.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says, coming into the sitting room. \u201cNice evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I begin disgruntledly. \u201cI\u2019ve been making these things. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, never mind,\u201d she says dramatically. \u201cBecause guess what? You\u2019ve got a secret admirer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, startled.</p><p>\u201cSomeone really likes you,\u201d she says, taking off her coat. \u201cI heard it tonight. You\u2019ll never guess who!\u201d</p><p>Luke Brandon pops into my mind before I can stop it. How ridiculous. And how would Suze have found that out, anyway? Stupid idea. Very stupid. Impossible.</p><p>She could have bumped into him at the cinema, whispers my brain. She does know him, after all, doesn\u2019t she? And he could have said. .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cousin!\u201d she says triumphantly. \u201cTarquin. He really likes you.\u201d</p><p>Oh for God\u2019s sake.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got this secret little crush on you,\u201d she continues happily. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s had one ever since he met you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say. \u201cWell, I had sort of. . guessed.\u201d Suze\u2019s eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cSo you already know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, and shrug awkwardly. What can I say? I can\u2019t tell her that her beloved cousin gives me the creeps. So instead I start to pick at the fabric on the photo frame in front of me, and a delighted smile spreads over Suze\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really keen on you!\u201d she says. \u201cI said he should just ring you and ask you out. You wouldn\u2019t mind, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I say feebly.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d said Suze. \u201cIf you two got married. I could be bridesmaid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and force myself to smile brightly. \u201cLovely.\u201d</p> <p>What I\u2019ll do, I think, is agree to a date just to be polite \u2014 and then cancel at the last moment. And hopefully Tarquin\u2019ll have to go back to Scotland or something, and we can forget all about it.</p><p>But to be honest, I could really do without it. Now I\u2019ve got two reasons to dread the phone ringing.</p><p>However, to my relief, Saturday arrives and I haven\u2019t heard a word from Tarquin. Or Derek Smeath. Everyone\u2019s finally leaving me alone to get on with my life!</p><p>On the slightly more negative side, I was planning to make 150 frames this week \u2014 but so far I\u2019ve only made three, and none of them looks like the one in the picture. One doesn\u2019t have enough wadding in it, one doesn\u2019t quite meet at the corner, and the third has got a smear of glue on the front, which hasn\u2019t come off. I just can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m finding it so difficult. Some people make hundreds of these things every week, without any effort. Mrs. S. of Ruislip even takes her family on a cruise every year on her earnings. How come they can do it and I can\u2019t? It\u2019s really depressing. I mean, I\u2019m supposed to be bright, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019ve got a degree, for God\u2019s sake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, never mind, I tell myself. It\u2019s my new job at Ally Smith today \u2014 so at least I\u2019ll be earning some extra money there.</p><p>And I\u2019m quite excited about it. Here starts a whole new career in fashion! I spend a long time choosing a cool outfit to wear on my first day \u2014 and eventually settle on black trousers from Jigsaw, a little cashmere (well, half cashmere) T-shirt, and a pink wraparound top, which actually came from Ally Smith.</p><p>I\u2019m quite pleased with the way I look, and am expecting Danielle to make some appreciative comment when I arrive at the shop \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t even seem to notice. She just says, \u201cHi. The trousers and T-shirts are in the stock room. Pick out your size and change in the cubicle.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. Now I come to think of it, all the assistants at Ally Smith do wear the same outfits. Almost like a. . well, a uniform, I suppose. Reluctantly I get changed and look at myself \u2014 and, to tell you the truth, I\u2019m disappointed. These gray trousers don\u2019t really flatter me \u2014 and the T-shirt\u2019s just plain boring. I\u2019m almost tempted to ask Danielle if I can pick out another outfit to wear \u2014 but she seems a bit busy, so I don\u2019t. Maybe next week I\u2019ll have a little word.</p> <p>But even though I don\u2019t like the outfit, I still feel a frisson of excitement as I come out onto the shop floor. The spotlights are shining brightly; the floor\u2019s all shiny and polished; music\u2019s playing and there\u2019s a sense of anticipation in the air. It\u2019s almost like being a performer. I glance at myself in a mirror and murmur, \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Or maybe it should be \u201cCan I help you?\u201d I\u2019m going to be the most charming shop assistant ever, I decide. People will come here just to be assisted by me, and I\u2019ll have a fantastic rapport with all the customers. And then I\u2019ll appear in the Evening Standard in some quirky column about favorite shops.</p><p>No one\u2019s told me what to do yet, so \u2014 using my initiative, very good \u2014 I walk up to a woman with blond hair, who\u2019s tapping away at the till, and say, \u201cShall I have a quick go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better learn how to work the till, hadn\u2019t I? Before all the customers arrive?\u201d</p><p>Then the woman does look up and, to my surprise, bursts into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cOn the till? You think you\u2019re going to go straight onto the till?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, blushing a little. \u201cWell, I thought. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beginner, darling,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going near the till. Go with Kelly. She\u2019ll show you what you\u2019ll be doing today.\u201d</p><p>Folding jumpers. Folding bloody jumpers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do. Rush round after customers who have picked up cardigans and left them all crumpled \u2014 and fold them back up again. By eleven o\u2019clock I\u2019m absolutely exhausted \u2014 and, to be honest, not enjoying myself very much at all. Do you know how depressing it is to fold a cardigan in exactly the right Ally Smith way and put it back on the shelf, all neatly lined up \u2014 just to see someone casually pull it down again, look at it, pull a face, and discard it? You want to scream at them, leave it alone if you\u2019re not going to buy it! I watched one girl even pick up a cardigan identical to the one she already had on!</p><p>And I\u2019m not getting to chat to the customers, either. It\u2019s as if they see through you when you\u2019re a shop assistant. No one\u2019s asked me a single interesting question, like \u201cDoes this shirt go with these shoes?\u201d or, \u201cWhere can I find a really nice black skirt under \u00a360?\u201d I\u2019d love to answer stuff like that. I could really help people! But the only questions I\u2019ve been asked are \u201cIs there a loo?\u201d and, \u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest Midland cashpoint?\u201d I haven\u2019t built up a single rapport with anyone.</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s depressing. The only thing that keeps me going is an end-of-stock reduced rack at the back of the shop. I keep sidling toward it and looking at a pair of zebra-print jeans, reduced from \u00a3180 to \u00a390. I remember those jeans. I\u2019ve even tried them on. And here they are, out of the blue \u2014 reduced. I just can\u2019t keep my eyes off them. They\u2019re even in my size.</p> <p>I mean, I know I\u2019m not really supposed to be spending money \u2014 but this is a complete one-off. They\u2019re the coolest jeans you\u2019ve ever seen. And \u00a390 is nothing for a pair of really good jeans. If you were in Gucci, you\u2019d be paying at least \u00a3500. Oh God, I want them. I want them.</p><p>I\u2019m just loitering at the back, eyeing them up for the hundredth time, when Danielle comes striding up and I jump guiltily. But all she says is \u201cCan you go onto fitting room duty now? Sarah\u2019ll show you the ropes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No more folding jumpers! Thank God!</p><p>To my relief, this fitting room lark is a lot more fun. Ally Smith has really nice fitting rooms, with lots of space and individual cubicles, and my job is to stand at the entrance and check how many items people are taking in with them. It\u2019s really interesting to see what people are trying on. One girl\u2019s buying loads of stuff, and keeps saying how her boyfriend told her to go mad for her birthday, and he would pay.</p><p>Huh. Well, it\u2019s all right for some. Still, never mind, at least I\u2019m earning money. It\u2019s eleven-thirty, which means I\u2019ve earned. . \u00a314.40 so far. Well, that\u2019s not bad, is it? I could get some nice makeup for that.</p><p>Except that I\u2019m not going to waste this money on makeup. Of course not \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here, is it? I\u2019m going to be really sensible. What I\u2019m going to do is buy the zebra-print jeans \u2014 just because they\u2019re a one-off and it would be a crime not to \u2014 and then put all the rest toward my bank balance. I just can\u2019t wait to put them on. I get a break at two-thirty, so what I\u2019ll do is nip to the reduced rack and take them to the staff room, just to make sure they fit, and. .</p> <p>Suddenly my face freezes. Hang on.</p><p>Hang on a moment. What\u2019s that girl holding over her arm? She\u2019s holding my zebra-print jeans! She\u2019s coming toward the fitting rooms. Oh my God. She wants to try them on. But they\u2019re mine! I saw them first!</p><p>I\u2019m almost giddy with panic. I mean, a normal pair of jeans, I wouldn\u2019t bother about. But these are unique. They\u2019re meant for me. I\u2019ve mentally reorganized my entire wardrobe around them, and have already planned to wear them at least three times next week. I can\u2019t lose them. Not now.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says brightly as she approaches.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I gulp, trying to stay calm. \u201cAhm. . how many items have you got?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour,\u201d she says, showing me the hangers. Behind me are tokens hanging on the wall, marked One, Two, Three, and Four. The girl\u2019s waiting for me to give her a token marked Four and let her in. But I can\u2019t.</p><p>I physically cannot let her go in there with my jeans.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d I hear myself saying, \u201cyou\u2019re only allowed three items.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she says in surprise. \u201cBut. .\u201d She gestures to the tokens.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cBut they\u2019ve just changed the rules. Sorry about that.\u201d And I flash her a quick smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, OK,\u201d says the girl. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave out\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese,\u201d I say, and grab the zebra-print jeans.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cActually, I think I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to take the top item,\u201d I explain hurriedly. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Thank God for bossy shop assistants and stupid pointless rules. People are so used to them that this girl doesn\u2019t even question me. She just rolls her eyes, grabs the Three token, and pushes her way past into the fitting room, leaving me holding the precious jeans.</p><p>OK, now what? From inside the girl\u2019s cubicle, I can hear zips being undone and hangers being clattered. She won\u2019t take long to try on those three things. And then she\u2019ll be out, wanting the zebra-print jeans. Oh God. What can I do? For a few moments I\u2019m frozen with indecision. Then the sound of a cubicle curtain being rattled back jolts me into action. It\u2019s not her \u2014 but it could have been. Quickly I stuff the zebra-print jeans out of sight behind the curtain and stand up again, a bright smile on my face.</p><p>Please let the girl find something else she likes, I pray feverishly. Please let her forget all about the jeans. Maybe she\u2019s not even that keen on them. Maybe she picked them up on impulse.

I\u2019ll be starving!</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, and moves off into the corner to write on her piece of paper, just as a voice says,</p><p>\u201cHi. Can I have those jeans now?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the girl, back again. How can she have tried on all those other things so quickly? Is she Houdini?</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, ignoring the last bit of what she said. \u201cAny good? That black skirt\u2019s really nice. I think it would really suit you.

Can I have them?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her desperately. I can\u2019t relinquish my treasured jeans. I just know this girl wouldn\u2019t love them like I would. She\u2019d probably wear them once and chuck them out \u2014 or never wear them at all! And I saw them first.</p><p>\u201cWhat jeans were they?\u201d I say, wrinkling my brow sympathetically. \u201cBlue ones? You can get them over there, next to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says the girl impatiently. \u201cThe zebra-print jeans I had a minute ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cOh yes. I\u2019m not sure where they went. Maybe someone else took them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake!\u201d she says, looking at me as if I\u2019m an imbecile. \u201cThis is ridiculous! I gave them to you about thirty seconds ago! How can you have lost them?\u201d</p><p>Shit. She\u2019s really angry. Her voice is getting quite loud, and people are starting to look. Oh, why couldn\u2019t she have liked the black skirt instead?</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d chimes in a syrupy voice, and I look up in horror. Danielle\u2019s coming over toward us, a sweet-but-menacing look on her face. OK, keep calm, I tell myself firmly. No one can prove anything either way.</p><p>\u201cI gave this assistant a pair of jeans to look after because I had four items, which is apparently too many,\u201d the girl begins explaining.</p> <p>\u201cFour items?\u201d says Danielle. \u201cBut you\u2019re allowed four items in the fitting room.\u201d And she turns to look at me with an expression which isn\u2019t very friendly.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d I say innocently. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m sorry. I thought it was three. I\u2019m new,\u201d I add apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was four!\u201d says the girl. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got tokens with bloody \u2018Four\u2019 written on them!\u201d She gives an impatient sigh. \u201cSo anyway, I gave her the jeans, and tried on the other things \u2014 and then I came out for the jeans, and they\u2019ve gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d says Danielle sharply. \u201cGone where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say, trying to look as baffled as the next person. \u201cMaybe another customer took them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were holding them!\u201d says the girl. \u201cSo what \u2014 did someone just come up to you and whip them out of your fingers?\u201d</p> <p>I flinch at the tone of her voice. I would never speak to a shop assistant like that, even if I was cross. Anyway, how can she be so obsessed with a pair of jeans?</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could get another pair from the rack,\u201d I say, trying to sound helpful. \u201cOr some capri pants? I bet you\u2019d look really nice in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t another pair,\u201d she says icily. \u201cThey were from the reduced rack. And I don\u2019t like capri pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca, think!\u201d says Danielle. \u201cDid you put the jeans down somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have done,\u201d I say, twisting my fingers into a knot. \u201cIt\u2019s been so busy in here, I must have put them on the rail, and. . and I suppose another customer must have walked off with them.\u201d I give an apologetic little shrug as though to say \u201cCustomers, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d says the girl sharply. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I follow her gaze and freeze. The zebra-print jeans have rolled out from under the curtain. For a moment we all stare at them.</p><p>\u201cGosh!\u201d I manage at last. \u201cThere they are!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what exactly are they doing down there?\u201d asks Danielle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe they. .\u201d I swallow, trying to think as quickly as I can. \u201cMaybe. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took them!\u201d says the girl incredulously. \u201cYou bloody took them! You wouldn\u2019t let me try them on, and then you hid them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d I say, trying to sound convincing \u2014 but I can feel my cheeks flushing a guilty red.</p><p>\u201cYou little. .\u201d The girl breaks off and turns to Danielle. \u201cI want to make an official complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Danielle. \u201cInto my office, please.\u201d</p><p>I jump in fright at her voice and follow her slowly to her office. Around the shop, I can see all the other staff looking at me and nudging each other. How utterly mortifying. Still, it\u2019ll be OK. I\u2019ll just say I\u2019m really sorry and promise not to do it again, and maybe offer to work overtime. Just as long as I don\u2019t get. .</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. She\u2019s fired me. I haven\u2019t even worked there for a day, and I\u2019ve been kicked out. I was so shocked when she told me, I almost became tearful. I mean, apart from the incident with the zebra-print jeans, I thought I was doing really well. But apparently hiding stuff from customers is one of those automatic-firing things. (Which is really unfair, because she never told me that at the interview.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I get changed out of my gray trousers and T-shirt, there\u2019s a heavy feeling in my heart.

And when I asked if I could quickly buy some clothes using my staff discount, she looked at me as if she wanted to hit me.</p><p>It\u2019s all gone wrong. No job, no money, no discount, just twenty bloody quid. Miserably I start to walk along the street, shoving my hands in my pockets. Twenty bloody quid. What am I supposed to do with\u2014</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d My head jerks up and I find myself looking dazedly at a face which I know I recognize. But who is it? It\u2019s. . it\u2019s. . it\u2019s. .</p><p>\u201cTom!\u201d I exclaim in the nick of time. \u201cHi there! What a surprise!\u201d</p> <p>Well, blow me down. Tom Webster, up in London. He\u2019s just as tall and gangly as ever \u2014 but somehow looking slightly cooler with it than usual. He\u2019s wearing a thin blue sweater over a T-shirt and. . are those really Armani jeans? This doesn\u2019t make sense. What\u2019s he doing here anyway? Shouldn\u2019t he be in Reigate, grouting his Mediterranean tiles or something?</p><p>\u201cThis is Lucy,\u201d he says proudly, and pulls forward a slim girl with big blue eyes, holding about sixty-five carrier bags. And I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s the girl who was buying all that stuff in Ally Smith. The girl whose boyfriend was paying. Surely she didn\u2019t mean. .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out together?\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cYou and her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Tom, and grins at me. \u201cHave been for some time now.\u201d</p><p>But this doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why haven\u2019t Janice and Martin mentioned Tom\u2019s girlfriend? They\u2019ve mentioned every other bloody thing in his life.</p> <p>And fancy Tom having a girlfriend!</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d says Lucy.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m Rebecca. Next-door neighbor. Childhood friend. All that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re Rebecca,\u201d she says, and gives a swift glance at Tom.</p><p>What does that mean? Have they been talking about me? God, does Tom still fancy me? How embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d I say brightly, and give a little laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen you somewhere before,\u201d says Lucy thoughtfully \u2014 and then her eyes crinkle in recognition. \u201cYou work at Ally Smith, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, a little too sharply.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I saw you\u2014\u201d</p><p>God, I can\u2019t have it going back to my parents that I work in a shop. They\u2019ll think I\u2019ve been lying about my entire life in London and that secretly I\u2019m broke and living in squalor.</p><p>\u201cResearch,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI\u2019m a journalist, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca\u2019s a financial journalist,\u201d says Tom. \u201cReally knows her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d says Lucy, and I give her a supercilious smile.</p><p>\u201cMum and Dad always listen to Rebecca,\u201d says Tom. \u201cDad was talking about it just the other day. Said you\u2019d been very helpful on some financial matter. Switching funds or something.\u201d</p> <p>I nod vaguely, and give him a special, old-friends smile. Not that I\u2019m jealous, or anything \u2014 but I do feel a little twinge seeing Tom smiling down at this Lucy character who, frankly, has very boring hair, even if her clothes are quite nice. Come to think of it, Tom\u2019s wearing quite nice clothes himself. Oh, what\u2019s going on? This is all wrong. Tom belongs in his starter home in Reigate, not prancing around expensive shops looking halfway decent.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he says. \u201cWe must get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrain to catch?\u201d I say patronizingly. \u201cIt must be hard, living so far out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Lucy. \u201cI commute to Wetherby\u2019s every morning and it only takes forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work for Wetherby\u2019s?\u201d I say, aghast. Why am I surrounded by City high-flyers?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m one of their political advisers.\u201d</p><p>What? What does that mean? Is she really brainy, or something? Oh God, this gets worse and worse.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re not catching our train just yet,\u201d says Tom, smiling down at Lucy. \u201cWe\u2019re off to Tiffany first. Choose a little something for Lucy\u2019s birthday next week.\u201d He lifts a hand and starts twisting a lock of her hair round his finger.</p><p>I can\u2019t cope with this anymore. It\u2019s not fair. Why haven\u2019t I got a boyfriend to buy me stuff in Tiffany\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cWell, lovely to see you,\u201d I gabble. \u201cGive my love to your mum and dad. Funny they didn\u2019t mention Lucy,\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding. \u201cI saw them the other day, and they didn\u2019t mention her once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shoot an innocent glance at Lucy.

Then Lucy says, \u201cTom, I\u2019ll just look in this shop window for a second,\u201d and walks off, leaving the two of us alone.</p> <p>God, what drama! I\u2019m obviously the third person in their relationship.</p><p>\u201cTom, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I say, and give a little laugh.</p><p>But it\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s still hankering after me. And Lucy knows it.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d says Tom, and rubs his face. \u201cLook, Rebecca, this isn\u2019t easy for me. But the thing is, Mum and Dad are aware of your. . feelings for me. They didn\u2019t want to mention Lucy to you, because they thought you\u2019d be. .\u201d He exhales sharply. \u201cDisappointed.\u201d</p><p>What? Is this some kind of joke? I have never been more dumbfounded in all my life. For a few seconds I can\u2019t even move for astonishment.</p> <p>\u201cMy feelings for you?\u201d I stutter at last. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s pretty obvious,\u201d he says, shrugging. \u201cMum and Dad told me how the other day, you kept on asking how I was, and all about my new house. .\u201d There\u2019s a slightly pitying look in his eye. Oh my God, I can\u2019t stand this. How can he think. . \u201cI really like you, Becky,\u201d he adds. \u201cI just don\u2019t. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being polite!\u201d I roar. \u201cI don\u2019t fancy you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t!\u201d I cry furiously. \u201cI never did fancy you! That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go out with you when you asked me! When we were both sixteen, remember?\u201d</p><p>I break off and look at him triumphantly \u2014 to see that his face hasn\u2019t moved a bit. He isn\u2019t listening. Or if he is, he\u2019s thinking that the fact I\u2019ve dragged in our teenage past means I\u2019m obsessed by him. And the more I try to argue the point, the more obsessed he\u2019ll think I am. Oh God, this is horrendous.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, trying to gather together the remaining shreds of my dignity. \u201cOK, we\u2019re obviously not communicating here, so I\u2019ll just leave you to it.\u201d I glance over at Lucy, who\u2019s looking in a shop window and obviously pretending not to be listening. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not after your boyfriend,\u201d I call. \u201cAnd I never was. Bye.\u201d</p><p>And I stride off down the street, a nonchalant smile plastered stiffly across my face.</p><p>As I round the corner, however, the smile gradually slips, and I sit heavily down on a bench. I feel humiliated. Of course, the whole thing\u2019s laughable. That Tom Webster should think I\u2019m in love with him. Just serves me right for being too polite to his parents and feigning interest in his bloody limed oak units. Next time I\u2019ll yawn loudly, or walk away. Or produce a boyfriend of my own.</p><p>I know all this. I know I shouldn\u2019t care two hoots what Tom Webster or his girlfriend think. But even so. . I have to admit, I feel a bit low. Why haven\u2019t I got a boyfriend? There isn\u2019t even anyone I fancy at the moment. The last serious boyfriend I had was Robert Hayman, who sells advertising for Portfolio News, and we split up three months ago. And I didn\u2019t even much like him. He used to call me \u201cLove\u201d and jokingly put his hands over my eyes during the rude bits in films. Even when I told him not to, he still kept doing it. It used to drive me mad. Just remembering it now makes me feel all tense and scratchy.</p><p>But still, he was a boyfriend, wasn\u2019t he? He was someone to phone up during work, and go to parties with and use as ammunition against creeps. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have chucked him. Maybe he was all right.</p><p>I give a gusty sigh, stand up, and start walking along the street again. All in all, it hasn\u2019t been a great day. I\u2019ve lost a job and been patronized by Tom Webster. And now I haven\u2019t got anything to do tonight. I thought I\u2019d be too knackered after working all day, so I didn\u2019t bother to organize anything.</p><p>Still, at least I\u2019ve got twenty quid.</p><p>Twenty quid. I\u2019ll buy myself a nice cappuccino and a chocolate brownie. And a couple of magazines.</p> <p>And maybe something from Accessorize. Or some boots. In fact I really need some new boots \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen some really nice ones in Hobbs with square toes and quite a low heel. I\u2019ll go there after my coffee, and look at the dresses, too. God, I deserve a treat, after today. And I need some new tights for work, and a nail file. And maybe a book to read on the tube. .</p><p>By the time I join the queue at Starbucks, I feel happier already. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>PGNI FIRST BANK VISA 7 Camel Square</p><p>Liverpool L1 5NP</p><p>Ms. Rebecca Bloomwood</p><p>Flat 24 Burney Rd.London SW6 8FD</p> <p>10 March 2000</p><p>Dear Ms. Bloomwood: PGNI First Bank VISA Card No. 1475839204847586 Thank you for your letter of 6 March.Your offer of a free subscription to Successful Saving magazine is most kind, as is your invitation to dinner at The Ivy.

My gaze flits to the pile of unopened carrier bags in the corner of my room and then quickly flits away again. I know I spent too much money on Saturday. I know I shouldn\u2019t have bought two pairs of boots. I know I shouldn\u2019t have bought that purple dress. In all, I spent. . Actually, I don\u2019t want to think about how much I spent. Think about something else, quick, I instruct myself. Something else. Anything\u2019ll do.</p><p>I\u2019m well aware that at the back of my mind, thumping quietly like a drumbeat, are the twin horrors of Guilt and Panic.</p> <p>Guilt Guilt Guilt Guilt.</p><p>Panic Panic Panic Panic.</p><p>If I let them, they\u2019d swoop in and take over. I\u2019d feel completely paralyzed with misery and fear. So the trick I\u2019ve learned is simply not to listen. My mind is very well trained like that.</p><p>My other trick is to distract myself with different thoughts and activities. So I get up, switch the radio on, take a shower, and get dressed. The thumping\u2019s still there at the back of my head, but gradually, gradually, it\u2019s fading away. As I go into the kitchen and make a cup of coffee, I can barely hear it anymore. A cautious relief floods over me, like that feeling you get when a painkiller finally gets rid of your headache. I can relax. I\u2019m going to be all right.</p><p>On the way out I pause in the hall to check my appearance in the mirror (Top: River Island, Skirt: French Connection, Tights: Pretty Polly Velvets, Shoes: Ravel) and reach for my coat (Coat: House of Fraser sale). Just then the post plops through the door, and I go to pick it up. There\u2019s a handwritten letter for Suze and a postcard from the Maldives. And for me, there are two ominous-looking window envelopes. One from VISA, one from Endwich Bank.</p><p>For a moment, my heart stands still. Why another letter from the bank? And VISA. What do they want? Can\u2019t they just leave me alone?</p> <p>Carefully I place Suze\u2019s post on the ledge in the hall and shove my own two letters in my pocket, telling myself I\u2019ll read them on the way to work. Once I get on the tube, I\u2019ll open them both and I\u2019ll read them, however unpleasant they may be.</p><p>Honestly. As I\u2019m walking along the pavement, I promise my intention is to read the letters.</p><p>But then I turn into the next street \u2014 and there\u2019s a skip outside someone\u2019s house. A huge great yellow skip, already half full of stuff. Builders are coming in and out of the house, tossing old bits of wood and upholstery into the skip. Loads of rubbish, all jumbled up together.</p><p>And a little thought creeps into my mind.</p><p>My steps slow down as I approach the skip and I pause, staring intently at it as though I\u2019m interested in the words printed on the side. I stand there, trying to appear casual, until the builders have gone back into the house and no one\u2019s looking. Then, in one motion, I reach for the two letters, pull them out of my pocket, and drop them over the side, into the skip.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>As I\u2019m standing there, a builder pushes past me with two sacks of broken plaster, and heaves them into the skip. And now they really are gone. Buried beneath a layer of plaster, unread. No one will ever find them.</p><p>Gone for good.</p> <p>Quickly I turn away from the skip and begin to walk on again. Already my step\u2019s lighter and I\u2019m feeling buoyant.</p><p>Before long, I\u2019m feeling completely purged of guilt. I mean, it\u2019s not my fault if I never read the letters, is it? It\u2019s not my fault if I never got them, is it?

Then, instead of leaning back in my chair and asking him how his weekend was, I turn back to my computer and start typing again. In fact, I\u2019m typing so fast that the screen is filled with lots of splodgy typos. It has to be said, I\u2019m not the best typist in the world. But who cares?

Full of It-girls, all living on trust funds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I say vaguely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to call you,\u201d he says, and gives a little guffaw. \u201cThe office It-girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, and smile at him.

Rebecca Bloomwood here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u201d comes Tarquin\u2019s unmistakable, reedy voice. He sounds rather nervous, as if he\u2019s been gearing up to this phone call for ages. Perhaps he has. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to hear your voice. You know, I\u2019ve been thinking about you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, trying not to sound too encouraging.

I\u2019d very much like to spend some more time in your company,\u201d he says. \u201cMay I take you out to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. What am I supposed to say to that? It\u2019s such an innocuous request. I mean, it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s said, Can I sleep with you? or even Can I kiss you? If I say no to dinner, it\u2019s like saying \u201cYou\u2019re so unbearable, I can\u2019t even stand sharing a table with you for two hours.\u201d</p><p>And Suze has been so sweet to me recently, and if I turn her darling Tarkie down flat, she\u2019ll be really upset.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I say, aware that I don\u2019t sound too thrilled \u2014 and also aware that maybe I should just come clean and say \u201cI don\u2019t fancy you.\u201d But somehow I can\u2019t face it. To be honest, it would be a lot easier just to go out to dinner with him. I mean, how bad can it be?</p><p>And anyway, I don\u2019t have to actually go. I\u2019ll call at the last moment and cancel. Easy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in London until Sunday,\u201d says Tarquin.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make it Saturday night, then!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cJust before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about eight?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says. \u201cEight o\u2019clock.\u201d And he rings off, without mentioning a venue.

For all she knows, he\u2019s incredibly good-looking and witty. \u201cWe\u2019re going out on Saturday night.\u201d I give her a nonchalant smile and start typing again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh right,\u201d she says, and snaps an elastic band round a pile of letters. \u201cYou know, Luke Brandon was asking me if you had a boyfriend the other day.\u201d</p><p>For an instant I can\u2019t move.

I\u2019ll have a huge income and a company car and wear Karen Millen suits every day. And I\u2019ll never have to worry about money again.</p><p>I feel exhilarated. This is it!

I\u2019ll be a futures broker. Easy.</p> <p>And it is easy. So easy that ten o\u2019clock the next morning sees me walking nervously up to the front doors of William Green, top City head-hunters. As I push the door open I glimpse my own reflection and feel a little thrill go through my stomach. Am I really doing this?</p><p>You bet I am. I\u2019m wearing my smartest black suit, and tights and high heels, with an FT under my arm, obviously. And I\u2019m carrying the briefcase with the combination lock, which my mum gave me one Christmas and which I\u2019ve never used. This is partly because it\u2019s really heavy and bumpy \u2014 and partly because I\u2019ve forgotten the combination, so I can\u2019t actually open it. But it looks the part. And that\u2019s what counts.</p><p>Jill Foxton, the woman I\u2019m meeting, was really nice on the phone when I told her about wanting to change careers, and sounded pretty impressed by all my experience. I quickly typed up a curriculum vitae and e-mailed it to her \u2014 and, OK, I padded it a bit, but that\u2019s what they expect, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s all about selling yourself. And it worked, because she phoned back only about ten minutes after receiving it, and asked if I\u2019d come in and see her, as she thought she had some interesting opportunities for me.</p><p>I was so excited, I could barely keep still. I went straight into Philip and told him I wanted to take tomorrow off to take my nephew to the zoo \u2014 and he didn\u2019t suspect a thing.

I sit down, run my eye hopefully over the magazines on the coffee table (but there\u2019s nothing interesting, just things like The Economist), then lean back and look around. This foyer is pretty impressive, I have to admit. There\u2019s a fountain in the middle, and glass stairs rising in a curve \u2014 and, what seems like several miles away, I can see lots of state-of-the-art lifts. Not just one lift, or two \u2014 but about ten. Blimey. This place must be huge.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d A blond girl in a pale trouser suit is suddenly in front of me. Nice suit, I think.

That\u2019s pretty cool. Sending your assistant to pick up your visitors, as if you\u2019re too grand and busy to do it yourself.

As we stride off over the glossy floor, I surreptitiously run my gaze over Amy\u2019s trouser suit again \u2014 and find my eye landing on an Emporio Armani label. I can\u2019t quite believe it. The assistants wear Emporio Armani! So what\u2019s Jill herself going to be in? Couture Dior?

Something like \u2018How do you trade a butterfly?\u2019 or, \u2018What\u2019s the difference between open outlay and OR?\u2019 Or, \u2018How would you calculate the expiry date of a futures instrument?\u2019 Really basic stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, and swallow. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Something in me is telling me to turn and run \u2014 but we\u2019ve already arrived at a pale blond-wood door.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d says Amy, and smiles at me. \u201cWould you like tea or coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee, please,\u201d I say, wishing I could say \u201cA stiff gin, please.\u201d Amy knocks on the door, opens it and ushers me in, and says, \u201cRebecca Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d says a dark-haired woman behind the desk, and gets up to shake my hand.</p><p>To my slight surprise, Jill is not nearly as well dressed as Amy. She\u2019s wearing a blue, rather mumsy-looking suit, and boring court shoes. But still, never mind, she\u2019s the boss. And her office is pretty amazing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good to meet you,\u201d she says, gesturing to a chair in front of her desk. \u201cAnd let me say straight away, I was extremely impressed by your CV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, feeling relief creep over me. That can\u2019t be bad, can it? Extremely impressed.

You do seem to be one of those rare breeds, an all-rounder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my French is really only conversational,\u201d I say modestly. \u201cVoici la plume de ma tante, and all that!\u201d</p> <p>Jill gives an appreciative laugh, and I beam back at her.</p><p>\u201cBut Finnish!\u201d she says, reaching for the cup of coffee on her desk. \u201cThat\u2019s quite unusual.\u201d</p><p>I keep smiling and hope we move off the subject of languages. To be honest, \u201cfluent in Finnish\u201d went in because I thought \u201cconversational French\u201d looked a bit bare on its own. And after all, who speaks Finnish, for God\u2019s sake? No one.</p><p>\u201cAnd your financial knowledge,\u201d she says, pulling my CV toward her. \u201cYou seemed to have covered a lot of different areas during your years in financial journalism.\u201d She looks up. \u201cWhat attracts you to derivatives in particular?\u201d</p><p>What?

There\u2019d be an interview, but I can\u2019t see any problems there.\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be able to negotiate you a very attractive package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suddenly, I can\u2019t quite breathe. She\u2019s going to negotiate an attractive package. For me!</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Jill. \u201cWell, you must realize you\u2019re a bit of a one-off.\u201d She gives me a confidential smile. \u201cYou know, when your CV came through yesterday, I actually whooped!

Why?</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d says Jill. \u201cNot nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d I say at once, and force a grin onto my face. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not nervous!\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll be able to busk it, I think suddenly. I mean, the guy won\u2019t conduct the whole bloody interview in Finnish, will he? He\u2019ll just say \u201cHa\u0161all\u00f8,\u201d or whatever it is, and I\u2019ll say \u201cHa\u0161all\u00f8\u201d back, and then before he can say anything else, I\u2019ll quickly say, \u201cYou know, my technical Finnish is a bit rusty these days. Would you mind if we spoke in English?\u201d And he\u2019ll say. . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNearly there,\u201d says Jill, and smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say brightly, and clasp my sweaty hand more tightly round my briefcase handle.

There\u2019s a roomful of people sitting round a table, and they all turn to look at me.</p><p>\u201cJan Virtanen,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d</p> <p>A bearded man rises from his chair, give me a huge smile, and extends his hand.</p><p>\u201cNeiti Bloomwood,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cNautin erittain paljon tapaamisestamme. Onko oiken, etta teilla on jonkinlainen yhteys Suomeen?\u201d</p><p>I stare speechlessly at him. My face is glowing, as though I\u2019m consumed with happiness. Everyone in the room is waiting for me to answer, I\u2019ve got to say something.</p><p>\u201cI. . erm. . erm. . Ha\u0161all\u00f8!\u201d I lift my hand in a friendly little wave and smile around the room.</p><p>But nobody smiles back.</p> <p>\u201cErm. .

Which is not surprising, since I\u2019ve just run about a half marathon along endless corridors, trying to get out of this place. I descend the final flight of stairs (couldn\u2019t risk waiting for the elevators in case the Finnish brigade suddenly turned up), then pause to catch my breath. I straighten my skirt, transfer my briefcase from one sweaty hand to the other, and begin to walk calmly across the foyer toward the door, as though I\u2019ve come out of an utterly ordinary, utterly unspectacular meeting. I don\u2019t look right and I don\u2019t look left. I don\u2019t think about the fact that I\u2019ve just completely shredded any chances I had of becoming a top City banker. All I can think about is getting to that glass door and getting outside before anyone can. .</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d comes a voice behind my voice, and I freeze. Shit. They\u2019ve got me.</p><p>\u201cHa\u0161all\u00f8!\u201d I gulp, turning round. \u201cHa\u0161all. . Oh. Hell. . Hello.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s Luke Brandon.</p><p>It\u2019s Luke Brandon, standing right in front of me, looking down at me with that amused smile he always seems to have.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the sort of place I would have expected to find you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not after a City job, are you?\u201d</p><p>And why shouldn\u2019t I be? Doesn\u2019t he think I\u2019m clever enough?</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d I say haughtily, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a change of career. Maybe into foreign banking. Or futures broking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>A shame? What does that mean? Why is it a shame? As I look up at him, his dark eyes meet mine, and I feel a little flicker, deep inside me. Out of nowhere, Clare\u2019s words pop into my head. Luke Brandon was asking me if you had a boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cWhat. .\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I recruit from here quite often,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re very efficient. Soulless, but efficient.\u201d He shrugs, then looks at my shiny briefcase. \u201cHave they fixed you up with anything yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve. . I\u2019ve got a number of options open to me,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just considering my next move.\u201d</p><p>Which, to be honest, is straight out the door.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he says, and pauses. \u201cDid you take the day off to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>What does he think? That I just sloped off for a couple of hours and said I was at a press conference?</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s not a bad idea. I might try that next time.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what are you up to now?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Don\u2019t say \u201cnothing.\u201d Never say \u201cnothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got some bits and pieces to do,\u201d I say. \u201cCalls to make, people to see. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cYes. Well. Don\u2019t let me keep you.\u201d He looks around the foyer. \u201cAnd I hope it all works out for you, job-wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, giving him a businesslike smile.</p><p>And then he\u2019s gone, walking off toward the doors, and I\u2019m left holding my clunky briefcase, feeling just a bit disappointed. I wait until he\u2019s disappeared, then wander slowly over to the doors myself and go out onto the street. And then I stop. To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not quite sure what to do next. I\u2019d kind of planned to spend the day ringing everyone up and telling them about my fab new job as a futures broker. Instead of which. . Well, anyway. Let\u2019s not think about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I can\u2019t stand still on the pavement outside William Green all day. People will start thinking I\u2019m a piece of installation art or something. So eventually I begin walking along the street, figuring I\u2019ll arrive at a tube soon enough and then I can decide what to do. I come to a corner and I\u2019m just waiting for the traffic to stop, when a taxi pulls up beside me.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a very busy woman, with a lot to do,\u201d comes Luke Brandon\u2019s voice, and my head jerks up in shock. There he is, leaning out of the taxi window, his dark eyes crinkled up in a little smile. \u201cBut if you had the odd half-hour to spare \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t be interested in doing a little shopping, would you?\u201d</p><p>This day is unreal. Completely and utterly unreal.</p><p>I get into the taxi, put my clunky briefcase on the floor, and shoot a nervous look at Luke as I sit down. I\u2019m already slightly regretting this. What if he asks me a question about interest rates? What if he wants to talk about the Bundesbank or American growth prospects? But all he says is \u201cHarrods, please,\u201d to the driver.</p> <p>As we zoom off, I can\u2019t stop a smile coming to my face. I thought I was going to have to go home and be all miserable on my own \u2014 and instead, I\u2019m on my way to Harrods, and someone else is paying. I mean, you can\u2019t get more perfect than that.</p><p>As we drive along, I look out of the window at the crowded streets. Although it\u2019s March, there are still a few sale signs in the shop windows left over from January, and I find myself peering at the displays, wondering if there are any bargains I might have missed. We pause outside a branch of Lloyds Bank. I look idly at the window, and at the queue of people inside, and hear myself saying \u201cYou know what? Banks should run January sales. Everyone else does.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I look up, to see a look of amusement on Luke Brandon\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBanks?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I say defensively. \u201cThey could reduce their charges for a month or something. And so could building societies. Big posters in the windows, \u2018Prices Slashed\u2019. .\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cOr maybe they should have April sales, after the end of the tax year. Investment houses could do it, too. \u2018Fifty percent off a selected range of funds.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cA unit trust sale,\u201d says Luke Brandon slowly. \u201cReductions on all upfront charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a sucker for a sale. Even rich people.\u201d</p><p>The taxi moves on again, and I gaze out at a woman in a gorgeous white coat, wondering where she got it. Maybe at Harrods. Maybe I should buy a white coat, too. I\u2019ll wear nothing but white all winter. A snowy white coat and a white fur hat. People will start calling me the Girl in the White Coat.</p><p>When I look back again, Luke\u2019s writing something down in a little notebook. He looks up and meets my eye for a moment, then says, \u201cRebecca, are you serious about leaving journalism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say vaguely. To be honest, I\u2019d forgotten all about leaving journalism. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really think banking would suit you better?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d I say, feeling a bit rattled at his tone. It\u2019s all right for him. He doesn\u2019t have to worry about his career \u2014 he\u2019s got his own multimillion-pound company. I\u2019ve only got my own multimillion-pound overdraft. \u201cElly Granger is leaving Investor\u2019s Weekly News,\u201d I add. \u201cShe\u2019s joining Wetherby\u2019s as a fund manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d he says. \u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me. But you\u2019re nothing like Elly Granger.\u201d</p><p>Really? This comment intrigues me. If I\u2019m not like Elly, who am I like, then? Someone really cool like Kristin Scott Thomas, maybe.</p><p>\u201cYou have imagination,\u201d adds Luke. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Wow! Now I really am gobsmacked. Luke Brandon thinks I have imagination? Gosh. That\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it. That\u2019s quite flattering, really. You have imagination. Mmm, yes, I like that. Unless. .</p><p>Hang on. It\u2019s not some polite way of saying he thinks I\u2019m stupid, is it? Or a liar? Like \u201ccreative accounting.\u201d Perhaps he\u2019s trying to say that none of my articles is accurate.</p><p>Oh God, now I don\u2019t know whether to look pleased or not.</p><p>To cover up my embarrassment, I look out of the window. We\u2019ve stopped at a traffic light, and a very large lady in a pink velour jogging suit is trying to cross the road. She\u2019s holding several bags of shopping and a pug dog, and she keeps losing grasp of one or other of them and having to put something down. I almost want to leap out and help her. Then, suddenly, she loses her grasp of one of the bags, and drops it on the ground. It falls open \u2014 and three huge tubs of ice cream come out of it and start rolling down the road.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t laugh, I instruct myself.

I can\u2019t stop myself giggling. And when the pug dog reaches the ice cream before the lady, and starts trying to get the lid off with its teeth, I think I\u2019m going to die laughing. I look over at Luke, and I can\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s laughing helplessly, too, wiping the tears from his eyes. I didn\u2019t think Luke Brandon ever laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cI know you shouldn\u2019t laugh at people. But I mean. .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat dog!\u201d Luke starts laughing again. \u201cThat bloody dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat outfit!\u201d I give a little shudder as we start to move off again, past the pink woman. She\u2019s bending over the ice cream, her huge pink bottom thrust up in the air. . \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but pink velour jogging suits should be banned from this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d says Luke, nodding seriously. \u201cPink velour jogging suits are hereby banned. Along with cravats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd men\u2019s briefs,\u201d I say without thinking \u2014 then blush pink. How could I mention men\u2019s briefs in front of Luke Brandon? \u201cAnd toffee-flavored popcorn,\u201d I quickly add.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Luke. \u201cSo we\u2019re banning pink velour jogging suits, cravats, men\u2019s briefs, toffee-flavored popcorn. .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd punters with no change,\u201d comes the taxi driver\u2019s voice from the front.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d says Luke, giving a little shrug. \u201cPunters with no change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd punters who vomit. They\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd punters who don\u2019t know where the fuck they\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Luke and I exchange glances and I begin to giggle again.</p> <p>\u201cAnd punters who don\u2019t speak the bloody language. Drive you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Luke. \u201cSo. . most punters, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d says the taxi driver. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against foreigners. .\u201d He pulls up outside Harrods. \u201cHere we are. Going shopping, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says Luke, getting out his wallet.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what\u2019re you after?\u201d</p><p>I look at Luke expectantly. He hasn\u2019t told me what we\u2019re here to buy. Clothes? A new aftershave? Will I have to keep smelling his cheek? (I wouldn\u2019t mind that, actually.) Furniture? Something dull like a new desk?</p><p>\u201cLuggage,\u201d he says, and hands a tenner to the driver. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d</p><p>Luggage! Suitcases and holdalls and stuff like that. As I wander round the department, looking at Louis Vuitton suitcases and calfskin bags, I\u2019m quite thrown. Quite shocked by myself. Luggage. Why on earth have I never considered luggage before?</p> <p>I should explain \u2014 for years now, I\u2019ve kind of operated under an informal shopping cycle. A bit like a farmer\u2019s crop rotation system. Except, instead of wheat-maize-barley-fallow, mine pretty much goes clothes-makeup-shoes-clothes. (I don\u2019t usually bother with fallow.) Shopping is actually very similar to farming a field. You can\u2019t keep buying the same thing \u2014 you have to have a bit of variety.</p><p>But look what I\u2019ve been missing out on all this time. Look what I\u2019ve been denying myself. I feel quite shaky as I realize the opportunities I\u2019ve just been throwing away over the years. Suitcases, weekend bags, monogrammed hatboxes. . With weak legs I wander into a corner and sit down on a carpeted pedestal next to a red leather vanity case.</p><p>How can I have overlooked luggage for so long? How can I have just blithely led my life ignoring an entire retail sector?</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 what do you think?\u201d says Luke, coming up to me. \u201cAnything worth buying?\u201d</p><p>And now, of course, I feel like a fraud. Why couldn\u2019t he have wanted to buy a really good white shirt, or a cashmere scarf? Or even hand cream? I would have been able to advise him authoritatively and even quote prices. But luggage. I\u2019m a beginner at luggage.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, playing for time. \u201cIt depends. They all look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do, don\u2019t they?\u201d He follows my gaze around the department. \u201cBut which one would you choose? If you had to buy one of these suitcases, which one would it be?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t bluff.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d I say, \u201cthis isn\u2019t really my field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d he says, sounding incredulous. \u201cShopping?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuggage,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019s not an area I\u2019ve put a lot of time into. I should have done, I know, but. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. . never mind,\u201d says Luke, his mouth twisting into a smile. \u201cAs a nonexpert, which one would you choose?\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s different.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I say, and get to my feet in a businesslike manner. \u201cWell, let\u2019s have a closer look.\u201d</p> <p>God, we have fun. We line up eight suitcases in a row, and give them marks for looks, heaviness, quality of lining, number of interior pockets, and efficiency of wheels. (I test this by striding the length of the department, pulling the case behind me. By this time, the assistant has just given up and left us to it.) Then we look to see if they have a matching holdall and give that marks, too.</p><p>The prices don\u2019t seem to matter to Luke. Which is a bloody good thing, because they\u2019re astronomical \u2014 and at first sight, so scary, they make me want to run away. But it\u2019s amazing how quickly \u00a31,000 can start to seem like a very reasonable sum for a suitcase \u2014 especially since the Louis Vuitton monogrammed trunk costs about ten times as much. In fact, after a while I find myself thinking quite seriously that I too should really invest in a quality suitcase, instead of my battered old canvas bag.</p><p>But today is Luke\u2019s shopping trip, not mine. And, strangely enough, it\u2019s almost more fun choosing for someone else than for yourself. In the end, we narrow it down to a dark green leather case, which has wonderful trundly wheels, or the palest beige calfskin case, which is a bit heavier, but has a stunning silk lining and is so soft, I can\u2019t stop running my fingers over it. And it has a matching holdall and vanity case \u2014 and they\u2019re just as beautiful. God, if it were me, I\u2019d. .</p><p>But then, it\u2019s not up to me, is it? It\u2019s Luke who\u2019s buying the case. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s got to choose. We sit down on the floor, side by side, and look at them.</p><p>\u201cThe green one would be more practical,\u201d says Luke eventually.</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I say noncommittally. \u201cI suppose it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lighter \u2014 and the wheels are better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that pale calfskin would probably scuff in a matter of minutes. Green\u2019s a more sensible color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I say, trying to sound as though I agree with him.</p><p>He gives me a quizzical look and says, \u201cRight, well, I think we\u2019ve made our choice, don\u2019t you?\u201d And, still sitting on the floor, he calls over the assistant.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d says the assistant, and Luke nods at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to buy one of these pale beige suitcases, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say, and I can\u2019t stop a smile of delight spreading over my face. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the one I liked best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule of life,\u201d says Luke, getting to his feet and brushing down his trousers. \u201cIf you bother to ask someone\u2019s advice, then bother to listen to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t say which one. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d says Luke, reaching out a hand to pull me to my feet. \u201cYour mmms gave it all away.\u201d</p><p>His hand is surprisingly strong round mine, and as he pulls me up, I feel a slight swooping in my stomach. He smells nice, too. Some expensive aftershave, which I don\u2019t recognize. For a moment, neither of us says anything.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Luke at last. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better pay for it, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, suddenly feeling ridiculously nervous. \u201cYes, I suppose you had.\u201d</p><p>He walks off to the checkout and starts talking to the assistant, and I perch next to a display of leather suit-carriers, suddenly feeling a bit awkward. I mean, what happens next?</p><p>Well, we\u2019ll just say good-bye politely, won\u2019t we? Luke\u2019ll probably have to get back to the office. He can\u2019t hang around shopping all day. And if he asks me what I\u2019m doing next, I tell myself, I really will say I\u2019m busy. I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019ve got some important meeting arranged or something.</p><p>\u201cAll sorted out,\u201d he says, coming back. \u201cRebecca, I\u2019m incredibly grateful to you for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cWell, I must be on my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was wondering,\u201d says Luke, before I can continue. \u201cWould you like some lunch?\u201d</p><p>This is turning into my perfect day. Shopping at Harrods, and lunch at Harvey Nichols. I mean, what could be better than that? We go straight up to the Fifth Floor restaurant, and Luke orders a bottle of chilled white wine and raises his glass in a toast.</p><p>\u201cTo luggage,\u201d he says, and smiles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuggage,\u201d I reply happily, and take a sip. It\u2019s just about the most delicious wine I\u2019ve ever tasted. Luke picks up his menu and starts to read it, and I pick mine up, too \u2014 but to be honest, I\u2019m not reading a word. I\u2019m just sitting in a happy glow. I\u2019m looking around with relish at all the smart women coming in to have lunch here, and making notes of their outfits and wondering where that girl over there got her pink boots from. And now, for some reason, I\u2019m thinking about that nice card Luke sent me. And I\u2019m wondering whether it was just being friendly \u2014 or. . or whether it was something else.</p><p>At this thought, my stomach flips so hard I almost feel sick, and very quickly I take another sip of wine. Well, a gulp, really. Then I put down my glass, count to five, and say casually, \u201cThanks for your card, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, looking up. \u201cOh, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He reaches for his glass and takes a sip of wine. \u201cIt was nice to bump into you that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great place,\u201d I say. \u201cGreat for table-hopping.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as I\u2019ve said this, I feel myself blush. But Luke just smiles and says, \u201cIndeed.\u201d Then he puts down his glass and says, \u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhm. .\u201d I say, glancing hurriedly at the menu. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just have. . erm. . fish cakes. And rocket salad.\u201d</p><p>Damn, I\u2019ve just spotted squid. I should have had that. Oh well, too late now.</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d says Luke, smiling at me. \u201cAnd thanks again for coming along today. It\u2019s always good to have a second opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I say lightly, and take a sip of wine. \u201cHope you enjoy the case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not for me,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s for Sacha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say pleasantly. \u201cWho\u2019s Sacha? Your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend,\u201d says Luke, and turns away to beckon to a waiter.</p><p>And I stare at him, unable to move.</p><p>His girlfriend. I\u2019ve been helping him choose a suitcase for his girlfriend.</p><p>Suddenly I don\u2019t feel hungry anymore. I don\u2019t want fish cakes and rocket salad. I don\u2019t even want to be here. My happy glow is fading away, and underneath I feel chilly and rather stupid. Luke Brandon\u2019s got a girlfriend. Of course he has. Some beautiful smart girl called Sacha, who has manicured nails and travels everywhere with expensive cases. I\u2019m a fool, aren\u2019t I? I should have known there\u2019d be a Sacha somewhere on the scene. I mean, it\u2019s obvious.</p> <p>Except. . Except it\u2019s not that obvious. In fact, it\u2019s not obvious at all. Luke hasn\u2019t mentioned his girlfriend all morning. Why hasn\u2019t he? Why didn\u2019t he just say the suitcase was for her in the first place? Why did he let me sit on the floor beside him in Harrods and laugh as I marched up and down, testing the wheels? I wouldn\u2019t have behaved anything like that if I\u2019d known we were buying a case for his girlfriend. And he must have known that. He must have known.</p><p>A cold feeling begins to creep over me. This is all wrong.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d says Luke, turning back to me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. You didn\u2019t tell me that case was for your girlfriend. You didn\u2019t even tell me you had a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019ve done it now. I\u2019ve been completely uncool. But somehow I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Luke after a pause. He picks up a piece of bread and begins to break it up with his fingers, then looks up. \u201cSacha and I have been together awhile now,\u201d he says kindly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I gave. . any other impression.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s patronizing me. I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d I say, feeling my cheeks flushing beet red. \u201cIt\u2019s just. . it\u2019s all wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong?\u201d he says, looking amused.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me we were choosing a case for your girlfriend,\u201d I say doggedly, staring down at the table. \u201cIt would have made things. . different.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I raise my eyes, to see Luke looking at me as though I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re getting this all out of proportion. I wanted your opinion on suitcases. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you going to tell your girlfriend you asked my advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d says Luke, and gives a little laugh. \u201cI expect she\u2019ll be rather amused.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in silence, feeling mortification creep over me. My throat\u2019s tight, and there\u2019s a pain growing in my chest. Amused. Sacha will be amused when she hears about me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, of course she will.

The girl who didn\u2019t know SBG and Rutland Bank had merged. The girl no one would ever think of taking seriously. Luke didn\u2019t bother telling me we were choosing a suitcase for his girlfriend because I don\u2019t matter.

Suddenly, triple-A-rated jobs in banking and Harrods with Luke Brandon seem miles away. Real life isn\u2019t swanning round Knightsbridge in a taxi, choosing \u00a31,000 suitcases, is it? This is real life. Home to a tiny flat which still smells of curry, and a pile of nasty letters from the bank, and no idea what to do about them.</p><p>I put my key in the lock, and as I open the door, I hear Suze cry, \u201cBex? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, trying to sound cheerful. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d she says, appearing at the door of my bedroom. Her face is all pink, and there\u2019s a shine in her eyes. \u201cGuess what! I\u2019ve got a surprise for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I say, putting down my briefcase. To be honest, I\u2019m not in the mood for one of Suze\u2019s surprises. She\u2019ll just have moved my bed to a different place, or something. And all I want is to sit down and have a cup of tea and something to eat. I never did get any lunch.</p><p>\u201cCome and see. No, no, shut your eyes, first. I\u2019ll lead you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say reluctantly. I close my eyes and allow her to take my hand. We start to walk along the corridor \u2014 and of course, as we near my bedroom door, I start feeling a little tingle of anticipation in spite of myself. I always fall for things like this.</p><p>\u201cDa-daaa! You can look now!\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and look dazedly around my room, wondering what mad thing Suze has done. At least she hasn\u2019t painted the walls or touched the curtains, and my computer\u2019s safely switched off. So what on earth can she have. . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then I see them. On my bed. Piles and piles of upholstered frames. All made up perfectly, with no wonky corners, and the braid glued neatly in place. I can\u2019t quite believe my eyes. There must be at least. .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a hundred,\u201d says Suze behind me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to do the rest tomorrow! Aren\u2019t they fab?\u201d</p><p>I turn and stare incredulously at her. \u201cYou. . you did all these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt was easy, once I got into a rhythm. I did it in front of Morning Coffee. Oh, I wish you\u2019d seen it. They had such a good phone-in, about men who dress up in women\u2019s clothes! Emma was being all sympathetic, but Rory looked like he wanted to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say, trying to get my head round this. \u201cWait. Suze, I don\u2019t understand. This must have taken you ages.\u201d My eye runs disbelievingly over the pile of frames again. \u201cWhy. . why on earth did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t getting very far with them, were you?\u201d says Suze. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d give you a helping hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA helping hand?\u201d I echo weakly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the rest tomorrow, and then I\u2019ll ring up the delivery people,\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a very good system. You don\u2019t have to post them, or anything. They just come and pick them up! And then they\u2019ll send you a check. It should come to about \u00a3284. Pretty good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d I turn round. \u201cWhat do you mean, they\u2019ll send me a check?\u201d Suze looks at me as though I\u2019m stupid.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Bex, they are your frames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you made them! Suze, you should get the money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did them for you!\u201d says Suze, and stares at me. \u201cI did them so you could make your three hundred quid!\u201d</p><p>I stare at her silently, feeling a sudden thickness in my throat. Suze made all these frames for me. Slowly I sit down on the bed, pick up one of the frames, and run my finger along the fabric. It\u2019s absolutely perfect. You could sell it in Liberty\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSuze, it\u2019s your money. Not mine,\u201d I say eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s your project now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d says Suze, and a triumphant look spreads over her face. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own project.\u201d</p> <p>She comes over to the bed, reaches behind the pile of made-up frames, and pulls something out. It\u2019s a photo frame, but it\u2019s nothing like a Fine Frame. It\u2019s upholstered in silver furry fabric, and the word angel is appliqu\u00e9d in pink across the top, and there are little silver pom-poms at the corners. It\u2019s the coolest, kitschest frame I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d she says, a bit nervously.</p><p>\u201cI love it!\u201d I say, grabbing it from her hands and looking more closely at it. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get it anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cI made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cYou. . made this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. During Neighbours. It was awful, actually. Beth found out about Joey and Skye.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m completely astounded. How come Suze suddenly turns out to be so talented?</p><p>\u201cSo what do you reckon?\u201d she says, taking the frame back and turning it over in her fingers. \u201cCould I sell these?\u201d</p> <p>Could she sell these?</p><p>\u201cSuze,\u201d I say quite seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a millionaire.\u201d</p><p>And we spend the rest of the evening getting very pissed and eating ice cream, as we always do when something good or bad happens to either one of us. We map out Suze\u2019s career as a high-flying businesswoman, and get quite hysterical trying to decide if she should wear Chanel or Prada when she goes to meet the queen. Somehow the discussion ends with us trying on each other\u2019s smartest outfits (Suze looks really good in my new Hobbs dress, much better than me), and by the time I get into bed, I\u2019ve forgotten all about Luke Brandon, and Bank of Helsinki, and the rest of my disastrous day.</p><p>The next morning, it all comes rushing back to me like a horror movie. I wake up feeling pale and shaky, and desperately wishing I could take a sickie. I don\u2019t want to go to work. I want to stay at home under the duvet, watching daytime telly and being a millionairess entrepreneur with Suze.</p><p>But it\u2019s the busiest week of the month, and Philip\u2019ll never believe I\u2019m ill.</p><p>So, somehow, I haul myself out of bed and into some clothes and onto the tube. At Lucio\u2019s I buy myself an extra large cappuccino, and a muffin, and a chocolate brownie. I don\u2019t care if I get fat. I just need sugar and caffeine and chocolate, and as much as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luckily it\u2019s so busy, no one\u2019s talking very much, so I don\u2019t have to bother telling everyone at the office what I did on my day off.

Suddenly I feel a bit small and sad, and I scrunch up even more in my chair. Oh God, I hate today. I hate everything. I want to go hooome.</p><p>By the time Friday arrives, I have to say I feel a lot more cheerful. This is primarily because: 1. It\u2019s Friday.2. I\u2019m spending all day out of the office.3. Elly phoned yesterday and said sorry she was so abrupt, but someone else came into the office just as we were talking. And she\u2019s going to be at the Personal Finance Fair.</p><p>Plus:</p><p>4. I have completely put the Luke Brandon incident from my mind. Who cares about him, anyway? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So as I get ready to go, I feel quite bouncy and positive. I put on my new gray cardigan over a short black shirt, and my new Hobbs boots \u2014 dark gray suede \u2014 and I have to say, I look bloody good in them. God, I love new clothes. If everyone could just wear new clothes every day, I reckon depression wouldn\u2019t exist anymore.</p><p>As I\u2019m about to leave, a pile of letters comes through the letterbox for me. Several of them look like bills, and one is yet another letter from Endwich Bank. But I have a clever new solution to all these nasty letters: I just put them in my dressing table drawer and close it. It\u2019s the only way to stop getting stressed out about it. And it really does work. As I thrust the drawer shut and head out of the front door, I\u2019ve already forgotten all about them.</p><p>The conference is buzzing by the time I get there. I give my name to the press officer at reception and I\u2019m given a big, shiny courtesy carrier bag with the logo of HSBC on the side. Inside this, I find an enormous press pack complete with a photo of all the conference organizers lifting glasses of champagne to each other, a voucher for two drinks at the Sun Alliance Pimm\u2019s Stand, a raffle ticket to win \u00a31,000 (invested in the unit trust of my choice), a big lollipop advertising Eastgate Insurance, and my name badge with press stamped across the top. There\u2019s also a white envelope with the ticket to the Barclays Champagne Reception inside, and I put that carefully in my bag. Then I fasten my name badge prominently on my lapel and start to walk around the arena.</p><p>Normally, of course, the rule is to throw away your name badge. But the great thing about being press at one of these events is that people fall over themselves to ply you with free stuff. A lot of it\u2019s just boring old leaflets about savings plans, but some of them are giving out free gifts and snacks, too. So after an hour, I\u2019ve accumulated two pens, a paper knife, a mini box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a helium balloon with Save &amp; Prosper on the side, and a T-shirt with a cartoon on the front, sponsored by some mobile phone company. I\u2019ve had two free cappuccinos, a pain au chocolat, some apple cider (from Somerset Savings), a mini pack of Smarties, and my Pimm\u2019s from Sun Alliance. (I haven\u2019t written a single note in my notebook, or asked a single question \u2014 but never mind.)</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen that some people are carrying quite neat little silver desk clocks, and I wouldn\u2019t mind one of those, so I\u2019m just wandering along, trying to work out what direction they\u2019re coming from, when a voice says, \u201cBecky!\u201d</p><p>I look up \u2014 and it\u2019s Elly! She\u2019s standing at the Wetherby\u2019s display with a couple of guys in suits, waving at me to come over.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say delightedly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d she says, beaming. \u201cReally getting along well.\u201d And she does look the part, I have to say. She\u2019s wearing a bright red suit (Karen Millen, no doubt), and some really nice square-toed shoes, and her hair\u2019s tied back. The only thing I don\u2019t go for is the earrings. Why is she suddenly wearing pearl earrings? Maybe it\u2019s just to blend in with the others.</p><p>\u201cGod, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually one of them!\u201d I say, lowering my voice slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be interviewing you next!\u201d I tilt my head earnestly, like Martin Bashir on Panorama. \u201c \u2018Ms. Granger, could you tell me the aims and principles of Wetherby\u2019s Investments?\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Elly gives a little laugh, then reaches into a box beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you this,\u201d she says, and hands me a brochure.</p><p>\u201cOh thanks,\u201d I say ironically, and stuff it into my bag. I suppose she has to look good in front of her colleagues.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite an exciting time at Wetherby\u2019s,\u201d continues Elly. \u201cYou know we\u2019re launching a whole new range of funds next month? There are five altogether. UK Growth, UK Prospects, European Growth, European Prospects, and. .\u201d</p><p>Why is she telling me this, exactly?</p><p>\u201cElly. .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd US Growth!\u201d she finishes triumphantly. There isn\u2019t a flicker of humor in her eyes. Suddenly I find myself remembering Luke saying he wasn\u2019t surprised by Elly joining Wetherby\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cWell, that sounds. . fab!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could arrange for our PR people to give you a call, if you like,\u201d she says. \u201cFill you in a bit more.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s OK. So, erm. . what are you doing afterward? Do you want to go for a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do,\u201d she says apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at a flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you moving?\u201d I say in surprise. Elly lives in the coolest flat in Camden, with two guys who are in a band and get her into loads of free gigs and stuff. I can\u2019t think why she\u2019d want to move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m buying,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m looking around Streatham, Tooting. . I just want to get on the first rung of that property ladder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say feebly. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do it yourself, you know, Becky,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t hang around in a student flat forever. Real life has to begin sometime!\u201d She glances at one of her men in suits, and he gives a little laugh.</p><p>It\u2019s not a student flat, I think indignantly. And anyway, who defines \u201creal life\u201d? Who says \u201creal life\u201d is property ladders and hideous pearl earrings? \u201cShit-boring tedious life,\u201d more like.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to the Barclays Champagne Reception?\u201d I say as a last gasp, thinking maybe we can go and have some fun together. But she pulls a little face and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cI might pop in,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be quite tied up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll. . I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>I move away from the stand and slowly start walking toward the corner where the Champagne Reception\u2019s being held, feeling slightly dispirited. In spite of myself, a part of me starts wondering if maybe Elly\u2019s right and I\u2019m wrong. Maybe I should be talking about property ladders and growth funds, too. Oh God, I\u2019m missing the gene which makes you grow up and buy a flat in Streatham and start visiting Homebase every weekend. Everyone\u2019s moving on without me, into a world I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>But as I get near the entrance to the Champagne Reception, I feel my spirits rising. Whose spirits don\u2019t rise at the thought of free champagne? It\u2019s all being held in a huge tent, and there\u2019s a huge banner, and a band playing music, and a girl in a sash at the entrance, handing out Barclays key rings. When she sees my badge, she gives me a wide smile, hands me a white glossy press pack, and says, \u201cBear with me a moment.\u201d Then she walks off to a little group of people, murmurs in the ear of a man in a suit, and comes back. \u201cSomeone will be with you soon,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the meantime, let me get you a glass of champagne.\u201d</p> <p>You see what I mean about being press? Everywhere you go, you get special treatment. I accept a glass of champagne, stuff the press pack into my carrier bag, and take a sip. Oh, it\u2019s delicious. Icy cold and sharp and bubbly. Maybe I\u2019ll stay here for a couple of hours, I think, just drinking champagne until there\u2019s none left. They won\u2019t dare chuck me out, I\u2019m press. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll. .</p><p>\u201cRebecca. Glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>I look up and feel myself freeze. The man in the suit was Luke Brandon. Luke Brandon\u2019s standing in front of me, with an expression I can\u2019t quite read. And suddenly I feel sick. All that stuff I planned about playing it cool and icy isn\u2019t going to work \u2014 because just seeing his face, I feel hot with humiliation, all over again.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I mutter, looking down. Why am I even saying hi to him?</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d come,\u201d he says in a low, serious voice. \u201cI very much wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cWell, I. . I can\u2019t talk, I\u2019ve got to mingle. I\u2019m here to work, you know.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to sound dignified, but there\u2019s a wobble in my voice, and I can feel my cheeks flush as he keeps gazing at me. So I turn away before he can say anything else, and march off toward the other side of the tent. I don\u2019t quite know where I\u2019m heading, but I\u2019ve just got to keep walking until I find someone to talk to.</p><p>The trouble is, I can\u2019t see anyone I recognize. It\u2019s all just groups of bank-type people laughing loudly together and talking about golf. They all seem really tall and broad-shouldered, and I can\u2019t even catch anyone\u2019s eye. God, this is embarrassing. I feel like a six-year-old at a grown-up\u2019s party. In the corner I spot Moira Channing from the Daily Herald, and she gives me a half flicker of recognition \u2014 but I\u2019m certainly not going to talk to her. OK, just keep walking, I tell myself. Pretend you\u2019re on your way somewhere. Don\u2019t panic.</p><p>Then I see Luke Brandon on the other side of the tent. His head jerks up as he sees me, and and he starts heading toward me. Oh God, quick. Quick. I\u2019ve got to find somebody to talk to.</p><p>Right, how about this couple standing together? The guy\u2019s middle-aged, the woman\u2019s quite a lot younger, and they don\u2019t look as if they know too many people, either. Thank God. Whoever they are, I\u2019ll just ask them how they\u2019re enjoying the Personal Finance Fair and whether they\u2019re finding it useful, and pretend I\u2019m making notes for my article. And when Luke Brandon arrives, I\u2019ll be too engrossed in conversation even to notice him. OK, go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a gulp of champagne, approach the man, and smile brightly.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d I say. \u201cRebecca Bloomwood, Successful Saving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says, turning toward me and extending his hand. \u201cDerek Smeath from Endwich Bank.

They don\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cYou journalists have to be expert on everything, I suppose,\u201d says Derek, who has given up trying to shake my hand and is swigging his champagne instead.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do really,\u201d I reply, and risk a smile. \u201cWe get to know all areas of personal finance \u2014 from banking to unit trusts to life insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you acquire all this knowledge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we just pick it up along the way,\u201d I say smoothly.</p><p>You know what? This is quite fun, actually, now that I\u2019ve relaxed. And Derek Smeath isn\u2019t at all scary in the flesh. In fact, he\u2019s rather cozy and friendly, like some nice sitcom uncle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve often thought,\u201d says Erica Parnell, \u201cthat they should do a fly-on-the-wall documentary about a bank.\u201d She gives me an expectant look and I nod vigorously.</p><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d I say. \u201cI think that would be fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see some of the characters we get in! People who have absolutely no idea about their finances. Don\u2019t we, Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed,\u201d says Derek. \u201cUtterly amazed. The lengths people go to, just to avoid paying off their overdrafts! Or even talking to us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, as though astonished.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it!\u201d says Erica. \u201cI sometimes wonder\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d A voice booms behind me and I turn round in shock to see Philip, clutching a glass of champagne and grinning at me. What\u2019s he doing here?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cMarketing canceled the meeting, so I thought I\u2019d pop along after all. How\u2019s it all going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great!\u201d I say, and take a gulp of champagne. \u201cThis is Derek, and Erica. . this is my editor, Philip Page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndwich Bank, eh?\u201d says Philip, looking at Derek Smeath\u2019s name badge. \u201cYou must know Martin Gollinger, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not head office, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d says Derek, giving a little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m the manager of our Fulham branch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFulham!\u201d says Philip. \u201cTrendy Fulham.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly a warning bell goes off in my head. Dong-dong-dong! I\u2019ve got to do something. I\u2019ve got to say something; change the subject. But it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m the spectator on the mountain, watching the trains collide in the valley below.</p><p>\u201cRebecca lives in Fulham,\u201d Philip\u2019s saying. \u201cWho do you bank with, Rebecca? You\u2019re probably one of Derek\u2019s customers!\u201d He laughs loudly at his own joke, and Derek laughs politely, too.</p><p>But I can\u2019t laugh. I\u2019m frozen to the spot, watching Erica Parnell\u2019s face as it changes. As realization slowly dawns. She meets my eye, and I feel something icy drip down my spine.</p><p>\u201cRebecca Bloomwood,\u201d she says, in quite a different voice. \u201cI thought I knew that name. Do you live in Burney Road, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s clever!\u201d says Philip. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d And he takes another swig of champagne.</p><p>Shut up, Philip, I think frantically. Shut up.</p><p>\u201cSo you do?\u201d Her voice is sweet but sharp. Oh God, now Philip\u2019s looking at me, waiting for me to answer.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say in a strangled voice. I\u2019m gripping my champagne glass so hard, I think I might break it.</p><p>\u201cDerek, have you realized who this is?\u201d says Erica pleasantly. \u201cThis is Rebecca Bloomwood, one of our customers.

They\u2019ll sit me down and start going through all my expenditures and. . Oh God, I feel sick at the thought of it. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t go. End of story.</p><p>Option Two: Go to meeting and lie.</p><p>So, what, tell them the \u00a31,000 is absolutely on its way, and that further funds will be coming through soon. Hmm. Possible. The trouble is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll believe me. So they\u2019ll still get all serious, sit me down, give me a lecture. No way.</p><p>Option Three: Don\u2019t go to meeting.</p><p>But if I don\u2019t, Derek Smeath will phone Philip and they\u2019ll start talking. Maybe the whole story will come out, and he\u2019ll find out I didn\u2019t actually break my leg. Or have glandular fever. And after that I won\u2019t ever be able to go back into the office. I\u2019ll be unemployed. My life will be over at the age of twenty-five. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Option Four: Go to meeting with check for \u00a31,000.</p><p>Perfect. Waltz in, hand over the check, say \u201cWill there be anything else?\u201d and waltz out again.</p><p>But how do I get \u00a31,000 before Monday morning? How?</p><p>Option Five: Run away.</p> <p>Which would be very childish and immature. Not worth considering.</p><p>I wonder where I could go? Maybe abroad somewhere. Las Vegas. Yes, and I could win a fortune at the casinos. A million pounds or something. Even more, perhaps. And then, yes, then I\u2019d fax Derek Smeath, saying I\u2019m closing my bank account due to his lack of faith in me.</p><p>God yes! Wouldn\u2019t that be great? \u201cDear Mr. Smeath, I was a little surprised at your recent implication that I have insufficient funds to cover my overdraft. As this check for \u00a31.2 million shows, I have ample funds at my disposal, which I will shortly be moving to one of your competitors. Perhaps they will treat me with more respect. p.s., I am copying this letter to your superiors.\u201d</p><p>I love this idea so much, I lean back and wallow in it for a while, amending the letter over and over in my head. \u201cDear Mr. Smeath, as I tried to inform you discreetly at our last encounter, I am in fact a millionairess. If only you had trusted me, things might have been different.\u201d</p><p>God, he\u2019ll be sorry, won\u2019t he? He\u2019ll probably phone up and apologize. Try and keep my business and say he hadn\u2019t meant to offend me. But it\u2019ll be too late. Hah! Ha-ha-ha-ha. .</p> <p>Oh blast. Missed my stop.</p><p>When I get home, Suze is sitting on the floor, surrounded by magazines.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says brightly. \u201cGuess what? I\u2019m going to be in Vogue!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say disbelievingly. \u201cWere you spotted on the streets or something?\u201d Suze has got an excellent figure. She could easily be a model. But still. . Vogue!</p><p>\u201cNot me, silly!\u201d she says. \u201cMy frames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour frames are going to be in Vogue?\u201d Now I really am disbelieving.</p> <p>\u201cIn the June issue! I\u2019m going to be in a piece called \u2018Just Relax: Designers Who Are Bringing the Fun Back into Interiors.\u2019 It\u2019s cool, isn\u2019t it? The only thing is, I\u2019ve only made two frames so far, so I need to make a few more in case people want to buy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to grasp all this. \u201cSo \u2014 how come Vogue is doing a piece about you? Did they. . hear about you?\u201d I mean, she only started making frames four days ago!</p><p>\u201cNo, silly!\u201d she says, and laughs. \u201cI phoned up Lally. Have you met Lally?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWell, she\u2019s fashion editor of Vogue now, and she spoke to Perdy, who\u2019s the interiors editor, and Perdy phoned me back \u2014 and when I told her what my frames were like, she just went wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me what to say in my interview, too,\u201d Suze adds, and clears her throat importantly. \u201cI want to create spaces for people to enjoy, not admire. There\u2019s a bit of the child in all of us. Life\u2019s too short for minimalism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, there was something else, too.\u201d Suze frowns thoughtfully. \u201cOh yes, my designs are inspired by the imaginative spirit of Gaudi. I\u2019m going to phone up Charlie now,\u201d she adds happily. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s something at Tatler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say again.</p> <p>And it is great.</p><p>I\u2019m really glad for Suze. Of course I am. If Suze gets in Vogue, I\u2019ll be the proudest person in the world.</p><p>But at the same time there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s thinking, How come everything happens so easily for her? I bet Suze has never had to face a nasty bank manager in her life. And I bet she never will have to, either.</p><p>Immediately I feel a huge spasm of guilt. Why can\u2019t I just be glad for Suze and nothing else? Dispiritedly I sink down onto the floor and begin to flip through a magazine.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d says Suze, looking up from the phone. \u201cTarquin rang about an hour ago, to arrange your date.\u201d She grins wickedly. \u201cAre you looking forward to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say dully. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten all about it, to be honest. But it\u2019s OK \u2014 I\u2019ll just wait until tomorrow afternoon and say I\u2019ve got period pain. Easy. No one ever questions that, especially men.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Suze, gesturing to a Harper\u2019s and Queen open on the floor. \u201cAnd look who I came across just now in the Hundred Richest Bachelors list! Oh hi, Charlie,\u201d she says into the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Suze! Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>I look down at the open Harper\u2019s and Queen and freeze. Luke Brandon is staring out of the page at me, an easy smile on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Number 31, reads the caption.

I have to check there isn\u2019t some other Tarquin Cleath-Stuart.

Twenty-five million pounds!\u201d</p><p>My heart stops.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he got \u00a325 million, then?\u201d I says carelessly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d She laughs as though the idea\u2019s ridiculous. \u201cThe estate\u2019s worth about. .

The fifteenth richest bachelor in Britain doesn\u2019t just meet you at a tube station, does he? He doesn\u2019t just say \u201cSee you under the big clock at Waterloo.\u201d He comes and picks you up.</p><p>Oh, this is it. This is it! Forget Luke Brandon, forget suitcases. My new life has finally begun.</p><p>I have never spent so long on getting ready for a date in my life. Never. The process starts at eight on Saturday morning when I look at my open wardrobe and realize that I don\u2019t have a single thing to wear \u2014 and only ends at seven-thirty that evening when I give my lashes another layer of mascara, spray myself in Coco Chanel, and walk into the sitting room for Suze\u2019s verdict.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d she says, looking up from a frame she is upholstering in distressed denim. \u201cYou look. . bloody amazing!\u201d</p><p>And I have to say, I agree. I\u2019m wearing all black \u2014 but expensive black. The kind of deep, soft black you fall into. A simple sleeveless dress from Whistles, the highest of Jimmy Choos, a pair of stunning uncut amethyst earrings. And please don\u2019t ask how much it all cost, because that\u2019s irrelevant. This is investment shopping. The biggest investment of my life.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t eaten anything all day so I\u2019m nice and thin, and for once my hair has fallen perfectly into shape. I look. . well, I\u2019ve never looked better in my life.</p><p>But of course, looks are only part of the package, aren\u2019t they? Which is why I cannily stopped off at Waterstones on the way home and bought a book on Wagner. I\u2019ve been reading it all afternoon, while I waited for my nails to dry, and have even memorized a few little passages to throw into the conversation.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what else Tarquin is into, apart from Wagner. Still, that should be enough to keep us going. And anyway, I expect he\u2019s planning to take me somewhere really glamorous with a jazz band, so we\u2019ll be too busy dancing cheek to cheek to make conversation.</p><p>The doorbell rings and I give a little start. I have to admit, my heart is pounding with nerves. But at the same time I feel strangely cool. This is it. Here begins my new multimillion-pound existence. Luke Brandon, eat your heart out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d says Suze, grinning at me, and disappears out into the hall. A moment later I hear her saying \u201cTarkie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d</p> <p>I glance at myself in the mirror, take a deep breath, and turn to face the door, just as Tarquin appears. His head is as bony as ever, and he\u2019s wearing another of his odd-looking suits. But somehow none of that seems to matter anymore. In fact, I\u2019m not really taking in the way he looks. I\u2019m just staring at him. Staring and staring at him, unable to speak; unable to frame any thought at all except: twenty-five million pounds.</p><p>Twenty-five million pounds.</p><p>The sort of thought that makes you feel dizzy and elated, like a fairground ride. I suddenly want to run around the room, yelling \u201cTwenty-five million! Twenty-five million!\u201d throwing bank notes up in the air as if I were in some Hollywood comedy caper.</p><p>But I don\u2019t. Of course I don\u2019t. I say, \u201cHi, Tarquin,\u201d and give him a dazzling smile.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and look bashfully down at my dress.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you want to stay for a titchy?\u201d says Suze, who is looking on fondly, as if she\u2019s my mother and this is senior prom night and I\u2019m dating the most popular boy in school.</p><p>\u201cErmm. . no, I think we\u2019ll just get going,\u201d says Tarquin, meeting my eye. \u201cWhat do you think, Becky?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>A TAXI IS CHUGGING outside in the road, and Tarquin ushers me inside. To be honest, I\u2019m a bit disappointed it isn\u2019t a chauffeur-driven limousine \u2014 but still. This is pretty good, too. Being whisked off in a taxi by one of Britain\u2019s most eligible bachelors to. . who knows where? The Savoy? Claridges? Dancing at Annabel\u2019s? Tarquin hasn\u2019t told me yet where we\u2019re going.</p><p>Oh God, maybe it\u2019ll be one of those mad places where everything is served under a silver dome and there\u2019s a million knives and forks and snooty waiters looking on, just waiting to catch you out.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d just have a nice quiet supper,\u201d says Tarquin, looking over at me.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d I say. \u201cNice quiet supper. Perfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thank God. That probably means we\u2019re not heading for silver domes. We\u2019re going to some tiny tucked-away place that hardly anyone knows about. Some little private club where you have to knock on an anonymous-looking door in a back street, and you get inside and it\u2019s packed with celebrities sitting on sofas, behaving like normal people. Yes! And maybe Tarquin knows them all!</p><p>But of course he knows them all. He\u2019s a multimillionaire, isn\u2019t he?</p><p>I look out of the window and see that we\u2019re driving past Harrods. And for just a moment, my stomach tightens painfully as I remember the last time I was here. Bloody suitcases. Bloody Luke Brandon. Huh. In fact, I wish he was walking along the road right now, so I could give him a careless, I\u2019m-with-the-fifteenth-richest-single-man-in-Britain wave.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Tarquin suddenly to the taxi driver. \u201cYou can drop us here.\u201d He grins at me. \u201cPractically on the doorstep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say, and reach for the door.</p><p>Practically on the doorstep of where? As I get out I look around, wondering where on earth we\u2019re going. We\u2019re at Hyde Park Corner. What\u2019s at Hyde Park Corner? I turn round slowly, and glimpse a sign \u2014 and suddenly I realize what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re going to the Lanesborough!</p><p>Wow. How classy is that? Dinner at the Lanesborough. But naturally. Where else would one go on a first date?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Tarquin, appearing at my side. \u201cI just thought we could get a bite to eat and then. . see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I say, as we start walking.</p> <p>Excellent! Dinner at the Lanesborough and then on to some glam nightclub. This is all shaping up wonderfully.</p><p>We walk straight past the entrance to the Lanesborough, but I\u2019m not fazed by that. Everyone knows VIPs always go in through the back to avoid the paparazzi. Not that I can actually see any paparazzi, but it probably becomes a habit. We\u2019ll duck into some back alley, and walk through the kitchens while the chefs pretend they can\u2019t see us, and then emerge in the foyer. This is so cool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been here before,\u201d says Tarquin apologetically. \u201cNot the most original choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d I say, as we stop and head toward a pair of glass doors. \u201cI simply adore. .\u201d</p><p>Hang on, where are we? This isn\u2019t the back entrance to anywhere. This is. .</p><p>Pizza on the Park.</p> <p>Tarquin\u2019s taking me to Pizza Express. I don\u2019t believe it. The fifteenth richest man in the country is taking me to bloody Pizza Express.</p><p>\u201c. . pizza,\u201d I finish weakly. \u201cLove the stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good!\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cI thought we probably didn\u2019t want anywhere too flashy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d I pull what I think is a very convincing face. \u201cI hate flashy places. Much better to have a nice quiet pizza together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d says Tarquin, turning to look at me. \u201cBut now I feel rather bad. You\u2019ve dressed up so nicely. .\u201d He pauses doubtfully, gazing at my outfit. (As well he might. I didn\u2019t go and spend a fortune in Whistles for Pizza Express.) \u201cI mean, if you wanted to, we could go somewhere a bit smarter. The Lanesborough\u2019s just around the corner. .\u201d</p><p>He raises his eyes questioningly, and I\u2019m about to say \u201cOh, yes, please!\u201d when suddenly, in a blinding flash, I realize what\u2019s going on. This is a test, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like choosing out of three caskets in a fairy tale. Everyone knows the rules. You never choose the gold shiny one. Or even the quite impressive silver one. What you\u2019re supposed to do is choose the dull little lead one, and then there\u2019s a flash of light and it turns into a mountain of jewels. So this is it. Tarquin\u2019s testing me, to see whether I like him for himself.</p><p>Which, frankly, I find rather insulting. I mean, who does he think I am?</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s stay here,\u201d I say, and touch his arm briefly. \u201cMuch more relaxed. Much more. . fun.\u201d</p> <p>Which is actually quite true. And I do like pizza. And that yummy garlic bread. Mmm. You know, now I come to think about it, this is quite a good choice.</p><p>As the waiter hands us our menus, I give a cursory flash down the list, but I already know what I want. It\u2019s what I always have when I go to Pizza Express \u2014 Fiorentina. The one with spinach and an egg. I know, it sounds weird, but honestly, it\u2019s delicious.</p><p>\u201cWould you like an aperitif?\u201d says the waiter, and I\u2019m about to say what I usually do, which is Oh, let\u2019s just have a bottle of wine, when I think, Sod it, I\u2019m having dinner with a multimillionaire here. I\u2019m bloody well going to have a gin and tonic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA gin and tonic,\u201d I say firmly, and look at Tarquin, daring him to look taken aback. But he grins at me and says, \u201cUnless you wanted champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, completely thrown.</p><p>\u201cI always think champagne and pizza is a good combination,\u201d he says, and looks at the waiter. \u201cA bottle of Moet, please.\u201d</p><p>Well, this is more like it. This is a lot more like it. Champagne and pizza. And Tarquin is actually being quite normal.</p> <p>The champagne arrives and we toast each other and take a few sips. I\u2019m really starting to enjoy myself. Then I spot Tarquin\u2019s bony hand edging slowly toward mine on the table. And in a reflex action \u2014 completely without meaning to \u2014 I whip my fingers away, pretending I have to scratch my ear. A flicker of disappointment passes over his face and I find myself giving a really fake, embarrassed cough and looking intently at a picture on the wall to my left.</p><p>I can do this, I tell myself firmly. I can be attracted to him. It\u2019s just a matter of self-control and possibly also getting very drunk. So I lift my glass and take several huge gulps. I can feel the bubbles surging into my head, singing happily \u201cI\u2019m going to be a millionaire\u2019s wife! I\u2019m going to be a millionaire\u2019s wife!\u201d And when I look back at Tarquin, he already seems a bit more attractive (in a stoaty kind of way). Alcohol is obviously going to be the key to our marital happiness.</p><p>My head is filled with a happy vision of our wedding day. Me in some wonderful designer dress; my mum and dad looking on proudly. No more money troubles ever. Ever. The fifteenth richest man in the country. A house in Belgravia. Mrs. Tarquin Cleath-Stuart. Just imagining it, I feel almost faint with longing.</p><p>I smile as warmly as I can at Tarquin, who hesitates \u2014 then smiles back. Phew. I haven\u2019t wrecked things. It\u2019s all still on. Now we just need to discover that we\u2019re utter soul mates with loads of things in common.</p><p>\u201cI love the\u2014\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cDo you\u2014\u201d</p><p>We both speak at once.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cDo carry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you carry on,\u201d says Tarquin.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cWell. . I was just going to say again how much I love the picture you gave Suze.\u201d No harm in complimenting his taste again. \u201cI love horses,\u201d I add for good measure.</p><p>\u201cThen we should go riding together,\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cI know a very good livery near Hyde Park. Not quite the same as in the country, of course. .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a wonderful idea!\u201d I say. \u201cThat would be such fun!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way anyone\u2019s getting me on a horse. Not even in Hyde Park. But that\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll just go along with the plan and then, on the day, say I\u2019ve twisted my ankle or something.</p><p>\u201cDo you like dogs?\u201d asks Tarquin.</p><p>\u201cI love dogs,\u201d I say confidently.</p><p>Which is sort of true. I wouldn\u2019t actually like to have a dog \u2014 too much hard work and hairs everywhere. But I like seeing Labradors running across the park. And cute little puppies. That kind of thing.</p><p>We lapse into silence, and I take a few sips of champagne.</p><p>\u201cDo you like EastEnders?\u201d I ask eventually. \u201cOr are you a. . a Coronation Street person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never watched either, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d says Tarquin apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re very good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell. . they\u2019re OK,\u201d I say. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re really good, and other times. .\u201d I tail off a bit feebly, and smile at him. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d exclaims Tarquin, as though I\u2019ve said something really interesting.</p><p>There\u2019s another awkward silence. This is getting a bit sticky.</p><p>\u201cAre there good shops, where you live in Scotland?\u201d I say at last. Tarquin pulls a little face.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. Never go near shops if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say, and take a deep gulp of champagne. \u201cNo, I. . I hate shops, too. Can\u2019t stand shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Tarquin in surprise. \u201cI thought all girls loved shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me!\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d far rather be. . out on the moors, riding along. With a couple of dogs running behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d says Tarquin, smiling at me. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do it sometime.\u201d</p><p>This is more like it! Common interests. Shared pursuits.</p><p>And OK, maybe I haven\u2019t been completely honest, maybe they aren\u2019t exactly my interests at the moment. But they could be. They can be. I can easily get to like dogs and horses, if I have to.</p><p>\u201cOr. . or listening to Wagner, of course,\u201d I say casually. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you really like Wagner?\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cNot everyone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore Wagner,\u201d I insist. \u201cHe\u2019s my favorite composer.\u201d OK, quick \u2014 what did that book say? \u201cI love the. . er. . sonorous melodic strands which interweave in the Prelude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Prelude to what?\u201d says Tarquin interestedly.</p><p>Oh shit. Is there more than one Prelude? I take a gulp of champagne, playing for time, desperately trying to recall something else from the book. But the only other bit I can remember is \u201cRichard Wagner was born in Leipzig.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll the Preludes,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI think they\u2019re all. . fab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Tarquin, looking a bit surprised.</p><p>Oh God. That wasn\u2019t the right thing to say, was it? Change the subject. Change the subject.</p><p>Luckily, at that moment, a waiter arrives with our garlic bread, and we can get off the subject of Wagner. And Tarquin orders some more champagne. Somehow, I think we\u2019re going to need it.</p><p>Which means that by the time I\u2019m halfway through my Fiorentina, I\u2019ve drunk almost an entire bottle of champagne and I\u2019m. . Well, frankly, I\u2019m completely pissed. My face is tingling and my eyes are sparkling, and my arm gestures are a lot more erratic than usual. But this doesn\u2019t matter. In fact, being pissed is a good thing \u2014 because it means I\u2019m also delightfully witty and lively and am more-or-less carrying the conversation single-handedly. Tarquin is also pissed, but not as much as me. He\u2019s got quieter and quieter, and kind of thoughtful. And he keeps gazing at me.</p> <p>As I finish my last scraps of pizza and lean back pleasurably, he stares at me silently for a moment, then reaches into his pocket and produces a little box.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>I have to admit, for one heart-stopping moment I think, This is it! He\u2019s proposing!</p><p>But of course, he\u2019s not proposing, is he? He\u2019s just giving me a little present.</p><p>I knew that.</p><p>So I open it, and find a leather box, and inside is a little gold brooch in the shape of a horse. Lots of fine detail; beautifully crafted. A little green stone (emerald?) for the eye.</p> <p>Really not my kind of thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d I breathe in awe. \u201cAbsolutely. . stunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather jolly, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cThought you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore it.\u201d I turn it over in my fingers then look up at him and blink a couple of times with misty eyes. God, I\u2019m drunk. I think I\u2019m actually seeing through champagne. \u201cThis is so thoughtful of you,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>Plus, I don\u2019t really wear brooches. I mean, where are you supposed to put them? Slap bang in the middle of a really nice top? I mean, come on. And they always leave great brooch-holes everywhere.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll look lovely on you,\u201d says Tarquin after a pause \u2014 and suddenly I realize he\u2019s expecting me to put it on.</p><p>Aaargh! It\u2019ll ruin my lovely Whistles dress! And who wants a horse galloping across their tits, anyway!</p><p>\u201cI must put it on,\u201d I say, and open the clasp. Gingerly, I thread it through the fabric of my dress and clasp it shut, already feeling it pull the dress out of shape.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks wonderful,\u201d says Tarquin, meeting my gaze. \u201cBut then. . you always look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>I feel a dart of apprehension as I see him leaning forward. He\u2019s going to try and hold my hand again, isn\u2019t he? And probably kiss me. I glance at Tarquin\u2019s lips \u2014 parted and slightly moist \u2014 and give an involuntary shudder. Oh God. I\u2019m not quite ready for this. I mean, obviously I do want to kiss Tarquin, of course I do. In fact, I find him incredibly attractive. It\u2019s just. . I think I need some more champagne first.</p><p>\u201cThat scarf you were wearing the other night,\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cIt was simply stunning. I looked at you in that, and I thought. .\u201d</p><p>Now I can see his hand edging toward mine.</p><p>\u201cMy Denny and George scarf!\u201d I cut in brightly, before he can say anything else. \u201cYes, that\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t it? It was my aunt\u2019s, but she died. It was really sad, actually.\u201d</p><p>Just keep talking, I think. Keep talking brightly and gesture a lot.</p><p>\u201cBut anyway, she left me her scarf,\u201d I continue hurriedly. \u201cSo I\u2019ll always remember her through that. Poor Aunt Ermintrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d says Tarquin, looking taken aback. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well. . her memory lives on through her good works,\u201d I say, and give him a little smile. \u201cShe was a very charitable woman.

If you work it out as a fraction of his wealth it\u2019s. . well, it\u2019s laughable, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the equivalent of about fifty pence to normal people. Why am I even hesitating?</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p><p>Tarquin is staring at me \u2014 and I realize my hand is still inches away from the check. Come on, take it, I instruct myself firmly.

I stare into my champagne glass, feeling like crying. Five thousand pounds. It would have changed my life. It would have solved everything. I would have written out checks immediately to Suze, to VISA, to Octagon. . to all of them. Then I would have taken this check and presented it to Derek Smeath on Monday morning. Perhaps I wouldn\u2019t have cleared every single penny of overdraft, but I would have made a start. A bloody good start.</p><p>Tarquin reaches for the box of matches on the table, sets the scraps of paper alight in the ashtray, and we both watch as they briefly flame. Then he puts down the matches, smiles at me, and says, \u201cDo excuse me a minute.\u201d</p><p>He gets up from the table and heads off toward the back of the restaurant, and I take another gulp of champagne. Then I lean my head in my hands and give a little sigh. Oh well, I think, trying to be philosophical. Maybe I\u2019ll win \u00a35,000 in a raffle or something. Maybe Derek Smeath\u2019s computer will go haywire and he\u2019ll be forced to cancel all my debts and start again. Maybe some utter stranger really will pay off my VISA bill for me by mistake.</p><p>Maybe Tarquin will come back from the loo and ask me to marry him.</p> <p>I raise my eyes, and they fall with an idle curiosity on the Coutts checkbook, which Tarquin has left on the table. That\u2019s the checkbook of the fifteenth richest unmarried man in the country. Wow. I wonder what it\u2019s like inside? He probably writes enormous checks all the time, doesn\u2019t he? He probably spends more money in a day than I spend in a year.</p><p>On impulse, I pull the checkbook toward me and open it. I don\u2019t know quite what I\u2019m looking for \u2014 really, I\u2019m just hoping to find some excitingly huge amount. But the first stub is only for \u00a330. Pathetic! I flip on a bit, and find \u00a3520. Payable to Arundel &amp; Son, whoever they are. Then, a bit later on, there\u2019s one for \u00a37,515 to American Express. Well, that\u2019s more like it. But I mean, really, it\u2019s not the most exciting read in the world. This could be anybody\u2019s checkbook. This could practically be mine.</p><p>I close it and push it back toward his place, and glance up. As I do so, my heart freezes. Tarquin is staring straight at me.</p><p>He\u2019s standing by the bar, being directed to the other side of the restaurant by a waiter. But he isn\u2019t looking at the waiter. He\u2019s looking at me. As our eyes meet, my stomach lurches. Oh, damn.</p><p>Damn. What exactly did he see?</p> <p>Quickly I pull my hand back from his checkbook and take a sip of champagne. Then I look up and pretend to spot him for the first time. I give a bright little smile, and after a pause he smiles back. Then he disappears off again and I sink back into my chair, trying to look relaxed.</p><p>OK, don\u2019t panic, I instruct myself. Just behave naturally. He probably didn\u2019t see you. And even if he did \u2014 it\u2019s not the hugest crime in the world, is it, looking at his checkbook? If he asks me what I was doing, I\u2019ll say I was. . checking he\u2019d filled in his stub correctly. Yes. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll say I was doing if he mentions it.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. He comes back to the table, silently pockets his checkbook, and says politely, \u201cHave you finished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, I have, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to sound as natural as possible \u2014 but I\u2019m aware my voice sounds guilty, and my cheeks are hot.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve paid the bill. . so shall we go?\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the end of the date. With impeccable courtesy, Tarquin ushers me to the door of Pizza on the Park, hails a taxi, and pays the driver the fare back to Fulham. I don\u2019t dare ask him if he\u2019d like to come back or go for a drink somewhere else. There\u2019s a coldness about my spine which stops me uttering the words. So we kiss each other on the cheek and he tells me he had a delightful evening, and I thank him again for a lovely time.</p><p>And I sit in the taxi all the way back to Fulham with a jumpy stomach, wondering what exactly he saw.</p><p>I say good-night to the taxi driver and reach for my keys. I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019ll go and run a hot bath and sit in it, and calmly try to work out exactly what happened back there. Did Tarquin really see me looking through his checkbook? Maybe he just saw me pushing it back toward his place in a helpful manner. Maybe he saw nothing at all.</p><p>But then why did he suddenly become all stiff and polite? He must have seen something; suspected something. And then he\u2019ll have noticed the way I flushed and couldn\u2019t meet his eye. Oh God, why do I always have to look so guilty? I wasn\u2019t even doing anything. I was just curious.</p><p>Perhaps I should have quickly said something \u2014 made some joke about it. Turned it into a lighthearted, amusing incident. But what kind of joke can you make about leafing through someone\u2019s private checkbook? Oh God, I\u2019m so stupid. Why did I ever touch the bloody thing? I should have just sat, quietly sipping my drink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But in my defense. . he left it on the table, didn\u2019t he?

OK, so Tarquin wasn\u2019t that friendly just now \u2014 but he might have been feeling ill or something. Or maybe he just didn\u2019t want to rush me. What I\u2019ll do is, tomorrow I\u2019ll send a nice chatty note to him, saying thanks again, and suggesting we go and see some Wagner together. Excellent idea. And I\u2019ll mug up a bit about the Preludes, so that if he asks me which one again, I\u2019ll know exactly what to say. Yes! This is all going to be fine. I need never have worried.</p><p>I swing the door open, taking off my coat \u2014 and then my heart gives a flip. Suze is waiting for me in the hall. She\u2019s sitting on the stairs, waiting for me \u2014 and there\u2019s a reproachful expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex,\u201d she says, and shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ve just been speaking to Tarquin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say, trying to sound natural \u2014 but aware that my voice is a frightened squeak. I turn away, take my coat, and slowly unwind my scarf, playing for time. What exactly has he said to her?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any point asking you why?\u201d she says after a pause.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I falter, feeling sick. God, I could do with a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blaming you, or anything. I just think you should have. .\u201d She shakes her head and sighs. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have let him down more gently? He sounded quite upset. The poor thing was really keen on you, you know.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t quite making sense. Let him down more gently?</p> <p>\u201cWhat exactly\u2014\u201d I lick my dry lips. \u201cWhat exactly did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was only really phoning to tell me you\u2019d left your umbrella behind,\u201d says Suze. \u201cApparently one of the waiters came rushing out with it. But of course I asked him how the date had gone. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd. . and what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Suze, and gives a little shrug. \u201cHe said you\u2019d had a really nice time \u2014 but you\u2019d pretty much made it clear you didn\u2019t want to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I sink down onto the floor, feeling rather weak. So that\u2019s it. Tarquin did see me leafing through his checkbook. I\u2019ve ruined my chances with him completely.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t tell Suze what I\u2019d done. He protected me. Pretended it was my decision not to carry things on. He was a gentleman.</p><p>In fact \u2014 he was a gentleman all evening, wasn\u2019t he? He was kind to me, and charming, and polite. And all I did, all throughout the date, was tell him lies.</p><p>Suddenly I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cI just think it\u2019s such a shame,\u201d says Suze. \u201cI mean, I know it\u2019s up to you and everything \u2014 but he\u2019s such a sweet guy. And he\u2019s had a crush on you for ages! You two would go perfectly together.\u201d She gives me a wheedling look. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any chance you might go out with him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . I honestly don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say in a scratchy voice. \u201cSuze. . I\u2019m a bit tired. I think I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>And without meeting her eye, I get up and slowly walk down the corridor to my room.</p><p>BANK OF LONDON</p><p>London House, Mill Street, EC3R 4DW</p> <p>Ms. Rebecca Boomwood</p><p>Flat 24 Burney Rd.London SW6 8FD</p><p>23 March 2000</p><p>Dear Ms. Boomwood: Thank you very much for your application for a Bank of London Easifone Loan.Unfortunately, \u201cbuying clothes and makeup\u201d was not deemed a suitable purpose for such a substantial unsecured loan, and your application has been turned down by our credit team.</p><p>Thank you very much for considering Bank of London.Yours sincerely,Margaret Hopkins Loans Adviser</p><p>ENDWICH BANK</p><p>FULHAM BRANCH 3 Fulham Road</p><p>London SW6 9JH</p><p>Ms. Rebecca BloomwoodFlat 24 Burney Rd.London SW6 8FD</p><p>23 March 2000</p><p>Dear Ms. Bloomwood: I am writing to confirm our meeting at 9:30 a.m. on Monday 26 March, here at our Fulham office.

Exploding sparks of pain as I try to move my head; as I try to open my eyes; as I try to work out a few basics like: Who am I? What day is it? Where should I be right now?</p><p>For a while I lie quite still, panting with the exertion of just being alive. In fact, my face is growing scarlet and I\u2019m almost starting to hyperventilate, so I force myself to slow down and breathe regularly. In. . out, in. . out.

I had pizza. And who was I with, again? In. . out, in. .</p><p>Tarquin.</p> <p>Out.</p><p>Oh God. Tarquin.</p><p>Leafing through checkbook. Everything ruined. All my own fault.</p><p>A familiar wave of despair floods over me and I close my eyes, trying to calm my throbbing head. At the same time, I remember that last night, when I went back to my room, I found the half bottle of malt whisky which Scottish Prudential once gave me, still sitting on my dressing table. I opened it up \u2014 even though I don\u2019t like whisky \u2014 and drank. . well, certainly a few cupfuls. Which might possibly explain why I\u2019m feeling so ill now.</p><p>Slowly I struggle to a sitting position and listen for sounds of Suze, but I can\u2019t hear anything. The flat\u2019s empty. It\u2019s just me.</p> <p>Me and my thoughts.</p><p>Which, to be honest, I can\u2019t endure. My head\u2019s pounding and I feel pale and shaky \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to get moving; distract myself. I\u2019ll go out, have a cup of coffee somewhere quiet and try to get myself together.</p><p>I manage to get out of bed, stagger to my chest of drawers, and stare at myself in the mirror. I don\u2019t like what I see. My skin\u2019s green, my mouth is dry, and my hair\u2019s sticking to my skin in clumps. But worst of all is the expression in my eyes: a blank, miserable self-loathing. Last night I was given a chance \u2014 a fantastic opportunity on a silver platter. I threw it in the bin \u2014 and hurt a really sweet, decent chap, to boot. God, I\u2019m a disaster. I don\u2019t deserve to live.</p><p>I head to King\u2019s Road, to lose myself in the anonymous bustle. The air\u2019s crisp and fresh, and as I stride along it\u2019s almost possible to forget about last night. Almost, but not quite.</p><p>I go into Aroma, order a large cappuccino, and try to drink it normally. As if everything\u2019s fine and I\u2019m just another girl out on a Sunday for some shopping. But I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t escape my thoughts. They\u2019re churning round in my head, like a record that won\u2019t stop, over and over and over.</p><p>If only I hadn\u2019t picked up his checkbook. If only I hadn\u2019t been so stupid. It was all going so well. He really liked me. We were holding hands. He was planning to ask me out again. If only I could go back; if only I could play the evening again. .</p> <p>Don\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t think about what could have been. It\u2019s too unbearable. If I\u2019d played it right, I\u2019d probably be sitting here drinking coffee with Tarquin, wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019d probably be well on my way to becoming the fifteenth richest woman in the country.</p><p>Instead of which, I have unpaid bills stacked up in my dressing table drawer. I have a meeting with my bank manager on Monday morning. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do. No idea at all.</p><p>Miserably I take a sip of coffee and unwrap my little chocolate. I\u2019m not in the mood for chocolate, but I stuff it into my mouth anyway.</p><p>The worst thing \u2014 the very worst thing of all \u2014 is that I was actually starting to quite like Tarquin. Maybe he isn\u2019t God\u2019s gift in the looks department, but he\u2019s very kind, and quite funny, in his own way. And that brooch \u2014 it\u2019s really quite sweet.</p><p>And the way he didn\u2019t tell Suze what he\u2019d seen me doing. And the way he believed me when I told him I liked dogs and Wagner and bloody violinists in Mozambique. The way he was so completely, utterly unsuspicious.</p><p>Now I really am going to start crying.</p><p>Roughly I brush at my eyes, drain my cup, and stand up. Out on the street I hesitate, then begin walking briskly again. Maybe the breeze will blow these unbearable thoughts out of my head.</p><p>But I stride and stride, and I still feel no better. My head\u2019s aching and my eyes are red and I could really do with a drink or something. Just a little something, to make me feel a bit better. A drink, or a cigarette, or. .</p> <p>I look up, and I\u2019m in front of Octagon. My favorite shop in the whole world. Three floors of clothes, accessories, furnishings, gifts, coffee shops, juice bars, and a florist which makes you want to buy enough bouquets to fill your house.</p><p>I\u2019ve got my purse with me.</p><p>Just something small, to cheer me up. A T-shirt or something. Or even some bubble bath. I need to buy myself something. I won\u2019t spend much. I\u2019ll just go in, and. .</p><p>I\u2019m already pushing my way through the doors. Oh God, the relief. The warmth, the light. This is where I belong. This is my natural habitat.</p><p>Except that even as I\u2019m heading toward the T-shirts, I\u2019m not quite as happy as I should be. I look through the racks, trying to summon the excitement I usually feel at buying myself a little treat \u2014 but somehow today I feel a bit empty. Still, I choose a cropped top with a silver star in the middle and put it over my arm, telling myself I feel better already. Then I spot a rack of dressing gowns. I could do with a new dressing gown, as a matter of fact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I finger a lovely white waffle robe, I can hear a little voice at the back of my head, like a radio turned down low. Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re in debt. Don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re in debt.</p><p>But quite frankly, what does it matter now? It\u2019s too late to make any difference. I\u2019m already in debt; I might as well be more in debt. Almost savagely, I pull the dressing gown down from the rack and put it over my arm. Then I reach for the matching waffle slippers. No point buying one without the other.</p><p>The checkout point is directly to my left, but I ignore it. I\u2019m not done yet. I head for the escalators and go up to the home-furnishing floor. Time for a new duvet set. White, to match my new dressing gown. And a pair of bolster cushions.</p><p>Every time I add something to my pile, I feel a little whoosh of pleasure, like a firework going off. And for a moment, everything\u2019s all right. But then, gradually, the light and sparkles disappear, and I\u2019m left with cold dark blackness again. So I look feverishly around for something else. A huge scented candle. A bottle of Jo Malone shower gel. A bag of handmade potpourri. As I add each one, I feel a whoosh \u2014 and then blackness. But the whooshes are getting shorter and shorter each time. Why won\u2019t the pleasure stay? Why don\u2019t I feel happier?</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d says a voice, interrupting my thoughts. A young assistant, dressed in the Octagon outfit of white shirt and linen trousers, has come up and is looking at my pile of stuff on the floor. \u201cWould you like me to hold some of these while you continue shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say blankly, and look down at the stuff I\u2019ve accumulated. It\u2019s actually quite a lot by now. \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll just. . I\u2019ll just pay for this lot.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, between us, we manage to lug all my shopping across the beechwood floor to the stylish granite checkout point in the middle, and the assistant begins to scan everything through. The bolster cushions have been reduced, which I hadn\u2019t realized, and while she\u2019s checking the exact price, a queue begins to form behind me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be \u00a3370.56,\u201d she says eventually, and smiles at me. \u201cHow would you like to pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm. . debit card,\u201d I say, and reach for my purse. As she\u2019s swiping it, I eye up my carrier bags and wonder how I\u2019m going to get all this stuff home.</p> <p>But immediately my thoughts bounce away. I don\u2019t want to think about home. I don\u2019t want to think about Suze, or Tarquin, or last night. Or any of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says the girl apologetically, \u201cbut there\u2019s something wrong with your card. It won\u2019t authorize the purchase.\u201d She hands it back to me. \u201cDo you have anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, slightly flustered. \u201cWell. . here\u2019s my VISA card.\u201d</p><p>How embarrassing. And anyway, what\u2019s wrong with my card? It looks all right to me. I must call the bank about this.</p><p>The bank. Meeting tomorrow, with Derek Smeath. Oh God. Quick, think about something else. Look at the floor. Glance about the shop. There\u2019s quite a big line of people now, and I can hear coughing and clearing of throats. Everyone\u2019s waiting for me. As I meet the eye of the woman behind me, I smile awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the girl. \u201cThis one\u2019s no good either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whip round in shock. How can my VISA card be no good? It\u2019s my VISA card, for God\u2019s sake. Accepted all over the world. What\u2019s going on? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. It doesn\u2019t make any. .</p><p>My words stop midstream, and a nasty chill feeling begins to creep over me. All those letters. Those letters I\u2019ve been putting in my dressing table drawer. Surely they can\u2019t have. .</p><p>No. They can\u2019t have done.</p><p>My heart starts to thump in panic. I know I haven\u2019t been that great at paying my bills \u2014 but I need my VISA card. I need it. They can\u2019t just cancel it, just like that.</p><p>\u201cThere are other people waiting,\u201d says the girl, gesturing to the queue. \u201cSo if you aren\u2019t able to pay. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m able to pay,\u201d I say stiffly. With trembling hands I scrabble in my purse and eventually produce my silver Octagon charge card. It was buried under all the others, so I can\u2019t have used it for a while. \u201cHere,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll put it all on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d says the girl curtly, and swipes the card.</p><p>It\u2019s only as we\u2019re waiting silently for the authorization that I begin to wonder whether I\u2019ve actually paid off my Octagon account. They sent me a nasty letter a while ago, didn\u2019t they? Something about an outstanding balance. But I\u2019m sure I paid it off, ages ago. Or at least some of it. Didn\u2019t I? I\u2019m sure I. .</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to have to make a quick call,\u201d says the assistant, staring at her machine. She reaches for the phone next to the till.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, if I can give you an account number. .\u201d</p><p>Behind me, somebody sighs loudly. I can feel my face growing hotter and hotter. I don\u2019t dare look round. I don\u2019t dare move.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says the assistant eventually, and puts down the phone. She looks up \u2014 and at the sight of her face, my stomach gives a lurch. Her expression isn\u2019t apologetic or polite anymore. It\u2019s plain unfriendly.</p> <p>\u201cOur financial services department would like you to contact them urgently,\u201d she says curtly. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to sound relaxed. As though this is a fairly normal request. \u201cOK. Well, I\u2019ll do that. Thanks.\u201d I hold my hand out for my charge card. I\u2019m not interested in my shopping anymore. All I want to do is get out of here as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m afraid your account\u2019s been frozen,\u201d says the assistant without lowering her voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to retain your card.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in disbelief, feeling my face prickling with shock. Behind me there\u2019s an interested rustle as everybody hears this and starts nudging each other.</p><p>\u201cSo, unless you have another means of paying. .\u201d she adds, looking at my heap of stuff on the counter. My waffle robe. My new duvet set. My scented candle. A huge, conspicuous pile of stuff. Stuff I don\u2019t need. Stuff I can\u2019t pay for. Suddenly the sight of it all makes me feel sick.</p> <p>Numbly I shake my head. I feel as if I\u2019ve been caught stealing.</p><p>\u201cElsa,\u201d calls the assistant. \u201cWill you deal with this, please? The customer isn\u2019t going to make the purchase after all.\u201d She gestures to the pile of stuff, and the other assistant moves it along the counter, out of the way, her face deliberately blank.</p><p>\u201cNext, please.\u201d</p><p>The woman behind me steps forward, avoiding my eye in embarrassment, and slowly I turn away. I have never felt so humiliated in all my life. The whole floor seems to be looking at me \u2014 all the customers, all the sales assistants, all whispering and nudging. Did you see? Did you see what happened?</p><p>With wobbling legs I walk away, not looking right or left. This is a nightmare. I just have to get out, as quickly as possible. I have to get out of the shop and onto the street and go. .</p><p>Go where? Home, I suppose.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t go back and face Suze. She\u2019s been so kind to me and how have I behaved? She has no idea what a horrible person I am. If I go home, I\u2019ll have to hear her telling me again how sweet Tarquin is. Or even worse, risk bumping into him. Oh God. The very thought makes me feel sick.</p><p>What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?</p><p>Shakily I begin to walk along the pavement, looking away from the mocking window displays. What can I do? Where can I go? I feel empty, almost light-headed with panic.</p><p>I pause at a corner, waiting for a traffic light to change, and look blankly at a display of cashmere jumpers to my left. And suddenly, at the sight of a scarlet Pringle golfing jumper, I feel tears of relief springing to my eyes. There\u2019s one place I can go. One place I can always go.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>WHEN I TURN UP at my parents\u2019 house that afternoon without warning, saying I want to stay for a few days, I can\u2019t say they seem shocked.</p><p>In fact, so unsurprised do they seem that I begin to wonder if they\u2019ve been expecting this eventuality all along, ever since I moved to London. Have they been waiting every week for me to arrive on the doorsteps with no luggage and red eyes? They\u2019re certainly behaving as calmly as a hospital casualty team operating an emergency procedure.</p><p>Except that surely the casualty team wouldn\u2019t keep arguing about the best way to resuscitate the patient? After a few minutes, I feel like going outside, letting them decide on their plan of action, and ringing the bell again.</p> <p>\u201cYou go upstairs and have a nice hot bath,\u201d says Mum, as soon as I\u2019ve put down my handbag. \u201cI expect you\u2019re exhausted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to have a bath if she doesn\u2019t want to!\u201d retorts Dad. \u201cShe might want a drink!

My mum would never have said that before she started watching Ricki Lake.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s sit you down with a nice cup of tea.\u201d</p> <p>And so I follow her into the kitchen, and we all sit down with a cup of tea. And I have to say, it is very nice. Hot strong tea and a chocolate bourbon biscuit. Perfect. I close my eyes and take a few sips, and then open them again, to see both my parents gazing at me with naked curiosity all over their faces. Immediately my mother changes her expression to a smile, and my father gives a little cough \u2014 but I can tell, they are gagging to know what\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say cautiously, and both their heads jerk up. \u201cYou\u2019re both well, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d says my mother. \u201cYes, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d says my father gravely, and both Mum and I swivel to face him. \u201cAre you in some kind of trouble we should know about? Only tell us if you want to,\u201d he adds hastily. \u201cAnd I want you to know \u2014 we\u2019re there for you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s another bloody Ricki Lake \u2014 ism, too. My parents should really get out more.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right, darling?\u201d says Mum gently \u2014 and she sounds so kind and understanding that, in spite of myself, I find myself putting down my cup with a bit of a clatter and saying \u201cTo tell you the truth, I am in a spot of bother. I didn\u2019t want to worry you, so I haven\u2019t said anything before now. .\u201d I can feel tears gathering in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d says Mum in a panicky voice. \u201cYou\u2019re on drugs, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not on drugs!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI\u2019m just. . It\u2019s just that I. . I\u2019m. .\u201d I take a deep gulp of tea. This is even harder than I thought it would be. Come on, Rebecca, just say it.</p><p>I close my eyes and clench my hand tightly around my mug.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is. .\u201d I say slowly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d says Mum.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is. .\u201d I open my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m being stalked. By a man called. . called Derek Smeath.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence apart from a long hiss as my father sucks in breath.</p> <p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d says my mother in a sharp, brittle voice. \u201cI knew it! I knew there was something wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all knew there was something wrong!\u201d says my father, and rests his elbows heavily on the table. \u201cHow long has this been going on, Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ahm. . months now,\u201d I say, staring into my tea. \u201cIt\u2019s just. . pestering, really. It\u2019s not serious or anything. But I just couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this Derek Smeath?\u201d says Dad. \u201cDo we know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I came across him. . I came across him through work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did!\u201d says Mum. \u201cA young, pretty girl like you, with a high-profile career. . I knew this was going to happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he another journalist?\u201d says Dad, and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cHe works for Endwich Bank. He does things like. . like phone up and pretend he\u2019s in charge of my bank account. He\u2019s really convincing.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence while my parents digest this and I eat another chocolate bourbon.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Mum at last. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to phone the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim, spluttering crumbs all over the table. \u201cI don\u2019t want the police! He\u2019s never threatened me or anything. In fact, he\u2019s not really a stalker at all. He\u2019s just a pain. I thought if I disappeared for a while. .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Dad, and glances at Mum. \u201cWell, that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what I suggest,\u201d I say, meshing my hands tightly in my lap, \u201cis that if he rings, you say I\u2019ve gone abroad and you don\u2019t have a number for me. And. . if anyone else rings, say the same thing. Even Suze. I\u2019ve left her a message saying I\u2019m OK \u2014 but I don\u2019t want anyone to know where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d says Mum, wrinkling her brow. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to go to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cThat would only make him feel important.

And as I see the worry on his face, I hate myself for what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>But I simply can\u2019t tell my kind, loving parents that their so-called successful daughter with her so-called top job is in fact a disorganized, deceitful mess, up to her eyeballs in debt.</p><p>And so we have supper (Waitrose Cumberland Pie) and watch an Agatha Christie adaption together, and then I go upstairs to my old bedroom, put on an old nightie, and go to bed. And when I wake up the next morning, I feel more happy and rested than I have for weeks.</p><p>Above all, staring at my old bedroom ceiling, I feel safe. Cocooned from the world; wrapped up in cotton wool. No one can get me here. No one even knows I\u2019m here. I won\u2019t get any nasty letters and I won\u2019t get any nasty phone calls and I won\u2019t get any nasty visitors. It\u2019s like a sanctuary. I feel as if I\u2019m fifteen again, with nothing to worry about but my homework. (And I haven\u2019t even got any of that.)</p> <p>It\u2019s at least nine o\u2019clock before I rouse myself and get out of bed, and as I do so, it occurs to me that miles away in London, Derek Smeath is expecting me to arrive for a meeting in half an hour. A slight twinge passes through my stomach and for a moment I consider phoning up the bank and giving some excuse. But even as I\u2019m considering it, I know I\u2019m not going to do it. I don\u2019t even want to acknowledge the bank\u2019s existence. I want to forget all about it.</p><p>None of it exists anymore. Not the bank, not VISA, not Octagon. All eliminated from my life, just like that.</p><p>The only call I make is to the office, because I don\u2019t want them sacking me in my absence. I phone at nine-twenty \u2014 before Philip gets in \u2014 and get Mavis on reception.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mavis?\u201d I croak. \u201cIt\u2019s Rebecca Bloomwood here. Can you tell Philip I\u2019m ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing!\u201d says Mavis. \u201cIs it bronchitis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I croak. \u201cI\u2019ve got a doctor\u2019s appointment later. I must go. Bye.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s it. One phone call, and I\u2019m free. No one suspects anything \u2014 why should they? I feel light with relief. It\u2019s so easy to escape. I should have done this long ago.</p><p>At the back of my mind, like a nasty little gremlin, is the knowledge that I won\u2019t be able to stay here forever. That sooner or later things will start to catch up with me. But the point is \u2014 not yet. And in the meantime, I\u2019m not even going to think about it. I\u2019m just going to have a nice cup of tea and watch Morning Coffee and blank my mind out completely.</p><p>As I go into the kitchen, Dad\u2019s sitting at the table, reading the paper. There\u2019s the smell of toast in the air, and Radio Four in the background. Just like when I was younger and lived at home. Life was simple then. No bills, no demands, no threatening letters. An enormous wave of nostalgia overcomes me, and I turn away to fill the kettle, blinking slightly.</p><p>\u201cInteresting news,\u201d says Dad, jabbing at The Daily Telegraph.</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d I say, putting a tea bag in a mug. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScottish Prime has taken over Flagstaff Life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cRight. Yes, I think I\u2019d heard that was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the Flagstaff Life investors are going to receive huge windfall payments. The biggest ever, apparently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGosh,\u201d I say, trying to sound interested. I reach for a copy of Good Housekeeping, flick it open, and begin to read my horoscope.</p><p>But something\u2019s niggling at my mind. Flagstaff Life. Why does that sound familiar? Who was I talking to about. .</p><p>\u201cMartin and Janice next door!\u201d I exclaim suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re with Flagstaff Life! Have been for fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll do very well,\u201d says Dad. \u201cThe longer you\u2019ve been with them, the more you get, apparently.\u201d</p><p>He turns the page with a rustle, and I sit down at the table with my cup of tea and a Good Housekeeping article on making Easter cakes. It\u2019s not fair, I find myself thinking resentfully. Why can\u2019t I get a windfall payment? Why doesn\u2019t Endwich Bank get taken over? Then they could pay me a windfall big enough to wipe out my overdraft. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny plans for the day?\u201d says Dad, looking up.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say, and take a sip of tea.</p><p>Any plans for the rest of my life? Not really.</p><p>In the end, I spend a pleasant, unchallenging morning helping Mum sort out a pile of clothes for a jumble sale, and at twelve-thirty we go into the kitchen to make a sandwich. As I look at the clock, the fact that I was supposed to be at Endwich Bank three hours ago flickers through my mind \u2014 but very far off, like a distant clock chiming. My whole London life seems remote and unreal now. This is where I belong. Away from the madding crowd; at home with Mum and Dad, having a nice relaxed uncomplicated time.</p> <p>After lunch I wander out into the garden with one of Mum\u2019s mail-order catalogues, and go and sit on the bench by the apple tree. A moment later, I hear a voice from over the garden fence, and look up. It\u2019s Martin from next door. Hmm. I\u2019m not feeling very well disposed toward Martin at the moment.</p><p>\u201cHello, Becky,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d I say shortly. And I don\u2019t fancy your son, I feel like adding.</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d says Janice, appearing beside Martin, holding a garden trowel. She gives me an awestricken look. \u201cWe heard about your. . stalker,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s criminal,\u201d says Martin fiercely. \u201cThese people should be locked up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything we can do,\u201d says Janice. \u201cAnything at all. You just let us know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d I say, softening. \u201cI just want to stay here for a while. Get away from it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWise girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was saying to Martin this morning,\u201d says Janice, \u201cyou should hire a bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful,\u201d says Martin. \u201cNot these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe price of fame,\u201d says Janice, sorrowfully shaking her head. \u201cThe price of fame.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d I say, trying to get off the subject of my stalker. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re both well,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI suppose.\u201d To my surprise there\u2019s a forced cheerfulness to his voice. He glances at Janice, who frowns and shakes her head slightly.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you must be pleased with the news,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cAbout Flagstaff Life.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWe would have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could have known,\u201d says Janice, giving a little shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things. Just the luck of the draw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d I say, puzzled. \u201cI thought you were getting some huge great windfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears. .\u201d Martin rubs his face. \u201cIt appears not in our case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut. . but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartin phoned them up this morning,\u201d says Janice. \u201cTo see how much we would be getting. They were saying in the papers that long-term investors would be getting thousands. But\u2014\u201d She glances at Martin.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I say, feeling a twinge of alarm.</p><p>\u201cApparently we\u2019re no longer eligible,\u201d says Martin awkwardly. \u201cSince we switched our investment. Our old fund would have qualified, but. .\u201d He coughs. \u201cI mean, we will get something \u2014 but it\u2019ll only be about \u00a3100.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cBut you only switched\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the irony. If we\u2019d just held on a little bit longer. . Still, what\u2019s done is done. No point whining about it.\u201d He gives a resigned shrug and smiles at Janice, who smiles back.</p><p>And I look away and bite my lip.</p><p>A nasty cold feeling is creeping over me. They took the decision to switch their money based on my advice, didn\u2019t they? They asked me if they should switch funds, and I said go ahead. But now I come to think of it. . hadn\u2019t I already heard a rumor about this takeover? Oh God. Could I have stopped this?</p><p>\u201cWe could never have known these windfalls would happen,\u201d says Janice, and puts her hand comfortingly on his arm. \u201cThey keep these things secret right up until the last minute, don\u2019t they, Becky?\u201d</p><p>My throat\u2019s too tight to answer. I can remember exactly now. It was Alicia who first mentioned the takeover. The day before I came down here. And then Philip said something about it in the office. Something about with-profits holders doing well. Except. . I wasn\u2019t really listening. I think I was doing my nails at the time.</p><p>\u201cTwenty thousand pounds, they reckon we would have got if we\u2019d stayed,\u201d says Martin gloomily. \u201cMakes you sick to think about it. Still, Janice is right. We couldn\u2019t have known. Nobody knew.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh God.

I should have said something when you asked me. I should have warned you to wait. But I just. . didn\u2019t think.

I don\u2019t deserve these people\u2019s kindness. I\u2019ve just lost them \u00a320,000, through being too bloody lazy to keep up with events I\u2019m supposed to know about. I\u2019m a financial journalist, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>And suddenly, standing there in my parents\u2019 garden on a Monday afternoon, I\u2019m plunged to the lowest ebb of my life. What have I got going for me? Nothing. Not one thing. I can\u2019t control my money, I can\u2019t do my job, and I haven\u2019t got a boyfriend. I\u2019ve hurt my best friend, I\u2019ve lied to my parents \u2014 and now I\u2019ve ruined my neighbors.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s voice interrupts us all, and I look up in surprise. He\u2019s striding across the lawn toward us, a perturbed look on his face.</p><p>\u201cBecky, don\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ve just had that Derek Smeath chap on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, feeling my face drain in horror.</p><p>\u201cThe stalker?\u201d exclaims Janice, and Dad gives a sober nod.</p><p>\u201cQuite an unpleasant fellow, I would say. He was really quite aggressive toward me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how does he know Becky\u2019s here?\u201d says Janice.</p><p>\u201cObviously just taking potluck,\u201d says Dad. \u201cI was very civil, simply told him you weren\u2019t here and that I had no idea where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd. . and what did he say?\u201d I say in a strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cCame out with some nonsense about a meeting you\u2019d set up with him.\u201d Dad shakes his head. \u201cThe chap\u2019s obviously deluded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should change your number,\u201d advises Martin. \u201cGo ex-directory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut where was he phoning from?\u201d says Janice, her voice rising in alarm. \u201cHe could be anywhere!\u201d She starts looking agitatedly around the garden as though expecting him to jump out from behind a bush.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d says Dad. \u201cSo, Becky, I think maybe you should come inside now. You never know with these characters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say numbly. I can\u2019t quite believe this is happening. I look at Dad\u2019s kind, concerned face and suddenly I can barely meet his eye. Oh, why didn\u2019t I tell him and Mum the truth? Why did I let myself get into this situation?</p><p>\u201cYou look quite shaken up, dear,\u201d says Janice, and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cYou go and have a nice sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, I think I will.\u201d</p><p>And Dad leads me off gently toward the house, as though I were some kind of invalid.</p><p>This is all getting out of hand. Now not only do I feel like an utter failure, I don\u2019t feel safe anymore, either. I feel exposed and edgy. I sit on the sofa next to Mum, drinking tea and watching Countdown, and every time there\u2019s a sound outside, I jump.</p><p>What if Derek Smeath\u2019s on his way here? How long would it take him to drive here from London? An hour and a half? Two, if the traffic\u2019s bad?</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t do that.

And I gaze back at her, full of a choking panic. My VISA card doesn\u2019t work. My debit card doesn\u2019t work. Nothing works. And she has no idea.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it. Don\u2019t think about it. I grab for an ancient copy of the Radio Times on the coffee table and begin to leaf through it blindly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame about poor Martin and Janice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Mum, looking up. \u201cFancy switching funds two weeks before the takeover! Such bad luck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I mumble, staring down at a page of listings. I don\u2019t want to be reminded about Martin and Janice.</p><p>\u201cIt seems a terrible coincidence,\u201d says Mum, shaking her head. \u201cThat the company should launch this new fund just before the takeover. You know, there must be a lot of people who did exactly what Martin and Janice did, who have lost out. Dreadful, really.\u201d She looks at the television. \u201cOh look, it\u2019s starting again.\u201d</p><p>The cheery Countdown music begins to play, and a round of applause rattles noisily from the television. But I\u2019m not listening to it, or even paying any attention to the vowels and consonants. I\u2019m thinking about what Mum has just said. A terrible coincidence \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t exactly a coincidence, was it? The bank actually wrote to Janice and Martin, suggesting that they switch funds. They even offered an incentive, didn\u2019t they? A carriage clock.</p> <p>Suddenly I feel alert. I want to see the letter from Flagstaff Life \u2014 and find out exactly how long before the takeover they sent it.</p><p>\u201c \u2018ending,\u2019 \u201d says Mum, staring at the screen. \u201cThat\u2019s six.

Would you like a sherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, a little taken aback. I mean, not that I\u2019m against drinking, obviously \u2014 but it isn\u2019t even five o\u2019clock yet. \u201cWell \u2014 OK then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever too early for a sherry!\u201d says Martin.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have another one, thanks, Martin,\u201d comes Janice\u2019s voice from the sitting room.</p><p>Blow me down. They\u2019re a pair of alcoholics!</p><p>Oh God, perhaps this is my fault too. Perhaps their financial mishap has driven them to seek solace in alcohol and daytime television.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering,\u201d I say nervously as Martin pours dark brown sherry into a schooner. \u201cJust out of interest, could I have a look at that letter you got from Flagstaff Life, asking you to switch funds? I was wondering when they sent it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt arrived the very day we saw you,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWhy do you want to see it?\u201d He raises his glass. \u201cYour good health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d I say, and take a sip. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome into the living room,\u201d he interrupts, and ushers me through from the hall. \u201cHere you are, my love,\u201d he adds, and gives Janice her sherry. \u201cBottoms up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s the numbers game! I need to concentrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I might do a little investigation into this,\u201d I whisper to Martin as the Countdown clock ticks round. \u201cI feel so bad about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty times 4 is 200,\u201d says Janice suddenly. \u201cSix minus 3 is 3, times 7 is 21 and add it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, love!\u201d says Martin, and roots about in a carved oak sideboard. \u201cHere\u2019s the letter,\u201d he says. \u201cSo \u2014 do you want to write an article or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d I say. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind, would you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMind?\u201d He gives a little shrug. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh!\u201d says Janice. \u201cIt\u2019s the Countdown Conundrum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just. .

How many investors must have switched funds after receiving this crappy carriage clock offer \u2014 and missed out on their windfall? More to the point, how much money must Flagstaff Life have saved? Suddenly I really want to know. There\u2019s a growing indignation in me; a growing determination to find out exactly what\u2019s been going on and, if it\u2019s what I suspect, to expose it. To print the truth and warn others. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m actually interested in a financial story.</p><p>And I don\u2019t just want to write it up for Successful Saving, either. This deserves the widest audience possible. Eric Foreman\u2019s card is still in my purse, with his direct telephone number printed at the top, and I take it out. I go to the phone and quickly punch in the number before I can change my mind.</p><p>\u201cEric Foreman, Daily World,\u201d comes his voice, booming down the line.</p><p>Am I really doing this?</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember me. Rebecca Bloomwood from Successful Saving. We met at the Sacrum Asset Management press conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, so we did,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cHow are you, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, and clench my hand tightly around the receiver. \u201cAbsolutely fine. Ahm. . I was just wondering, are you still running your series on \u2018Can We Trust the Money Men?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are, as it goes,\u201d says Eric Foreman. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just. .\u201d I swallow. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a story that might interest you.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p> <p>I HAVE NEVER BEFORE worked so hard on an article. Never.</p><p>Mind you, I\u2019ve never before been asked to write one so quickly. At Successful Saving, we get a whole month to write our articles \u2014 and we complain about that. When Eric Foreman said, \u201cCan you do it by tomorrow?\u201d I thought he was joking at first. I jauntily replied, \u201cOf course!\u201d and nearly added, \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll have it with you in five minutes\u2019 time!\u201d Then, just in time, I realized he was serious. Crikey.</p><p>So I\u2019m round at Martin and Janice\u2019s first thing the next morning with a Dictaphone, writing down exactly all the information on their investment and trying to get in lots of heart-wrenching details as advised by Eric.</p><p>\u201cWe need human interest,\u201d he told me over the phone. \u201cNone of your dull financial reporting here. Make us feel sorry for them. Make us weep. A hardworking, ordinary couple, who thought they could rely on a few savings to see them through their old age. Ripped off by the fat cats. What kind of house do these people live in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhmm. . a four-bedroom detached house in Surrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for Christ\u2019s sake don\u2019t put that in!\u201d he boomed. \u201cI want honest, poor, and proud. Never demanded a penny off the state, saved to provide for themselves. Trusted a respectable financial institution. And all it did was kick them in the face.\u201d He paused, and it sounded as if he might be picking his teeth. \u201cThat kind of thing. Think you can manage it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . ahm. . yes! Of course!\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>Oh God, I thought as I put down the phone. What have I got myself into?</p> <p>But it\u2019s too late to change my mind now. So the next thing is to persuade Janice and Martin that they don\u2019t mind appearing in The Daily World. The trouble is, it\u2019s not exactly The Financial Times, is it? Or even the normal Times. (Still, it could be a lot worse. It could be The Sun \u2014 and they\u2019d end up sandwiched between a topless model and a blurred paparazzi shot of Posh Spice.)</p><p>Luckily, however, they\u2019re so bowled over that I\u2019m making all this effort on their behalf, they don\u2019t seem to care which newspaper I\u2019m writing for. And when they hear that a photographer\u2019s coming over at midday to take their picture, you\u2019d think the queen was coming to visit.</p><p>\u201cMy hair!\u201d says Janice in dismay, staring into the mirror. \u201cHave I time to get Maureen in to give me a blow-dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. And it looks lovely,\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cAnyway, they want you as natural as possible. Just. . honest, ordinary people.\u201d I glance around the living room, trying to pick up poignant details to put into my article. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An anniversary card from their son stands proudly on the well-polished mantelpiece.

Anything like that.

Not. . unwell, or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit nervous, to be honest, dear,\u201d she says, looking round from the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m never very good at having my picture taken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy nerves are shot to pieces,\u201d said Mrs. Webster in a ragged voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so betrayed in all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve got enough now,\u201d I say, getting up and switching off my Dictaphone. \u201cI might have to slightly digress from what\u2019s on the tape \u2014 just to make the story work. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d says Janice. \u201cYou write what you like, Becky! We trust you.\u201d</p><p>I look at her soft, friendly face and feel a sudden shot of determination. This time I\u2019ll get it right.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d says Martin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to go and talk to Flagstaff Life,\u201d I say. \u201cGet them to give their defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat defense?\u201d says Martin. \u201cThere is no defense for what they did to us!\u201d</p><p>I grin at him. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m full of happy adrenaline. All I need to do is get a quote from Flagstaff Life, and I can start writing the piece. I haven\u2019t got long: it needs to be finished by two o\u2019clock if it\u2019s going to make tomorrow\u2019s edition. Why has work never seemed so exciting before?</p><p>Briskly I reach for the phone and dial Flagstaff\u2019s number \u2014 only to be told by the switchboard operator that all press inquiries are dealt with out of house. She gives me a number, which seems rather familiar, and I frown at it for a moment, then punch it in.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says a smooth voice. \u201cBrandon Communications.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Suddenly I feel a bit shaky. The word Brandon has hit me right in the stomach like a punch. I\u2019d forgotten all about Luke Brandon. To be honest, I\u2019d forgotten all about the rest of my life. And frankly, I don\u2019t want to be reminded of it.</p><p>But it\u2019s OK \u2014 I don\u2019t have to speak to him personally, do I?</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s Rebecca Bloomwood here. Ermm. . I just wanted to talk to somebody about Flagstaff Life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check. .\u201d says the voice. \u201cYes, that\u2019s Luke Brandon\u2019s client. I\u2019ll just put you through to his assistant. .\u201d And the voice disappears before I can say anything.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t speak to Luke Brandon. My questions are jotted down on a piece of paper in front of me, but as I stare at them, I\u2019m not reading them. I\u2019m remembering the humiliation I felt that day in Harvey Nichols. That horrible plunge in my stomach, as I heard the patronizing note in his voice and suddenly realized what he thought of me. A nothing. A joke.</p><p>OK, I can do this, I tell myself firmly. I\u2019ll just be very stern and businesslike and ask my questions, and. .</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d comes a voice in my ear. \u201cHow are you!

I\u2019ve never minded before \u2014 I\u2019ve rather enjoyed hanging on to a phone, listening to \u201cGreensleeves.\u201d I\u2019ve never cared before whether people took me seriously or not.</p><p>But today I do care.

It\u2019s pathetic, I know, but I\u2019m as excited as a little kid on Christmas Day (or as me on Christmas Day, to be perfectly honest).</p><p>I lie in bed, telling myself to be grown-up and laid-back and not think about it \u2014 but I just can\u2019t resist it. My mind swims with images of the piles of newspapers in newsstands all over the country. Of the copies of The Daily World being dropped on people\u2019s doormats this morning; all the people who are going to be opening their papers, yawning, wondering what\u2019s in the news.</p><p>And what are they going to see?</p><p>They\u2019re going to see my name! Rebecca Bloomwood in print in The Daily World! My first national byline: \u201cBy Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d Doesn\u2019t that sound cool? \u201cBy Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>I know the piece has gone in, because Eric Foreman phoned me up yesterday afternoon and told me the editor was really pleased with it. And they\u2019ve got it on a color page \u2014 so the picture of Janice and Martin will be in full color. Really high profile. I can\u2019t quite believe it. The Daily World!</p><p>Even as I\u2019m lying here, it occurs to me, there\u2019s already a whole pile of Daily Worlds at the newsstand in the parade of shops round the corner. A whole pile of pristine, unopened copies. And the newsstand opens at. . what time? Six, I seem to remember. And now it\u2019s five past six. So in theory, I could go and buy one right now if I wanted to. I could just get up, slip on some clothes, go down to the newsstand, and buy one.</p><p>Not that I would, of course. I\u2019m not quite so sad and desperate that I\u2019m going to rush down as soon as the shop\u2019s opened, just to see my name. I mean, what do you take me for? No, what I\u2019ll do is just saunter down casually later on \u2014 perhaps at eleven or midday \u2014 pick up the paper and flip through it in mild interest and then saunter home again. I probably won\u2019t even bother to buy a copy. I mean \u2014 I\u2019ve seen my name in print before. It\u2019s hardly a big deal. No need to make a song and dance about it.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to turn over now and go back to sleep. I can\u2019t think why I\u2019m awake so early. Must be the birds or something. Hmm. . close my eyes, plump up my pillow, think about something else. . I wonder what I\u2019ll have for breakfast when I get up? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I\u2019ve never seen my name in The Daily World, says a little voice in my head. I\u2019ve never seen it in a national newspaper.</p><p>This is killing me. I can\u2019t wait any longer, I\u2019ve got to see it.</p><p>Abruptly I get out of bed, throw on my clothes, and tiptoe down the stairs. As I close the door, I feel just like the girl in that Beatles song about leaving home. Outside the air has a sweet, new-day smell, and the road is completely quiet. Gosh, it\u2019s nice being up early. Why on earth don\u2019t I get up at six more often? I should do this every day. A power walk before breakfast, like people do in New York. Burn off loads of calories and then return home to an energizing breakfast of oats and freshly squeezed orange juice. Perfect. This will be my new regime.</p><p>But as I reach the little parade of shops I feel a stab of nerves, and without quite meaning to, I slow my walk to a funereal pace. Maybe I\u2019ll just buy myself a Mars Bar and go home again. Or a Mint Aero, if they\u2019ve got them.</p> <p>Cautiously, I push at the door and wince at the ping! as it opens. I really don\u2019t want to draw attention to myself this morning. What if the guy behind the counter has read my article and thinks it\u2019s rubbish? This is nerve-racking. I should never have become a journalist. I should have become a beautician, like I always wanted to. Maybe it\u2019s not too late. I\u2019ll retrain, open my own boutique. .</p><p>\u201cHello, Becky!\u201d</p><p>I look up and feel my face jerk in surprise. Martin Webster\u2019s standing at the counter, holding a copy of The Daily World. \u201cI just happened to be awake,\u201d he explains sheepishly. \u201cThought I\u2019d just come down, have a little look. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cErm. . me too.\u201d I give a nonchalant shrug. \u201cSince I was awake anyway. .\u201d</p><p>My eye falls on the newspaper and I feel my stomach flip over. I\u2019m going to expire with nerves. Please, just kill me quickly.</p> <p>\u201cSo \u2014 what. . what\u2019s it like?\u201d I say in a strangled voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Martin, gazing at the page as though perplexed. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly big.\u201d He turns the paper round to face me, and I nearly keel over. There, in full color, is a picture of Martin and Janice staring miserably up at the camera, below the headline couple cheated by fat cats at flagstaff life.</p><p>Shaking slightly, I take the paper from Martin. My eye skips across the page to the first column of text. . and there it is! \u201cBy Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d That\u2019s my name! That\u2019s me!</p><p>There\u2019s a ping at the door of the shop, and we both look round. And there, to my utter astonishment, is Dad.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, and gives an embarrassed little cough. \u201cYour mother wanted me to buy a copy. And since I was awake anyway. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I,\u201d says Martin quickly.</p> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Dad. \u201cSo \u2014 is it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, \u201cit\u2019s in.\u201d I turn the paper round so he can see it.</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s big, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe photo\u2019s good, don\u2019t you think?\u201d says Martin enthusiastically. \u201cBrings out the flowers in our curtains beautifully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the photo\u2019s great,\u201d I agree.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to demean myself by asking what he thought of the article itself. If he wants to compliment my writing, he will. If he doesn\u2019t \u2014 then it really doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, I\u2019m proud of it.</p><p>\u201cAnd Janice looks very nice, I thought,\u201d says Martin, still gazing at the photograph.</p> <p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d agrees Dad. \u201cIf a little mournful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, these professionals, they know how to light a shot,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThe way the sunlight falls just here, on her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my article?\u201d I wail piteously. \u201cDid you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s very good!\u201d says Martin. \u201cSorry, Becky, I should have said! I haven\u2019t read it all yet, but it seems to capture the situation exactly. Makes me out to be quite a hero!\u201d He frowns. \u201cAlthough I never did fight in the Falklands, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wrote all this yesterday?\u201d says Dad. \u201cOn my typewriter?\u201d He seems astounded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say smugly. \u201cIt looks good, doesn\u2019t it? Have you seen my byline? \u2018By Rebecca Bloomwood.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice\u2019ll be thrilled,\u201d says Martin. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy two copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy three,\u201d says Dad. \u201cYour granny will love to see this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll buy one,\u201d I say. \u201cOr two, perhaps.\u201d I carelessly reach for a handful and plonk them on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSix copies?\u201d says the cashier. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need them for my records,\u201d I say, and blush slightly.</p><p>When we get home, Mum and Janice are both waiting at our front door, desperate to see a copy.</p> <p>\u201cMy hair!\u201d wails Janice as soon as she sees the picture. \u201cIt looks terrible!

There\u2019s a rather festive air to the proceedings, and everyone keeps laughing a lot. I don\u2019t think any of us can quite believe that Janice and Martin are in The Daily World. (And me, of course. \u201cBy Rebecca Bloomwood.\u201d)</p><p>At ten o\u2019clock, I slope off and ring up Eric Foreman. Just casually, you know. To let him know I\u2019ve seen it.</p><p>\u201cLooks good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cThe editor\u2019s really going for this series, so if you come up with any more stories like this just give me a shout. I like your style. Just right for The Daily World.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I say, feeling a glow of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, and while I\u2019m at it,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou\u2019d better give me your bank details.\u201d</p><p>My stomach gives a nasty lurch. Why does Eric Foreman want my bank details? Shit, is he going to check that my own finances are in order or something? Is he going to run a credit check on me?</p> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s done by transfer these days,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cFour hundred quid. That all right?\u201d</p><p>What? What\u2019s he\u2014</p><p>Oh my God, he\u2019s going to pay me. But of course he is. Of course he is!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I hear myself say. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll just, ahm. . give you my account number, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Four hundred quid! I think dazedly as I scrabble for my checkbook. Just like that! I can\u2019t quite believe it.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d says Eric Foreman, writing the details down. \u201cI\u2019ll sort that out for you with Accounts.\u201d Then he pauses. \u201cTell me, would you be in the market for writing general features? Human interest stories, that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>Would I be in the market? Is he kidding?</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, trying not to sound too thrilled. \u201cIn fact. . I\u2019d probably prefer it to finance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep an eye out for bits that might suit you. As I say, I think you\u2019ve got the right style for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>As I put the phone down, there\u2019s a huge smile on my face. I\u2019ve got the right style for The Daily World! Hah!</p><p>The phone rings again, and I pick it up, wondering if it\u2019s Eric Foreman offering me some more work already.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rebecca Bloomwood,\u201d I say in a businesslike voice.</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Luke Brandon\u2019s curt voice \u2014 and my heart freezes. \u201cCould you please tell me what the fuck is going on?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He sounds really angry. For an instant I\u2019m paralyzed. My throat feels dry; my hand is sweaty round the receiver. Oh God. What am I going to say? What am I going to say to him?</p><p>But hang on a minute. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I say, playing for time. Keep calm, I tell myself. Calm and cool.</p><p>\u201cYour tawdry effort in The Daily World,\u201d he says scathingly. \u201cYour one-sided, unbalanced, probably libelous little story.\u201d</p><p>For a second I\u2019m so shocked I can\u2019t speak. Tawdry? Libelous?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tawdry!\u201d I splutter at last. \u201cIt\u2019s a good piece. And it\u2019s certainly not libelous. I can prove everything I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose getting the other side of the story would have been inconvenient,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI suppose you were too busy writing your purple prose to approach Flagstaff Life and ask for their version of events.

She just assumed I couldn\u2019t possibly be doing anything important.\u201d In spite of myself, my voice is rising in emotion. \u201cWell, she was wrong, wasn\u2019t she? You were all wrong. And maybe now you\u2019ll start treating everybody with respect.

This is about two innocent people being hoodwinked by one of your big-shot clients, nothing else. I told the truth, and if you didn\u2019t have a chance to respond, it\u2019s your own company\u2019s incompetence that\u2019s to blame. I was completely professional, I gave you every opportunity to put out your side of the story. Every opportunity.

Rory and Emma read my article? Rory and Emma themselves? I have a sudden vision of them holding the paper together, jostling for a good view.</p><p>But of course, that\u2019s silly, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019d have a copy each.</p><p>\u201cSo, anyway, they want to have you on the show tomorrow morning,\u201d Eric Foreman\u2019s saying. \u201cTalk about this windfall story, warn their viewers to take care.

When the doorbell rings, Mum, Dad, and I all jump, even though we\u2019ve been waiting in a tense silence for ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Dad gruffly, glancing at his watch. \u201cThey\u2019re here, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ever since I told him about the arrangements, Dad\u2019s been predicting that the car won\u2019t turn up and that he\u2019ll have to drive me to the studios himself. He even worked out a route last night, and phoned up Uncle Malcolm as a standby. (To be honest, I think he was quite looking forward to it.)</p> <p>\u201cOh, Becky,\u201d says Mum in a trembling voice. \u201cGood luck, darling.\u201d She looks at me, then shakes her head. \u201cOur little Becky, on television. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>I start to get up, but Dad puts out a restraining arm.</p><p>\u201cNow, before you answer the door, Becky,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are sure, aren\u2019t you? About the risk you\u2019re taking.\u201d He glances at Mum, who bites her lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine!\u201d I say, trying to sound as soothing as possible. \u201cHonestly, Dad, we\u2019ve been over it all.\u201d</p><p>Last night, it suddenly occurred to Dad that if I went on the telly, my stalker would know where I was. At first he was adamant I\u2019d have to call the whole thing off \u2014 and it took an awful lot of persuasion to convince him and Mum I\u2019d be perfectly safe in the TV studios. They were even talking about hiring a bodyguard, can you believe it? I mean, what on earth would I look like, turning up with a bodyguard?</p> <p>Actually, I\u2019d look pretty cool and mysterious, wouldn\u2019t I? That might have been quite a good idea.</p><p>The doorbell rings again and I leap to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Dad. \u201cYou just be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, don\u2019t worry!\u201d I say, picking up my bag. I walk to the door calmly, trying not to give away how excited I feel. Inside I feel as light as a bubble.</p><p>I just can\u2019t believe how well everything\u2019s going. Not only am I going to be on the telly, but everyone\u2019s being so nice to me! Yesterday I had several phone conversations with an assistant producer of Morning Coffee, who\u2019s a really sweet girl called Zelda. We went over exactly what I was going to say on the program, then she arranged for a car to come and pick me up \u2014 and when I told her I was at my parents\u2019 house with none of my clothes handy, she thought for a bit \u2014 then said I could choose something to wear from the wardrobe. I mean, how cool is that? Choosing any outfit I like from the wardrobe! Maybe they\u2019ll let me keep it afterward, too.</p><p>As I open the front door, my stomach gives an excited leap. There, waiting in the drive, is a portly, middle-aged man in a blue blazer and cap, standing next to a shiny black car. My own private chauffeur! This just gets better and better.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Bloomwood?\u201d says the driver.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, unable to stop myself from grinning in delight. I\u2019m about to reach for the door handle \u2014 but he gets there before me, opens the car door with a flourish, and stands to attention, waiting for me to get in. God, this is like being a film star or something!</p><p>I glance back toward the house and see Mum and Dad standing on the front step, both looking utterly gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cWell \u2014 bye then!\u201d I say, trying to sound casual, as though I always ride around in a chauffeur-driven car. \u201cSee you later!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, is that you?\u201d comes a voice from next door, and Janice appears on the other side of the hedge in her dressing gown. Her eyes grow large as they take in the car and she glances at Mum, who raises her shoulders, as though to say \u201cI know, isn\u2019t it unbelievable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Janice,\u201d says Dad.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Graham,\u201d says Janice dazedly. \u201cOh, Becky! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. In all the years. . If Tom could only see you. .\u201d She breaks off and looks at Mum. \u201cHave you taken any photographs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t!\u201d says Mum in dismay. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even occur to us. Graham, quick \u2014 go and get the camera.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, wait, I\u2019ll get our camcorder!\u201d says Janice. \u201cIt won\u2019t take me two ticks. We could have the car arriving in the drive, and Becky walking out of the front door. . and maybe we could use The Four Seasons as the soundtrack, and then cut straight to. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say hastily, seeing a flicker of amusement pass across the face of the driver. And I was doing so well at looking nonchalant and professional. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time for any pictures. I have to get to the studios!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Janice, suddenly looking anxious. \u201cYes, you don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d She glances fearfully at her watch, as though afraid the program might already have started. \u201cIt\u2019s on at eleven, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEleven o\u2019clock the program starts,\u201d says Dad. \u201cSet the video for five to, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll do,\u201d says Janice. \u201cJust in case.\u201d She gives a little sigh. \u201cI shan\u2019t dare to go to the loo all morning, just in case I miss it!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awed silence as I get into the car. The driver closes the door smartly, then walks around to the driver\u2019s door. I press the button to lower my window and grin out at Mum and Dad.</p><p>\u201cBecky, darling, what will you do afterward?\u201d says Mum. \u201cCome back here or go back to the flat?\u201d</p> <p>Immediately I feel my smile falter, and look down, pretending to fiddle with the window controls. I don\u2019t want to think about afterward.</p><p>In fact, I can\u2019t even visualize afterward. I\u2019m going to be on the telly. . and that\u2019s as far as it goes. The rest of my life is shut securely away in a box at the back of my head and I don\u2019t even want to remember it\u2019s there.</p><p>\u201cI. . I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably take you out to lunch afterward,\u201d says Dad knowledgeably. \u201cThese showbiz types are always having lunch with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiquid lunches,\u201d puts in Janice, and gives a little laugh.</p> <p>\u201cAt The Ivy,\u201d says Mum. \u201cThat\u2019s where all the actors meet up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ivy\u2019s old hat!\u201d retorts Dad. \u201cThey\u2019ll take her to the Groucho Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Groucho Club!\u201d says Janice, clasping her hands. \u201cIsn\u2019t that where Kate Moss goes?\u201d</p><p>This is getting ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go,\u201d I say, and the driver nods.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, sweetheart,\u201d calls Dad. I close the window and lean back, and the car purrs out of the drive.</p> <p>For a while, we drive in silence. I keep casually glancing out of the window to see if anyone\u2019s looking at me in my chauffeur-driven car and wondering who I am (that new girl on EastEnders, perhaps). Although we\u2019re whizzing along the highway so fast, I probably look like a blur.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says the driver after a while. \u201cYou\u2019re appearing on Morning Coffee, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d I say, and immediately feel a joyful smile plaster itself over my face. God, I must stop this. I bet Jeremy Paxman doesn\u2019t start grinning inanely every time someone asks him if he\u2019s appearing on University Challenge.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019re you on for?\u201d says the driver, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>I\u2019m about to reply \u201cTo be famous and maybe get some free clothes,\u201d when I realize what he means.</p><p>\u201cA financial story,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cI wrote a piece in The Daily World, and the producers read it and wanted me on the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen on television before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admit reluctantly. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>We pull up at some lights and the driver turns round in his seat to survey me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t let the nerves get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNerves?\u201d I say, and give a little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous! I\u2019m just. . looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d says the driver, turning back. \u201cYou\u2019ll be OK, then. Some people, they get onto that sofa, thinking they\u2019re fine, relaxed, happy as a clam. . then they see that red light, and it hits them that 2.5 million people around the country are all watching them. Makes some people start to panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say after a slight pause. \u201cWell. . I\u2019m nothing like them! I\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d says the driver.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I echo, a little less certainly, and look out of the window.</p><p>I\u2019ll be fine. Of course I will. I\u2019ve never been nervous in my life before, and I\u2019m certainly not going to start. .</p><p>Two point five million people.</p><p>Gosh. When you think about it \u2014 that is quite a lot, isn\u2019t it? Two point five million people, all sitting at home, staring at the screen. Staring at my face. Waiting for what I\u2019m going to say next.</p><p>OK, don\u2019t think about it. The important thing is just to keep remembering how well prepared I am. I rehearsed for ages in front of the mirror last night and I know what I\u2019m going to say practically by heart.</p><p>It all has to be very basic and simple, Zelda said \u2014 because apparently 76 percent of the Morning Coffee audience are housewives looking after toddlers, who have very short attention spans. She kept apologizing for what she called the \u201cdumbing-down effect\u201d and saying a financial expert like myself must feel really frustrated by it \u2014 and of course, I agreed with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But to be honest, I\u2019m quite relieved. In fact, the more dumbed down the better, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I mean, writing a Daily World article with all my notes to hand was one thing, but answering tricky questions on live TV is quite another.</p><p>So anyway, I\u2019m going to start off by saying \u201cIf you were offered a choice between a carriage clock and \u00a320,000, which would you choose?\u201d Rory or Emma will reply, \u201cTwenty thousand pounds, of course!\u201d and I\u2019ll say, \u201cExactly. Twenty thousand pounds.\u201d I\u2019ll pause briefly, to let that figure sink into the audience\u2019s mind, and then I\u2019ll say, \u201cUnfortunately, when Flagstaff Life offered their customers a carriage clock to transfer their savings, they didn\u2019t tell them that if they did so, they would lose a \u00a320,000 windfall!\u201d</p><p>That sounds quite good, don\u2019t you think? Rory and Emma will ask a few very easy questions like \u201cWhat can people do to protect themselves?\u201d and I\u2019ll give nice simple answers. And right at the end, just to keep it light, we\u2019re going to talk about all the different things you could buy with \u00a320,000.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s the bit I\u2019m looking forward to most of all. I\u2019ve already thought of loads of things. Did you know, with \u00a320,000 you could buy forty Gucci watches, and have enough left over for a bag?</p> <p>The Morning Coffee studios are in Maida Vale, and as we draw near to the gates, familiar from the opening credits of the show, I feel a dart of excitement. I\u2019m actually going to be on television!</p><p>The doorman waves us through the barrier, we pull up outside a pair of huge double doors, and the driver opens the door for me. As I get out, my legs are shaking slightly, but I force myself to walk confidently up the steps, into the reception hall, and up to the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for Morning Coffee,\u201d I say, and give a little laugh as I realize what I\u2019ve just said. \u201cI mean. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d says the receptionist, kindly but wearily. She looks up my name on a list, jabs a number into her phone, and says, \u201cJane? Rebecca Bloomwood\u2019s here.\u201d Then she gestures to a row of squashy chairs and says, \u201cSomeone will be with you shortly.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to the seating area and sit down opposite a middle-aged woman with lots of wild dark hair and a big amber necklace round her neck. She\u2019s lighting up a cigarette, and even though I don\u2019t really smoke anymore, I suddenly feel as though I could do with one myself.</p> <p>Not that I\u2019m nervous or anything. I just fancy a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d calls the receptionist. \u201cThis is a no-smoking area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d says the woman in a raspy voice. She takes a long drag, then stubs the cigarette out on a saucer and smiles at me conspiratorially. \u201cAre you a guest on the show?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>The woman nods. \u201cPromoting my new novel, Blood Red Sunset.\u201d She lowers her voice to a thrilling throb. \u201cA searing tale of love, greed, and murder, set in the ruthless world of South American money launderers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d I say. \u201cThat sounds really\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me give you a copy,\u201d interrupts the woman. She reaches into a Mulberry holdall by her side and pulls out a vividly colored hardback book. \u201cRemind me of your name?\u201d</p><p>Remind her?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rebecca,\u201d I say. \u201cRebecca Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Becca,\u201d the woman says aloud, as she scrawls inside the front page. \u201cWith love and great affection.\u201d She signs with a flourish and hands the book to me.</p><p>\u201cThanks very much. .\u201d Quickly I look at the cover. \u201cElisabeth.\u201d</p><p>Elisabeth Plover. To be honest, I\u2019ve never heard of her.</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019re wondering how I came to know such a lot about such a violent, dangerous world,\u201d says Elisabeth. She leans forward and gazes at me with huge green eyes. \u201cThe truth is, I lived with a money launderer for three long months. I loved him; I learned from him. . and then I betrayed him.\u201d Her voice dies to a trembling whisper. \u201cI still remember the look he gave me as the police dragged him away. He knew what I\u2019d done. He knew I was his Judas Iscariot. And yet, in a strange kind of way, I think he loved me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, impressed in spite of myself. \u201cDid all this happen in South America?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrighton,\u201d she says after a slight pause. \u201cBut money launderers are the same the world over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d says a voice, before I can think of a reply to this, and we both look up to see a girl with smooth dark hair, in jeans and a black polo neck, walking swiftly toward us. \u201cI\u2019m Zelda. We spoke yesterday?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cZelda!\u201d exclaims Elisabeth, getting to her feet. \u201cHow have you been, my darling?\u201d She holds out her arms, and Zelda stares at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, \u201chave we\u2014\u201d She stops as her gaze falls on my copy of Blood Red Sunset. \u201cOh yes, that\u2019s right. Elisabeth Plover. One of the researchers will be down for you in a minute. Meanwhile, do help yourself to coffee.\u201d She flashes her a smile, then turns to me. \u201cRebecca, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say eagerly, leaping up from my chair. (I have to admit, I feel quite flattered that Zelda\u2019s come down to get me herself. I mean, she obviously doesn\u2019t come down for everyone.)</p><p>\u201cGreat to meet you,\u201d says Zelda, shaking my hand. \u201cGreat to have you on the show. Now, as usual, we\u2019re completely frantic \u2014 so if it\u2019s OK by you, I thought we\u2019d just head straight off to hair and makeup and we can talk on the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say, trying not to sound too excited. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>Hair and makeup! This is so cool!</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a slight change of plan which I need to fill you in on,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cNothing to worry about. . Any word from Bella yet?\u201d she adds to the receptionist.</p><p>The receptionist shakes her head, and Zelda mutters something which sounds like \u201cStupid cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s go,\u201d she says, heading off toward a pair of swing doors. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s even more crazy than usual today. One of our regulars has let us down, so we\u2019re searching for a replacement, and there\u2019s been an accident in the kitchen. .\u201d She pushes through the swing doors and now we\u2019re striding along a green-carpeted corridor buzzing with people. \u201cPlus, we\u2019ve got Heaven Sent 7 in today,\u201d she adds over her shoulder. \u201cWhich means the switchboard gets jammed with fans calling in, and we have to find dressing room space for seven enormous egos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say nonchalantly. But underneath I\u2019m jumping with excitement. Heaven Sent 7? But I mean. . they\u2019re really famous! And I\u2019m appearing on the same show as them! I mean \u2014 I\u2019ll get to meet them and everything, won\u2019t I? Maybe we\u2019ll all go out for a drink afterward and become really good friends. They\u2019re all a bit younger than me, but that won\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll be like their older sister.</p><p>Or maybe I\u2019ll go out with one of them! God, yes. That nice one with the dark hair. Nathan. (Or is it Ethan? Whatever he\u2019s called.) He\u2019ll catch my eye after the show and quietly ask me out to dinner without the others. We\u2019ll go to some tiny little restaurant, and at first it\u2019ll be all quiet and discreet, but then the press will find out and we\u2019ll become one of those really famous couples who go to premieres all the time. And I\u2019ll wear. .</p><p>\u201cOK, here we are,\u201d says Zelda, and I look up dazedly.</p><p>We\u2019re standing in the doorway of a room lined with mirrors and spotlights. Three people are sitting in chairs in front of the mirrors, wearing capes and having makeup applied by trendy-looking girls in jeans; another is having her hair blow-dried. Music is playing in the background, there\u2019s a friendly level of chatter, and in the air are the mingled scents of hair spray, face powder, and coffee.</p><p>It\u2019s basically my idea of heaven.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Zelda, leading me toward a girl with red hair. \u201cChloe will do your makeup, and then we\u2019ll pop you along to wardrobe. OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, my eyes widening as I take in Chloe\u2019s collection of makeup. There\u2019s about a zillion brushes, pots, and tubes littered over the counter in front of us, all really good brands like Chanel and MAC.</p><p>\u201cNow, about your slot,\u201d continues Zelda as I sit down on a swivel chair. \u201cAs I say, we\u2019ve gone for a rather different format from the one we talked about previously. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cZelda!\u201d comes a man\u2019s voice from outside. \u201cBella\u2019s on the line for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cLook, Rebecca, I\u2019ve got to go and take this call, but I\u2019ll come back as soon as I can. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say happily, as Chloe drapes a cape round me and pulls my hair back into a wide towel band. In the background, the radio\u2019s playing my favorite song by Lenny Kravitz.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just cleanse and tone, and then give you a base,\u201d says Chloe. \u201cIf you could shut your eyes. .\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and, after a few seconds, feel a cool, creamy liquid being massaged into my face. It\u2019s the most delicious sensation in the world. I could sit here all day.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Chloe after a while. \u201cWhat are you on the show for?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cErrm. . finance,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cA piece on finance.\u201d</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019m feeling so relaxed, I can hardly remember what I\u2019m doing here.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d says Chloe, efficiently smoothing foundation over my face. \u201cThey were talking earlier about some financial thing.\u201d She reaches for a palette of eyeshadows, blends a couple of colors together, then picks up a brush. \u201cSo, are you a financial expert, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, a little awkwardly. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d says Chloe, starting to apply eyeshadow to my eyelids. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the first thing about money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither!\u201d chimes in a dark-haired girl from across the room. \u201cMy accountant\u2019s given up trying to explain it all to me. As soon he says the word \u2018tax-year,\u2019 my mind glazes over.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to reply sympathetically \u201cMe too!\u201d and launch into a nice girly chat \u2014 but then I stop myself. The memory of Janice and Martin is a bit too raw for me to be flippant.</p><p>\u201cYou probably know quite a lot more about your finances than you realize,\u201d I say instead. \u201cIf you really don\u2019t know. . then you should take advice from someone who does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a financial expert like you?\u201d says the girl.</p> <p>I smile back, trying to look confident \u2014 but all this talk of my being a \u201cfinancial expert\u201d is unnerving me. I feel as though any minute now, someone\u2019s going to walk in, ask me an impossible question about South African bond yields, and then denounce me as a fraud. Thank goodness I know exactly what I\u2019m going to say on air.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Rebecca,\u201d says Chloe, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to interrupt. Now, I was thinking a raspberry red for the lips. Is that OK by you?\u201d</p><p>What with all this chatting, I haven\u2019t really been paying attention to what she\u2019s been doing to my face. But as I look at my reflection properly, I can\u2019t quite believe it. My eyes are huge; I\u2019ve suddenly got amazing cheekbones. . honestly, I look like a different person. Why on earth don\u2019t I wear makeup like this every day?</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier because you\u2019re so calm,\u201d observes Chloe, reaching into a black vanity case. \u201cWe get some people in here, really trembling with nerves. Even celebrities. We can hardly do their makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, and lean forward, ready to hear some insider gossip. But Zelda\u2019s voice interrupts us.</p> <p>\u201cSorry about that, Rebecca!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cRight, how are we doing? Makeup looks good. What about hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nicely cut,\u201d says Chloe, picking up a few strands of my hair and dropping them back down again, just like Nicky Clarke on a makeover. \u201cI\u2019ll just give it a blow-dry for sheen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll get her along to wardrobe.\u201d She glances at something on her clipboard, then sits down on a swivel chair next to me. \u201cOK, so, Rebecca, we need to talk about your item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I say, matching her businesslike tone. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve prepared it all just as you wanted. Really simple and straightforward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing. We had a talk at the meeting yesterday, and you\u2019ll be glad to hear, we don\u2019t need it too basic, after all.\u201d She smiles. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to get as technical as you like!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWell. . good! That\u2019s great! Although I might still keep it fairly low\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to avoid talking down to the audience. I mean, they\u2019re not morons!\u201d Zelda lowers her voice slightly. \u201cPlus we had some new audience research in yesterday, and apparently 80 percent of our viewers feel patronized by some or all of the show\u2019s content. Basically, we need to redress that balance. So we\u2019ve had a complete change of plan for your item!\u201d She beams at me. \u201cWhat we thought is, instead of a simple interview, we\u2019d have more of a high-powered debate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA high-powered debate?\u201d I echo, trying not to sound as alarmed as I feel.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d says Zelda. \u201cWhat we want is a really heated discussion! Opinions flying, voices raised. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Opinions?</p><p>\u201cSo is that OK?\u201d says Zelda, frowning at me. \u201cYou look a bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I force myself to smile brightly. \u201cJust. . looking forward to it!

But my throat\u2019s so tight, I can\u2019t swallow. I\u2019ve never felt so frightened in all my life.</p><p>I can\u2019t talk in a high-powered debate!</p><p>Why did I ever want to be on television?</p><p>\u201cRebecca, could you try to keep your lips still?\u201d says Chloe with a puzzled frown. \u201cThey\u2019re really shaking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper, staring at my reflection like a frozen rabbit. She\u2019s right, I\u2019m trembling all over. Oh God, this is no good. I\u2019ve got to calm down. Think happy thoughts. Think Zen.</p><p>In an effort to distract myself, I focus on the reflection in the mirror. In the background I can see Zelda standing in the corridor, talking into a phone with a furious expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I can hear her saying curtly. \u201cYup. But the point is, Bella, we pay you a retainer to be available. What the fuck am I supposed to do now?\u201d She looks up, sees someone, and lifts a hand in greeting. \u201cOK, Bella, I do see that. .\u201d</p><p>A blond woman and two men appear in the corridor, and Zelda nods to them apologetically. I can\u2019t see their faces, but they\u2019re all wearing smart overcoats and holding briefcases, and one of the men is holding a folder bulging with papers. The blond woman\u2019s coat is actually rather nice, I find myself thinking. And she\u2019s got a gorgeous Louis Vuitton bag. I wonder who she is.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Zelda\u2019s saying. \u201cYup. Well, if you can suggest an alternative phone-in subject. .\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows at the blond woman, who shrugs and turns away to look at a poster on the wall. And as she does so, my heart nearly stops dead.</p> <p>Because I recognize her. It\u2019s Alicia. Alicia from Brandon Communications is standing five yards away from me.</p><p>I almost want to laugh at the incongruity of it. What\u2019s she doing here? What\u2019s Alicia Bitch Long-legs doing here, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>One of the men turns round to say something to her \u2014 and as I see his face, I think I recognize him, too. He\u2019s another one of the Brandon C lot, isn\u2019t he? One of those young, eager, baby-faced types.</p><p>But what on earth are they all doing here? What\u2019s going on? Surely it can\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>They can\u2019t all be here because of\u2014</p><p>No. Oh no. Suddenly I feel rather cold.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d comes Zelda\u2019s voice from the corridor, and I feel a swoop of dismay. \u201cSo glad you could make it. We always love having you on the show. You know, I had no idea you represented Flagstaff Life, until Sandy said. .\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t happening. Please tell me this isn\u2019t happening.</p> <p>\u201cThe journalist who wrote the piece is already here,\u201d Zelda\u2019s saying, \u201cand I\u2019ve primed her on what\u2019s happening. I think it\u2019s going to make really great television, the two of you arguing away!\u201d</p><p>She starts moving down the corridor, and in the mirror I see Alicia and the eager young man begin to follow her. Then the third overcoated man starts to come into view. And although my stomach\u2019s churning painfully, I can\u2019t stop myself. I slowly turn my head as he passes the door.</p><p>I meet Luke Brandon\u2019s grave, dark eyes and he meets mine, and for a few still seconds, we just stare at each other. Then abruptly he looks away and strides off down the corridor. And I\u2019m left, gazing helplessly at my painted reflection, feeling sick with panic.</p><p>POINTS FOR TELEVISION INTERVIEW SIMPLE AND BASIC FINANCIAL ADVICE</p><p>1. Prefer clock/twenty grand?

I\u2019m dressed in a midnight-blue Jasper Conran suit, sheer tights, and a pair of suede high heels. What with my makeup and blown-dry hair, I\u2019ve never looked smarter in my life. But I can\u2019t enjoy any of it. All I can think of is the fact that in fifteen minutes, I\u2019ve got to sit on a sofa and discuss high-powered finance with Luke Brandon on live television.</p><p>The very thought of it makes me feel like whimpering. Or laughing wildly. I mean, it\u2019s like some kind of sick joke. Luke Brandon against me. Luke Brandon, with his genius IQ and bloody photographic memory \u2014 against me. He\u2019ll walk all over me. He\u2019ll massacre me.</p><p>\u201cDarling, have a croissant,\u201d says Elisabeth Plover, who\u2019s sitting opposite me, munching a pain au chocolat. \u201cThey\u2019re simply sublime. Every bite like a ray of golden Proven\u00e7al sun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI. . I\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand how she can eat. I honestly feel as though I\u2019m about to throw up at any moment. How on earth do people appear on television every day? How does Fiona Phillips do it? No wonder they\u2019re all so thin.</p><p>\u201cComing up!\u201d comes Rory\u2019s voice from the television monitor in the corner of the room, and both our heads automatically swivel round to see the screen filled with a picture of the beach at sunset. \u201cWhat is it like, to live with a gangster and then, risking everything, betray him? Our next guest has written an explosive novel based on her dark and dangerous background. .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . And we introduce a new series of in-depth discussions,\u201d chimes in Emma. The picture changes to one of pound coins raining onto the floor, and my stomach gives a nasty flip. \u201cMorning Coffee turns the spotlight on the issue of financial scandal, with two leading industry experts coming head-to-head in debate.\u201d</p><p>Is that me? Oh God, I don\u2019t want to be a leading industry expert. I want to go home and watch reruns of The Simpsons.</p> <p>\u201cBut first!\u201d says Rory cheerily. \u201cScott Robertson\u2019s getting all fired up in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>The picture switches abruptly to a man in a chef\u2019s hat grinning and brandishing a blowtorch. I stare at him for a few moments, then look down again, clenching my hands tightly in my lap. I can\u2019t quite believe that in fifteen minutes it\u2019ll be me up on that screen. Sitting on the sofa. Trying to think of something to say.</p><p>To distract myself, I unscrew my crappy piece of paper for the thousandth time and read through my paltry notes. Maybe it won\u2019t be so bad, I find myself thinking hopefully, as my eyes circle the same few sentences again and again. Maybe I\u2019m worrying about nothing. We\u2019ll probably keep the whole thing at the level of a casual chat. Keep it simple and friendly. After all. .</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Rebecca,\u201d comes a voice from the door. Slowly I look up \u2014 and as I do so, my heart sinks. Luke Brandon is standing in the doorway. He\u2019s wearing an immaculate dark suit, his hair is shining, and his face is bronze with makeup. There isn\u2019t an ounce of friendliness in his face. His jaw is tight; his eyes are hard and businesslike. As they meet mine, they don\u2019t even flicker.</p><p>For a few moments we gaze at each other without speaking. I can hear my pulse beating loudly in my ears; my face feels hot beneath all the makeup. Then, summoning all my inner resources, I force myself to say calmly, \u201cHello, Luke.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an interested silence as he walks into the room. Even Elisabeth Plover seems intrigued by him.</p> <p>\u201cI know that face,\u201d she says, leaning forward. \u201cI know it. You\u2019re an actor, aren\u2019t you? Shakespearean, of course. I believe I saw you in Lear three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Luke curtly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d says Elisabeth, slapping the table. \u201cIt was Hamlet. I remember it well. The desperate pain, the guilt, the final tragedy. .\u201d She shakes her head solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that voice of yours. Every word was like a stab wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it,\u201d says Luke, and looks at me. \u201cRebecca\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, here are the final figures,\u201d interrupts Alicia, hurrying into the room and handing him a piece of paper. \u201cHello, Rebecca,\u201d she adds, giving me a snide look. \u201cAll prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, actually,\u201d I say, crumpling my paper into a ball in my lap. \u201cVery well prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d says Alicia, raising her eyebrows. \u201cIt should be an interesting debate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cVery.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, she\u2019s a cow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had John from Flagstaff on the phone,\u201d adds Alicia to Luke in a lowered voice. \u201cHe was very keen that you should mention the new Foresight Savings Series. Obviously, I told him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a damage limitation exercise,\u201d says Luke curtly. \u201cNot a bloody plug-fest. He\u2019ll be bloody lucky if he. .\u201d He glances at me and I look away as though I\u2019m not remotely interested in what he\u2019s talking about. Casually I glance at my watch and feel a leap of fright as I see the time. Ten minutes. Ten minutes to go.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Zelda, coming into the room. \u201cElisabeth, we\u2019re ready for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarvelous,\u201d says Elisabeth, taking a last mouthful of pain au chocolat. \u201cNow, I do look all right, don\u2019t I?\u201d She stands up and a shower of crumbs falls off her skirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a piece of croissant in your hair,\u201d says Zelda, reaching up and removing it. \u201cOther than that \u2014 what can I say?\u201d She catches my eye and I have a hysterical desire to giggle.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d says the baby-faced guy, rushing in with a mobile phone. \u201cJohn Bateson on the line for you. And a couple of packages have arrived. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tim,\u201d says Alicia, taking the packages and ripping them open. She pulls out a bunch of papers and begins scanning them quickly, marking things every so often in pencil. Meanwhile, Tim sits down, opens a laptop computer, and starts typing.</p><p>\u201cYes, John, I do see your bloody point,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying in a low, tight voice. \u201cBut if you had just kept me better informed\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTim,\u201d says Alicia, looking up. \u201cCan you quickly check the return on the Flagstaff Premium Pension over the last three, five, and ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Tim, and starts tapping at his computer.</p><p>\u201cTim,\u201d says Luke, looking up from the phone. \u201cCan you print out the Flagstaff Foresight press release draft for me ASAP? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe what I\u2019m seeing. They\u2019ve practically set up an office, here in the Morning Coffee green room. An entire office of Brandon Communications staff complete with computers and modems and phones. . pitted against me and my crumpled piece of notebook paper.</p><p>As I watch Tim\u2019s laptop efficiently spewing out pages, and Alicia handing sheets of paper to Luke, a resigned feeling starts to creep over me. I mean, let\u2019s face it. I\u2019ll never beat this lot, will I? I haven\u2019t got a chance. I should just give up now. Tell them I\u2019m ill or something. Run home and hide under my duvet.</p><p>\u201cOK, everyone?\u201d says Zelda, poking her head round the door. \u201cOn in seven minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I echo in a wobbly voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Rebecca, there\u2019s a package for you,\u201d says Zelda. She comes into the room and hands me a large, square box. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zelda,\u201d I say in surprise, and, with a sudden lift of spirits, begin to rip the box open. I\u2019ve no idea what it is or who it\u2019s from \u2014 but it\u2019s got to be something helpful, hasn\u2019t it? Special last-minute information from Eric Foreman, maybe. A graph, or a series of figures that I can produce at the crucial moment. Or some secret document that Luke doesn\u2019t know about.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I can see that all the Brandonites have stopped what they\u2019re doing and are watching, too. Well, that\u2019ll show them. They\u2019re not the only ones to get packages delivered to the green room. They\u2019re not the only ones to have resources. Finally I get the sticky tape undone and open the flaps of the box.</p><p>And as everyone watches, a big red helium balloon, with \u201cgood luck\u201d emblazoned across it, floats up to the ceiling. There\u2019s a card attached to the string, and, without looking anyone in the eye, I rip it open.</p><p>Immediately I wish I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGood luck to you, good luck to you, whatever you\u2019re about to do,\u201d sings a tinny electronic voice.</p> <p>I slam the card shut and feel a surge of embarrassment. From the other side of the room I can hear little sniggers going on, and I look up to see Alicia smirking. She whispers something into Luke\u2019s ear, and an amused expression spreads across his face.</p><p>He\u2019s laughing at me. They\u2019re all laughing at Rebecca Bloomwood and her singing balloon. For a few moments I can\u2019t move for mortification. My chest is rising and falling swiftly; I\u2019ve never felt less like a leading industry expert in my life.</p><p>Then, on the other side of the room, I hear Alicia murmur some malicious little comment and give a snort of laughter. Deep inside me, something snaps. Sod them, I think suddenly. Sod them all. They\u2019re probably only jealous, anyway. They wish they had balloons, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Defiantly I open the card again to read the message.</p><p>\u201cNo matter if it\u2019s rain or shine, we all know that you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d sings the card\u2019s tinny voice at once. \u201cHold your head up, keep it high \u2014 all that matters is you try.\u201d</p><p>To Becky, I read. With love and thanks for all your wonderful help. We\u2019re so proud to know you.

They\u2019ve always been kind to me, even when I gave them such disastrous advice. I owe this to them. And I\u2019m bloody well not going to let them down.</p> <p>I blink a few times, take a deep breath, and look up to see Luke Brandon gazing at me, his eyes dark and expressionless.</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cSending me their good wishes.\u201d</p><p>Carefully I place the card on the coffee table, making sure it stays open so it\u2019ll keep singing, then pull my balloon down from the ceiling and tie it to the back of my chair.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d comes Zelda\u2019s voice from the door. \u201cLuke and Rebecca.

I dart a glance at him as we turn a corner \u2014 and his face is even steelier than it was before.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s fine. I can do hard and businesslike, too. Firmly I lift my chin and begin to take longer strides, pretending to be Alexis Carrington in Dynasty.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you two already know each other?\u201d says Zelda, who\u2019s walking along between us.</p><p>\u201cWe do, as it happens,\u201d says Luke shortly.</p><p>\u201cIn a business context,\u201d I say, equally shortly. \u201cLuke\u2019s always trying to promote some financial product or other. And I\u2019m always trying to avoid his calls.\u201d</p> <p>Zelda gives an appreciative laugh and I see Luke\u2019s eyes flash angrily. But I really don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care how angry he gets. In fact, the angrier he gets, the better I feel.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 Luke, you must have been quite pissed off at Rebecca\u2019s article in The Daily World,\u201d says Zelda.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t pleased,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBy any of it,\u201d he adds in a lower voice.</p><p>What does that mean? I turn my head, and to my astonishment, he\u2019s looking at me with a sober expression. Almost apologetic. Hmm. This must be an old PR trick. Soften up your opponent and then go in for the kill. But I\u2019m not going to fall for it.</p><p>\u201cHe phoned me up to complain,\u201d I say airily to Zelda. \u201cCan\u2019t cope with the truth, eh, Luke? Can\u2019t cope with seeing what\u2019s under the PR gloss?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I dart another look at him. Now he looks so furious, I think for a terrifying moment that he\u2019s going to hit me. Then his face changes and, in an icily calm voice, he says, \u201cLet\u2019s just get on the fucking set and get this over with, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Zelda raises her eyebrows at me and I grin back. This is more like it.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Zelda as we approach a set of double swing doors. \u201cHere we are. Keep your voices down when we go in.\u201d</p> <p>She pushes open the doors and ushers us in, and for a moment my cool act falters. I feel all shaky and awed, like Laura Dern in Jurassic Park when she sees the dinosaurs for the first time. Because there it is, in real life. The real live Morning Coffee set. With the sofa and all the plants and everything, all lit up by the brightest, most dazzling lights I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.</p><p>This is just unreal.

The sofa\u2019s harder than I was expecting, and kind of. . different. Everything\u2019s different. The plants seem bigger than they do on the screen, and the coffee table is smaller. God, this is weird. The lights are so bright on my face, I can hardly see anything, and I\u2019m not quite sure how to sit. A girl comes and threads a microphone cable under my shirt and clips it to my lapel. Awkwardly, I lift my hand to push my hair back, and immediately Zelda comes hurrying over.</p><p>\u201cTry not to move too much, OK, Rebecca?\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear a load of rustling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cSorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly my voice doesn\u2019t seem to be working properly.

Just behave naturally!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say huskily.</p><p>Behave naturally. Easy-peasy.</p> <p>\u201cThirty seconds till the news bulletin,\u201d she says, looking at her watch. \u201cEverything OK, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Luke calmly. He\u2019s sitting on his sofa as though he\u2019s been there all his life. Typical.</p><p>I shift on my seat, tug nervously at my skirt, and smooth my jacket down. They always say that television puts ten pounds on you, which means my legs will look really fat. Maybe I should cross them the other way. Or not cross them at all? But then maybe they\u2019ll look even fatter.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d comes a high-pitched voice from across the set before I can make up my mind. My head jerks up, and I feel an excited twinge in my stomach. It\u2019s Emma March in the flesh! She\u2019s wearing a pink suit and hurrying toward the sofa, closely followed by Rory, who looks even more square-jawed than usual. God, it\u2019s weird seeing celebrities up close. They don\u2019t look quite real, somehow.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Emma says cheerfully, and sits down on the sofa. \u201cSo you\u2019re the finance people, are you? Gosh, I\u2019m dying for a wee.\u201d She frowns into the lights. \u201cHow long is this slot, Zelda?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi there!\u201d says Rory, and shakes my hand. \u201cRoberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Rebecca!\u201d says Emma, and rolls her eyes at me sympathetically. \u201cHonestly, he\u2019s hopeless.\u201d She wriggles on the sofa. \u201cGosh, I really need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late now,\u201d says Rory.</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it really unhealthy not to go when you need to?\u201d Emma wrinkles her brow anxiously. \u201cDidn\u2019t we have a phone-in on it once? That weird girl phoned up who only went once a day. And Dr. James said. . what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearch me,\u201d says Rory cheerfully. \u201cThese phone-ins always go over my head. Now I\u2019m warning you, Rebecca,\u201d he adds, turning to me, \u201cI can never follow any of this finance stuff. Far too brainy for me.\u201d He gives me a wide grin and I smile weakly back.</p><p>\u201cTen seconds,\u201d calls Zelda from the side of the set, and my stomach gives a tweak of fear. Over the loudspeakers I can hear the Morning Coffee theme music, signaling the end of a commercial break.</p> <p>\u201cWho starts?\u201d says Emma, squinting at the TelePrompTer. \u201cOh, me.\u201d</p><p>So this is it. I feel almost light-headed with fear. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m supposed to be looking; I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m supposed to speak. My legs are trembling and my hands are clenched tightly in my lap. The lights are dazzling my eyes; a camera\u2019s zooming in on my left, but I\u2019ve got to try to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back!\u201d says Emma suddenly to the camera. \u201cNow, which would you rather have? A carriage clock or \u00a320,000?\u201d</p><p>What? I think in shock. But that\u2019s my line. That\u2019s what I was going to say.</p><p>\u201cThe answer\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d continues Emma blithely. \u201cWe\u2019d all prefer the \u00a320,000.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d interjects Rory with a cheerful smile.</p><p>\u201cBut when some Flagstaff Life investors received a letter inviting them to move their savings recently,\u201d says Emma, suddenly putting on a sober face, \u201cthey didn\u2019t realize that if they did so, they would lose out on a \u00a320,000 windfall. Rebecca Bloomwood is the journalist who uncovered this story \u2014 Rebecca, do you think this kind of deception is commonplace?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly everyone\u2019s looking at me, waiting for me to reply. The camera\u2019s trained on my face; the studio\u2019s silent.</p> <p>Two point five million people, all watching at home.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cDo you think investors need to be cautious?\u201d prompts Emma.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I manage in a strange, woolly voice. \u201cYes, I think they should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke Brandon, you represent Flagstaff Life,\u201d says Emma, turning away. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shit, I think miserably. That was pathetic. Pathetic! What\u2019s happened to my voice, for God\u2019s sake? What\u2019s happened to all my prepared answers?</p><p>And now I\u2019m not even listening to Luke\u2019s reply. Come on, Rebecca. Concentrate.</p><p>\u201cWhat you must remember,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying smoothly, \u201cis that nobody\u2019s entitled to a windfall. This isn\u2019t a case of deception!\u201d He smiles at Emma. \u201cThis is simply a case of a few investors being a little too greedy for their own good. They believe they\u2019ve missed out \u2014 so they\u2019re deliberately stirring up bad publicity for the company. Meanwhile, there are thousands of people who have benefited from Flagstaff Life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What?

Mr. Brandon, did you just call the investors greedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBut some, yes.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him in disbelief, my skin prickling with outrage. An image of Janice and Martin comes into my mind \u2014 the sweetest, least greedy people in the world \u2014 and for a few moments I\u2019m so angry, I can\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, the majority of investors with Flagstaff Life have seen record returns over the last five years,\u201d Luke\u2019s continuing to Emma, who\u2019s nodding intelligently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what they should be concerned with. Good-quality investment. Not flash-in-the-pan windfalls. After all, Flagstaff Life was originally set up to provide\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, Luke,\u201d I cut in, forcing myself to speak calmly. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 but I believe Flagstaff Life was originally set up as a mutual company? For the mutual benefit of all its members. Not to benefit some at the expense of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d replies Luke without flickering. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t entitle every investor to a \u00a320,000 windfall, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I say, my voice rising slightly. \u201cBut surely it entitles them to believe they won\u2019t be misled by a company they\u2019ve put their money with for fifteen years? Janice and Martin Webster trusted Flagstaff Life. They trusted the advice they were given. And look where that trust got them!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInvestment is a game of luck,\u201d says Luke blandly. \u201cSometimes you win\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck!\u201d I hear myself crying furiously. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t luck! Are you telling me it was compete coincidence that they were advised to switch their funds two weeks before the windfall announcements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clients were simply making available an offer that they believed would add value to their customers\u2019 portfolios,\u201d says Luke, giving me a tight smile. \u201cThey have assured me that they were simply wishing to benefit their customers. They have assured me that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying your clients are incompetent, then?\u201d I retort. \u201cYou\u2019re saying they had all the best intentions \u2014 but cocked it up?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes flash in anger and I feel a thrill of exhilaration.</p><p>\u201cI fail to see\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we could go on debating all day!\u201d says Emma, shifting slightly on her seat. \u201cBut moving onto a slightly more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Luke,\u201d I say, cutting her off. \u201cCome on. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d I lean forward, ticking points off on my hand. \u201cEither Flagstaff Life were incompetent, or they were deliberately trying to save money. Whichever it is, they\u2019re in the wrong. The Websters were loyal customers and they should have gotten that money. In my opinion, Flagstaff Life deliberately encouraged them out of the with-profits fund to stop them receiving the windfall. I mean, it\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I look around for support and see Rory gazing blankly at me.</p><p>\u201cIt all sounds a bit technical for me,\u201d he says with a little laugh. \u201cBit complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s put it another way,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cLet\u2019s. .\u201d I close my eyes, searching for inspiration. \u201cLet\u2019s. . suppose I\u2019m in a clothes shop!\u201d I open my eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m in a clothes shop, and I\u2019ve chosen a wonderful cashmere Nicole Farhi coat. OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Rory cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI love Nicole Farhi!\u201d says Emma, perking up. \u201cBeautiful knitwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say. \u201cOK, so imagine I\u2019m standing in the checkout queue, minding my own business, when a sales assistant comes up to me and says, \u2018Why not buy this other coat instead? It\u2019s better quality \u2014 and I\u2019ll throw in a free bottle of perfume.\u2019 I\u2019ve got no reason to distrust the sales assistant, so I think, Wonderful, and I buy the other coat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Rory, nodding. \u201cWith you so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when I get outside,\u201d I say carefully, \u201cI discover that this other coat isn\u2019t Nicole Farhi and isn\u2019t real cashmere. I go back in \u2014 and the shop won\u2019t give me a refund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were ripped off!\u201d exclaims Rory, as though he\u2019s just discovered gravity.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say. \u201cI was ripped off. And the point is, so were thousands of Flagstaff Life customers. They were persuaded out of their original choice of investment, into a fund which left them \u00a320,000 worse off.\u201d I pause, marshaling my thoughts. \u201cPerhaps Flagstaff Life didn\u2019t break the law. Perhaps they didn\u2019t contravene any regulations. But there\u2019s a natural justice in this world, and they didn\u2019t just break that, they shattered it. Those customers deserved that windfall. They were loyal, long-standing customers, and they deserved it. And if you\u2019re honest, Luke Brandon, you know they deserved it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I finish my speech breathlessly and look at Luke.

It\u2019s as though our eyes are glued together.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d says Emma. \u201cDo you have a response to Rebecca\u2019s point?\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t respond. He\u2019s staring at me, and I\u2019m staring back, feeling my heart thump like a rabbit.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d repeats Emma slightly impatiently. \u201cDo you have\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Luke. \u201cYes I do. Rebecca\u2014\u201d He shakes his head, almost smiling to himself, then looks up again at me. \u201cRebecca, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden still silence around the studio.</p><p>I open my mouth, but I can\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Rory and Emma glancing at each other puzzledly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Luke,\u201d says Emma. \u201cDo you mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d says Luke, and gives a shrug. \u201cRebecca\u2019s absolutely right.\u201d He reaches for his glass of water, leans back on his sofa, and takes a sip. \u201cIf you want my honest opinion, those customers deserved that windfall. I very much wish they had received it.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me, and he\u2019s wearing that same apologetic expression he had in the corridor. This can\u2019t be happening. Luke\u2019s agreeing with me. How can he be agreeing with me?</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Emma, sounding a bit affronted. \u201cSo, you\u2019ve changed your position, then?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, while Luke stares thoughtfully into his glass of water. Then he looks up and says, \u201cMy company is employed by Flagstaff Life to maintain their public profile. But that doesn\u2019t mean that personally I agree with everything they do \u2014 or even that I know about it.\u201d He pauses. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I had no idea any of this was going on until I read about it in Rebecca\u2019s article in The Daily World. Which, by the way, was a fine piece of investigative journalism,\u201d he adds, nodding to me. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>I stare back helplessly, unable even to mutter \u201cThank you.\u201d I\u2019ve never felt so wrong-footed in all my life. I want to stop and bury my head in my hands and think all of this through slowly and carefully \u2014 but I can\u2019t, I\u2019m on live television. I\u2019m being watched by 2.5 million people, all around the country.</p><p>I hope my legs look OK.</p> <p>\u201cIf I were a Flagstaff customer and this had happened to me, I\u2019d be very angry,\u201d Luke continues. \u201cThere is such a thing as customer loyalty; there is such a thing as playing straight. And I would hope that any client of mine, whom I represent in public, would abide by both of those principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Emma, and turns to the camera. \u201cWell, this is quite a turnaround! Luke Brandon, here to represent Flagstaff Life, now says that what they did was wrong. Any further comment, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d says Luke, with a wry smile, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be representing Flagstaff Life any more after this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Rory, leaning forward intelligently. \u201cAnd can you tell us why that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Rory!\u201d says Emma impatiently. She rolls her eyes and Luke gives a little snort of laughter.</p><p>And suddenly everyone\u2019s laughing, and I join in too, slightly hysterically. I catch Luke\u2019s eye and feel something flash in my chest, then quickly look away again.</p><p>\u201cRight, well, anyway,\u201d says Emma abruptly, pulling herself together and smiling at the camera. \u201cThat\u2019s it from the finance experts \u2014 but, coming up after the break, the return of hot pants to the catwalk. .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . and cellulite creams \u2014 do they really work?\u201d adds Rory.</p> <p>\u201cPlus our special guests \u2014 Heaven Sent 7\u2014singing live in the studio.\u201d</p><p>The theme music blares out of the loudspeakers and both Emma and Rory leap to their feet.</p><p>\u201cWonderful debate,\u201d says Emma, hurrying off. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m dying for a wee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent stuff,\u201d adds Rory earnestly. \u201cDidn\u2019t understand a word \u2014 but great television.\u201d He slaps Luke on the back, raises his hand to me, and then hurries off the set.</p><p>And all at once it\u2019s over. It\u2019s just me and Luke, sitting opposite each other on the sofas, with bright lights still shining in our eyes and microphones still clipped to our lapels. I feel slightly shell-shocked.</p><p>Did all that really just happen?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say eventually, and clear my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d echoes Luke with a tiny smile. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and bite my lip awkwardly in the silence.</p><p>I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s in big trouble now. If attacking one of your clients on live TV is the PR equivalent of hiding clothes from the customers.</p><p>If he really changed his mind because of my article. Because of me.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t ask that.

Mine wasn\u2019t. . You go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Luke, and gives a little shrug. \u201cI was just going to ask if you\u2019d like to have dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>What does he mean, have dinner? Does he mean\u2014</p><p>\u201cTo discuss a bit of business,\u201d he continues. \u201cI very much liked your idea for a unit trust promotion along the lines of the January sales.\u201d</p><p>My what?</p><p>What idea? What\u2019s he. .</p> <p>Oh God, that. Is he serious? That was just one of my stupid, speak-aloud, brain-not-engaged moments.</p><p>\u201cI think it could be a good promotion for a particular client of ours,\u201d he\u2019s saying, \u201cand I was wondering whether you\u2019d like to consult on the project. On a freelance basis, of course.\u201d</p><p>Consult. Freelance. Project.</p><p>He\u2019s serious.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, and swallow, inexplicably disappointed. \u201cOh, I see. Well, I. . I suppose I might be free tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d says Luke. \u201cShall we say the Ritz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like,\u201d I say offhandedly, as though I go there all the time.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d says Luke again, and his eyes crinkle into a smile. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p> <p>And then \u2014 oh God. To my utter horror, before I can stop myself, I hear myself saying bitchily, \u201cWhat about Sacha? Doesn\u2019t she have plans for you tonight?\u201d</p><p>Even as the words hit the air, I feel myself redden. Oh shit. Shit! What did I say that for?</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence during which I want to slink off somewhere and die.</p><p>\u201cSacha left two weeks ago,\u201d says Luke finally, and my head pops up.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say feebly. \u201cOh dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo warning \u2014 she packed up her calfskin suitcase and went.\u201d Luke looks up. \u201cStill, it could be worse.\u201d He gives a deadpan shrug. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t buy the holdall as well.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, now I\u2019m going to giggle. I mustn\u2019t giggle. I mustn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I manage at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d says Luke, gazing at me seriously, and the laughter inside me dies away. I stare back at him nervously and feel a tingle spread across my face.</p><p>\u201cRebecca! Luke!\u201d</p><p>Our heads jerk round to see Zelda approaching the set, clipboard in hand.</p><p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cJust what we wanted. Luke, you were great. And Rebecca. .\u201d She comes and sits next to me on the sofa and pats my shoulder. \u201cYou were so wonderful, we were thinking \u2014 how would you like to stand in as our phone-in expert later in the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cBut. . but I can\u2019t! I\u2019m not an expert on anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha-ha, very good!\u201d Zelda gives an appreciative laugh. \u201cThe great thing about you, Rebecca, is you\u2019ve got the common touch. We see you as finance guru meets girl next door. Informative but approachable. Knowledgeable but down-to-earth. The financial expert people really want to talk to. What do you think, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Rebecca will do the job perfectly,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone better qualified. I also think I\u2019d better get out of your way.\u201d He stands up and smiles at me. \u201cSee you later, Rebecca. Bye, Zelda.\u201d</p><p>I watch in a daze as he picks his way across the cable-strewn floor toward the exit, half wishing he would look back.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Zelda, and squeezes my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get you sorted.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>I WAS MADE TO go on television. That\u2019s the truth. I was absolutely made to go on television.</p><p>We\u2019re sitting on the sofas again, Rory and Emma and me, and Anne from Leeds is admitting over the line that she\u2019s never given retirement planning a thought.</p><p>I glance at Emma and smile, and she twinkles back. I\u2019ve never felt so warm and happy in all my life.</p><p>What\u2019s really strange is that when it was me being interviewed, I felt all tongue-tied and nervous \u2014 but on the other side of the sofa, I\u2019ve been in my element right from the start. God, I could do this all day. I don\u2019t even mind the bright lights anymore. They feel normal. And I\u2019ve practiced the most flattering way to sit in front of the mirror (knees together, feet crossed at the ankle), and I\u2019m sticking to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy mum used to tell me to take out a pension,\u201d says Anne, \u201cand I used to laugh at her. But now I\u2019ve started to panic I\u2019ve left it too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d says Emma. \u201cShould Anne be concerned?\u201d</p><p>Pensions, I think quickly. Come on, what do I know about pensions?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say. \u201cOf course, the earlier you start saving, the more you\u2019ll accumulate. But that\u2019s no reason to panic, Anne. The good thing is, you\u2019re thinking about it now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow old are you exactly, Anne?\u201d says Emma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty,\u201d says Anne. \u201cThirty last month.\u201d</p><p>Yes! Thank you, God!</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d I say knowledgeably. \u201cA typical woman of thirty, who invested \u00a3100 a month, would receive an income of \u00a39,000 on retirement at sixty. That\u2019s assuming 7 percent growth.\u201d</p><p>Bingo. Rory and Emma look so impressed. OK, quick, what else?</p> <p>\u201cBut you should also look for flexibility, Anne,\u201d I continue. \u201cChoose a scheme which allows you to take a \u2018holiday\u2019 from payments, because you never know when you might need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d says Anne thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019d like to take a year off sometime and travel a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you are!\u201d I say triumphantly. \u201cIf you do that, you\u2019ll want to be able to pause your pension payments. In fact, what I would do is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rebecca,\u201d chimes in Emma. \u201cWise advice there! Now we\u2019re going to go briefly to Davina for news and weather. .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rather disappointed at being interrupted. There were so many more things I could have said to Anne. All the points I made in my pensions article are popping up in my head \u2014 and now that there\u2019s a real person involved, they all suddenly seem a lot more interesting. In fact, the whole subject seems more interesting today. It\u2019s as though all this stuff has suddenly got a point.</p><p>Believe it or not, I\u2019m really enjoying the questions on this phone-in. I know about mortgages and I know about life insurance and I know about unit trusts. I know so much more than I ever realized! A few minutes ago, Kenneth from St. Austell asked what the annual contribution limit for an ISA is \u2014 and the figure \u00a35,000 just jumped right into my head. It\u2019s as if some bit of my mind has been storing every single bit of information I\u2019ve ever written \u2014 and now, when I need it, it\u2019s all there.</p> <p>\u201cAnd after the break,\u201d Emma\u2019s saying, \u201csince so many of you are ringing in, we\u2019ll be coming back to this phone-in: \u2018Managing Your Money.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of people with money problems out there,\u201d chimes in Rory.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Emma. \u201cAnd we want to help. So whatever your query, however big or small, please call in for Rebecca Bloomwood\u2019s advice, on 0333 4567.\u201d She freezes for a moment, smiling at the camera, then relaxes back in her chair as the light goes off. \u201cWell, this is going very well!\u201d she says brightly, as a makeup girl hurries up and touches up her face with powder. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, Zelda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic!\u201d says Zelda, appearing out of nowhere. \u201cThe lines haven\u2019t been this busy since we did \u2018I\u2019d Like to Meet a Spice Girl.\u2019 \u201d She looks curiously at me. \u201cHave you ever done a course in television presenting, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cI haven\u2019t. But. . I\u2019ve watched a lot of telly.\u201d</p><p>Zelda roars with laughter. \u201cGood answer! OK, folks, we\u2019re back in thirty.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiles at me and consults a piece of paper in front of her, and Rory leans back and examines his nails.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so completely and utterly happy. Never. Not even that time I found a Vivienne Westwood bustier for \u00a360 in the Harvey Nichols sale. (I wonder where that is, actually. I must get round to wearing it sometime.) This beats everything. Life is perfect.</p> <p>I lean back, full of contentment, and am idly looking around the studio when an oddly familiar figure catches my eye. I peer harder, and my skin starts to prickle in horror. There\u2019s a man standing in the gloom of the studio \u2014 and honestly, I must be hallucinating or something, because he looks exactly like\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd. . welcome back,\u201d says Rory, and my attention snaps back to the set. \u201cThis morning\u2019s phone-in is on financial problems, big and small. Our guest expert is Rebecca Bloomwood and our next caller is Fran from Shrewsbury. Fran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Fran. \u201cHi. Hi, Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, Fran,\u201d I say, smiling warmly. \u201cAnd what seems to be the trouble?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in a mess,\u201d says Fran. \u201cI. . I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in debt, Fran?\u201d says Emma gently.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Fran, and gives a shaky sigh. \u201cI\u2019m overdrawn, I owe money on all my credit cards, I\u2019ve borrowed money off my sister. . and I just can\u2019t stop spending. I just. . love buying things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d says Rory interestedly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, really,\u201d says Fran after a pause. \u201cClothes for me, clothes for the kids, things for the house, just rubbish, really. Then the bills arrive. . and I throw them away.\u201d</p><p>Emma gives me a significant look, and I raise my eyebrows back. But my cool act is starting to falter a little at Fran\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a vicious circle,\u201d Fran\u2019s saying. \u201cThe more in debt I am, the worse I feel, so I go out and spend more.\u201d</p><p>Outstanding bills. Credit card debts. Overdrafts. All the things I\u2019ve been desperate not to think about are being thrust back into my mind. Desperately I thrust them back out again.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d she says. \u201cFran\u2019s obviously in a bit of a spot. What should she be doing?\u201d</p> <p>For an instant I feel like crying Why ask me? But I can\u2019t crumble, I have to do this. I have to be Rebecca Bloomwood, top financial expert. Summoning all my strength, I force myself to smile sympathetically at the camera.</p><p>\u201cWell, Fran,\u201d I say. \u201cThe first thing you\u2019ve got to do is. . is be brave and confront the issue. Contact the bank and tell them you\u2019re having trouble managing.\u201d I swallow hard, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cI know myself how hard it can be to tackle this kind of problem \u2014 but I can honestly tell you, running away doesn\u2019t solve anything. The longer you leave it, the worse it\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Emma earnestly. \u201cWould you say this is a common problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it is,\u201d I reply. \u201cIt\u2019s all too easy to forget those unpaid bills, to put them in a dressing table drawer, or. . or throw them in a skip. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA skip?\u201d says Rory, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cEverybody\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI put mine in the dog basket,\u201d interjects Fran. \u201cThen he chews them and I can\u2019t read them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d I say, nodding. \u201cBut you know what, Fran? Once you take those letters out of the dog basket and actually read them, you\u2019ll find they\u2019re not nearly as bad as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d says Fran tremulously.</p><p>\u201cOpen each envelope,\u201d I suggest, \u201cand write down all the outstanding amounts. Then make a plan to pay them off, even if it\u2019s only \u00a35 a week. You can do it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause.</p><p>\u201cFran?\u201d says Emma. \u201cAre you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Fran. \u201cYes, I\u2019m still here \u2014 and I\u2019m going to do it! You\u2019ve convinced me. Thanks, Becky! I really appreciate your help!\u201d</p><p>I beam back at the camera, my confidence restored.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you know, Fran, as soon as you turn that corner and wake up to the real world, your life will be transformed.\u201d</p><p>I make a confident sweeping gesture with my arm, and as I do so, my gaze takes in the whole studio. And. . oh my God, it\u2019s him.</p><p>I\u2019m not hallucinating.</p><p>It\u2019s really him. Standing at the corner of the set, wearing a security badge and sipping something in a polystyrene cup as though he belongs here. Derek Smeath is standing here in the Morning Coffee studios, ten yards away from me.</p><p>Derek Smeath of Endwich Bank. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. What\u2019s he doing here?</p><p>Oh God, and now he\u2019s staring straight at me.</p><p>My heart begins to pound, and I swallow hard, trying to keep control of myself.</p><p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d Emma says puzzledly, and I force myself to turn my attention back to the show. But all my confident words are withering on my lips. \u201cSo you really think, if she tries, Fran will be able to get her life in order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . that\u2019s right,\u201d I say, and force a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of facing up to it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying desperately to stay cool and professional \u2014 but all the bits of my life I\u2019d so carefully buried are starting to worm their way out again. Here they come, wriggling into my mind, one piece of dreadful reality after another.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Rory. \u201cLet\u2019s all hope Fran takes Rebecca\u2019s very good advice.\u201d</p><p>My bank account.

My Octagon card, confiscated in front of that whole crowd. God, that was humiliating.</p><p>OK, stop it. Concentrate. Concentrate.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, forcing a confident tone. \u201cI would just say. . in the same way you might have a medical checkup once a year, do the same with your finances. Don\u2019t ignore them until they become a problem!\u201d</p> <p>My whole terrible, disorganized life. It\u2019s all there, isn\u2019t it? Waiting for me, like a great big spider.

Coming up after the break, the results of our makeover in Newcastle and Heaven Sent 7, live in the studio.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a frozen pause, then everyone relaxes.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Emma, consulting her piece of paper. \u201cWhere are we next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work, Rebecca,\u201d says Rory cheerfully. \u201cExcellent stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Zelda!\u201d says Emma, leaping up. \u201cCould I have a quick word? That was fab, Rebecca,\u201d she adds. \u201cReally fab.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly they\u2019re both gone. And I\u2019m left alone on the set, exposed and vulnerable. Rebecca Bloomwood, top financial expert, has vanished. All that\u2019s left is me, Becky. Shrinking on my seat and frantically trying to avoid Derek Smeath\u2019s eye.</p><p>I don\u2019t have anything to give him. The money from The Daily World has got to go straight to Suze. I\u2019m in as much trouble as I ever was. What am I going to do?</p><p>Maybe I could slip out at the back.</p><p>Maybe I could stick it out here on the sofa. Just sit here until he gets bored and leaves. I mean, he won\u2019t dare to come onto the actual set, will he? Or maybe I could pretend to be someone else. God yes. I mean, with all this makeup on, I practically look like someone else, anyway. I could just walk quickly past, and if he talks to me, answer in a foreign accent. Or else. .</p><p>And then suddenly I stop, midtrack. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m hearing my own thoughts for the first time in my life. And what I hear makes me ashamed of myself.</p> <p>Who do I think I\u2019m kidding? What exactly will I achieve by dodging Derek Smeath one more time? It\u2019s time to grow up, Becky, I tell myself. It\u2019s time to stop running away. If Fran from Shrewsbury can do it, then so can Rebecca from London.</p><p>I stand up, take a deep breath, and walk slowly across the set to Derek Smeath.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Smeath,\u201d I say in polite, calm tones. \u201cWhat a coincidence to see you here.\u201d I hold out my hand for a symbolic, peacemaking handshake, but Derek Smeath doesn\u2019t even seem to see it. He\u2019s staring at me as though he\u2019s seen a goldfish begin to talk.</p><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d he echoes at last, and a technician gestures to us to keep our voices down. Derek Smeath firmly ushers me out of the studio into a foyer area and turns to face me, and I feel a twinge of fear at his expression.</p><p>\u201cMiss Bloomwood,\u201d he says. \u201cMiss Bloomwood\u2014\u201d He rubs his face with his hand, then looks up. \u201cDo you know quite how long I have been writing letters to you? Do you know how long I\u2019ve been trying to get you into the bank for a meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhm. . I\u2019m not quite\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months,\u201d says Derek Smeath, and pauses. \u201cSix long months of excuses and prevarication. Now, I\u2019d just like you to think about what that means for me. It means endless letters. Numerous phone calls. Hours of time and effort on my part and that of my assistant, Erica. Resources which, quite frankly, could be better spent elsewhere.\u201d He gestures sharply with his polystyrene cup and some coffee slops onto the floor. \u201cThen finally I pin you down to a cast-iron appointment. Finally I think you\u2019re taking your situation seriously. . And you don\u2019t turn up. You disappear completely. I telephone your home to find out where you are, and get accused most unpleasantly of being some kind of stalker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, and pull an apologetic face. \u201cSorry about that. It\u2019s just my dad, you know. He\u2019s a bit weird.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d all but given up on you,\u201d says Derek Smeath, his voice rising. \u201cI\u2019d all but given up. And then I\u2019m passing a television shop this morning, and what should I see, on six different screens, but the missing, vanished Rebecca Bloomwood, advising the nation. And what are you advising them on?\u201d He begins to shake with laughter. (At least, I think it\u2019s laughter.) \u201cFinance!

But if we could reschedule. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cReschedule!\u201d cries Derek Smeath, as though I\u2019ve just cracked a hysterical joke. \u201cReschedule!\u201d</p><p>I gaze at him indignantly. He\u2019s not taking me seriously at all, is he? He hasn\u2019t shaken my hand, and he\u2019s not even listening to what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m telling him I want to come in for a meeting \u2014 I actually want to \u2014 and he\u2019s just treating me like a joke.</p> <p>And no wonder, interrupts a tiny voice inside me. Look at the way you\u2019ve behaved. Look at the way you\u2019ve treated him. Frankly, it\u2019s a wonder he\u2019s being civil to you at all.</p><p>I look up at his face, still crinkled in laughter. . and suddenly feel very chastened.</p><p>Because the truth is, he could have been a lot nastier to me than he has been. He could have taken my card away a long time ago. Or sent the bailiffs round. Or had me blacklisted. He\u2019s actually been very nice to me, one way or another, and all I\u2019ve done is lie and wriggle and run away.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cPlease. Give me another chance.

Derek Smeath looks around for a place to put his coffee cup, takes a white handkerchief out of his pocket, and rubs his brow with it. Then he puts it away and gives me a long look.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll really make an effort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.

I want to get my life in order. I want him to tell me what to do to make things right.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d says Derek Smeath at last. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can sort out. You come into the office tomorrow, nine-thirty sharp, and we\u2019ll have a little chat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, my whole body subsiding in relief. \u201cThank you so much. I\u2019ll be there. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be,\u201d he says. \u201cNo more excuses.\u201d Then a faint smile passes over his features. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he adds, gesturing to the set. \u201cI thought you did very well up there, with all your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cWell. . thanks. That\u2019s really. .\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cHow did you get into the studio, anyway? I thought they had quite tight security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d replies Derek Smeath. \u201cBut my daughter works in television.\u201d He smiles fondly. \u201cShe used to work on this very show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>God, how amazing. Derek Smeath has a daughter. He\u2019s probably got a whole family, come to that. A wife, and everything. Who would have thought it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go,\u201d he says, and drains his polystyrene cup. \u201cThis was a bit of an unscheduled detour.\u201d He gives me a severe look. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d I say quickly, as he walks off toward the exit. \u201cAnd. . and thanks. Thanks a lot.\u201d</p> <p>As he disappears, I sink down onto a nearby chair. I can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019ve just had a pleasant, civilized conversation with Derek Smeath. With Derek Smeath! And actually, he seems quite a sweetheart. He\u2019s been so nice and kind to me, and his daughter works in television. . I mean, who knows, maybe I\u2019ll get to know her, too. Maybe I\u2019ll become friends with the whole family. Wouldn\u2019t that be great?

What about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought you did tremendously well today,\u201d says Zelda, crossing one jeaned leg over the other. \u201cTremendously well. I\u2019ve spoken to Emma and Rory and our senior producer\u201d\u2014she pauses for effect\u2014\u201cand they\u2019d all like to see you back on the show.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at her in disbelief. \u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every week,\u201d says Zelda. \u201cBut fairly regularly.

I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say dazedly. \u201cI expect it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d says Zelda. \u201cWe could probably plug your magazine as well, keep them happy.\u201d She scribbles something on a piece of paper and looks up. \u201cNow, you don\u2019t have an agent, do you? So I\u2019ll have to talk money directly with you.\u201d She pauses, and looks down at her clipboard. \u201cWhat we\u2019re offering, per slot, is\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-three</p><p>I PUT MY KEY in the lock and slowly open the door of the flat. It seems like about a million years since I was here last, and I feel like a completely different person. I\u2019ve grown up. Or changed. Or something.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say cautiously into the silence, and drop my bag onto the floor. \u201cIs anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex!\u201d gasps Suze, appearing at the door of the sitting room. She\u2019s wearing tight black leggings and holding a half-made denim photograph frame in one hand. \u201cOh my God! Where\u2019ve you been? What have you been doing? I saw you on Morning Coffee and I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes! I tried to phone in and speak to you, but they said I had to have a financial problem. So I said, OK, how should I invest half a million? but they said that wasn\u2019t really. .\u201d She breaks off. \u201cBex, what happened?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply straight away. My attention has been grabbed by the pile of letters addressed to me on the table. White, official-looking envelopes, brown window envelopes, envelopes marked menacingly \u201cFinal Reminder.\u201d The scariest pile of letters you\u2019ve ever seen.</p> <p>Except somehow. . they don\u2019t seem quite so scary anymore.</p><p>\u201cI was at my parents\u2019 house,\u201d I say, looking up. \u201cAnd then I was on television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I phoned your parents! They said they didn\u2019t know where you were!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, flushing slightly. \u201cThey were. . protecting me from a stalker.\u201d I look up, to see Suze staring at me in utter incomprehension. Which I suppose is fair enough. \u201cAnyway,\u201d I add defensively, \u201cI left you a message on the machine, saying not to worry, I was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d wails Suze, \u201cbut that\u2019s what they always do in films. And it means the baddies have got you and you\u2019ve got a gun jammed against your head. Honestly, I thought you were dead! I thought you were, like, cut up into a million pieces somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I look at her face again. She isn\u2019t kidding, she really was worried. I feel awful. I should never have vanished like that. It was completely thoughtless and irresponsible and selfish.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Suze.\u201d On impulse, I hurry forward and hug her tightly. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I never meant to worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d says Suze, hugging me back. \u201cI was worried for a bit \u2014 but then I knew you must be all right when I saw you on the telly. You were fantastic, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, a tiny smile flickering round the corners of my mouth. \u201cDid you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d says Suze. \u201cMuch better than whatshisface. Luke Brandon. God, he\u2019s arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say after a tiny pause. \u201cYes, I suppose he is. But he was actually quite nice to me afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Suze indifferently. \u201cWell, you were brilliant, anyway. Do you want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove some,\u201d I say, and she disappears into the kitchen.</p><p>I pick up my letters and bills and begin slowly to leaf through them. Once upon a time, this lot would have sent me into a blind panic. In fact, they would have gone straight into the bin, unread. But you know what? Today I don\u2019t feel a flicker of fear. Honestly, how could I have been so silly about my financial affairs? How could I have been so cowardly? This time I\u2019m just going to face up to them properly. I\u2019m going to sit down with my checkbook and my latest bank statements, and sort methodically through the whole mess.</p> <p>Staring at the clutch of envelopes in my hand, I feel suddenly very grown-up and responsible. Farsighted and sensible. I\u2019m going to sort my life out and keep my finances in order from now on. I\u2019ve completely and utterly changed my attitude toward money.</p><p>Plus. .</p><p>OK, I wasn\u2019t actually going to tell you this. But Morning Coffee is paying me absolute loads. Loads.

Finally, finally my life is going to be sorted.</p><p>\u201cSo, why did you just disappear like that?\u201d asks Suze, coming back out of the kitchen and making me jump. \u201cWhat was wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d I say with a sigh, putting the letters back down on the hall table. \u201cI just had to get away and think.

Has he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not that keen on Tarkie,\u201d says Suze wistfully, \u201cbut I think he still really likes you. He came round a couple of nights ago and left you this letter.\u201d</p><p>She gestures to a cream envelope stuck in the mirror. With slightly trembling hands I take it. Oh God, what\u2019s he going to say? I hesitate, then rip it open, and a ticket falls onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cThe opera!\u201d says Suze, picking it up. \u201cDay after tomorrow.\u201d She looks up. \u201cGod, it\u2019s lucky you came back, Bex.\u201d My dear Rebecca, I\u2019m reading incredulously. Forgive my reticence in contacting you before. But the more I think about it, the more I realize how much I enjoyed our evening together and how much I would like to repeat it.I enclose a ticket for Die Meistersinger at the Opera House. I shall be attending in any case and if you were able to join me, I would be delighted.Yours very sincerely,Tarquin Cleath-Stuart.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex, you must go!\u201d says Suze, reading over my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go. He\u2019ll be devastated if you don\u2019t. I really think he likes you.\u201d</p> <p>I look at the ticket, for two nights\u2019 time. \u201cGala Performance,\u201d it says, and I feel a sudden excitement. I\u2019ve never been to an opera gala! I could wear that divine Ghost dress which I\u2019ve never had a chance to wear, and I could put my hair up, and meet lots of amazing people. .</p><p>And then, abruptly, I stop. However much fun it would be \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be fair or honest to go. I\u2019ve hurt Tarquin enough.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go, Suze,\u201d I say, thrusting the letter down. \u201cI\u2019ve. . I\u2019ve got plans that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about poor Tarkie?\u201d says Suze, crestfallen. \u201cHe\u2019s so keen on you. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, and take a deep breath. \u201cBut I\u2019m not keen on him. I\u2019m really sorry, Suze. . but that\u2019s the truth. If I could change the way I felt. .\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence.</p> <p>\u201cOh well,\u201d says Suze at last. \u201cNever mind. You can\u2019t help it.\u201d She disappears into the kitchen and emerges a minute later with two mugs of coffee. \u201cSo,\u201d she says, handing me one, \u201cwhat are you up to tonight? Shall we go out together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t,\u201d I say, and clear my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve got a business meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suze pulls a face. \u201cWhat a bummer!\u201d She sips at her coffee and leans against the door frame. \u201cWho on earth has business meetings in the evening, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s. . it\u2019s with Luke Brandon,\u201d I say, trying to sound unconcerned. But it\u2019s no good, I can feel myself starting to blush.</p><p>\u201cLuke Brandon?\u201d says Suze puzzledly. \u201cBut what\u2014\u201d She stares at me, and her expression slowly changes. \u201cOh no. Bex! Don\u2019t tell me. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a business meeting,\u201d I say, avoiding her eye. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Two businesspeople meeting up and talking about business. In a. . in a business situation. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>And I hurry off to my room.</p><p>Business meeting. Clothes for a business meeting. OK, let\u2019s have a look.</p> <p>I pull all my outfits out of the wardrobe and lay them on the bed. Blue suit, black suit, pink suit. Hopeless. Pinstriped suit? Hmm. Maybe overdoing it. Cream suit. . too weddingy. Green suit. . isn\u2019t that bad luck or something?</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to wear?\u201d says Suze, looking in through my open bedroom door. \u201cAre you going to buy something new?\u201d Her face lights up. \u201cHey, shall we go shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d I say distractedly. \u201cAhm. . maybe.\u201d</p><p>Somehow today. .

You\u2019re so. . different. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d I reach for a white shirt and smile at her. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>It takes me all afternoon to decide on an outfit. There\u2019s a lot of trying on, and mixing and matching, and suddenly remembering things at the back of my wardrobe. (I must wear those purple jeans sometime.) But eventually I go for simple and straightforward. My nicest black suit (Jigsaw sale, two years ago), a white T-shirt (M&amp;S), and knee-high black suede boots (Dolce &amp; Gabbana, but I told Mum they were from BHS. Which was a mistake, because then she wanted to get some for herself, and I had to pretend they\u2019d all sold out). I put it all on, screw my hair up into a knot, and stare at myself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d says Suze admiringly from the door. \u201cVery sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy?\u201d I feel a pang of dismay. \u201cI\u2019m not going for sexy! I\u2019m going for businesslike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you be both at once?\u201d suggests Suze. \u201cBusinesslike and sexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . no,\u201d I say after a pause, and look away. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want Luke Brandon to think I\u2019ve dressed up for him, is what I really mean. I don\u2019t want to give him the slightest chance to think I\u2019ve misconstrued what this meeting is about. Not like last time.</p><p>With no warning, a surge of fresh humiliation goes through my body as I remember that awful moment in Harvey Nichols. I shake my head hard, trying to clear it; trying to calm myself. Why the hell did I agree to this bloody dinner, anyway?</p><p>\u201cI just want to look as serious and businesslike as possible,\u201d I say, and frown sternly at my reflection.</p><p>\u201cI know, then,\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou need some accessories. Some businesswoman-type accessories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? A Filofax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike. .\u201d Suze pauses thoughtfully. \u201cOK. Wait there\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I arrive at the Ritz that evening five minutes after our agreed time of seventy-thirty, and as I reach the entrance to the restaurant, I see Luke there already, sitting back looking relaxed and sipping something that looks like a gin and tonic. He\u2019s wearing a different suit from the one he was wearing this morning, I can\u2019t help noticing, and he\u2019s put on a fresh, dark green shirt. He actually looks. . Well. Quite nice. Quite good-looking.</p><p>Not that businessy, in fact.</p><p>And, come to think of it, this restaurant isn\u2019t very businessy, either. It\u2019s all chandeliers and gold garlands and soft pink chairs, and the most beautiful painted ceiling, all clouds and flowers. The whole place is sparkling with light, and it looks. .</p><p>Well, actually, the word that springs to mind is romantic.</p><p>Oh God. My heart starts thumping with nerves, and I glance quickly at my reflection in a gilded mirror. I\u2019m wearing the black Jigsaw suit and white T-shirt and black suede boots as originally planned. But now I also have a crisp copy of the Financial Times under one arm, a pair of tortoiseshell glasses (with clear glass) perched on my head, my clunky executive briefcase in one hand and \u2014 Suze\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance \u2014 an AppleMac laptop in the other.</p><p>Maybe I overdid it.</p><p>I\u2019m about to back away and see if I can quickly deposit the briefcase in the cloakroom (or, to be honest, just put it down on a chair and walk away), when Luke looks up, sees me, and smiles. Damn. So I\u2019m forced to go forward over the plushy carpet, trying to look as relaxed as possible, even though one arm is clamped tightly to my side, to stop the FT from falling on the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d says Luke as I arrive at the table. He stands up to greet me, and I realize that I can\u2019t shake his hand, because I\u2019m holding the laptop. Flustered, I plunk my briefcase on the floor, transfer the laptop to the other side \u2014 nearly dropping the FT as I do so \u2014 and, with as much poise as possible, hold out my hand.</p><p>A flicker of amusement passes over Luke\u2019s face and he solemnly shakes it. He gestures to a chair, and watches politely as I put the laptop on the tablecloth, all ready for use.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an impressive machine,\u201d he says. \u201cVery. . high tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, and give him a brief, cool smile. \u201cI often use it to take notes at business meetings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Luke, nodding. \u201cVery organized of you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s obviously waiting for me to switch it on, so experimentally I press the return key. This, according to Suze, should make the screen spring to life. But nothing happens.</p><p>Casually I press the key again \u2014 and still nothing. I jab at it, pretending my finger slipped by accident \u2014 and still nothing. Shit, this is embarrassing. Why do I ever listen to Suze?</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say at once, and snap the lid shut. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve just\u2014 On second thought, I won\u2019t use it today.\u201d I reach into my bag for a notebook. \u201cI\u2019ll jot my notes down in here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d says Luke mildly. \u201cWould you like some champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, slightly thrown. \u201cWell. . OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI hoped you would.\u201d</p><p>He glances up, and a beaming waiter scurries forward with a bottle. Gosh, Krug.</p><p>But I\u2019m not going to smile, or look pleased or anything. I\u2019m going to stay thoroughly cool and professional. In fact, I\u2019m only going to have one glass, before moving on to still water. I need to keep a clear head, after all.</p><p>While the waiter fills my champagne flute, I write down \u201cMeeting between Rebecca Bloomwood and Luke Brandon\u201d in my notebook. I look at it appraisingly, then underline it twice. There. That looks very efficient.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say, looking up, and raise my glass. \u201cTo business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo business,\u201d echoes Luke, and gives a wry smile. \u201cAssuming I\u2019m still in business, that is. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say anxiously. \u201cYou mean \u2014 after what you said on Morning Coffee? Has it gotten you into trouble?\u201d</p><p>He nods and I feel a pang of sympathy for him.</p><p>I mean, Suze is right \u2014 Luke is pretty arrogant. But I actually thought it was really good of him to stick out his neck like that and say publicly what he really thought about Flagstaff Life. And now, if he\u2019s going to be ruined as a result. . well, it just seems all wrong.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost. . everything?\u201d I say quietly, and Luke laughs.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far. But we\u2019ve had to do an awful lot of explaining to our other clients this afternoon.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cIt has to be said, insulting one of your major clients on live television isn\u2019t exactly normal PR practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think they should respect you!\u201d I retort. \u201cFor actually saying what you think! I mean, so few people do that these days. It could be like. . your company motto: \u2018We tell the truth.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>I take a gulp of champagne and look up into silence. Luke\u2019s gazing at me, a quizzical expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, you have the uncanniest knack of hitting the nail right on the head,\u201d he says at last. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what some of our clients have said. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve given ourselves a seal of integrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, feeling rather pleased with myself. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good. So you\u2019re not ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ruined,\u201d agrees Luke, and gives a little smile. \u201cJust slightly dented.\u201d</p><p>A waiter appears from nowhere and replenishes my glass, and I take a sip. When I look up, Luke\u2019s staring at me again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Rebecca, you\u2019re an extremely perceptive person,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see what other people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well.\u201d I wave my champagne glass airily. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear Zelda? I\u2019m \u2018finance guru meets girl next door.\u2019 \u201d I meet his eye and we both start to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re informative meets approachable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowledgeable meets down-to-earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re intelligent meets charming, meets bright, meets. .\u201d Luke tails off, staring down into his drink, then looks up.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, I want to apologize,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to apologize for a while. That lunch in Harvey Nichols. . you were right. I didn\u2019t treat you with the respect you deserved. The respect you deserve.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He breaks off into silence and I stare down at the tablecloth, feeling hot with indignation. It\u2019s all very well for him to say this now, I\u2019m thinking furiously. It\u2019s all very well for him to book a table at the Ritz and order champagne and expect me to smile and say \u201cOh, that\u2019s OK.\u201d But underneath all the bright banter, I still feel wounded by that whole episode.</p><p>\u201cMy piece in The Daily World had nothing to do with that lunch,\u201d I say without looking up. \u201cNothing. And for you to insinuate that it did. .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Luke, and sighs. \u201cI should never have said that. It was a. . a defensive, angry remark on a day when, frankly, you had us all on the hop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I can\u2019t help a pleased little smile coming to my lips. \u201cI had you all on the hop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d says Luke. \u201cA whole page in The Daily World on one of our clients, completely out of the blue?\u201d</p><p>Ha. I quite like that idea, actually. The whole of Brandon C thrown into disarray by Janice and Martin Webster.</p><p>\u201cWas Alicia on the hop?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cShe was hopping as fast as her Pradas would let her,\u201d says Luke drily. \u201cEven faster when I discovered she\u2019d actually spoken to you the day before.\u201d</p><p>Ha!</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I hear myself saying childishly \u2014 then wish I hadn\u2019t. Top businesswomen don\u2019t gloat over their enemies being told off. I should have simply nodded, or said \u201cAh\u201d meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cSo, did I have you on the hop, too?\u201d I say, giving a careless little shrug.</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and after a while I look up. Luke\u2019s gazing at me with an unsmiling expression, which makes me feel suddenly light-headed and breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had me on the hop for quite a while, Rebecca,\u201d he says quietly. He holds my eyes for a few seconds while I stare back, unable to move \u2014 then looks down at his menu. \u201cShall we order?\u201d</p><p>The meal seems to go on all night. We talk and talk and eat, and talk, and eat some more. The food is so delicious I can\u2019t say no to anything, and the wine is so delicious I abandon my plan of drinking a businesslike single glass. By the time I\u2019m toying listlessly with chocolate feulliantine, lavender honey ice cream, and caramelized pears, it\u2019s about midnight, and my head is starting to droop.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the chocolate thing?\u201d says Luke, finishing a mouthful of cheesecake.</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d I say, and push it toward him. \u201cNot as good as the lemon mousse, though.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the other thing \u2014 I\u2019m absolutely stuffed to the brim. I couldn\u2019t decide between all the scrummy-sounding desserts, so Luke said we should order all the ones we liked the sound of. Which was most of them. So now my stomach feels as though it\u2019s the size of a Christmas pudding, and just as heavy.</p><p>I honestly feel as if I\u2019ll never ever be able to get out of this chair. It\u2019s so comfortable, and I\u2019m so warm and cozy, and it\u2019s all so pretty, and my head\u2019s spinning just enough to make me not want to stand up. Plus. . I don\u2019t want it all to stop. I don\u2019t want the evening to end. I\u2019ve had such a good time. The amazing thing is how much Luke makes me laugh. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be all serious and boring and intellectual, but really, he\u2019s not. In fact, come to think of it, we haven\u2019t talked about that unit trust thingy once.</p><p>A waiter comes and clears away all our pudding dishes, and brings us each a cup of coffee. I lean back in my chair, close my eyes, and take a few delicious sips. Oh God, I could stay here forever. I\u2019m actually feeling really sleepy by now \u2014 partly because I was so nervous last night about Morning Coffee, I hardly slept at all.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d I say eventually, and force myself to open my eyes. \u201cI should go back to. .\u201d Where do I live, again? \u201cFulham. To Fulham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Luke after a pause, and takes a sip of coffee. He puts his cup down and reaches for the milk. And as he does so, his hand brushes against mine \u2014 and stops still. At once I feel my whole body stiffen. I can\u2019t even blink, in case I break the spell.</p><p>OK, I\u2019ll admit it \u2014 I kind of put my hand in his way.</p><p>Just to see what would happen. I mean, he could easily move his hand back if he wanted to, couldn\u2019t he? Pour his milk, make a joke, say good-night.</p> <p>But he doesn\u2019t. Very slowly, he closes his hand over mine.</p><p>And now I really can\u2019t move. His thumb starts to trace patterns on my wrist, and I can feel how warm and dry his skin is. I look up and meet his gaze, and feel a little jolt inside me. I can\u2019t tear my eyes away from his. I can\u2019t move my hand. I\u2019m completely transfixed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat chap I saw you with in Terrazza,\u201d he says after a while, his thumb still drawing leisurely pictures on my skin. \u201cWas he anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust. . you know.\u201d I try to give a careless laugh, but I\u2019m feeling so nervous it comes out as a squeak. \u201cSome multimillionaire or other.\u201d</p><p>Luke stares intently at me for a second, then looks away.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, as though closing the subject. \u201cWell. Perhaps we should get you a taxi.\u201d I feel a thud of disappointment, and try not to let it show. \u201cOr maybe. .\u201d He stops.</p> <p>There\u2019s an endless pause. I can\u2019t quite breathe. Maybe what? What?</p><p>\u201cI know them pretty well here,\u201d says Luke at last. \u201cIf we wanted to. .\u201d He meets my eyes. \u201cI expect we could stay.\u201d</p><p>I feel an electric shock go through my body.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to?\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak, I nod my head.</p> <p>\u201cOK, wait here,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019ll go and see if I can get rooms.\u201d He gets up and I stare after him in a daze, my hand all cold and bereft.</p><p>Rooms. Rooms, plural. So he didn\u2019t mean\u2014</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to\u2014</p><p>Oh God. What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>We travel up in the lift in silence with a smart porter. I glance a couple of times at Luke\u2019s face, but he\u2019s staring impassively ahead. In fact, he\u2019s barely said a word since he went off to ask about staying. I feel a bit chilly inside \u2014 in fact, to be honest, I\u2019m half wishing they hadn\u2019t had any spare rooms for us after all. But it turns out there was a big cancellation tonight \u2014 and it also turns out that Luke is some big-shot client of the Ritz. When I commented on how nice they were being to us, he shrugged and said he often puts up business contacts here.</p><p>Business contacts. So is that what I am? Oh, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. I wish I\u2019d gone home after all.</p> <p>We walk along an opulent corridor in complete silence \u2014 then the porter swings open a door and ushers us into a spectacularly beautiful room, furnished with a big double bed and plushy chairs. He places my briefcase and AppleMac on the luggage rail, then Luke gives him a bill and he disappears.</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward pause.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Luke. \u201cHere you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say in a voice which doesn\u2019t sound like mine. \u201cThanks. . thank you. And for dinner.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d</p><p>We seem to have turned into complete strangers.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Luke again, and glances at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s late. You\u2019ll probably be wanting to. .\u201d He stops, and there\u2019s a sharp, waiting silence.</p><p>My hands are twisted in a nervous knot. I don\u2019t dare look at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be off, then,\u201d says Luke at last. \u201cI hope you have a\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d I hear myself say, and blush furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t go yet. We could just. .\u201d I swallow. \u201cTalk, or something.\u201d</p><p>I look up and meet his eyes, and something fearful starts to pound within me. Slowly he walks toward me, until he\u2019s standing just in front of me. I can just smell the scent of his aftershave and hear the crisp cotton rustle of his shirt as he moves. My whole body\u2019s prickling with anticipation. Oh God, I want to touch him. But I daren\u2019t. I daren\u2019t move anything.</p><p>\u201cWe could just talk, or something,\u201d he echoes, and slowly lifts his hands until they cup my face.</p><p>And then he kisses me.</p><p>His mouth is on mine, gently parting my lips, and I feel a white-hot dart of excitement. His hands are running down my back and cupping my bottom, fingering under the hem of my skirt. And then he pulls me tightly toward him, and suddenly I\u2019m finding it hard to breathe.</p><p>It\u2019s pretty obvious we\u2019re not going to do much talking at all.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>MMM.</p><p>Bliss.</p><p>Lying in the most comfortable bed in the world, feeling all dreamy and smiley and happy, letting the morning sunlight play on my closed eyelids. Stretching my arms above my head, then collapsing contentedly onto an enormous mound of pillows. Oh, I feel good. I feel. . sated. Last night was absolutely. .</p><p>Well, let\u2019s just say it was. .</p><p>Oh, come on. You don\u2019t need to know that. Anyway, can\u2019t you use your imagination? Of course you can.</p><p>I open my eyes, sit up, and reach for my cup of room-service coffee. Luke\u2019s in the shower, so it\u2019s just me alone with my thoughts. And I don\u2019t want to sound all pretentious here \u2014 but I do feel this is a pretty significant day in my life.</p><p>It\u2019s not just Luke \u2014 although the whole thing was. . well, amazing, actually.

Not the point. The point is, it\u2019s not just Luke, and it\u2019s not just my new job with Morning Coffee (even though every time I remember it, I feel a leap of disbelieving joy).</p><p>No, it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s that I feel like a completely new person. I feel as though I\u2019m moving on to a new stage in life \u2014 with a different outlook, and different priorities. When I look back at the frivolous way I used to think \u2014 well, it makes me want to laugh, really. The new Rebecca is so much more levelheaded. So much more responsible. It\u2019s as though the tinted glasses have fallen off \u2014 and suddenly I can see what\u2019s really important in the world and what\u2019s not.</p><p>I\u2019ve even been thinking this morning that I might go into politics or something. Luke and I discussed politics a bit last night, and I have to say, I came up with lots of interesting views. I could be a young, intellectual member of parliament, and be interviewed about lots of important issues on television. I\u2019d probably specialize in health, or education, or something like that. Maybe foreign affairs.</p><p>Casually I reach for the remote control and switch on the television, thinking I might watch the news. I flick a few times, trying to find BBC1, but the TV seems stuck on rubbish cable channels. Eventually I give up, leave it on something called QVT or something, and lean back down on my pillows.</p> <p>The truth, I think, taking a sip of coffee, is that I\u2019m quite a serious-minded person. That\u2019s probably why Luke and I get on so well.</p><p>Mmm, Luke. Mmm, that\u2019s a nice thought. I wonder where he is.</p><p>I sit up in bed, and am just considering going into the bathroom to surprise him, when a woman\u2019s voice from the television attracts my attention.</p><p>\u201c. . offering genuine NK Malone sunglasses, in tortoiseshell, black, and white, with that distinctive NKM logo in brushed chrome.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s interesting, I think idly. NK Malone sunglasses. I\u2019ve always quite wanted a pair of those.</p> <p>\u201cBuy all three pairs. .\u201d the woman pauses \u201c. . and pay not \u00a3400. Not \u00a3300. But \u00a3200! A saving of at least 40 percent off the recommended retail price.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the screen, riveted.</p><p>But this is incredible. Incredible. Do you know how much NK Malone sunglasses usually cost? At least 140 quid. Each! Which means you\u2019re saving. .</p><p>\u201cSend no money now,\u201d the woman is saying. \u201cSimply call this number. .\u201d</p><p>Excitedly I scrabble for the notebook on my bedside table and scribble down the number. This is an absolute dream come true. NK Malone sunglasses. I can\u2019t quite believe it. And three pairs! I\u2019ll never have to buy sunglasses again. People will call me the Girl in the NK Malone Shades. (And those Armani ones I bought last year are all wrong now. Completely out of date.) Oh, this is such an investment. With shaking hands I reach for the phone and dial the number.</p><p>And then I stop.</p> <p>Wait just a moment. The new Rebecca has more self-control than this. The new Rebecca isn\u2019t even interested in fashion.</p><p>Slowly I put the phone down. I reach for the remote and zap the TV to a different channel. A nature program. Yes, that\u2019s more like it. There\u2019s a close-up of a tiny green frog and a sober voice-over talking about the effect of drought on the ecosystem. I turn up the volume and settle back, pleased with myself. This is much more me. I\u2019m not going to give those sunglasses a second thought. I\u2019m going to learn about this tiny frog and the ecosystem, and global warming. Maybe Luke and I will talk about all these important issues, over breakfast.</p><p>NK Malone.</p><p>Stop it. Stop it. Watch the frog, and that tiny red beetle thing. .</p><p>I\u2019ve wanted NK Malone sunglasses for so long. And \u00a3200 is amazing value for three pairs.</p><p>I could always give one pair away as a present.</p><p>And I deserve a little treat, don\u2019t I? After everything I\u2019ve been though? Just one little final luxury and that\u2019s the end. I promise.</p><p>Grabbing the phone, I redial the number. I give my name and address, thank the woman very much indeed, then put down the receiver, a content smile on my face. This day is turning out perfect. And it\u2019s only nine o\u2019clock!</p> <p>I turn off the nature program, snuggle back down under the covers, and close my eyes. Maybe Luke and I will spend all day here, in this lovely room. Maybe we\u2019ll have oysters and champagne sent up. (I hope not, actually, because I hate oysters.) Maybe we\u2019ll. .</p><p>Nine o\u2019clock, interrupts a little voice in my mind. I frown for a second, shake my head, then turn over to get rid of it. But it\u2019s still there, prodding annoyingly at my thoughts.</p><p>Nine o\u2019clock. Nine. .</p><p>And suddenly I sit bolt upright in bed, my eyes wide in dismay. Oh my God.</p><p>Nine-thirty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Derek Smeath.</p><p>I promised to be there.

If I got dressed as quickly as possible, and ran downstairs and jumped in a taxi \u2014 I might just make it. Fulham\u2019s not that far away.

OK, quick, I tell myself. What am I doing to do? Am I going to get dressed and go? Am I going to make the meeting?</p><p>But my hand\u2019s already reaching for my bag as though it\u2019s got a will of its own; I\u2019m pulling out a business card and punching a number into the phone.</p><p>Because, I mean, we don\u2019t actually need to have a meeting, do we?
