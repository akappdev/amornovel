Among the deserted streets and the canyons of tall buildings; the sound seemed to echo from everywhere.</p> <p>The night was extremely dark, and, Ginger Rockford thought, you would have believed that the streets were lit by centuries-old gas lamps, as they\u2019d supposedly been during the filming that day.</p><p>A hot afternoon had turned into a chilly, misty night, and a fog was rolling in from the river.</p><p>The area seemed ridiculously quiet\u2014except for that sound she heard now and then, a click-click, like a footfall, and then a shuffling noise, as if her stalker dragged a foot.</p><p>Great. Chased through the streets by a gimp.</p><p>It was New York City, for God\u2019s sake. Millions lived on this tiny island.</p> <p>So where the hell were they all now?</p><p>Ginger turned around to look back in the direction from which she had come. She could still see the row of trailers on Whitehall Street; she had just left one. Sammy Vintner, fat-old-ex-cop studio guard, was still on duty, but she saw that he was on the phone.</p><p>He was the only living soul she saw.</p><p>There were markers where the tape had been that had held the crowd back during the day, separating the filmmakers from the plebs hoping to catch a glimpse of megastar Bobby Walden.</p><p>She cursed Bobby Walden. While she\u2019d waited, believing that he was really going to call her, Bobby had surely been picked up by a big black limousine.</p><p>Bobby was a somebody. She was a nobody.</p> <p>But at least Bobby had spoken to her. The female lead, Sherry Blanco, had almost knocked her over, and she hadn\u2019t even apologized. Well, maybe Sherry would learn. Ginger had done a lot of studying up on actors and their careers. She estimated that Sherry Blanco had about three years left\u2014she was nearly thirty-five, and it was starting to show. Sherry was pretty, but she couldn\u2019t really act. Nor had she been known for any kindness to the young hopefuls with whom she had worked. Ginger hoped with her whole heart that she might be a rising star when Sherry was a burned-out has-been.</p><p>At least Angus Avery, the up-and-coming director, had noticed her. Okay, so his words weren\u2019t every girl\u2019s dream. \u201cPerfect! I mean, damn, do you look the role of the immigrant prostitute, her dreams already vanquished!\u201d That was how she had gotten to be the one on Bobby\u2019s arm, and how she had managed to flirt with him.</p><p>And then he had said that they needed to hook up, and taken her phone number.</p><p>So she had sat in the trailer well past time to leave; Missy Everett and Jane Deaver\u2014who had played the other two young prostitutes in the scene\u2014had begged her to leave with them. Their day of extra-stardom was over. They should celebrate, and wonder if they\u2019d wind up on the cutting-room floor.</p><p>She, like a fool, had refused to leave; she\u2019d been waiting for Bobby. And she should have left. The set was a construction site. The ugly old building that had been there had been razed to the foundations and a few structural walls. There were rumors about the site; bad things had happened there. She didn\u2019t really know what\u2014she wasn\u2019t into history. Maybe it had been an old burial ground. But it had been perfect for the set designers when they had installed their prefabricated backdrops and facades, and it had been right next to Blair House, a truly creepy old place. She hadn\u2019t been spooked during the day. The day had been chaotic with actors and crew, one shot being set up while another was being shot, sometimes over and over again if Avery didn\u2019t like the lighting or the camera angle.</p><p>How had she managed to be the very last one on set? Oh, yes, waiting and praying that Bobby would really call her.</p><p>Sammy had emerged from his guard post. \u201cHey!\u201d she called back, hoping that he would pay attention, see her and wait for her to come running back. She\u2019d even take a ride with disgusting fat Sammy at this point.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking her direction. He was going off duty, heading away from her. She should have accepted a ride from him when he\u2019d offered, but she\u2019d been convinced she\u2019d find a taxi right away.</p> <p>Who the hell knew that the area dried up like a prune once it got late at night?</p><p>The guard disappeared behind one of the trailers; he\u2019d been anxious for her to go, of course, once she\u2019d refused to ride with him. She\u2019d been the last one near the trailers, the only one left who had been working on the on-location day-plus shoot for O\u2019Leary\u2019s, a tale about crime and prostitution in the eighteen hundreds in New York City. One of the pubs in the area had had the right interior, and the buildings\u2014except for the gap where the old Darby Building had so recently stood\u2014were perfect. The gutted area and the work tents set up on the old site were shielded by a blue screen for the moviemaking; New York was not a city to make do without the income a permit for such work would secure for the city. Nor, with the preservationist-supporting liberals to be found in the area, could a recently discovered historic site be disturbed.</p><p>Even so, the area around the demolished building was surrounded by cheap wire fencing that any schoolboy could scale, and closed by a gate with a two-bit combination lock. It looked like a war zone in a third world country.</p><p>She was beyond it, though, and she hurried; the gaping hole in the landscape seemed alive, mocking her for her fear of darkness and shadows.</p><p>Now she cursed Bobby Walden. Megastar\u2014jerk!</p><p>So, maybe, she had been too easy, too wide-eyed and too hopeful. But he\u2019d really been into her during the shoot; he\u2019d whispered such cool stuff to her between takes that day. She was ready; she knew how to get her name in the paper, and how to move ahead. In film, in the real world, perception was everything. She wasn\u2019t a fool; she didn\u2019t expect a happy-ever-after with Bobby Walden. Just a date\u2014or a night in his hotel room, a place she could pretend to slip out of while being sure that she was spotted by the media. That was all she needed. Her picture on Page Six, maybe. People would start talking about her, and it would make it worthwhile that she\u2019d slept with the pimple-faced assistant at the casting agency to get the job as an extra\u2014a down-and-out historical hooker\u2014for the movie. And, she should still be glad, because she\u2019d wound up with a few lines, enough to quality for her SAG card.</p><p>B movie. That was okay. Many a star had gotten his or her start as an extra-suddenly-given-lines. It took something like being singled out by Bobby Walden to get noticed.</p><p>\u201cHey! Hey, Sammy!\u201d she called, walking back toward the site and Sammy. But Sammy didn\u2019t appear from behind the trailer that was just about two blocks away now. He had to have heard her, but even if she ran, she\u2019d never catch him. \u201cSammy! You fat ass!\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Sammy was gone. Probably down in the useless-to-her Whitehall subway station already.</p><p>She thought she saw a man; a different man standing by the trailers. He must have been an actor; he seemed to be wearing a stovepipe hat and a long black all-encompassing coat. Whoever it was would be in big trouble with the costume department.</p><p>The moon shifted; there was no man standing there. She was making herself bizarrely nervous; it was simply because she\u2019d never imagined that anywhere in New York could become so devoid of people.</p><p>She turned and retraced her steps. If she reached Broadway and started running...</p><p>She was almost at the corner when she heard the noise again. Click-click-drag.</p><p>Was it coming from behind her? Or before her?</p><p>She turned the corner and screamed; there was a man standing there. He looked dazed. He was in dirty jeans, a dirtier denim jacket. He hadn\u2019t shaved in days, and his hair was tangled and greasy.</p><p>\u201cHey, lady, you got a dollar? Just a dollar\u2014or some change? Anything\u2014a quarter?\u201d He took a step toward her with his hand outstretched, and she suddenly knew the direction from which the click-click-drag had come. She could smell him; he was absolutely repulsive.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried. \u201cGet away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, I\u2019m just a vet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just an alcoholic or a junkie\u2014and you\u2019re disgusting! Take a bath!\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t even want to touch him to shove him in the chest, but she did so. She was desperate to get past him.</p><p>He fell against the wall of the building she was passing. She didn\u2019t look to see what type of office it was; she hurried on for a block, turned around. The ratty old homeless man was gone.</p><p>She leaned against a railing where she had stopped, panting, to stare back hard. She wanted to make sure that he was gone\u2014really gone. She needed to get a hold of her fear. As soon as she got a little bit farther up Broadway, she\u2019d start to see people. Ha! Stalked by a derelict who would fall down in a breeze. Well, the louse-ridden bastard was gone now. She kept looking down the street, making sure.</p><p>It was amazing; she could hear the traffic on West Street, albeit in the distance. Battery City was no more than a few blocks away. Wall Street was mobbed with cutthroat brokers during the day, and tourists thronged Trinity and St. Paul\u2019s. But now the streets were dead, as dead as those rotting in the old graves and tombs of the city\u2019s churches.</p><p>Yes, the derelict was gone, too.</p><p>She turned to hurry on up Broadway.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard a thing; she hadn\u2019t suspected anyone might be in front of her\u2014she had been looking behind, back to the dark abyss of the site.</p><p>Her turn brought her directly into his arms. Before she could open her mouth, his hand clamped over it, and he twisted her viciously around until she was flat against his body.</p><p>She tried to scream, but the sound was muffled by the gloved hand. She strained to see, to kick to fight...</p><p>She barely even felt the knife across her throat; the blade was that sharp and the slice he made was swift and hard and sure. She was aware that, as the blood began to flow, he dragged her. She saw the lights of the street.</p><p>Seeming as pale as old gas lamps.</p><p>As she died, the world growing dark and cold, she was dimly aware once again that it was all a matter of perception. Blood was rushing from her throat, and she was dying. She was even aware of the irony\u2014that she might become really famous at last.</p><p>Somewhere, not far, car horns blared, neon illuminated the city and millions of souls worked, played and slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But to Virginia Rockford, the world beyond was no longer of any consequence.</p><p>Her last vision was that of a shadow-man.</p><p>A man in a long black cape wearing a stovepipe hat. A shadow-man, coming at her again with the long wicked blade of his knife...</p> <p>But she felt no more. Death became a gentle blessing.</p><p>1</p><p>One great thing about New York City\u2014tourists.</p><p>And residents who behaved like tourists, every time he came to the scene of a murder.</p><p>Jude Crosby flashed his badge to the officers on duty and ducked beneath the yellow crime scene tape that was stretched across lower Broadway.</p> <p>The murder site had acquired more onlookers than a movie premiere. Traffic downtown had grown to a snarl that was just about impassable even with the extra traffic cops manning the detour, and the sound of cursing drivers threatened to drown out the sound of their horns.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only just dawn; most finance workers weren\u2019t even on their way in yet.</p><p>He made his way to the circle of men around the body. He was glad to see that the medical examiner who had been on call was Wally Fullbright, a man in his late fifties with ruffled white hair and big-rimmed glasses; he looked like an aged Beaker, from the Muppets. He was, in Jude\u2019s mind, the finest in his profession. Yet, he never considered his own expertise as the zenith of knowledge, and was known to probe to the depths of any anatomical mystery.</p><p>\u201cCrosby!\u201d Fullbright said, acknowledging Jude without looking up. He knew he had a distinctive height, and in his off-hours he practiced at the ring. Pounding away at punching bags helped him release the tension that often bubbled up after dealing with some of the more bizarre crimes that plagued the city.</p><p>Even then, he had to make his way through more men; officers had formed a curtain of bodies, hiding the corpse from the view of the crowd that looked on.</p><p>He quickly saw why.</p> <p>\u201cLord,\u201d he said quietly, hunkering down across the body from Fullbright.</p><p>He\u2019d seen a lot as a homicide detective in New York City. Dead drunks, prostitutes, drug addicts, mob hits and victims of domestic abuse. He\u2019d seen the derelicts who had died in Dumpsters, in alleys, atop mountains of trash and he\u2019d seen the floaters who had popped up in the East River and the Hudson.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen anything like this.</p><p>\u201cDo we know who she is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d one of the uniformed men\u2014Smith, according to his badge\u2014said. \u201cShe had her ID on her, in her bag. Found next to the body. Her name is Virginia Rockford, twenty-six years old. We believe that she was an actress working on location last night, but that fact still has to be verified. We formed ranks around her as fast as we could when we reached the scene. We called it in to Major Crimes because of...because of the way you see the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found her like this?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>The officer blushed and shook his head. \u201cThere were people coming around, staring. I threw the coat over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I carefully threw it off, again, in favor of the screen of blue,\u201d Fullbright said.</p> <p>Jude nodded. He understood. The black trench coat now at the victim\u2019s side had apparently belonged to Officer Smith.</p><p>He doubted Officer Smith would ever wear the coat again.</p><p>Smith shouldn\u2019t have changed the crime scene in any way, but, under the circumstances, Jude knew why he had felt compelled to do so\u2014even if the officer had known better.</p><p>He looked at Fullbright. \u201cTell me, please, that she wasn\u2019t\u2014gutted\u2014alive?\u201d</p><p>Fullbright shook his head, indicating the thick pool of blood at the victim\u2019s throat, and the way it had poured down the front of her dress. \u201cIt\u2019s my belief that she was seized, her mouth muffled, though God knows who might have heard her scream down here at night, and that her throat was slit ear to ear immediately. I think, and it\u2019s my theory, but, logical, if you will forgive me, that she was nabbed on the corner, and quickly dragged into the street as she died. There are two slashes, but I believe the first would have caused her to bleed out. The mutilation of the body occurred after death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen some bad ones in my day, but this seems exceptionally sick, don\u2019t you think, Detective Crosby?\u201d one of the other uniformed men asked.</p><p>\u201cThey come in very, very, very sick sometimes,\u201d Jude said quietly.</p><p>He looked at the victim again, feeling his own stomach curdling. There was bruising on her face, which might have come from a blow, or from the force the killer used to hold her while slashing her throat. Her legs were bent at the knees slightly, and falling outward in a sexually implicit line. Her stomach appeared to have been sliced deeply several times, but there was now such a mass of congealed blood and ragged flesh, there was little he could tell about any precise injury that had been done to her.</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been here?\u201d he asked Fullbright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m estimating time of death to be around eleven,\u201d the medical examiner told him. \u201cGive or take an hour.\u201d</p><p>Smith offered, \u201cI was on duty down here, Detective Crosby. I had just come on duty. I came running when I heard a woman screaming.\u201d He pulled out a pad and read from his notes, nodding toward a woman who was on the sidewalk, surrounded by officers. \u201cShe\u2019s Miss Dorothy Hannigan, and she runs the bakery on the corner. She came walking from the subway exit\u2014\u201d he pointed down the street \u201c\u2014and started screaming when she saw the body. I called in dispatch for help and they called you.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cIt was barely light... I thought she was a mannequin, a movie prop, at first.\u201d</p><p>Jude Crosby studied the body a moment longer; he wasn\u2019t sure it was necessary. The details seemed to be etched into his mind.</p><p>He was sure that Fullbright was right\u2014she had been nabbed while walking on the sidewalk, and dragged out to the road to die. He wondered how long, even with the light traffic at night, it had taken the bakery worker to discover the body. Time of death wasn\u2019t exact, and a number of cars had to have driven by at sometime.</p><p>He started to rise.</p><p>\u201cThe Ripper,\u201d Fullbright said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Jude looked over at the man he sincerely respected.</p><p>Fullbright looked at him and spoke dryly. \u201cJack the Ripper. London murderer of the late eighteen hundreds. Come on, Jude, you were sent to study criminal history and crime-fighting methods across the pond. The Ripper. Jack the Ripper. His first victim\u2014well, the first victim agreed upon by most criminal experts and Ripperologists\u2014was Polly Nichols. Found on August 31, 1888. She was found...just as we\u2019ve found this girl.\u201d</p><p>Officer Smith made a sound at the back of his throat. \u201cThat was well over a hundred years ago, Doctor. I doubt the same man could have killed this girl. And, hell, that was London, not New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne theory regarding the cessation of the murders after the Mary Kelly grand finale was that the bastard came to the United States,\u201d Fullbright said, looking at Jude.</p><p>Jude asked Fullbright, \u201cYou think we might have a whacked-out murderer who is also a Ripperologist\u2014one dedicated to the point of re-creating the crimes himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d Fullbright said. \u201cThey just got worse,\u201d he added softly. \u201cThe murders just became more and more vicious. Until Mary Kelly, and then...\u201d</p><p>And then...</p><p>Of course, no one knew what would happen next. Jude was far from a Ripperologist, but he\u2019d attended a lecture at a British forum on \u201cHistorical Crimes, Modern-day Solutions: Crimes That Would Have Been Solved in the Twenty-first Century.\u201d He knew that theories abounded. One was indeed the idea that the Ripper had come to the United States. But, of course, wherever he had gone\u2014to America, Africa, South America\u2014or hell itself\u2014that had been over a hundred years ago. And Jude didn\u2019t believe that he was a Freddy Krueger-type monster who had returned to roam the streets.</p><p>And still, he felt a deep unease sweeping over him. Last week, they\u2019d found the remains of a girl in the Hudson; she was still a Jane Doe, but her throat had been slashed. A pleasure boater had reported the remains; police divers had brought her in. Two weeks before, there had been a victim who had died en route to the hospital without ever being able to speak or point a finger even vaguely in the direction of her attacker; she\u2019d been cut\u2014slashed and stabbed.</p><p>But not like this.</p><p>Not like this poor girl.</p><p>Probably a once pretty girl, who had been alive just last night. Filled with hopes and dreams. She might have been nice; she might have been a scrapper, one of the thousands of hopefuls who came to the big city each year to strike it rich in the Big Apple. The open chart of her life was closed, and it didn\u2019t matter if she\u2019d helped old ladies cross the street or snubbed the geeks who had stared at her when she had walked by, oblivious. No one deserved this kind of end.</p><p>He noted the position of her body, and that she had certainly been positioned and displayed; he was sure the killer had worn gloves, and been careful not to let his victim catch any skin cells in her fingernails. Still, there was always hope.</p><p>Jude stood up and started going through the initial motions. He ordered that his victim\u2019s hands be bagged in hopes she\u2019d gotten her nails into the bastard that had killed her somehow or somewhere, but he knew he didn\u2019t even have to say the words. Fullbright was on the case.</p><p>Photographs were taken of the body. He watched that procedure, making certain that the techs took every angle he might need.</p><p>He spoke to the uniformed officers on the street. Buildings were to be canvassed in hopes that someone had been somewhere doing something. The crime scene unit was called in to search the area for any possible minuscule clues.</p><p>Fullbright stood, giving additional orders to the officers and his assistant. He looked at Jude while the gurney and body bag were brought over, everyone there moving quickly and efficiently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re working alone on this?\u201d Fullbright asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a new partner yet. I haven\u2019t had anyone assigned to me since...since Monty took a bullet,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s having another surgery on Friday. They\u2019re hoping he\u2019ll walk again,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>He tried to keep his voice even, and free from the resentment he couldn\u2019t help but feel. Niles Monty had been doing the right thing\u2014he had been the perfect officer, trying to talk down the drugged-out vet who had just shot and killed his wife. His partner had been doing all the right things, and the soldier, in tears, was ready to hand his weapon over to Monty. Instead, a frightened vigilante neighbor who\u2019d snuck up the fire escape had taken a shot and missed; the frightened vet had fired at Monty, before turning the gun on himself.</p><p>Jude had been waiting quietly next to Monty who had been doing a damn good job talking the man down. He felt the bullet whistle by, but too late to stop the lethal action that had all taken place in less than ten seconds. He\u2019d managed to stanch the flow of blood emitting from his partner while praying for the medics to hurry.</p> <p>The vigilante was walking the streets, his case having been dismissed, portraying himself to the press as a hero. How he was managing that, since his actions had caused the crippling of a veteran cop with twenty years\u2019 experience and a slew of medals, Jude didn\u2019t know.</p><p>God, he hated the press.</p><p>And the press was going to have a field day with this.</p><p>He looked through the crowd of television vans and camera crews setting up near the scene. He noticed Melissa Banks, who tended to be a responsible newspaper journalist in a world where sensationalism had become everything.</p><p>He strode straight for her. \u201cMs. Banks,\u201d he said, acknowledging her. \u201cWe have found the body of a woman on Broadway, and look, I suppose that\u2019s evident, but it\u2019s all I can give you at the moment. Headquarters will make a statement later. Pending notification of next of kin, I can\u2019t release her name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying that her throat was slashed and that she was\u2014ripped to shreds. Do we have our own Jack the Ripper in the city now, Detective Crosby? A Jack the Slasher, as it were?\u201d Melissa asked him. He winced. His killer had a name now.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know if this was an isolated incident or not, Ms. Banks. As soon as we have information, we will certainly bring it to you in the best interest of the public. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me...?\u201d</p><p>The officers who had been first on the scene had done their best to keep the details hidden, but it was New York. People had seen. They\u2019d seen beyond the crime scene tape and the wall of bodies, and they had seen the amount of blood around the victim. People were going to talk; speculation would run high, and if his killer was a sensationalist trying to prove a point, he would be savoring the attention he was getting this very minute. He would be somewhere, watching, and gloating over his victory.</p><p>\u201cShould women in this vicinity be worried to walk about at night?\u201d Melissa Banks asked him.</p><p>He stared at her; she tended to be an intelligent woman. \u201cWomen should always be careful walking about at night. However, since the financial district is relatively quiet at night, yes, I would definitely take extra care.\u201d</p><p>One of the other reporters had heard his words and moved in. \u201cDid you just say that it\u2019s not safe to walk the streets at night?\u201d</p> <p>Jude stepped toward her. \u201cWhat I just said was that any single woman should take care at any time\u2014anywhere. Sadly, there is evil in this world, and there are those who will hurt others. I\u2019m suggesting women not be alone late at night on quiet streets. Period. I\u2019m also suggesting that journalists be responsible and not create panic where panic will avail no one. I\u2019m promoting common sense, and if you\u2019ll really excuse me now, I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Jude walked back to the body, and looked at the corner. He paused, and motioned to a crime scene tech, who hurried over. \u201cBlood, I\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d Jude told him, and the fellow nodded gravely and went to work. On the sidewalk, he found more drops of blood, and motioned as well.</p><p>A photographer followed the techs, taking pictures as they took samples of the substances on the ground.</p><p>He was certain that Fullbright had been right; his victim had been walking uptown, as if she was trying to find a busier spot on Broadway, perhaps to hail a cab. The assailant had waited for her on the corner behind the building. Jude didn\u2019t like his audience, though the uniforms were doing the best they could to control the scene. He was still downtown on a busy Monday morning, and blocking off an entire street in the vicinity of the stock market, city hall, Trinity, St. Paul\u2019s and the Woolworth Building was not easy. Still, he called one of the young officers over, took a position behind the first building and had the officer walk toward him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be seen until the last minute. When he stepped out, it was easy to accost the man, spin him around and ascertain that a strong man could have certainly caught a woman so; he would have had to have dragged her as she bled, and thus the trail to the street.</p><p>Why leave her in the street?</p><p>So she would be found, and found as she was.</p><p>He scanned the crowd, wondering if any of the men hovering about in their business suits, construction vests, chef\u2019s outfits, messenger tees or other attire might be a killer. He wouldn\u2019t be bloody anymore; he\u2019d be fitting in with the crowd.</p> <p>Jude walked down the sidewalk to where the bakery manager still stood, trembling with two officers. She was shaking badly.</p><p>Dorothy Hannigan was a woman with a thin face and thinner body; she obviously did not indulge frequently in her bakery\u2019s items. She looked at him with wide brown eyes and an expression that still denoted the horror of her discovery.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hannigan, I\u2019m Detective Jude Crosby. I know you\u2019ve already given the officers your statement, so I really just want to thank you for so quickly summoning help, and for all that you\u2019ve done to assist us in the investigation.\u201d She hadn\u2019t really done anything\u2014she\u2019d screamed instinctively. But he had discovered that the right tone of questioning always produced more than dismissal or rudeness.</p><p>She nodded, seeming to get a bit of a grip. \u201cShall we have some coffee?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked nervously at the corner bakery. \u201cI open. I gave the keys to one of the boys...but I guess no one is really going to be hungry around here for a while.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThey\u2019ll be hungry,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t kid yourself, he thought. People will be converging to talk. When the crime scene tape is gone, they\u2019ll be fighting each other to get in the street and photograph the position where the body lay.</p><p>\u201cBut come in...the police will clear this with your boss.\u201d He nodded to Smith, who hurried on in ahead of him. He ushered Dorothy Hannigan to a booth at the rear of the bakery. Apparently, the boy she had given the keys to had gotten things going; customers were already in the shop, but other than Dorothy Hannigan\u2019s white face, little gave away the fact that Jude was anything other than an ordinary customer. His suit was a good one, not that a homicide detective in New York made the big bucks, but he had a great apartment in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, thanks to his father\u2019s savvy with real estate, and it seemed, lately, that he lived to work. That meant decent suits\u2014and suits that blended in well with the business attire in the moneyed district where he worked.</p><p>\u201cSo, Dorothy, please, tell me exactly how you came upon the body this morning,\u201d he said quietly. He lifted a hand so that she would wait. Officer Smith had apparently seen to it that the owner, now in, was aware that his manager was helping the police; a waiter brought them two cups of coffee and quickly disappeared. She shook her head. \u201cI saw...the body. It was barely light, you know. And there was no traffic\u2014no, wait, there was one car, but it was in the other lane, and it just drove on by. You can only go the one way, you know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking a sip of his coffee.</p><p>She shivered suddenly. \u201cI come off that subway every morning. I\u2019m the only person who gets off half the time. That could have been me.\u201d</p><p>He set a hand on hers. \u201cShe was killed late last night, Miss Hannigan. I don\u2019t think this killer was looking to stalk victims in the morning\u2014someone would have come. You saw how quickly the streets got busy.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed audibly.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone you can ride in with for the next week or so?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to catch this freak in a week or so?\u201d she asked. \u201cHalf the cases go unsolved, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a gross exaggeration, really. Half the murder cases we go out on are\u2014well, sadly\u2014domestic. And they\u2019re solved,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014how? There are twenty million people on the island of Manhattan on a workday\u2014that\u2019s the statistic I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive or take a million,\u201d he agreed. \u201cPlease, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you\u2014describe exactly what you saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was walking down the street. I saw the car go by\u2014oh, yes, of course. I saw the body in the middle of the street because of the headlights. The car just kept going. I was afraid it might have been an old derelict, passed out in the street. I have a little laser light I carry, and a whistle\u2014I\u2019m not stupid, you know\u2014and so I shone the light and hurried out, hoping that nothing was coming barreling up Broadway. And then I saw her\u2014and then I started screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone else\u2014anyone at all? A bum, a shadow...anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. Then she sat straighter. \u201cWait\u2014there\u2019s old Captain Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Captain Tyler?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA sad case. Everyone keeps urging him to go to a shelter, but he shows up back on the streets, begging. I mean, of course, God help us, we get a lot of homeless guys down here. But Captain Tyler is kind of sweet. He\u2019s an older fellow, Vietnam vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see him this morning?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cI might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a pile of rags and a sleeping bag at the entrance to the subway. I remember thinking that it might have been poor old Captain Tyler. But I didn\u2019t disturb the pile.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cBut nothing else? No one watching you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, not that I noticed.\u201d She fell silent again. \u201cI\u2019m going to get killed on my way in to work one of these days despite my whistle, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in with coworkers, Ms. Hannigan, if there\u2019s any way. I\u2019ll talk to your boss. It\u2019s prudent to be extremely careful until we know what we\u2019re up against,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my men looking for Captain Tyler. Can you give me a description?\u201d</p> <p>Tyler, according to Ms. Hannigan, was tall and thin, wore a shabby army-surplus jacket and dirty denim jeans, and had long white hair and a scraggly white-and-gray beard.</p><p>\u201cHe told me once he suffered from shell shock,\u201d Dorothy Hannigan told him. \u201cSad, huh? Can\u2019t hold a job, and his benefits don\u2019t really keep a roof over his head.\u201d She gasped. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have done this, could he have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you see him, call me. I don\u2019t think, however, that shell shock, even after years, would suddenly turn a man into a vicious murderer. But when we find him, we\u2019ll find out what we can. We have some truly wonderful psychiatrists with the department. They\u2019ll be able to deal with him,\u201d Jude assured her. As he spoke, his phone rang.</p><p>It was Norton, from headquarters.</p><p>\u201cAssistant chief wants to see you, pronto,\u201d Norton told him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m at the scene,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I told him that you\u2019d been dispatched by orders of the lieutenant. But he says that you\u2019ve had time to do what you can do there, and that he wants to see you about a task force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other murders today, huh?\u201d Jude asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cNot like this. Film is already rolling. The news is shooting through all five boroughs, the country and the world like the spew from a geyser. Jack\u2019s back. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying. Anyway, he wants you in here, now.\u201d</p><p>The twenty-first-century media was amazing, Jude thought. He barely knew anything about the crime, but rumor was running rampant, and he understood that One Police Plaza wanted this solved as quickly as humanly possible.</p><p>Two other murder investigations were open on his slate; this seemed to be the one that mattered. Naturally. The other two had also been stabbed, but one had died on the way to the hospital and one had been dragged out of the river. This had been public and sensationalist. The victim was a spectacle on Broadway. They were both his cases because he worked specifically for the chief of police; he and Monty had been \u201cdetective specialists\u201d for years, which meant they could cover all of New York City as needed.</p> <p>He wished that they hadn\u2019t been his cases; he\u2019d gotten nowhere with them. The other two women had died quietly, apparently without friends to miss them. They hadn\u2019t been discovered in such a bold and gruesome state, with all the world watching.</p><p>Except that he wondered if the deputy chief was thinking along the same lines that were now plaguing him. He wasn\u2019t a Ripperologist, as Fullbright considered himself, but he did know about the case a fair amount since he\u2019d spent the month of August in Britain last year for an experimental exchange police procedural program. The program had included a study of the Ripper files, with one of Britain\u2019s top historians discussing police work now and then. Jude had looked at the archives available. Five victims were accepted as the Ripper\u2019s, but the London case files had started with the deaths of two women who had been killed before what was now deemed by experts to be Ripper murders.</p><p>They had the girl from the river, and the girl who had survived her attack long enough to make it to the hospital. Neither had carried ID; neither had been reported missing. All efforts to identify the two had been to no avail. Both had come from New York or to New York...and met sad ends.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Virginia Rockford.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still at the scene, working it,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cCrime scene folks are there. And they\u2019re good at what they do. That\u2019s what the assistant chief said. Get in here.\u201d</p><p>Jude clicked his phone closed. Great. He\u2019d find himself besieged by the reporters stationed at \u201cthe shack\u201d on the second floor of headquarters before he could reach the deputy chief\u2019s office.</p> <p>He wished he hadn\u2019t been called. He wished any other cop in the city had come on for this case.</p><p>But they hadn\u2019t; he had been on duty, and he had been specifically ordered down here.</p><p>He thanked Dorothy Hannigan and left her his card, and started out, wishing that he could look for Captain Tyler himself. But he told Smith to get more men on finding the homeless man; and he gave the officer the task of connecting with the producer for the movie being shot down the street and getting him a list of anyone involved in the production. He wanted the beat cops to keep a presence on the street and their eyes open.</p><p>There had probably been a number of young women involved in the shoot the day before; the cops could start with them. He stressed the importance of their notes, and Smith looked at him, hesitant. \u201cCrosby, you know I\u2019m a beat cop, right? Not the boss down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith, I think you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>He headed down Broadway. It was far easier to walk around Lower Manhattan right now than to get his car.</p><p>He managed to reach the deputy chief\u2019s office without being waylaid. The offices were huge, and he was just lucky that the elevator he was in didn\u2019t stop on the second floor where he might have been detained by an avid reporter.</p><p>He stood in front of the desk, but Nathaniel Green, \u201cD-Chiefy,\u201d as the men called him affectionately behind his back, wasn\u2019t a browbeater. He wasn\u2019t a political appointee, either. He\u2019d earned his place, moving up the ranks.</p><p>Green indicated the chair in front of his desk and Jude sat.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me off this new case?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>Green smiled grimly. \u201cSorry, no. But I\u2019m giving you a team, a task force. Who do you want?\u201d</p><p>Jude was quiet for a minute. He wanted to work with Monty, his partner of the last five years. But Monty was still in the hospital, and the last thing he needed, still clinging to life and praying to walk again, was a sensationalist murder case on his mind.</p><p>\u201cEllis Sayer and his group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got them. You have priority access to whoever you want in the Technical Assistance Response Unit. And I\u2019m bringing in the feds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feds? As far as I know, the killer didn\u2019t kidnap the women and cross state lines.\u201d Jude was truly puzzled; he wanted to believe that when it was important, law enforcement agencies did know how to cooperate. But they could also be possessive and territorial. The NYPD usually wanted to solve their own cases. They didn\u2019t mind help from other agencies, but they wanted control.</p><p>Green grimaced dryly. \u201cYou just said women. I believe we\u2019re thinking along the same lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we have a killer trying to emulate one from the late 1880s? That\u2019s a stretch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a killer who left a woman slashed to shreds on Broadway. The other women in those two earlier cases\u2014both seemed to have come from nowhere. They were murdered, and they\u2019re still trying to hold on down at the morgue to see if the bodies will be claimed.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cLook, Jude, this is my call. The second that body was found, the media went crazy, and, before the public puts the puzzle pieces together, I want to be on it\u2014a step ahead. Think about the way our Jane Does were ripped up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, sir, since I arrived at the scene of last night\u2019s crime, I\u2019ve given it some thought. But I\u2019ve also been trying to give the first two victims my full attention. No one seems to miss them\u2014as you said. They appear to be lost creatures. Maybe prostitutes,\u201d Jude said. \u201cAnd maybe the three murders are all connected\u2014at this point, we just don\u2019t know. If you say we should bring in the feds, fine. I\u2019m not sure I see where federal jurisdiction is warranted yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re bringing in is a special federal unit. We\u2019re not handing over jurisdiction. They\u2019ll work with you\u2014you work with them,\u201d Green said.</p><p>\u201cSure. Though again, I\u2019m still not seeing a federal connection. And we have FBI offices in the city. Why is a special unit coming in?\u201d</p><p>Green looked at him with a certain degree of exasperation. \u201cJude, this is coming straight from the top brass. The mayor\u2019s office. We can\u2019t have tourists terrified of coming to New York City. We\u2019ve done a good job in the past few years. Giuliani cleaned up a lot of the theater district and visitors can actually catch cabs that take them where they want to go. We don\u2019t need a return to the seventies\u2014or back to the days of Five Points, when a walk near where our own building stands meant tripping over the bodies of the starved, diseased\u2014or murdered. We have to work hard and fast. The media is already having a field day with this one. If a special unit can help, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p><p>Jude winced inwardly. Special unit? He wasn\u2019t sure what that meant. But it was fine. He was pretty damn sure that they weren\u2019t going to find anything to point them straight to the killer. New York City cops were good; they had learned to deal with just about everything the world could throw them. But they were also faced with a population that was staggering. Finding leads was going to be like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, yes, I\u2019m glad for anything that can help,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cYou want not just this murder solved, but the other two as well. I know you, Crosby. You\u2019ve been beating the pavement and harassing Tech Support every day for help on the two victims you pulled in the last couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that these killings are connected in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStabbings with sharp knives or utensils, same place on the bodies, each attack growing more violent...\u201d</p><p>Jude looked down, not wanting Green to see that he was irritated about being called off the street at the prime moment to make discoveries.</p><p>\u201cWe do have good cops. Our forensics people are cops, too, Jude. They won\u2019t let you down. You know you aren\u2019t going to find clues on the street...you know this is a serious situation being created by an extremely organized killer. This is going to take time, manpower and all the behavioral profiling help we can get.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can be a team player, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re in charge, Jude.

Notoriety.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Now, as to the team... This unit was established by a man we worked with down here years ago. Adam Harrison. Similar crimes. Attacks on historical properties, and a perp who was in love with Edgar Allan Poe and started killing people like the victims in Poe stories. Anyway, it\u2019s a different thing to go after a man like this, and the head of this team is an agent who worked the behavioral sciences aspect of crimes for years. One of the team is already in transit\u2014the others will be here tomorrow. I\u2019m setting them up with an apartment in Blair House. You\u2019ll actually meet...\u201d He paused for a minute, looking at a memo on his desk. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet Miss Whitney Tremont at Blair House at two, get her settled in and then head for the autopsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her to autopsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Blair House was closed for renovations.\u201d</p><p>Green nodded. \u201cIt is\u2014the preservationists won\u2019t let the place be torn down, and it\u2019s not due for construction crews to begin work for another few weeks. I want the team in the area. I\u2019ll set up a meeting for you tomorrow with the team and the team head, Special Agent Jackson Crow.\u201d</p> <p>Jude stood. It was decided, and he knew it. So much for his social life. Wait\u2014he didn\u2019t really have a social life. Since he and Jill had parted last spring, he\u2019d enjoyed three one-night stands and a two-week dating whirl. Actually, he\u2019d had three one-night stands\u2014enjoyed two.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I want Hannah Mills in Tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded again. \u201cAnd I have priority at autopsy\u2014now, and if this does go further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just called Fullbright. He\u2019ll be your man, and he will be ready to meet with you at three this afternoon\u2014the autopsy is already scheduled.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded again. \u201cI\u2019m going back to the scene until then. I\u2019ll meet your Miss Tremont at two, and we\u2019ll be at autopsy together at three. And don\u2019t give me that resigned look. I\u2019ll call Ellis and get his team moving, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best I\u2019ve got, Jude. And I\u2019m giving you priority all the way,\u201d Green told him.</p><p>Jude wasn\u2019t sure he was the best that the deputy chief had. Hell, he\u2019d just watched his partner get shot in a situation that should have never ended as it had.</p><p>But this was what he did; he\u2019d known all his life that, like his father and grandfather\u2014and great-grandfather before that\u2014he\u2019d wanted to be a cop. He\u2019d been lucky; he\u2019d gone to college and gotten degrees in criminology and psychology, something his father and grandfather hadn\u2019t been able to acquire. But they\u2019d both been good cops. The kind who put the bad guys away.</p><p>This was one bad guy they were going after and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my absolute best, sir,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>He had been dismissed. He headed straight to Tech Support, where he discovered that Green had put through a call to Hannah Mills. Hannah was excited; she\u2019d never actually spoken directly to Green before.</p><p>She was a whiz with computers, and if a piece of information was available anywhere, Hannah could find it. At one time in history, she would have been called a spinster. She was a slender woman with bottle-thick wire glasses, brown hair worn in a bun each day and a mind that could work as quickly as a computer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m making printouts for you, they\u2019ll be popping out as we speak,\u201d she told Jude.</p><p>\u201cShe was with the movie crew?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was portraying prostitute Mary Green. She was an extra, I believe, but she had a fair amount of screen time. Maybe even a line or two. Anyway, I have a list for you. The producer, the director, the name of the off-duty officer patrolling...a liaison with the movie and television unit. I think it\u2019s all here. And when you want more, you call me, day or night!\u201d She stood up in her little cubicle and planted a kiss on his cheek. \u201cThank you, Jude! Thank you for asking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for being a good tech. I do have something for you. I want you to find out all you can about a Captain Tyler, a Vietnam vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that Tyler. I thought you meant one of the thousand others on the island of Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. This one would have been in and out of local veterans\u2019 hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cAnd one more\u2014I want everything you can find about a government group put together by a man named Adam Harrison. Team head is Jackson Crow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name is familiar. I\u2019ll get right on it.\u201d</p><p>Jude returned to lower Broadway, opting to walk back to the scene. On a television screen, through an appliance-shop window, he could see that Deputy Chief Green himself was speaking to the media. He urged citizens to calm down and be vigilant.</p><p>He put a in call to Ellis and let him know that he and his group were to join Jude and the feds. Before he had reached the scene of the crime again, he had everyone in motion; they would start with initial interviews of everyone on the movie set. He looked at the list Hannah had given him; he could get one of the feds to make sure that this list and the list that Smith was able to garner matched. Like it or not, he was working with the feds. Might as well make use of them.</p><p>With careful steps, he walked from the set to where the body had been found, reimagining the victim\u2019s probable search for a cab, and how the killer had come upon her. All the while he searched for Captain Tyler as well. But though he made new acquaintances with several of the homeless people on the streets, he didn\u2019t find Tyler.</p><p>He felt a growing sense of anger.</p><p>Someone out there was either amusing himself at the expense of the police, or sincerely thought himself the reincarnation of a legendary killer.</p><p>The victim probably hadn\u2019t had time to scream. New York had been teeming with life just blocks away\u2014the population was huge.</p><p>Just as it had been in the crowded tenements of Whitechapel and the East End of London.</p><p>The killer had probably surprised her; choked her to unconsciousness before slitting her throat.</p><p>His phone rang. It was Hannah.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? What have you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfo, but not on the victim\u2014on your team,\u201d Hannah told him.</p><p>There was a strange excitement in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a special team, all right. They\u2019ve barely been around a year, but they\u2019ve already solved a number of really bizarre cases. Jude\u2014they\u2019re a paranormal team. They don\u2019t just investigate, they appear to talk to ghosts. They\u2019re highly respected for what they\u2019ve done, but they\u2019re also a bit on the outside, even of the FBI itself. Only the head guy, that Jackson Crow, has been a special agent for a long time. But he\u2019s supposed to be one of the best behavioral guys out there. They sound good, really good. But weird, too. You must have heard something about this group. They solved a creepy murder in New Orleans that had to do with all kinds of political corruption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have heard something,\u201d he said. He winced. Leave it him to wind up with the \u201cspecial\u201d team. Which reminded him...</p><p>\u201cThanks, Hannah. I have to meet one of the agents now, and it\u2019s good to be forewarned.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. On to meet his spiritualist or medium or whatever. He\u2019d been told he had to work with the team; he would. He\u2019d be polite. He\u2019d spend the days and nights reminding himself that all help was needed at the moment.</p><p>The days and nights ahead suddenly seemed extremely long.</p><p>Be polite. Collect the \u201cspecial\u201d agent. And then on to autopsy.</p><p>2</p><p>Blair House.</p><p>It stood behind a wall and next to an area where a massive construction project seemed to be under way\u2014except that the construction crews didn\u2019t appear to be out. The house was barely a block away from Wall Street, and another block from Broadway, within easy distance of St. Paul\u2019s, Trinity and the World Trade Center site.</p><p>Blair House itself was as out of sync with the current pulse of the city as the churches with their early American graveyards.</p><p>As far as the financial concerns of humanity went, it only made sense to tear down the old to make way for the new.</p><p>But, Whitney Tremont had been glad to hear, Blair House was not going to be torn down. It was slated for a great deal of renovation; federal money was coming in to tend to a federal project\u2014it was said that among the many places George Washington slept, Blair House was one of his favorites.</p><p>A low brick wall obscured much of the facade, while wrought-iron detail, tangled with ivy, rose from the wall. She could see the house from the sidewalk only because the driver who had picked her up from the airport had provided her with keys, and she had opened the gate while awaiting her NYPD liaison, Detective Jude Crosby.</p><p>The brick path to the house was overgrown, as was the house\u2019s yard area. To the left, there was a charming pagoda overrun with ivy and flowering plants and to the right, a fountain that no longer trickled water was in a similar state.</p><p>The house itself was Greek Revival\u2014several steps led up to a porch with fine Ionic columns. The front door was double-wide with etched-glass porticoes.</p><p>The off-white paint was peeling. The columns obviously needed help as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks.\u201d</p><p>She turned, startled. She had been giving the house so much attention that she hadn\u2019t noticed the tall man who had walked up to her on the sidewalk.</p><p>He was actually hard not to notice; he was a good six foot three and built like a linebacker.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking that it was bad,\u201d she told him. \u201cI was just thinking that it\u2019s beautiful, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re not tearing it down.\u201d She offered him a hand. \u201cSpecial Agent Whitney Tremont, Detective Crosby. Thank you for being here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cSure. The situation is bad. Whatever it takes. Need a hand with your bag?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. We can just head on in.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t exactly been warm and cuddly, but he wasn\u2019t being rude, and he seemed to be sincere. Other agencies sometimes resented FBI involvement in a case\u2014they weren\u2019t always fond of the fact that someone over them had invited the feds in.</p> <p>She\u2019d never exactly intended to work for the federal government, but she didn\u2019t mind. As long as they were left to work alone, it just didn\u2019t matter. And since the head of their unit, Jackson Crow, had established himself as an agent with an exemplary record before he\u2019d been given his current team, she was more than willing to accept the occasional snickers that came their way. Jackson could stare down any man and silence him within a matter of seconds.</p><p>\u201cI believe they had a cleaning crew come in already\u2014a good thing, since I don\u2019t imagine that you and your team would want a lot of people around.\u201d Jude Crosby told her. \u201cAlso, if I know my superiors, they had staples brought in, so you should have essentials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a minute; his face gave nothing away. \u201cWell, I guess we should get you settled.\u201d He actually grinned. \u201cYou know it\u2019s a haunted house, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat self-respecting house this old isn\u2019t haunted?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He was still sizing her up, of course, given the team\u2019s reputation. She smiled, not saying anything. They were all welcome to wonder. Detective Crosby would meet Jackson Crow soon enough. Jackson had a tenet he lived by, and the team followed its simple sentiment\u2014use logic, and then feelings.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of your team isn\u2019t arriving until tomorrow?\u201d he asked her. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re staying here alone tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll be fine. Let me take a quick look around, drop my bag and we can go to the autopsy.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the area next door. \u201cThat\u2019s where they were filming the movie and that\u2019s where the victim came from when she was leaving. I\u2019m surprised that they sent you in alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be. I went through a lot of sessions at the shooting range. I passed,\u201d Whitney told him.</p> <p>\u201cCan you shoot a ghost?\u201d he asked. The question seemed pleasant enough, but she realized she was being mocked. She wondered if he was more concerned that she was a ghost-hunting special agent, or that she was a small woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite competent, thank you,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, your call... Just remember, please, it\u2019s an NYC case with NYC police heading the investigation. I\u2019m impressed that a unit was asked in immediately. Somebody thinks that your ghost hunting\u2014that your team\u2014is top-notch. Thing is, there\u2019s nothing really around you at night, unless you want to count the dead in Trinity\u2019s and St. Paul\u2019s graveyards. Last night, that crew working this area so late was unusual. But that\u2019s film for you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for her reply; he started up the walk.</p><p>Whitney stepped into the main hallway, which was long and extremely broad. A slim curving staircase against the western wall led to the floor above, and she could see down the hallway to the door that opened to the back. She wanted to stop, to try to sense the place, but she didn\u2019t; not with Jude Crosby watching.</p><p>\u201cThey say the foundations of this old place date back to the last decades of the eighteenth century. There were lots of fires back then, though, and not a lot of control. I think the current structure is from 1810. I have to say, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re preserving it, too. Wonder what it was like back in the day. I mean, New York moves like a bullet. I love the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great city,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>Whitney noted that the hallway had probably been the grand meeting room of the house; parties had probably been held right there with indentured servants or slaves walking the room at times with silver trays. A grand piano sat against the wall at the rear; she wondered just how old it might be.</p> <p>But she\u2019d have to explore later.</p><p>Whatever happened with the New York City police, she wanted to make sure that she was there from the get-go, and that her prep work had been done. They were there to assist the police, not to take over an investigation, no matter how much pull they might have with different power structures. She\u2019d spent the trip reading email on the current murder\u2014preliminary notes only\u2014and, since the cry was out that the murder seemed to be mimicking that of a long-ago Ripper victim, she had spent most of the time during her flight on her iPad, downloading the best books she could find on the elusive killer from the past.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been in this house a few times,\u201d Jude told her. \u201cWhen I was a kid on school tours, before it was closed down for renovations. I\u2019m going to suggest you snag the first room up the stairs on your left. The last owners\u2014who gave it to the government about twenty years ago\u2014had a nice bathroom installed up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGo on, take a peek. I\u2019ll carry your bag on up, and then I\u2019ll get you down to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she told him again.</p><p>He was an imposing presence. His features were as rugged as his muscled form\u2014handsome, masculine, strong, with the right amount of rough around the edges.</p><p>Not a good thought, she told herself. She had to be blunt and strong herself; in fact, she was going to have to make sure that she remained smoothly professional in every way. They needed his respect. In her case, at five-three, she was fighting physical odds right from the start.</p><p>\u201cI can really carry my own bag\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple courtesy, Agent Tremont. We\u2019re not without it,\u201d he said.</p><p>The bedroom was nice. She glanced in the doorway as Jude Crosby set her travel bag on the footrest at the end of the bed. She took a minute to dig into her overnight bag for her better camera to be added to the shoulder bag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a photographer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm is the best record of what we see, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The room smelled sweetly and lightly of lavender cleaning solution. It was a beautiful room, and she was convinced that it did have a feel for the past, just as venerated old churches and other historic buildings often seemed to have.</p><p>Would it be more than just the sacred feel of history? she wondered.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jude arched a brow. \u201cThat\u2019s it? You don\u2019t want to look around longer? Settle in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She was grateful that she\u2019d been able to come so quickly; they\u2019d received the call almost immediately after they saw on the news that a gruesome murder had taken place in New York. While Jackson had calmly spoken about travel arrangements and equipment, explaining the circumstances in which they\u2019d be working, she\u2019d been online and discovered that if she left within the next ten minutes, she could be on a plane to LaGuardia that was scheduled for departure at ten, and would have her on the ground in New York by one. She\u2019d jumped at the chance, although not without a few minutes of stern warnings from her associates. They mostly consisted of: Be careful. We\u2019ll be right behind you. You know not to take chances. Remember that we work best when we can earn the cooperation of the local police.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jude said. \u201cYou need anything else?\u201d</p><p>She tapped her shoulder bag, a big soft leather sling she hadn\u2019t released since she\u2019d gone through the security lines at the airport.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. I have everything I need for the moment.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a crooked smile. \u201cYou travel light for a woman.\u201d</p><p>She felt her own smile tighten just a bit. Was he mocking her? She was fairly small and slim, she knew. Her appearance and gender often worked in her favor. She wasn\u2019t threatening in size and, sometimes, that was good.</p><p>Get along with the locals, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of me as a woman, Detective. Think of me as an agent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t think of you as a boy or a man\u2014I\u2019ll think of you as a top-notch NYPD detective.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Apparently, he did have a sense of humor. And he could laugh at himself.</p><p>As they left Blair House, Whitney found herself pausing to look at the large construction site next door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming whatever was there wasn\u2019t protected by any historical society,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, there had been an ugly building there from the 1920s, or something like that,\u201d Jude said. \u201cBefore that, it had been some kind of society building\u2014not like high society. I mean...I don\u2019t know. Some people claimed that it was a spiritualist house, or a place for Satanists, or something like that. Odd, though. Construction there has had to halt several times. A few workers were injured. I think one was killed. And then, of course, last night happened. The film company had acquired permits to use the area. They bought mega-insurance for the shoot, but I don\u2019t think it helps, because the murder was off-site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman who was murdered had been working there,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cYep, playing a gaslight prostitute, I believe. Honestly, it\u2019s really no wonder that folks are crying \u2018Jack\u2019s back.\u2019 Poor girl. There\u2019s been some insinuation in early news reports that our victim didn\u2019t always get along with the other actresses. But maybe that\u2019s not a fair assessment\u2014we haven\u2019t even really begun the investigation. From what I\u2019ve learned, the old Jack the Ripper found victims who were used up, missing teeth, old and ugly, but I guess none of his victims had a reputation for not being nice. Now, that\u2019s an interesting question. Does being nice or not nice have much to do with being a victim?\u201d</p><p>Whitney glanced at him. He was thoughtful, really thoughtful. She decided that he might have made a decent behaviorial scientist himself. \u201cThat is an interesting question,\u201d Whitney said, still looking at the cheap mesh fencing and the occasional ugly green plastic sheets that surrounded the construction site. It appeared that the majority of the old structure had been demolished; there were planks over what looked like foundations that were still in the process of being dug out and cleared. There were also piles of new timber lying about\u2014remnants, she presumed\u2014of the sets that had been hastily constructed for the on-location shooting that had been done the day before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She thought the site was empty and then she realized that there was a gate around the other side, and by the gate there was a small section with a tented roof. Sitting beneath it, watching the entrance and reading a magazine, was a guard.</p><p>\u201cOne guard watching the area,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>Jude pointed to a row of trailers on the other side of the street. \u201cYesterday, throughout the day, there was tons of security. That\u2019s the tail end of the movie crew. There was no shooting today, and the producer announced, after the report of Miss Rockford\u2019s murder, that they were done with the location.\u201d He glanced her way. \u201cI spent most of the day down here off and on, trying to get a real feel for what was going on, and what the situation was last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your feeling about it now?\u201d</p><p>He glanced her way and actually smiled. \u201cI have a feeling\u2014ye olde cop gut feeling\u2014that it does have something to do with the movie and the movie crew.\u201d</p><p>Whitney mulled over his words as he drove her down to the morgue. She listened to the constant honking that was as natural as conversation in this city. She watched the rush of pedestrians along the busy streets. People flocking through the intersections, the occasional dog walker pausing along the sidewalk with a Baggie.</p><p>She\u2019d been a film student herself in the city, and she knew the area. But now, she felt as if she was seeing it all through different eyes. She thought about the age and the history of the city; the city buildings forming a concrete tomb over the iniquity and depredation of what had been the Five Points region. Wall Street\u2014once where the old wall built to protect the tip of the island had been. Few places rivaled New York City as a place where the sheer velocity of life trampled the pivotal spaces of history.</p><p>It all seemed new to her now: the slash of Broadway, the one-way streets, the parks, the people, the old and the new.</p> <p>Well, her eyes were different now; she was different. And all because, once upon a time, she had determined to hold her own ground.</p><p>Life was different.</p><p>As was death.</p><p>As they headed for the morgue, Jude tried to forget the woman at his side.</p><p>Whitney Tremont. Special agent. Very special agent.</p><p>But, she did know how to be quiet. She was distracting, but that wasn\u2019t her fault. His. He set his mind back to the situation, and tried not to think that she was definitely an interesting and arresting individual.</p> <p>Captain Tyler. Now, there was a dash of cold water. He wanted to find him\u2014and he would. Rush hour\u2014that time when citizens took their lives in their hands just to step into the subway\u2014would most probably bring Captain Tyler back to his home haunts; the subway station where those who knew him would be kind enough to drop spare change or a dollar his way. The autopsy would be finished by that point.</p><p>He had spoken with many people who talked about how strange downtown could be at night. By day, the world itself hummed because of all the activity that occurred at the New York Stock Exchange. By night, restaurants closed. The gates to the churches were locked. Office workers were gone, and the major hotels were by Battery Park and the South Street Seaport. Nearby Tribeca and Soho entertained nightlife and housed hundreds of thousands of people. But here, at this end with the financial district and the government buildings, the night brought on a haunting quiet, as if the little area needed time to recoup from the madness of the light.</p><p>His only hope was in finding Captain Tyler, he thought. Or someone else who was like a ghost, left to eke out an existence from those who passed hurriedly by day, and forget them once darkness fell.</p><p>Jude parked his car, still lost in the case as he did so, and hoping against hope that it might be one that was solved quickly. Though he had his task force questioning the hundreds of people who had been involved in the film shoot, and he knew that they\u2019d be eliminating those with airtight alibis, they\u2019d also be making lists of those he needed to interview himself, or who needed to be investigated further. He almost forgot Whitney Tremont; in fact, he might have if she didn\u2019t give off a soft, underlying perfume, and if he didn\u2019t just feel the warmth of the body beside his own.</p><p>She was out of the car door, though, before he could walk around to open it for her. She was pure motion and energy.</p><p>\u201cKeep your thoughts going and don\u2019t worry about me, Detective,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. So she was.</p><p>Jude Crosby was known at the morgue; he had no difficulty navigating the structure of the building, Whitney Tremont following closely behind him.</p> <p>\u201cOCME,\u201d or the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, was housed on First Avenue. New York City held many firsts in the investigation of death; the Office of the Medical Examiner was established in 1918, the first of its kind in the country. OCME established the first toxicology laboratory and the first serology laboratory as well, at Bellevue Hospital, rather than the six-story headquarters where the executive offices, mortuary, autopsy, X-ray, photography and many labs were housed now.</p><p>Attending a victim\u2019s autopsy was always paramount to him; no matter how great a medical examiner might be at a report, there was always something to be gained by attending. Many medical examiners did consider the autopsy to be the victim\u2019s last chance to speak, and Jude believed them. You never knew just what a victim might \u201csay.\u201d</p><p>He knew that time had made him jaded; he\u2019d seen the dead so often. He noticed the odor of decaying flesh, and the stronger odors of the chemicals that were used to mask the smell. He noticed them, but he barely thought about them. He thought of the place as sterile. He wondered if his religious teachings as a child kicked in when he saw the dead; the spirit didn\u2019t reside in the flesh. The dead were far from feeling pain. They had gone to a better place.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he completely believed that. He did believe that they suffered no more in the fragile shell of the flesh.</p><p>There was a saying on the wall outside the autopsy room, there for all to see, a Latin motto: Let conversation cease, let laughter flee. This is the place where death delights in helping the living.</p><p>He hoped that Virginia Rockford could help point them toward her killer.</p><p>There were eight steel tables in the room, and three of them had occupants. Thousands passed through the doors of the morgue yearly, but not all were murder victims. Suicides came here, along with those who died in accidents, and those who died while in apparent good health. There were those who had died \u201cby violence,\u201d and those who had died unattended. There were many reasons to come to the morgue. It was a big city; people died in strange ways.</p><p>Two assistants were working with Fullbright when they suited up to join the procedure. The body had been stripped and cleaned by the assistants, and somehow, that made the injuries done to Ginger Rockford all the more macabre. He could clearly see the gashes in her throat, and the hideous slashes that had been made in the lower abdomen.</p><p>He was aware of everyone around him, and especially, Whitney.</p><p>Whitney worked with her camera; he wanted to stop her. He had to remind himself that she was an agent, and not a gawker. Whatever photos and digital film she took would be for the purposes of the investigation.</p><p>Clothed in scrubs, Whitney might have blended in with the workforce, except that he could see that she was also wearing a pair of neat little fashionable heels that weren\u2019t usually worn by techs in the morgue. When he had introduced her to Fullbright, she\u2019d stood a slight distance back as well, as if trying to make herself unobtrusive.</p><p>When he looked at her, curious as to whether or not she could really watch the autopsy and learn from it, he discovered that he was almost transfixed by her eyes. They were nearly gold. The color had to be hazel, but the green and brown blended so remarkably that the color was almost like the sun. And her skin was the most amazing shade of golden copper he could imagine. It seemed as if every race into which humanity had divided had recombined in her, and that mixture was arresting; she was a beautiful young woman, but much more as well. She stood still, and yet seemed to be brimming with energy. Character, curiosity, passion and a certain appearance of honor seemed to be imprinted in the very structure of her face.</p><p>And she was young; too young to be jaded. He had the feeling she still believed in \u201cTruth, Justice, and the American Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude, look well,\u201d Fullbright said, and he clenched hard on his jaw, returning his full attention to the sad matter at hand. \u201cThe two great lacerations to the throat severed both the major blood vessels in the throat\u2014just as in the case of Polly Nichols, the woman most detectives\u2014past and present\u2014believed to have been the Ripper\u2019s first victim. And if you\u2019ll note the mutilations on the abdomen, you see how jagged this first cut is, and you\u2019ll see how violent and savage the rest are. Jude, these are nearly the exact wounds as perpetrated by a killer over a hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the woman, holding back a groan. He didn\u2019t discount the idea that they might be looking at a mimic who had an agenda that would send the city into a real panic, attempting to re-create the slayings of a long-gone killer.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t discount the idea yet that they were looking at an isolated incident, and that Virginia Rockford had managed to really anger someone intent on killing her specifically. And solely.</p><p>Whitney spoke up. \u201cI spent the hours on the plane here reading up on the crimes, since the press seems to believe there\u2019s a copycat out there.\u201d She walked to the side table where she had left her shoulder bag and dug in it briefly to produce a piece of paper with a picture on it. \u201cPolly Nichols\u2014a morgue photo. Care to compare the medical examiner\u2019s report with our corpse?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked from her unique eyes to the photo, and despite his determination to keep an entirely open mind, he had to give the comparison credence.</p><p>The Ripper\u2019s victim had been older; life had not been kind. The image was not that of a pretty young woman.</p><p>Whatever else Virginia Rockford might have been, she hadn\u2019t been old. She had been attractive; killed when it seemed that the world was waiting for her.</p><p>But, despite the difference in the living appearances and situations of the women, the wounds on the bodies were the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Exactly the same.</p><p>The autopsy had just begun.

And the perfect vision of one. So tall, so leanly, ruggedly muscled. He had dark hair, with no signs of gray yet, neatly clipped. She estimated that he was in his mid-thirties; a man with gray eyes that had seen too much; he was weary, and yet he still seemed to have the look of a man who wanted to change the world.</p><p>Whitney thought that he must have grown up reading every old detective novel that had ever been printed. He didn\u2019t have to speak a word; she could tell by his body language that he wasn\u2019t happy about her being on the case.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been so pleased that she\u2019d been the first of her team to arrive on-site, or that she should be the one to dive headfirst into the macabre killing. Perhaps it would have been better if they would have started out with Jude Crosby meeting one of the guys; Jackson Crow, Jake Mallory or Will Chan might have made a better impression. She doubted that Jude Crosby had ever worked with a female partner. He kept looking at her as if she were a little mosquito that had gotten in his way. She wasn\u2019t out to prove anything; she and the others were a team, and each member was always glad to make use of his or her gender, color or any perceived edge when it meant getting done what needed to get done.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s move through this autopsy before leaping to any conclusions, shall we?\u201d Jude Crosby suggested. His voice was even; his tone was cool.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t play well with others! she thought.</p><p>Too bad. Fullbright seemed fine; he accepted her simply as an FBI agent, and he was interested in the photo of Jack the Ripper\u2019s first canonical victim. Fullbright was intrigued by the puzzle before him, and it seemed evident that he was an armchair detective himself, fascinated by the mystery of old. The medical examiner was convinced that the killer had, at the least, studied the modus operandi of the mysterious nineteenth-century killer.</p><p>Crosby wasn\u2019t happy. Maybe he was always that way. Maybe he felt that the federal government was encroaching upon his right as state law enforcement.</p><p>Well, that was all right. They had worked with cops who were grateful to have them around\u2014and cops who didn\u2019t want them at all. They were learning as they went, and so far, their odd mix of a team had done very well.</p><p>She could step back.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d she replied, and did step back, clearly defining her role as observer.</p><p>Whitney had seen many horrible things, but nothing like what had been done to the young woman on the gurney. She didn\u2019t want to blink or blanch as the doctor reported his findings in a dispassionate voice; she couldn\u2019t appear too weak to stomach it. The only thing she could do was force herself to take a huge mental step back as well. In truth, that wasn\u2019t so hard. It couldn\u2019t be real flesh on the table; that was too terrible to accept.</p><p>But she had known what the findings would be. Not exact, perhaps. But close. There were two grievously deep slashes across the throat, cutting the windpipe and vital veins and arteries; the woman had nearly been decapitated. There was bruising on the throat. There was a ragged gash right beneath the ribs, and followed down on the right-hand side of the body to the pelvis, displaying the kidneys. There were two cuts to the genitals, deep, and violent.</p><p>It was all so frighteningly exact.</p><p>Down to the wounds, the direction of the wounds, everything.</p><p>She felt Jude Crosby\u2019s eyes on her, over the body of the dead woman, and she met his gaze. Steady, but not challenging, she warned herself. They\u2019d been asked in, through Adam Harrison\u2019s nudging, but it was still best to keep things as copacetic as possible.</p><p>\u201cDoc, you scraped beneath her nails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014but we\u2019re not going to get anything. She didn\u2019t have a chance to fight him. She doesn\u2019t have a single defensive wound on her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFibers? Threads? Hairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went fast\u2014the lab has her clothing.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll leave you to close her up. Call me if anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Jude. If anything, whatsoever. I\u2019m not expecting anything on the toxicology reports, but, I promise, I\u2019ll let you know immediately.\u201d He hesitated, looking at Jude. \u201cI still have your Jane Does in here,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we getting anywhere with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve sent out the picture of the girl who died on the way to the hospital\u2014we\u2019ve sent it everywhere in hell, and nothing,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThe second girl...the one from the water. Well, you saw her face. Not even a mother\u2019s love could help her recognize that child. I just asked my lieutenant yesterday about getting a graphic artist over. I\u2019m not great on computers, but I know that a good graphic artist can do an amazing job with a likeness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll get with you as soon as I have...anything,\u201d Wally Fullbright assured him grimly. \u201cMiss Tremont\u2014a pleasure, even if we\u2019re meeting under sad circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Dr. Fullbright,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThank you. Except...would it be possible for me to see the two girls who died last week?\u201d</p><p>She thought that Jake would step in and proprietarily inform her that they had nothing to do with this case, and that he had it covered.</p><p>Fullbright did look to Jake.</p><p>Jake nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy assistant will escort you,\u201d Fullbright said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>They followed a fellow in scrubs out and down the hall. In another room, there were rows and rows of steel drawers. Apparently, despite the number of deaths that came through the morgue, the murders of the two unknown girls were remembered. The assistant knew right where he was going. He glanced at Jake apologetically. \u201cWe\u2019re calling them Jane Doe wet and Jane Doe dry. The more recent body was pulled from the river,\u201d he explained to Whitney, something she already knew. Jackson Crow was thorough when he briefed his team.</p><p>He pulled out the drawer and pulled back the shroud-like sheet covering the corpse.</p><p>Whitney locked her jaw.</p><p>The flesh on the girl\u2019s face had met with the elements and any number of hungry river carnivores. The skull peeked through in many places. The skin that remained was a mottled gray-blue color, where it wasn\u2019t pulpy-red.</p><p>She glanced at Jake. \u201cI\u2019d like to take some photos. One of my teammates is a true whiz on a computer. He can work any graphics program invented, and I think he can get us a likeness of this girl\u2019s face by tonight. He\u2019s flying in tomorrow, but if he can get something right away, you can have the image by morning.\u201d</p><p>He was still wearing a mask over his mouth; maybe that made his eyes seem all the more intense. He nodded.</p><p>She looked at the M.E.\u2019s assistant. \u201cI need a tape measure or a ruler,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWe have excellent photos at the station,\u201d Crosby told her.</p><p>\u201cI can email these straight from my phone,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He obliged her with a nod, and she drew out her little high-megapixel phone/camera, and began shooting from every conceivable angle. Both men waited for her, and she worked quickly. On the one hand, she felt as if, in this steel and sterile environment, nothing was real. On the other hand, the girl in the drawer was far too real. Eventually, the police would find out who she was, because although Whitney hadn\u2019t known Jude long at all, she was certain that he would never give up. She had to keep snapping pictures; the police could find out who she was. Her work was to find out who had done this to her and why.</p><p>And hopefully before more died.</p><p>When Whitney was done, she nodded grimly. The assistant gently covered the dead girl\u2019s face again, and closed the drawer while Whitney prayed that she had a signal, so she could email the photos to Jake Mallory efficiently\u2014and quickly.</p><p>Jude thanked the attendant and started walking on. Still hitting the send key, Whitney followed in his wake.</p><p>All the drawers were numbered. That seemed incredibly sad to Whitney. They were people in the drawers, not numbers.</p><p>In contrast, the second victim looked serene, as if she were sleeping. She might have been, if it weren\u2019t for the deep gashes on her body, visible when the sheet was pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had her picture out everywhere,\u201d Jude said quietly. \u201cAnd no one has claimed her body yet. She\u2019ll stay here a few more days, and then they\u2019ll house her in the morgue in the basement\u2014and then she\u2019ll go to a potter\u2019s grave at City Cemetery,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Whitney took just one picture. The assistant covered the body and shut the drawer.</p><p>As it closed, Whitney felt as if she was surrounded by steel, the scent of formaldehyde and other chemicals, and realized just how cold she was.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a witness to find, Miss Tremont,\u201d Jude told her.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m here to follow in your footsteps,\u201d she said.</p><p>He paused. She knew he really just wanted to tell her to go away. He didn\u2019t. He shrugged. She\u2019d been assigned to him; he\u2019d been told to accept the team\u2019s help. \u201cAll right, fine.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked quickly. She hurried to keep up with him. He was tall. She was\u2014not.</p><p>Outside, horns were blaring, pedestrians moved about the street and it seemed that everything in the world was small and slow next to the size and speed of the city. Jude Crosby, however, knew his city well. He maneuvered the sidewalk in a long stride; he\u2019d parked his car on the street. That in itself was quite a feat\u2014she was a good driver, but she\u2019d never figure out how he parked his car in the tiny space where it was wedged. He started to walk around to the driver\u2019s side, but then remembered her. He turned and opened the passenger-side door.</p><p>She slid in quickly. She had the feeling that if she didn\u2019t move fast enough, she was going to be left behind.</p><p>\u201cWho are we looking for?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Tyler,\u201d he said briefly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA cop\u2014a sea captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld veteran. Vietnam,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wanders that area at night. The woman who found the body thought that he was sleeping nearby when she came out of the subway. He might have seen something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken with the last people to see Virginia Rockford yet?\u201d Whitney asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be going through the cast and crew from the movie next, and those who were working at the on-site location,\u201d he said. He glanced at her. \u201cObviously, a sensationalist murder like this, I\u2019m not the only cop on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the two earlier victims\u2014you were assigned to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner and I were assigned as the lead detectives on both cases. We\u2019ve had a decent record, even when we\u2019ve come up against unknowns. How anyone can live in this day and age and not be missed by someone, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they must be missed by people who can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be in New York,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>He stared straight ahead; she didn\u2019t blame him. In school, she hadn\u2019t kept a car in the city. She wondered if she\u2019d actually be capable of driving when everyone seemed to think that they belonged in every lane, when the streets stopped up and people were everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose someone, somewhere, misses them. But you\u2019d be amazed by the amount of people who really don\u2019t seem to belong anywhere,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI understand your partner is in the hospital,\u201d Whitney said softly, realizing she was probably treading on dangerous ground.</p><p>\u201cHe was shot. Mainly because people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing need to stay out of police business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s going to make it,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>He gazed at her then. His eyes could be as cold as jagged gray ice. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s going to live. Whether he\u2019ll ever walk again or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedicine has come far. I\u2019m sure he has the best doctors in the world.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t reply. They drove in silence, except when he cursed beneath his breath at the other drivers on the road.</p><p>He glanced over at her as they moved south. \u201cHave you been to New York before?\u201d he asked, as if remembering that he had another person in his car.</p><p>\u201cFilm school,\u201d she said.</p><p>That drew a frown. \u201cYou are here now, with me, but you went to film school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you\u2019re an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you usually work with film, then? Surveillance systems, that kind of work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes. In many ways, I still work with film. We\u2019re a specialized unit, working with bizarre situations. But you know that. You\u2019ve had someone look up information about the team.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cThis is homicide. And, sadly, homicide is horrible, but not\u2014ghostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think it was a bizarre homicide?\u201d</p><p>She had him there, and he knew it. He didn\u2019t reply. She knew he wasn\u2019t happy that his partner was in the hospital, and he was working with a girl who looked as if she might have only just gotten her degree\u2014in film. He wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>Crosby seemed to have a talent for parking in New York City\u2014of course, he drove an unmarked car and didn\u2019t have to worry much about parking tickets. Still, he seemed to be able to find the only street parking on Broadway, and they were quickly walking down the major street, weaving their way through the mass of humanity.</p><p>Crime tape was gone; a woman had been murdered, and speculation was on everyone\u2019s lips\u2014but Broadway could only be stopped so long.</p><p>Jude knew where he was going; they walked to the subway.</p><p>His pace decelerated as they reached the entrance. \u201cCaptain Tyler!\u201d he said politely.</p><p>Whitney looked around Jude\u2019s imposing form and saw that there was a man sitting by the entrance. He was wearing a worn peacoat, denim jeans and a cap. He had nice gray eyes\u2014that appeared as if they had known much better days.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d the man said. He heaved a sigh and stood up. It seemed that he did so because he had been addressed by name, and standing was the proper thing to do. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d he asked Jude. \u201cCan I help you in some way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, you can help me, yes. I\u2019d like very much to bother you for some of your time. I\u2019m a detective with the police, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe murder,\u201d Captain Tyler said. He nodded. It appeared that his thinking was clear; he didn\u2019t seem to have been drinking, nor did he have bloodshot or dilated eyes that would indicate he was taking drugs.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cI saw her,\u201d Captain Tyler said, staring at Jude, then noting Whitney and looking at her, his smile becoming a gentle one. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, touching his cap. \u201cYes, I saw the young woman last night. She was not very nice.\u201d</p><p>Whitney frowned; she desperately didn\u2019t want this man to be the murderer. She didn\u2019t know him, of course. He smelled like the street, but that didn\u2019t matter. But there was something about his gray eyes and grizzled face that seemed to speak of dignity beyond misfortune.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Tyler? You\u2019re certain you saw the woman who was killed?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, her picture has been all over the news.\u201d Captain Tyler smiled, seeing Jude Crosby\u2019s frown. \u201cPete\u2019s Appliances, up on Reade Street. He keeps the news on all the time in his shop-front window,\u201d Tyler explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve been blasting that girl\u2019s face over the airwaves all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell us, please, about when you saw her last night?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Captain Tyler nodded gravely. \u201cShe was walking up Broadway. I asked her for change, or for a dollar. She was rude. I think she said that I was an old junkie. I have never sold drugs. I took some drugs. I was in the jungle. It was the only way to stay in the jungle.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey say she was ripped up bad. I\u2019ve seen men living and breathing and running into battle, and then their young bodies literally blown to bits, their limbs here and there. But they are saying that the girl was gutted... She wasn\u2019t nice, but I hope she went quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Tyler, would you come with me to the station?\u201d Jude asked him. \u201cI\u2019d like to get your statement down on paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStatement?\u201d Captain Tyler said, confused.</p><p>\u201cYes, everything you have to say can help us,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>Whitney looked at Jude, frowning. He couldn\u2019t believe that this dignified old man, down and out as he was, had hurt anyone.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He glared at her fiercely. So much for cooperation; this was his case.</p><p>Captain Tyler nodded, looking at Whitney with a smile. \u201cFree hot coffee, even if it\u2019s bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you good coffee,\u201d she promised him. \u201cAnd, are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Captain Tyler was hungry. Jude seemed impatient, but when she started into the nearest coffee shop, he muttered and eased past her, buying Captain Tyler a large coffee and an Italian sub, and paying for it himself.</p><p>At the station, Jude moved through the offices, pausing only briefly to rattle off a few names in introductions she couldn\u2019t possibly remember. He directed her to one door while he directed Captain Tyler in through another door. She found herself in a small room behind one-way glass. She saw Jude sit Tyler down, and he asked the man his first name. It was Michael. As Jude politely laid out the lunch and waited for Michael Tyler to eat, an older man joined her in the room, offering his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Deputy Chief Green. I know that they call me D-Chiefy behind my back, and I answer quickly to Green,\u201d he told her, his tone pleasant and easy as he studied her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the first of the feds?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled, offered her hand in return and told him, \u201cYes, I\u2019m the first of the feds. I\u2019m Whitney Tremont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, glad to have you. I spoke briefly to Agent Crow. He said not to be fooled by your size, that you\u2019re as strong as a diamond. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019m fascinated enough by what I do to walk boldly into the fray.\u201d</p><p>He nodded with a small smile. \u201cJude met you at Blair House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your team will be all right there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. We\u2019re grateful for the lodging,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re glad to have any and all help on this one. We have to nip this thing right in the bud,\u201d he said, turning to watch through the glass. She thought that he might be one man who had been raised to the right position; he had an easy manner about him, but he watched the proceedings with sharp eyes, and she didn\u2019t think that he missed much. He\u2019d done an assessment of her, she was sure, and he\u2019d probably come to his own conclusions, with or without comment from Jackson Crow. But then Jackson and Angela Hawkins did have an edge over the rest of the team. Jackson had been an agent for years before becoming head of their team; Angela had been a cop in Virginia. She, on the other hand, had been sought out because she\u2019d refused to doctor film that she\u2019d taken of an actual ghost\u2014because it hadn\u2019t been doctored to begin with! And Adam Harrison, who had put them all together, had been fascinated with her abilities with film and video, and her background, perhaps. However, after they had proved themselves with the Holloway case, they\u2019d all received training, and she was confident in the training she\u2019d received.</p><p>However, a man like Jude Crosby would consider her too inexperienced and too young and maybe even, eventually, too emotional; maybe she was, in a way. A way that she hoped stood her well. Emotions came along with instinct and intuition, and she and the team relied heavily on intuition. When she watched Captain Tyler, she was still somehow convinced of his innocence. The man\u2019s hands shook, perhaps due to Parkinson\u2019s or something, but she was certain that he wasn\u2019t on drugs. She wasn\u2019t sure what she expected; she had never conducted an in-office police interview. The only interviews like this that she\u2019d ever seen had been on television. But Jude was never rude to the man. There were none of the softly spoken questions followed by yelled accusations or hands beating on the table that she had seen on television shows. He just asked Captain Michael Tyler to remember everything about the night and his meeting with Virginia Rockford. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grew very serious, though, leaning forward as he asked, \u201cCaptain Tyler, after Miss Rockford passed by you, what did you do? What did you see? She must have been murdered right after she passed you. If you saw or heard anything else, we need to know.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was surprised when Tyler paused like a man who did have something to contribute. He shivered\u2014or trembled\u2014and then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not always...right. You know, I mean...in the head. I hear explosions when they\u2019re not happening. I see...I see enemy faces in a crowd. I\u2019m not always\u2014right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I understand. But anything you saw or heard or thought that you saw or heard will help me. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man,\u201d Captain Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did this man look like? Did you see him with Miss Rockford?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Tyler shook his head and closed his eyes. He seemed to be in pain. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he was real. He seemed tall in the night, but it might have been his hat. He wore a tall hat. And\u2014and a cloak. And he was carrying something. A bag. Like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a backpack?\u201d Jude pressed.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Like an old doctor\u2019s bag,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Jude sat back a moment, and then asked, \u201cDid you see the man with Ginger Rockford?\u201d</p><p>Tyler said, \u201cNo. I saw him under the street lamp. I saw him from a distance\u2014he was down Broadway when the young woman was telling me I was a junkie. I\u2019ve never been a junkie. I didn\u2019t see his face, but I did see that he looked strange\u2014as if he didn\u2019t belong there. As if he had...stepped out of the mist from some other time.\u201d He winced again, and gripped his trembling hands together. \u201cI told you\u2014I go to the hospital now and then, but...when I\u2019m on the street, I see things.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cThank you. Captain Tyler, can you still write?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jude passed him a legal pad. \u201cPlease, write down everything that you thought you saw. We deeply appreciate your help.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler looked at the pad and held the pencil awkwardly for a moment, and then started writing. Jude waited patiently with him, and then excused himself while Tyler set about finishing his task.</p><p>Jude entered the small chamber where Whitney stood with Green.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not our killer,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Green agreed. \u201cFrom my experience, this man wouldn\u2019t be capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve introduced yourselves, I presume?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cDeputy Chief Nathaniel Green, Whitney Tremont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met, thank you,\u201d the deputy chief said. \u201cWhat do you think about the man he saw? Sounds like the image of the Ripper. Do you think that the media is going to cause everyone out there to start seeing men in stovepipe hats and cloaks, carrying medical bags, around the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Jude said wearily. \u201cBut I still wanted to talk to Captain Tyler myself. We believed that he was in the area, and so it was important to know what he had to say. He\u2019s not the killer. From what he\u2019s said, it\u2019s looking more possible that we do have a psycho out there who wants to be the new Jack the Ripper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllis Sayer called in right before I joined Miss Tremont. He\u2019s talked to Angus Avery, the director on the film Miss Rockford was working on at the site. He\u2019s arranged to meet you at the old diner up in Soho... He should be here in the next half hour.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy chief nodded. \u201cSayer also told me that you\u2019ve set up a meeting with the task force in the morning\u2014let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a quiet night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope. We have anything from Forensics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will soon.\u201d</p><p>Jude started out of the room, and then paused. \u201cSir, do you think we could get someone to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get an officer to see if we can get Captain Tyler into a shelter for the night. He may refuse our help, but I\u2019ll offer what we can,\u201d Green said.</p><p>Jude nodded. He sighed, as if he\u2019d forgotten to pick up a brick he had to carry around his neck.</p><p>\u201cAgent Tremont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Whitney said to Green. It was nice to meet you or it was a pleasure just seemed wrong under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cGood to have you here, Agent Tremont,\u201d Green told her, and she thanked him.</p><p>Once again, she had to hurry to catch up with Jude. He was already moving through the building.</p><p>She realized quickly that he didn\u2019t intend to ditch her\u2014brick around his neck or no, he\u2019d been given his orders regarding her federal involvement along with the rest of the team, and as long as she didn\u2019t get in his way, she\u2019d be fine. He simply assumed that she\u2019d follow at his speed.</p><p>And so she kept up. She was at the passenger\u2019s side of his car again before he could open the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>She buckled in silently. As they pulled out into traffic again, she realized that he glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cYou heard him, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Tyler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I hear very well, Detective. Young ears, you know.\u201d</p><p>She thought that he almost grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what insights the specialty of your team might provide, but I don\u2019t believe that the ghost of Jack the Ripper has come to murder people in New York City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, either,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cBut you do believe in ghosts,\u201d he said. Lord! She\u2019d heard that tone often enough.</p><p>\u201cI believe that, frequently, by looking at the past, we can understand what\u2019s happening in the present,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>He made some kind of snorting sound that was almost beneath his breath.</p><p>Whitney held her silence.</p><p>\u201cGhosts,\u201d he muttered after a minute.</p><p>She turned to stare at him. \u201cDo you have any religious beliefs, Detective? Are you an atheist?\u201d</p><p>She thought his jaw hardened, but it was difficult to tell with him. He hid his emotion well\u2014unless he meant for it to show.</p><p>\u201cDo I believe in God? Yes, I suppose I believe in a higher power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She allowed herself a small sniff.</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrosby\u2014Irish. I\u2019ll bet you grew up Catholic,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTremont\u2014French? Hmm. New Orleans. Catholic\u2014Baptist, voodooist, vampire Buddhist...Wiccan?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, offering him a smile with just a slight edge. He wasn\u2019t happy that he was saddled with a small woman. She was also a woman of mixed heritage who came from a city known for its alternative beliefs\u2014voodoo, mumbo jumbo, as some thought. \u201cObviously, my background is mixed,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut, you see, my point here is that anyone who grew up Catholic, or in many of the Christian religions, already acknowledges a \u2018holy\u2019 ghost in the Nicene Creed. Most of us worship a higher, unseen power. Most people worldwide have some kind of faith in an afterlife, and if we can believe this without seeing what lies beyond, why does it seem so ridiculous that the energy that was life can stay behind?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were on the road ahead of him. She saw the muscles in his face twitch. He didn\u2019t believe that energy stayed behind.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he said, glancing her way, \u201cif you can solve this case with ghosts, just go right on and be my guest.\u201d</p><p>Whitney smiled, not responding. There was something she liked about him, despite his curt manner with her. He had a good strong jawline and steady eyes. She thought he probably hit a gym now and then and she wondered if he spent time with a punching bag\u2014he had callused knuckles.</p><p>\u201cAngus Avery...I know the name. He\u2019s not as big as a Spielberg, but he\u2019s not an unknown,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014your expertise is film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good with it\u2014you wait and see,\u201d she told him. \u201cI worked with some excellent people\u2014filmmakers from several of the major educational channels. I\u2019d intended to make documentaries. Eventually, I would have found my own projects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you woke up one morning and decided you wanted to be an FBI agent?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked over at him. He glanced her way, but his attention was for driving.</p><p>\u201cI like where my life has gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even you will like Jackson Crow and some of the others.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cEven me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pleased to have me hanging around.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he was quiet for a minute. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that Monty\u2014my partner\u2014was like another half of me. We had a situation under control, and some idiot vigilante walked in and one man wound up dead and my partner may never walk again. You\u2019re fine. In fact,\u201d he said, and he grinned broadly, glancing her way again, \u201cI think I\u2019m happier to have you than whoever they might have assigned me. You\u2019re a guest of the city police. You won\u2019t be trying to second-guess me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you\u2019ll have to bow to my decisions\u2014I\u2019m lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the task force will all bow to you,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>He swerved slightly, avoiding a taxi that didn\u2019t seem to realize that there were lanes on Broadway. A few minutes later, in Soho, he pulled into a spot that had looked too small for the car.</p><p>\u201cDiner is up there, on the corner,\u201d he said. He took her elbow, directing her toward the end of the street. Keeping up with him meant long strides, and she took them.</p><p>They entered the touristy diner, which was decorated in red plastic and chrome with old movie posters on the walls. Looking around, Jude pointed down a row of glitter-red plastic booths.</p><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d he asked Whitney.</p><p>She looked. A lone man was sitting in one of the middle booths. He was on his phone, and he\u2019d doodled all over the napkin at his place setting. He had dark hair that was swept over his forehead in a strange way\u2014hair transplant, gotta keep young, Whitney thought\u2014and gold-rimmed glasses and he seemed to be thirty-five or so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cDirectors don\u2019t have their pictures out there all that often, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been nominated for an Academy Award yet.\u201d</p><p>Jude edged her ahead of him and she walked toward the booth. \u201cMr. Avery?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked up and waved a finger at her, pointing at his phone. She held still politely.</p> <p>Jude did not.</p><p>He flipped out his badge, and reached for Angus Avery\u2019s phone, snapping it shut and returning it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mr. Avery. I know that time is money in your line of work, but time could mean someone\u2019s life in mine. I\u2019m Detective Crosby, and this is Agent Tremont.\u201d</p><p>Avery took the closure of his phone with little more than a frown, but he seemed perplexed by Whitney\u2019s appearance. \u201cAgent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Tremont is with a special unit of the FBI, Mr. Angus,\u201d Jude explained, urging Whitney into the booth and taking the seat beside her. \u201cThank you for agreeing to meet with me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Angus Avery nodded, and then shook his head sadly. \u201cHey. This is horrible. But, I have to tell you, I think it\u2019s almost my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed Miss Rockford?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, of course not!\u201d Avery protested. \u201cNo, no\u2014I should have stayed away from that location. I should have shot anywhere else in Manhattan\u2014or Brooklyn, the Bronx, New Jersey or Hollywood, for that matter. It\u2019s that damn location. It\u2019s haunted\u2014and it\u2019s cursed. And God knows\u2014the creature haunting the place might just be Jack the Ripper\u2014the real Jack the Ripper!\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? Jack the Ripper left London and came to the United States. And when he did, that\u2019s where he lived!\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Film people.</p> <p>Great. He couldn\u2019t help it, he glanced at Whitney.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSurely, Mr. Angus, you don\u2019t believe that Jack the Ripper has lived all these years and that he\u2019s just starting out to murder women again? At age one hundred plus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew all about the history of the location. I just doubted all that mumbo-jumbo ghost stuff, just the way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something about the location this morning, but I don\u2019t really know much about it,\u201d Whitney said. She smiled at him. \u201cI went to the film school at NYU, Mr. Angus. I loved living and working up here, but somehow, I never learned about the location you were using for the film shoot yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me tell you about it,\u201d Avery said, leaning toward Whitney.</p><p>Maybe the young woman would turn out to be an odd asset, Jude decided. Angus Avery seemed to like her. She was encouraging him to talk. He did believe\u2014gut feeling\u2014that the movie had something to do with it all. Maybe her background was going to be a good thing.</p><p>\u201cThe building they just tore down had no history. The Darby Building. It was an ugly old thing\u2014built in the 1920s. No character, no class whatsoever. It should have been torn down. But what was on the site before\u2014that\u2019s where all the trouble comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was there before?\u201d Whitney asked. \u201cA friend of mine told me that it had been some kind of spiritualist church.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn offshoot group of some whacked-out folks\u2014now, I suppose it would be some kind of nondenominational thing\u2014started out building a church. Plain church. Simple pews, no statues, no stained-glass windows. They began in the 1840s, but it was too close to St. Paul\u2019s and Trinity to make the powers that be happy. Anyway, it became a \u2018home.\u2019 But it was a home for believers. I think it spent about twenty years becoming an old-fashioned halfway house for the homeless, immigrants, addicts, you name it. But by the end of the last decades of the nineteenth century, spiritualism was coming heavily to the fore, and along with spiritualism, you had devil worshippers, pagan cults and all that rot. So, imagine, you\u2019ve got the House of Spiritualism here, and the Five Points area just blocks away. Slums and a cesspool. So. They start to clean up the Five Points area, and where do you think the real crackpots are going to come? Why, right over to the House of Spiritualism.\u201d</p><p>Angus Avery sat back, looking pleased with himself, as if he\u2019d solved everything.</p><p>\u201cAnd the so-called American victim of Jack the Ripper was killed in the Bowery, and again, we\u2019re talking about a matter of blocks,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jude spoke up. \u201cCarrie Brown was killed in an old hotel.\u201d</p><p>They both looked at him, as if surprised that he was in on their conversation.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was killed in a hotel room. But Jack the Ripper killed Mary Kelly in her apartment. He was better\u2014in his own mind, I\u2019m sure\u2014at his task of \u2018ripping\u2019 when he had time and privacy on his side. Well, here\u2019s the thing\u2014and, Detective Crosby, I believe you\u2019ll find this in old police records or in memoirs of the officers of the time\u2014they believed that the Jack the Ripper mimic or Jack the Ripper himself found lodging at the House of Spiritualism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe that by renting the location for your film shoot you awakened the ghost of Jack the Ripper\u2014or Jack the Ripper himself,\u201d Jude said, trying very hard to keep his tone low and even.</p><p>Angus Avery shook his head unhappily. \u201cWe were finished with the site after that day\u2019s shoot\u2014we\u2019d broken down. We were already planning on moving. But I called off all shooting for today\u2014everywhere in the city. Can you even begin to imagine what that will do to my budget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you choose the location?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, the real shots we could get. And the fact that the financial district is actually shaped more like the Five Points that once was than the area that was Five Points! The movie takes place in the late eighteen hundreds. Shooting there, we could use the streets with some editing and CGI. And I had a great, almost barren landscape for the set designers to create facades. You\u2019d be surprised at what you have when you black out modern additions to downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a giant pit at the location\u2014dangerous,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Avery waved a hand in the air. \u201cWe had it barricaded during the filming, and all kinds of people keeping watch. Production assistants and city engineers. We had a permit that included working a large section of Broadway,\u201d Avery said. \u201cI knew about the location, but, as I said, I thought it was all a bunch of hogwash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd right next door, you had Blair House. It\u2019s pristine\u2014you could have done some great shooting there,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude squeezed her hand beneath the table; he didn\u2019t want her announcing that the team was staying at Blair House. Especially since the team wasn\u2019t all here yet. As the day went by, he found himself more concerned that they had Whitney Tremont housed at Blair House\u2014alone\u2014for tonight.</p><p>\u201cBlair House is under federal jurisdiction at the moment. I don\u2019t know exactly which historical association is in charge, but it\u2019s on the national list of historic places. I don\u2019t believe that a permit would have been given out for the use of it right now, no matter what was promised to the city,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Avery said with a sigh. He brightened. \u201cBut, we did get some great footage of the facade. In fact, the Blair House facade\u2014cleaned up, CGI\u2014will be the house of ill repute where our movie prostitutes were settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what was the movie you were making?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cAm making. O\u2019Leary\u2019s. I\u2019m afraid the loss of an extra doesn\u2019t stop the giant wheels of a movie turning forever. And don\u2019t think badly of me, please. Movies have been completed when the featured stars have died. Everyone can\u2019t take the hit. Lord knows, in this country, we have to keep people employed and the money moving these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a humanitarian,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Whitney kicked his ankle.</p><p>\u201cAnd the movie is?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cA love story,\u201d Avery said. \u201cA love story set amidst the squalor of the final days of the Five Points region of New York City. I mean, seriously, it\u2019s hard to imagine what it was like. Tenements were so crowded that the living often walked over the dead. Gangs were kings...politics were crooked. Sewage was a real killer\u2014disease ran rampant. My movie, O\u2019Leary\u2019s, is about two young people who rise above the horror and corruption to make it to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. They moved to Gramercy Park!\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Finally, he\u2019d managed something that the filmmaker could seize upon. \u201cPrecisely!\u201d Avery said with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMr. Avery, what time did you leave the set yesterday?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>Avery was thoughtful. Many people immediately shrank suspiciously from the question, aware that it was not harmless. But the man seemed to be remembering his day. \u201cI left by five. One of my assistant directors worked on a few last shots with the prostitutes. I headed to midtown. I gave a speech to a class from the fashion institute at their dinner at six.\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t ask Avery if there were witnesses; he\u2019d check on it himself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Avery, we have a witness who saw a man in costume on the street\u2014a nineteenth-century cloak and tall hat, like a stovepipe hat,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cWas your witness a wino living on the streets? Or was your witness the killer?\u201d Avery asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have nineteenth-century costuming on your cast, Mr. Avery,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cPerhaps the killer is stealing from your wardrobe department?\u201d</p><p>Avery shook his head. \u201cYou may speak to my costume designer and the wardrobe mistress. I insist on all costumes being returned at the end of the day. If a costume wasn\u2019t returned, I\u2019d have known it. I might be making a movie, but any half-baked costume shop in town might have a cloak and a stovepipe hat! Look, please, check my alibi\u2014and check my work record. It couldn\u2019t have been me, and I guarantee you, my wardrobe mistress would have been fired if there had been anything missing.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s alibi didn\u2019t actually clear him. He might have given a speech\u2014and returned, Jude thought. New York traffic\u2014always a major \u201cif\u201d factor in the city. And, still, by the time Virginia Rockford had been killed, there had been very little traffic downtown. Avery could have well done everything exactly as he had said\u2014and still arrived back on Broadway in time to commit murder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow well did you know Miss Rockford?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cKnow her? I didn\u2019t know her at all,\u201d Avery said.</p><p>\u201cBut she was working on your film,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>\u201cDirectors seldom hire the extras,\u201d Whitney said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, well, of course not,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cHer death, however, devastates me,\u201d Avery said.</p><p>A waitress stopped by their table; Jude ordered coffee and Whitney did the same. Avery already had a cup before him.</p><p>When she was gone, Avery became businesslike. \u201cI\u2019ve asked my office to make sure that your fellow officer\u2014Detective Sayer\u2014has a list of everyone associated with the film, and what their position is. Except for poor Miss Rockford, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an idea of anyone else who might have stayed behind last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a guard who stays on until the last actor, costumer, production assistant\u2014even caterer\u2014has left the set for the day. Last night that would have been a fellow named Samuel Vintner. My offices have given Detective Sayer everything he could possibly need\u2014phone numbers, addresses, even social security numbers. We desperately want to see this murder solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your help,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>Angus Avery wagged a finger in the air again, directed at them both. \u201cYou mark my words. It\u2019s evil land. I think that they were burying people in the walls and foundations. I think that you\u2019ll find that Jack the Ripper\u2014the real Ripper\u2014is buried somewhere on that location. You have to find the corpse and burn it and say lots of prayers. Maybe that will stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to catch a flesh-and-blood killer before anyone else dies,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Avery, there might have been someone\u2014someone working on your movie\u2014who had a grudge against Virginia Rockford,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cThere might have been. I told you, I didn\u2019t know the girl,\u201d Avery said, sounding impatient at last. \u201cYou have the names and office address of the casting directors. Madison and May Casting\u2014they\u2019re actually on Madison. They can tell you all about the extras.\u201d He stood. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I have a date with a bottle of blended scotch whiskey and a friend. This is becoming a nightmare, what with my actors in a stew and the press all over everything in the world...forgive me. Order dinner on my tab, if you like. I need to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed nothing unusual on the set at all?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014the location is cursed. We had a fellow die of a heart attack when he was moving set pieces. That was unusual. Natural causes, though, that\u2019s what they said. And we had a few injuries, too. It\u2019s the location. Go dig up the Ripper, burn his bones and the world will be back to normal. Down to a few domestic, drug and gang murders a week!\u201d Avery had grown really impatient. \u201cI\u2019m easy to find, Detective Crosby. But, please, I\u2019m a busy man. Call me only if you believe I can really help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, police business does take precedence. Rest assured, I don\u2019t like to waste my time. But if I feel that I need you, I will find you, no problem. Wherever you are,\u201d Jude assured him.</p><p>Avery\u2019s lips tightened as he rose and walked out, a clipboard in his hands. Jude watched as he headed out to the street\u2014and a waiting stretch limo.</p><p>\u201cAre we having dinner on him?\u201d Whitney asked him.</p><p>\u201cNope, and I\u2019m not seeing his movie, either,\u201d Jude said, rising. He looked at the three cups of coffee and laid a bill on the table, and then lifted a hand, hailing their waitress. When she arrived at the table, he said, \u201cMiss, I need that cup, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a police officer. If you need to get the manager, do so. That cup is evidence in a case I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a Baggie?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe cup is all yours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I carry my own,\u201d he told her.</p><p>In a few minutes, he\u2019d secured the cup that Avery had been drinking from. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He flipped his phone out and put through a call. \u201cEllis? Hey, yes, I\u2019ve met with Angus Avery. I want the limos that worked that film site yesterday impounded. You\u2019ll need warrants, but you won\u2019t have a problem getting them now. I want Forensics going through them.\u201d</p><p>He listened for a minute. \u201cI know everyone is working around the clock. Get the limos in anyway. They\u2019ll get to them.\u201d He listened again. \u201cYep, thanks, Ellis.\u201d He hung up and looked at Whitney.</p><p>\u201cWhere to now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jude hesitated, and then offered her a twisted grin. \u201cI\u2019m going to drop off the cup at the lab, and then I\u2019m bringing you home to meet Dad, Whitney. Seems like the thing to do after this conversation.\u201d</p><p>Andrew Crosby lived in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, also known as Clinton, which, for some reason, had become a more politically correct term for the area. His home was in a building that appeared to have been built in the late eighteen hundreds. Flowers grew in little patches of earth that might be called a yard, and when they entered the hallway and climbed the stairs to the two second-floor apartments, one of the doors was open.</p><p>Jude actually lived in the same building; his was the apartment next door. Years ago, when the place had gone co-op, his father had purchased the apartments. His dad\u2019s foresight was something for which he was eternally grateful. Living in New York was expensive.</p><p>At first, too, after his mother\u2019s death, he\u2019d been glad that he was so close. And now, with the life he led, it was still good to be next door. Andrew had never been the type to intrude; he was there when needed.</p><p>\u201cJude, been expecting you all day!\u201d his father said in a booming voice, greeting them at the entry.</p><p>\u201cWhitney, meet my dad, Andrew Crosby. Dad, this is Whitney Tremont. She\u2019s with the feds who have been sent down on this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fed! Nice,\u201d Andrew said, greeting Whitney warmly. Naturally, Whitney still seemed lost, since he had told his dad that she was there, but hadn\u2019t told her anything about his father other than that he was good at puzzles, knew the city like the back of his hand and would be expecting him. \u201cI have pasta ready for the pot, and I\u2019ve been brewing up a sauce all day. It\u2019s meat sauce. I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t expecting you, Agent Tremont. I hope you\u2019re not a vegetarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but I do have a team member who is, if you ever need to host us all for some reason,\u201d Whitney told him. She was smiling. Well, his father was likable.</p><p>As they chatted, Jude saw that Whitney learned that Andrew Crosby had worked his way up the ranks without benefit of higher education, and he had reached the rank of lieutenant. He\u2019d worked the worst streets, the most unusual crimes and, been commended for bravery several times. He\u2019d retired just a decade ago, when Jude\u2019s mother had first been diagnosed with cancer. He\u2019d spent every day at her side until she had slipped away.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re having me to dinner, I hope I\u2019m able to return the favor,\u201d Whitney told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I must say, seems that I\u2019d like that, if the rest of your team members are anything like you. But, of course, we\u2019ve got a situation going,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cYou two haven\u2019t been watching television, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>He led them past the entrance. The apartment was just as it had been a decade ago. Jude had finally convinced his dad\u2014when his mom had been gone two years\u2014that she would have been angry with him if he hadn\u2019t given her clothing and shoes to Goodwill. But the throw she had knitted remained on the couch; her doilies still covered the occasional tables. The only concession his father had made to modern living was the entertainment center; he had a good flat-screen television, a sound stereo system and even Rock Band and a Wii Playstation.</p><p>As they followed him into the living room, Andrew picked up the remote control and hit a play button on the television.</p><p>Jude frowned, not certain what he was watching at first. Then he realized that the two beautiful young people on the screen were giving a press conference.</p><p>\u201cBobby Walden and Sherry Blanco,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>\u201cThe leads in Angus Avery\u2019s movie?\u201d Jude murmured.</p><p>\u201cI knew her only briefly, only in passing,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut Ginger Rockford was a beautiful person, and we\u2019re all horrified at her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis movie is dedicated to her memory!\u201d Sherry Blanco put in, dabbing at a tear.</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you afraid? Aren\u2019t you afraid to continue filming?\u201d one of the reporters asked. Jude squinted. It appeared as if they\u2019d done the press conference in front of the Plaza. They were standing on red-carpeted steps, and the press was kept at a distance by velvet ropes. It was almost like a premiere night.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cWe owe it to Ginger to finish the film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course\u2014\u201d a man in a suit\u2014one of their agents?\u2014stepped in front of the microphone \u201c\u2014of course, we\u2019re increasing security on the set. We\u2019re cutting all night hours and doubling up on our security personnel. And we\u2019ve negotiated new locations for the rest of the shoot, though! Rest assured. We will remain in this great city!\u201d</p><p>Those words were greeted by a roar of applause.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a murderer on the streets\u2014a heinous killer\u2014and what really matters is that America\u2019s sweethearts are going to finish a movie,\u201d Jude said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cNothing you can do about pop culture, son. I just thought you should see this,\u201d Andrew told him.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cToo small. I don\u2019t think she could have managed the kind of strength needed,\u201d Andrew agreed.</p><p>Jude looked at the two of them. They had taken up positions on the sofa, watching as Andrew ran the recorded version of the press conference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. You two have eliminated a suspect. Now we just have to eliminate about another eight million people or so,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it narrowed down,\u201d Andrew said with confidence.</p><p>Jude lowered his head, hiding a smile. His father always had confidence. He\u2019d never given up on one of his own cases, though it was true that far too many went unsolved, despite the best work of dedicated people and excellent forensics labs.</p> <p>The press conference ended with a public service announcement: Sherry Blanco begged the women of New York City to be careful, and to be safe. When two anchors came back on, talking about the celebrity of those involved, Andrew shut the television off.</p><p>\u201cDad, I need anything you have on the construction site down by Blair House. The director\u2014Angus Avery\u2014just told us that it had been a kind of church for devil worshippers at some time before the recently razed structure was there,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Andrew said thoughtfully. \u201cWell, then. Come into my den,\u201d he said.</p><p>His father loved history; always had. In fact, sometimes, when he\u2019d been a child, his father\u2019s love of history had driven both him and his mother mad. They\u2019d had to tent one time with the rebels at Monmouth, canoe down rough water in the wake of Teddy Roosevelt and follow the path of George Washington. Most of the time, however, his father\u2019s love of adventure had been wonderful.</p><p>And it could prove very helpful now.</p> <p>The apartment was designed in an ell, and they followed Andrew through the kitchen and dining room to the room that had once been the extra, or guest, bedroom and was now his father\u2019s library.</p><p>He noted that his dad didn\u2019t show Whitney his old room, now kind of a back parlor and not much different than it had been. Apparently, Andrew had silently decided that whatever Jude wanted to tell Whitney about his father\u2019s place and his own was Jude\u2019s call.</p><p>There was a large accountant\u2019s desk in the center of the room, a number of overstuffed chairs and the walls were lined floor to ceiling with books. One wall contained fiction, his father\u2019s favorites, from Poe and H. G. Wells down to more contemporary authors like Robert McCammon and F. Paul Wilson. He had a fine collection of works by Dickens, Defoe and others as well; this wall also contained his fictionalized history.</p><p>The back wall was totally dedicated to fiction and nonfiction on the city and state of New York, while the last wall offered books on American and world history.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cBooks\u2014my weakness,\u201d Andrew told her, looking through his titles. \u201cHere! The House of Spiritualism. It\u2019s a first edition, written by a fellow named Magnor Honeywell in 1910. He was on the police force in Lower Manhattan from 1880 to 1905. He had firsthand experience of everything going on in the city, and he was there during the final days of the Five Points dismantling. This book can at least give you an insight into what was going on back then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is fabulous!\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIt\u2019s a first edition, though\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s nothing, if it can help,\u201d Andrew assured her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ll bet you take care of your books.\u201d</p><p>Whitney immediately started thumbing through it and let out a pleased cry, scanning information here and there. \u201cIt\u2019s the best description I\u2019ve seen on Carrie Brown,\u201d she said. She looked at Jude. \u201cShe was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who she was,\u201d Jude said. \u201cShe was a prostitute found dead in room 31 of the East River Hotel, mutilated\u2014in the manner that Jack the Ripper\u2019s victims had been mutilated. Since she was found on April 24, 1891, it was easy for the reporters camped out on Mulberry Street to determine that the Ripper had left London after his horrendous mutilation of Mary Kelly at the end of 1888, and come to America. Oh, by the way, check my exact figures on this, but I believe she was something like the forty-fifth person to die violently that year\u2014even with the Five Points region having been cleaned up. A man named Ameer Ben Ali\u2014aka Frenchy\u2014was arrested and convicted of the murder, and later exonerated. Chief Inspector Thomas Byrnes made an ass of himself, since he\u2019d claimed that if the Ripper ever came to America, he\u2019d catch him in twenty-four hours. Byrnes practiced a form of psychological torture on criminals that really created the term the third degree. He was supposedly larger than life, but totally corrupt, amassing a fortune of over a quarter-million dollars when he was only making a salary of about two thousand. He was forced to resign in 1895 when a new president of the New York City Police Commission came in\u2014Theodore Roosevelt. Whether Carrie Brown\u2019s murder was or wasn\u2019t the work of the Jack the Ripper, he was never caught.\u201d</p><p>Whitney stared at him, smiling slowly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too impressed. He went to a police symposium in Britain, kind of like a look at how to improve things for detectives on both sides of the briny,\u201d Andrew said, but Jude saw that his father was grinning. He smiled in return. His father was a good man; at seventy, he was spry and dignified, almost as tall as Jude and straight as an arrow. \u201cKeep flipping those pages, and you\u2019ll find info on the House of Spiritualism itself,\u201d he told Whitney. \u201cI\u2019m going to set out dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can. It\u2019s just pasta. You read,\u201d Andrew told her. He left them both, heading to the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s an impressive man,\u201d Whitney told Jude.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She started reading, sinking into one of the chairs. Jude excused himself, walked back out to the living room and pulled out his phone to put through another call to Ellis Sayer.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many people were on that set during the day?\u201d Sayer asked him over the wires.</p><p>Jude liked Ellis Sayer. He was the most thorough man Jude had ever met; he was glad to have him on the task force because he was so anal that he checked out every little tiny detail\u2014and that sometimes mattered.</p><p>\u201cYeah. A ton. I\u2019ve got the lists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds. We\u2019ve sifted through the caterers, and eliminated them from being on set past six o\u2019clock. Most of the actors were gone by seven, the designers, camera crew, lighting...they were all out by eight-thirty. Here\u2019s the thing, of course\u2014they could have come back. You met with the director\u2014Angus Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The ghost of the Ripper killed her, according to him. He\u2019s convinced that evil lurks on that construction site\u2014Jack the Ripper did come to America, and was buried there, and has now been dug up with the demolition of the building. And the ghost is pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s what he told me, too. But I knew you\u2019d want to speak with him yourself. I\u2019ve spoken with the principal actors, and limos picked them both up early. But I\u2019m sure you want to speak with them, too. They\u2019ll be at the station tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jude rubbed his forehead. \u201cYes, that\u2019s going to be important,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sayer was silent for a minute. \u201cJude, we\u2019re not going to get this guy tonight, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m not going to call Fullbright again...he\u2019ll never answer my calls again if I do. All he\u2019ll tell me is that she was butchered like a Ripper victim. I think Fullbright is actually excited about the possibility. Scary. But I guess he spends his days with bodies. That\u2019s what\u2019s so scary to me\u2014people are excited by this murder. You\u2019d think the movies would be enough for them,\u201d Ellis added with disgust.</p><p>\u201cDo you know, by the way, if Captain Tyler went to a shelter?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cThe old vet who saw a man in a dark cloak and stovepipe hat, carrying a medical bag?\u201d Sayer asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s the only description we\u2019ve gotten of anyone in the vicinity,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cExcept for Captain Tyler himself, who admits to being there,\u201d Sayer reminded him. \u201cBut, yes, the old guy is fine. He agreed that he might need a breathing treatment, so he\u2019s at a place that\u2019s kind of a halfway house for vets\u2014it offers some medical assistance, and rooms with more of a homelike atmosphere. Hannah did some research on the place, and she seemed to like it best. She said he could be happy there\u2014not living in the midst of the urine and antiseptic smell of a shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really our only suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If you didn\u2019t see him, you didn\u2019t see how his hands trembled. No way he could have held a knife and carried out the murder,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him. The deputy chief filled me in on him. So, he\u2019s not a viable suspect. Okay, so I\u2019m looking for Jack the Ripper?\u201d Sayer asked.</p><p>\u201cMore or less. Keep your men questioning cast and crew,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be a full-time job for the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got patrol cars doubled up down there, right?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Come on, you asked for me because I\u2019m good,\u201d Sayer told him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ellis. Keep me posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>When Jude hung up, he heard his father call, \u201cChow\u2019s on. And, hey, you want to be good at your jobs\u2014you got to fuel the human engine.\u201d</p><p>Whitney joined him from the library as he headed for the dining room. Andrew had set out the pasta and a salad and bottles of red wine and soda. \u201cDidn\u2019t know if you wanted to indulge in a glass of wine this evening,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d indulge in a lot more,\u201d Jude said, but he reached over to pour them each a glass of cabernet. \u201cThanks, Dad. This is a nice break. We do have to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMangia, mangia!\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI had an Italian grandmother,\u201d he told Whitney.</p><p>Whitney thanked him for the meal, but couldn\u2019t hold back her excitement over her reading. \u201cDid you know, when the city started the demolition of the tenements in the Five Points region, a lot of plain old thugs became interested in the House of Spiritualism? The movement\u2014or modern spiritualism\u2014began to rise in 1848 with the Fox sisters claiming to communicate with the dead, and from then on, it grew. There were all kinds of charlatan mediums taking people for large sums, and that\u2019s what went on mostly at the House of Spiritualism at first. But then it took a twist. By the later 1880s and into the 1890s, those who were less than scrupulous were joined by those who had downright devilish desires. It was still a time when orphaned and immigrant children were barely valued. Only occasionally did the papers mention that a child had disappeared, or a young woman. While the police suspected that a number of murderers and sadists were taking refuge at the society, they couldn\u2019t prove anything. A raid in 1890 produced nothing at all. But, there was a rumor that Carrie Brown\u2019s killer was a member of the so-called church, a mysterious newcomer who had arrived from Britain. It\u2019s suspected that he died there, but everything about the man was rumor. There were no records of his arrival or even his existence, but the police heard that he was so sadistic that he scared the people there, and that they killed and buried him secretly somewhere on the property. They found Carrie Brown, but there were still nearby alleys and overcrowded tenements, and it\u2019s believed he killed more victims, but in the overcrowding, constant crime and corruption of the time, they were probably immigrants and their bodies were decayed when discovered, and treated like refuse. Oh, you will like this. He went by the name of Jack. Jonathan Black.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSad, very sad,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>\u201cRight.

But, then again, as human beings, it seems that we haven\u2019t come so far.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cLook at the victim we found today,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve unearthed the body or soul of Jonathan Black and that he\u2019s terrorizing Lower Manhattan. There\u2019s someone out there, a psychotic but organized killer, with an agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed\u2014but what if he is someone who knows all the history of the area?\u201d Whitney asked. \u201cSomeone who is working to re-create the crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngus Avery seems to know all about it,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cAnd this will give his movie more publicity than money could ever buy,\u201d Andrew noted.</p><p>Don\u2019t argue with the man! Whitney warned herself.</p> <p>Jude wanted to bring her back to Blair House after dinner; she didn\u2019t have to stay up with him. He was just going to make the proper calls to assure himself that Angus Avery had indeed spoken at a dinner that took place in Midtown, and talk with the driver who had been assigned to get him around the city. He was going to have records pulled on the major players in the movie, and also get an interview with the ex-cop who had last been on duty at the site.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do shift work\u2014I\u2019m here to work the case,\u201d Whitney told him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven-thirty for the task force meeting,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI\u2019m on to paperwork and phone work, mundane telephone stuff. There\u2019s no reason for you not to settle in and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at Blair House, though, he hesitated in the car.</p><p>They\u2019d passed several patrol cars\u2014the police were making their presence known in the area.</p><p>But Blair House was dark, except for the slender porch light, and the street lamps illuminating the construction site were sadly lacking in strength.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not afraid of the dark,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be.\u201d</p><p>Whitney grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in ghosts, and they\u2019re not going to bother me. And if there\u2019s a real human threat, remember, I have a gun, and I know how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is ever invulnerable,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, really,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>As she was about to get out of the car, she felt her phone buzz. She paused to see the message she was receiving.</p><p>Whitney sucked in her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jude asked her.</p> <p>She passed him the phone. There was a likeness on the screen. \u201cI know you have police artists, and that they\u2019ve surely worked with what you have. But Jake Mallory is really a technical wizard. He\u2019s worked every angle of the pictures I\u2019ve sent him, and this is the likeness he has created from \u2018Jane Doe wet\u2019 that I sent him today.\u201d</p><p>Jude stared at the image. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a computer in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And I have a mobile broadband card, so we can connect anywhere you like.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be appraising her with new eyes; she had proven that the team might just be of use.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She still had all the keys for the team on the band that the driver had given her, and it took her a minute to open the gate and then the front door to the house. Once inside, she told him that it would take her a minute to set up her computer, but he assured her that it was no problem. She moved quickly, racing upstairs to the room she had chosen, hurrying back down and finding that she could easily set up in the broad hallway at an old desk situated below the stairs. In another minute, she had the image on the large screen, and it was so good that it looked like a photograph. Jake had sent her a note next to the image: Naturally, don\u2019t know about eye color, but from what you sent, computer said her hair was brown. Hope this helps; see you tomorrow.</p><p>Jude leaned over her shoulder, staring at the image on the screen. The woman pictured appeared to be in her mid-thirties. She looked a little the worse for wear, as if she had spent long years abusing alcohol or drugs.</p><p>\u201cJust about thirty-five,\u201d Jude said as if reading her thoughts. \u201cThat\u2019s the age Fullbright estimated as well.\u201d He looked at her. His face was close; the lamplight gave his skin a bronze cast. She felt a little tremor shoot through her. She liked his face. She wished that she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOur next step,\u201d he told her, \u201cwas going to be to remove the head, dissolve the flesh\u2014Fullbright likes maggots, actually\u2014and then send the skull to a woman down at the Smithsonian. But...may I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She stood, letting him take the chair at the desk. She watched as he emailed the likeness to someone, typing, \u201cI know it\u2019s late. Use any newspaper contact. I need this out there\u2014neighborhood websites, flyers, too. Copy should just read, \u2018Do you know this woman?\u2019\u201d</p><p>A second later, he got his reply. \u201cOn it, Jude. Not too late. I can get it in for tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was up. I\u2019ve kind of got a guy, Jude. We have coffee. We chat. Who knows... I was on the phone with him when you emailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m always your girl first, Jude.\u201d</p><p>Jude replied, \u201cYou\u2019re a good egg, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best.\u201d</p><p>He eased back in the chair, and then sat forward again, emailing the likeness to himself. Then he rose, looking at her strangely. \u201cThanks. Yes, we\u2019ve had some sketches done. But...this is\u2014detailed. It\u2019s as if she could walk off the page. I don\u2019t know if we can find out who she was, and if we do, if that can help us catch her killer, but...hey. Everyone deserves a burial, and no one deserves to die like that.\u201d</p><p>Whitney nodded. \u201cSure. I agree.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if they shared a bizarrely awkward moment. He had discovered that he didn\u2019t dislike her and she just might be useful.</p><p>She had just discovered that she liked way too much about him.</p><p>\u201cListen, I have a two-bedroom place in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and you\u2019re more than welcome to come back with me. I\u2019d appreciate it, actually. I don\u2019t like thinking about you down here by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, too?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThe apartment next to my father. He was bright enough to buy when things went co-op a couple of decades ago, and I just pay him a minimum rent\u2014his pleasure money, as he calls it. I think he charges me because he knew I wouldn\u2019t accept the place if I didn\u2019t pay him something. And, hey, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to have you for the night, too.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted. Really tempted. She wasn\u2019t afraid of Blair House, or of being alone. She was afraid that the more she was with him, the more she liked him, and the more she was close to him, the more she realized that he was really an attractive man\u2014and she was attracted to him. Not a good thing on the first day of a new investigation.</p><p>Whitney certainly had no desire to appear to be afraid just to be with him\u2014or anyone.</p><p>And he probably didn\u2019t understand that she needed to be in the house by herself for the night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, honestly. Like I told you earlier, I\u2019m not the fearful type. And I have some work to do tonight. I have to decide where I think we\u2019ll need our camera equipment, and just what we may want to film or record on tape...\u201d</p><p>He stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cWe always keep track of what happens around us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, we\u2019ll want to watch the property next door.\u201d</p><p>He still stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOh. For shadows and ghosts and things?\u201d he asked. His tone was polite.</p><p>\u201cFor anything that\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me\u2014it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And I\u2019m okay, really. I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and it was a real smile.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not staying here would make you the intelligent type,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She grinned at that. \u201cThank you. Sincerely, thank you. But I have a phone. There are cruisers in the street tonight. I\u2019m not going back out, and I\u2019ll sleep with my gun under my pillow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded; her words were rational.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ll be here at seven-thirty, sharp. You need a wake-up call or anything?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cNo, but thanks again. I have an alarm on my phone. I\u2019ll be fine. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>She walked him to the door. \u201cGood night, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated just a minute, gray eyes guarded. \u201cI look forward to meeting the rest of your team.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Again, the moment felt slightly awkward; almost as if they\u2019d been on a strange date all day.</p><p>She made sure he heard her sliding the bolts on the front door as he left, and she watched through one of the etched-glass windows in the door as he walked back out to his car.</p><p>When he was gone, Whitney walked through the house, leaving the large hallway light on as she wandered the downstairs. She could well imagine that it would be a fine tourist attraction when the renovations were done.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any of the equipment; that would arrive with the others. But it would be good to have a sense of where she wanted cameras and recording devices.</p><p>Upstairs, Whitney took stock of the bedrooms. There were six of them, and everything in the house seemed to be proportionate. Three on one side, three on the other.</p><p>She paused at a window that overlooked the construction site next door. The book she read that day had shown pictures of the structure that had been there when it had been the House of Spiritualism; then, a two-story building with a circular porch had stood. The steeple was still standing toward what had been the rear of the structure. People had entered from the same sidewalk that led to the path to Blair House. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whitney stood in the darkness, watching the site. Patrol cars rounded the corner regularly, and she was pretty sure that when Jude Crosby left her, he had called in to make sure that the cars would watch Blair House throughout the night.</p><p>When the equipment arrived, she knew that they would want to keep a good eye on the site.</p><p>Pulling her phone from her pocket, she saw that it was nearly midnight. The time had gone so quickly that day. She told herself that she had to be tired; she had not known this morning that she\u2019d be spending the night in New York City. But she wasn\u2019t tired; she was wound up.</p> <p>In the kitchen, she brewed herself hot tea and made mental notes about where she wanted cameras set up. She wanted a couple of cameras looking down Broadway at all times, but, of course, they couldn\u2019t cover every possible nook and cranny and shadow. Yet the cameras would catch movement of anyone who did come onto the street.</p><p>Finally, she went back into the hallway. She stood very still, waiting. Nothing happened. No shadows moved. The old house didn\u2019t even creak.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did everyone die in this house in a state of absolute bliss?\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>Nothing. Just the darkness.</p><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t Blair House where the supposed evil had taken place; it had been next door, at the House of Spiritualism. But she wasn\u2019t an idiot, and she wasn\u2019t going to go out to explore the area until the rest of the team had arrived.</p> <p>At last she convinced herself that it was time to get some sleep. She put her service revolver on the little table next to the bed, changed into pajamas and curled up to sleep.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t sleep, and so she rose, and in the quiet of the night, headed for the stairs.</p><p>Downstairs, she looked at the pictures she had taken at autopsy. They were a good record, and she would show them to the others, but at the moment, they weren\u2019t giving her any information that would help in finding a suspect.</p><p>She found the book that Andrew Crosby had loaned her. It was fascinating reading, all about the demise of the Five Points area, the House of Spiritualism and the founding of the NYPD. And the murder of Carrie Brown.</p><p>The author had been convinced that there had been other victims.</p><p>She tried to imagine the squalor of the Five Points area, so near to this one. What had happened to the sea of humanity that had lived in those tenements when they had been brought down? The area had been so similar to Whitechapel in London; filled with immigrants eking out an existence. Filled with crime\u2014and police who increased their incomes by taking bribe money from all the establishments in the area. Money paid so that the police force would protect shop owners from thugs and criminals; money paid so that the police would overlook code infractions and other illegal activities.</p> <p>She smiled; impressed and thinking about Jude Crosby. The man was truly intelligent and well read. He wasn\u2019t unlike most of humanity; he believed in what he saw, in flesh and blood. In bad people who did bad things.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes\u2014there is a truly evil person, flesh and blood out there,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut, if someone is in this house, I\u2019d love to speak with you!\u201d she added. Nothing.</p><p>Hoping she could sleep at last, she closed the book, headed back upstairs and willed herself to try to sleep. Finally she dozed, and then she slept deeply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dream. No images flashed through her mind in the night, at least none that she could hold and retain.</p><p>When she woke up, sun was filtering through the chintz drapes.</p><p>She yawned and stretched, and looked toward the foot of the bed.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>A woman stood there, her image hazy and then solid. She appeared to be in late Victorian dress; her clothing was poor, simple cotton. A crocheted mantle sat over her shoulders. Her hair was queued, and yet tendrils were escaping. She looked to be about thirty, but her appearance was worn and tired...</p> <p>Like that of the image of Jane Doe wet Jake had created from her death photos.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t Jane Doe wet. She had lived long before Jane Doe wet.</p><p>Whitney thought that she heard something, like a whimpering. She realized that the woman wasn\u2019t alone. At her side was a large hound, a mix between a shepherd and a wolfhound, perhaps, but a large shaggy creature that stood valiantly at her side.</p><p>The woman began fading away again.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, stay!\u201d Whitney begged.</p><p>The dog lingered just a moment longer.</p><p>But the woman disappeared, and then, more slowly, the dog. Whitney was left to wonder if the images had really been there, of if she had imagined both the woman and canine in the desperate hope that she could learn something from the beyond.</p><p>5</p><p>It was barely the crack of dawn when Jude pulled the last of his information sheets from the printer in his home office and arranged his discourse for the task force meeting the next morning. He had pictures and every note taken on the Jane Does, and he had every note they\u2019d thus far acquired regarding Virginia Rockford as well. And, he had drawn up a time line of Jack the Ripper in London, the murder of Carrie Brown and everything he could find on the House of Spiritualism as well. There was nothing to be found on the mysterious Jonathan Black other than what had been written by his contemporaries. Hannah was searching records, but she had found nothing that registered he\u2019d been in the country, or in the city of New York.</p><p>It was possible, of course, that the murders were not related in any way, and that the murder of Virginia Rockford was unrelated to any past or present Ripper. But Deputy Chief Green had been disturbed enough by the similarities to call in a special unit, and there was no reason not to entertain anything that might help in the investigation.</p><p>He dreaded the thought that another victim would tell them whether or not they were moving in the right direction.</p><p>Allison, his blue-eyed mixed-breed cat, meowed, cleaning her paws as she sat at the edge of his desk.</p><p>\u201cToo damn bad they hadn\u2019t invented credit cards back then,\u201d he told the cat.</p><p>He was startled by a knock at the side door to his office.</p><p>When his dad had bought the apartments, they\u2019d discovered that the place had once been owned by a notorious madam, Madam Shelley, who had been a voyeur. What had appeared to be wall actually hid a door, and that door led to the apartment next door. When he\u2019d had to fix the wall because of water damage from a leaking pipe on the floor above, they\u2019d found out that there had been an entrance and exit between the two apartments\u2014and a way for the madam to spy on her clients.</p><p>They\u2019d kept the exit/entrance something of a secret door. Jude\u2019s father had never interfered with his life, and it was nice that he was close. He could feed Allison when Jude wound up working crazy hours on a case.</p><p>He stood to unlock the door, letting his dad in.</p><p>Andrew remained on his side of the doorway, hands behind his back, waiting for an invitation in. Jude smiled, looking into his dad\u2019s back parlor. A lot of the things crammed in here had been his own\u2014a huge desk and computer and game player, for example; the shelves were crowded with books, and more. Animal skulls, comics, Star Trek and Star Wars toys and all kinds of collectibles.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I know it\u2019s early but I heard you rattling around in here,\u201d Andrew said. He grinned and drew his hands from behind his back, producing a large paper coffee cup. \u201cDidn\u2019t know if you\u2019d bothered to brew yourself any.\u201d</p><p>Jude took the cup, stepping back. \u201cThanks. Good and strong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, killer strong, just the way you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in. You know I always appreciate your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe media just keeps going crazy. Slow day for catastrophes yesterday,\u201d Andrew said with a shrug. \u201cNo storms or oil spills or other such activity. The major cable stations have all hopped on the bandwagon. Everyone across the globe has to be getting information regarding Virginia Rockford. I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019s happy in heaven. She found her fifteen minutes of fame\u2014a lot more than fifteen minutes. There are even some takes from that movie on the internet\u2014don\u2019t know how people got them. Well, barriers can only keep onlookers so far\u2014it\u2019s gone viral. That movie is going to make a fortune!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess it is,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t hesitate, son, if you want any help on anything, let me know. There\u2019s got to be something else useful in my book collection. if you want any research done and your folks are bogged down\u2014though I guess you have half the department on it\u2014let me know, okay. Even if it\u2019s just coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll take you up on that. And, hey, I\u2019m going to leave my side of the door unlocked. Will you check in on Allison this evening, give her an ear rub and make sure she has water and food?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Andrew laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll even clean the litter box! I can see you gotta get out of here. Talk to you later.\u201d He turned to close the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>His dad paused, brows arching with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got lots of people, but you are a reader and you have one of the best book collections I\u2019ve ever seen. Keep reading. See what you can find on the House of Spiritualism, Jonathan Black\u2014and Blair House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>He left, closing the door between the two apartments. Jude headed out. As he did so, he picked up the morning paper at his door, flipping it over:</p><p>Have You Seen This Woman?</p><p>He was pleased to see that Hannah had gotten Jake Mallory\u2019s computer rendition of his victim on the lower-right side of the first page of the paper. Since he\u2019d spent the night preparing for the meeting and grimly realizing how little they had to go on, it was a pleasant perk to see that the likeness was in the paper, and just as he had wanted it placed.</p><p>The paper was on the front passenger\u2019s seat of the car when he picked up Whitney; she was in front of the house, waiting for him at precisely 7:30 a.m. He couldn\u2019t help think again that everything about her was gleaming, from the pert curls in her hair to the tone of her skin and on to her eyes. She was entirely unique\u2014and absolutely mesmerizing. She would surely draw attention no matter where she went. He did wonder if that would prove to be an asset or a distraction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He admitted grudgingly to himself that she had probably drawn more from Angus Avery than he would have managed.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she said, accepting the newspaper and seeing where the picture had been displayed.</p><p>\u201cHow was your night?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou slept well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t have to be worried tonight. You won\u2019t be alone. The rest of your team gets in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried last night,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut I like my team. I\u2019ll be glad when they\u2019re here. And, I think you\u2019ll like them, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll like anyone who can move this investigation in a forward direction. The news has picked up on the unknown victims we discovered. It\u2019s a media frenzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Whitney murmured. \u201cOr maybe not so strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about the late eighteen hundreds in London. There were murders that occurred constantly, especially in the East End. But the Ripper murders were the first to really gain attention. They were so ghastly that people were forced to notice people and the horrendous conditions under which they were living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a comparison. They don\u2019t need to notice this area. Five Points is really long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Five Points wasn\u2019t cleaned up until the 1880s, 1890s. The Bowery was filled with seedy bars and hotels\u2014it wasn\u2019t a nice area! And what happened to Carrie Brown turned into a huge case as well, with the media heavily involved. Some people believe that Jack the Ripper was out to draw attention to the absolute misery of life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPersonally,\u201d Jude told her, \u201cI don\u2019t think that Jack the Ripper was hoping to clean up the Whitechapel area of London. I think he was a psychopath with a bitter hatred of women, and there was nothing about him that should have been romanticized. I don\u2019t believe he was in the royal family, and I don\u2019t believe any of the half-cocked theories that have come out about him in books in the last few years. Possibly, he was a butcher\u2014the degree of his anatomical skills has been argued throughout the years\u2014who suffered from a sexually transmitted disease. And it\u2019s likely that he got that disease from a prostitute. Or maybe his mother had been a prostitute, and he\u2019d spent his formative years watching her ply her trade. Today, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten away with his crimes\u2014we rely so heavily on forensics now. Back then, there were slaughterhouses in the area and a lot of the population walked around bloodstained\u2014people walking around bloodstained are noticed these days, even in New York City. The populace might be busy and impatient, but they\u2019re not blind or ignorant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, careful! The head of the New York police force at the time made a big mistake mocking the English police over the Ripper\u2014and then he couldn\u2019t catch the man who killed Carrie Brown, and possibly others,\u201d Whitney warned. \u201cThey were desperate\u2014and a man innocent of the crime went to prison for years because they were grasping at straws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t knock the London police, they worked with what they had. Thing is, since I do know a lot of our less-than-prime neighborhoods well, I can imagine what it was like for them. They were amidst an absolute stream of humanity, and knifings and bar fights were the norm. Prostitution has always been a dangerous profession, and clever killers\u2014and even not-so-clever killers\u2014have eluded law enforcement in every age. And the New York police force was first created by the city in 1844 and reorganized a year later\u2014and modeled after the Metropolitan force in London. It was the first police department in the United States.\u201d He glanced at her apologetically. \u201cCan\u2019t be my father\u2019s son for nothing, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pray that we get this guy,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>The task force was set to meet in one of the spacious conference rooms. There was a large rolling poster board that Jude could use for his presentation and organization, and he began tacking up pictures, lists, maps and assignments. Hannah walked in while he was working and Whitney was reading the book his father had loaned her, having understood he really didn\u2019t want her help setting up. He liked that about her; she didn\u2019t insist.</p><p>He introduced the two women, and Hannah spoke with enthusiasm. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet the rest of your team. I\u2019m sure I will, unless we get him right away, which, of course, is impossible...sorry. Jude is a great detective, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Hannah said, \u201cI know just about every program out there, but I\u2019ve seldom seen anyone find a computer program that could work so well with morgue photos. She\u2019s so real\u2014it looks like the picture was just shot!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you got it right into the paper at the last minute,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>Patrolman Smith arrived looking a little awed to be there, and the seven detectives working with him and Ellis Sayer filed in one by one soon after Ellis arrived, before it became 8:00 a.m. exactly.</p><p>Deputy Chief Green came into the room at eight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only at this meeting as an observer, everyone. And to let you know that I have ultimate faith in your talents as investigators. This is our highest-priority case in the city right now, and you have access to any form of backup at any time\u2014beat patrols, patrol cars\u2014the mounted unit if you need it. Now, we all know that the media seized on the information regarding the victim almost before we were in on it ourselves\u2014not much you can do to stop people from talking. I and our public information officer have given them what we can, though we will try to keep further information to a minimum to weed out the nuts. Agent Whitney Tremont is the first of the assisting FBI unit to arrive.\u201d He paused to indicate her; Jude saw a few lips tighten, but mostly the others noted her with grim nods.</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t really believe in rivalries between federal and local jurisdiction\u2014whatever it took to get it done was important\u2014but there had been times when local investigations and federal interests had clashed, and that did create problems.</p><p>\u201cThe team is here because they specialize in unusual circumstances and they have an excellent track record. I know you\u2019re all aware that we have two Jane Does who were murdered, and because of those two women and the especially heinous nature of Virginia Rockford\u2019s death, we\u2019re entertaining the possibility that someone is trying to re-create deaths from Victorian London. I don\u2019t believe that any journalists yet realize that we do have victims with injuries similar to those of the victims of Jack the Ripper. I realize that this killer has us by the balls, but he must be caught. Jude, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\u201d</p><p>Jude stood before his board, pointing out the two women who were not believed to have been Ripper victims, but who coincided with their Jane Does. He reminded the team that they weren\u2019t to draw assumptions, but that they needed to be wary. He went on to describe the five victims of the Ripper\u2014per \u201cexperts\u201d\u2014and then the New York victim of the 1890s, and pointed out the fact that the filming that had taken place on the day that Virginia Rockford had been killed was where the Ripper was rumored to have lived, if he had come to New York.</p><p>\u201cAll right, our one eyewitness\u2014albeit a burned-out Viet vet\u2014saw a man on the streets who resembled the gaslight-movie version of Jack the Ripper. Cloak, stovepipe hat, medical bag. So we do believe it\u2019s going to be important to understand the past regarding the murders in London and the murder of Carrie Brown in New York City. But we\u2019re not discounting the idea that the Jane Does and the murder of Virginia Rockford are unrelated. As yet, the medical examiner has only been able to tell us that our victim was ripped up exactly the same way as Jack the Ripper\u2019s first victim\u2014sadly, he has not reported DNA discovered on the body or clothing, or any scrap of forensic evidence that could help us. We now have a reasonable likeness of Jane Doe wet in the paper, so we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll hear from someone who knew her, or knew her identity. Our real-life suspects could be just about anyone in the state of New York. Obviously, we\u2019re going to start by focusing on the movie cast and crew. Sayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on it, Jude. It\u2019s just a hell of a lot of people,\u201d Sayer told him.</p><p>\u201cWe spent yesterday interviewing hundreds of people,\u201d one of his men added quietly.</p><p>\u201cFind the costume designer and everyone in costumes. If Tyler saw a man in a stovepipe hat and cloak, I believe he exists. He\u2019s burned out\u2014not blind,\u201d Jude said. He looked at Whitney. \u201cAgent Tremont?\u201d</p><p>She might have been surprised that he was asking for her input at this point of the investigation, but she didn\u2019t show it. She stood and walked forward. \u201cIf our killer is playing out a reenactment of the nineteenth-century Ripper murders, he\u2019s doing it in his own way, since he killed an attractive young woman and didn\u2019t target an older prostitute with missing teeth, as did the Ripper. I believe this discrepancy might indicate the killer is a narcissist\u2014whatever route he takes can be twisted into anything that he wants, because he is all important. Therefore, he\u2019s doubly difficult to catch. Although it appears he is trying to recreate a time of terror, he will also consider expediency in everything that he does. He\u2019s organized, despite the savagery of the crime. I think it\u2019s going to be important that we study the past, because he likely knows all the stories regarding New York and London in the late eighteen hundreds. He may not believe that the voice of Jack the Ripper is in his head...he may just be using the crimes of the past because of their shocking brutality. This killer is going to prove to be the average or even handsome next-door neighbor. If you knew him, you\u2019d probably want to talk about the crimes with him\u2014you\u2019d never suspect him of being a functioning psychopath. Also,\u201d Whitney said, and paused, glancing over at Jude, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that this man is acting alone. Although I don\u2019t particularly subscribe to any of the conspiracy theories, it is possible that the real Ripper worked with a partner. In with the royal conspiracy theory is the concept that a carriage came and took the Ripper away from the crime scenes, and thus he wasn\u2019t seen walking around Whitechapel covered in blood. Obviously, then, the carriage driver was in on the killings. Others claim that there were so many butchers and slaughterhouse workers at the time that people were accustomed to others walking around covered in blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue. The East End of London was crawling with butchers and slaughterhouses,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cBut, the truth doesn\u2019t matter as much as what the killer perceives to have been the truth, so, please, it\u2019s important that we all review everything that went on back then.\u201d</p><p>Sayer shook his head, looking at Jude. \u201cDoes everybody really believe this? That a modern-day Ripper has come to New York? Or, should I be working off the newspaper accounts\u2014and assume that the Ripper did come here in the eighteen hundreds, and that his ghost has risen to attack the women of our city?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSayer, no one in this room believes that a ghost killed Virginia Rockford, I assure you. But,\u201d Jude said, once again pausing to look at Whitney, \u201cone of the most logical theories we have at the moment is that someone either wants to emulate the Ripper, or perhaps believes that the voice of the Ripper\u2019s ghost speaks to him and tells him what to do.\u201d</p><p>Hannah groaned softly and started when they all looked at her. She grimaced. \u201cSorry. I just think of all the defense strategies criminals have\u2014 The violence on TV made me do it. The abuse I suffered from my alcoholic mother made me do it. The dog spoke to me in Satan\u2019s voice. And now, Jack the Ripper made me do it!\u201d</p><p>Every detective in the room seemed to nod, but only Jude spoke. \u201cWe all know the system is imperfect, Hannah, but we have to catch the guy, and leave it to our prosecutors to get him locked away forever. Him\u2014or them. But, in most cases, and I believe we\u2019ll discover this to be true here, if there is an accomplice, one of the killers is still driving the action and the killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have booklets for everyone,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cHistory of the Ripper in London, the murder of Carrie Brown, info on the House of Spiritualism and, everything we have\u2014basically the autopsy results\u2014on our Jane Does.\u201d She glanced at Jude, too. He nodded to her and she handed out the booklets. Sayer looked at Jude. \u201cYou want us to read all day, or keep up with the interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. You all passed the exam to get where you are,\u201d Jude said evenly. \u201cAnd you know street work, and how to go with gut-level thinking to solve this. I have complete faith in you. And Jackson Crow, who will be at our next meeting, has a reputation as one of the finest minds in criminal behavior.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say solve this, Detective Crosby,\u201d one of Sayer\u2019s men, Alex Lacey, said. It always seemed to Jude that his surname was misapplied since he was a brick wall of a man. \u201cWhat if we are putting puzzle pieces together that don\u2019t really connect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the murders of the Jane Does and Miss Rockford?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cWe could be wrong on that. We\u2019re talking theory here now, too. But, we all know that as soon as the body of Virginia Rockford was discovered, the cry of Ripper went up in the street. And I know I\u2019ve hit a dead end with every possible lead on the Jane Does. Maybe we are looking for several killers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe there won\u2019t be any more murders,\u201d Sayer said.</p><p>Jude later thought that Ellis Sayer couldn\u2019t have spoken on cue more completely if they had scripted the meeting. As he was still speaking, there was a tap on the door. Lieutenant Nelson, Deputy Chief Green\u2019s assistant, beckoned him gravely to the door.</p><p>Green listened to her, and then turned back to the group. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Sayer, that the question of more victims has just been answered. Melody Tatum, a local escort, has just been discovered in an alley in the Bowery.\u201d</p><p>The NYPD was given a bad rap sometimes\u2014all cops were given a bad rap sometimes, just for being cops\u2014but he was proud when he reached the scene to see the first officers on-site had quickly taken control of the crime scene, and there wasn\u2019t just tape protecting the area\u2014a narrow alley in back of a number of buildings\u2014there were barricades. There was again a human wall of officers as well, protecting the mutilated body of Melody Tatum from the curious stares of onlookers\u2014and the press.</p> <p>\u201cCrosby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Crosby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective!\u201d</p><p>He heard the shouts of the press as he arrived and ducked beneath the tape and made his way through the officers, nodding a grim appreciation to several of the men as he did so. For the moment, he ignored the press. Whitney and Sayer followed closely in his wake while other members of his task force interviewed the first officers at the site and began to work a door-to-door canvass in the area. They were once again in a section of the city where the dark alleys could be quiet, while just blocks away, nightlife teemed. But they were in the midst of some residential buildings, and the police would knock on every door.</p><p>He hunkered down by the body, hands gloved.</p><p>Melody Tatum had been in her mid to late thirties; she might have been \u201cplastically\u201d attractive. Her face was bruised and swelling, but he could see scars in the puffed skin that indicated she\u2019d already had cosmetic surgery.</p><p>Her eyes were open. Blue eyes that seemed horrified, and still surprised.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been missing teeth, nor had she been old or ugly, like the Ripper\u2019s usual used-up ha\u2019penny whores in London. And yet there was something similar about her, he thought. Illusion was gone from those dead eyes. Once upon a time, she\u2019d had dreams. Life had taught her that not everyone made the big time. In her case, the word escort had certainly been a euphemism. There was a look about her of someone who had gotten hard around the edges. She\u2019d learned the truth about the fairy tale, and she\u2019d dealt with it, but not without losing a little piece of her soul.</p> <p>There was no mistaking the fact that the woman was dead. Her insides had been removed and arranged around the body. The garish fur of her coat rose against her throat. Jude inspected the coat, and saw where the fur had hardened at the throat. Using his pen, he gingerly flattened the fur, and when he did so, he saw the slash that had nearly severed the head from the body.</p><p>He stepped back, allowing the police photographer to do his work. In the background, never getting in the way, Whitney took her own photos as well. He felt cold himself. He was accustomed to crime, brutal crime. But the disembowelment of this woman was something that could twist the most cast-iron stomach. He looked at Whitney; he could see in her face that the crime appalled her, but he could see the same thing in the grim expressions of everyone around him. He heard one old seasoned cop yelling at another not to disturb the crime scene, and to move on quickly. The retching sounds made by the younger officer proved that he was moving away as quickly as he could.</p><p>Whitney was obviously affected, but she quietly did whatever she felt she must, always a step behind so as not to disturb the work of the local police. She was professional; he wasn\u2019t sure if she was taking still shots or videos, but she intended to chronicle the crime scene. She seemed so small there; fragile and delicate, and he was surprised by the desire to drag her away from a scene so horrible. Perhaps he would have felt that way about any young woman. He steeled himself; she was an agent. And, at that moment, if the agents could prove a ghost was guilty and stop the horror, he\u2019d be happy to see it happen.</p><p>Fullbright came through and hunkered down opposite him. \u201cMy, my. Our Ripper is a busy boy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jude frowned at him, but Fullbright didn\u2019t notice. He was shaking his head. \u201cHave the photographers finished?\u201d he asked Jude. \u201cHas she been touched or moved in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Officers Lewis and Jentz found the body at eight forty-five; her purse, with her identification, credit and business cards, was found about twenty feet away. If anyone else came across her, they didn\u2019t report the discovery. Jentz said they saw the heap from the sidewalk when they were heading to the caf\u00e9 down the street to start their shift with some espresso. When they started toward her, they thought that she\u2019d passed out, or been mugged or injured. Lewis went to feel for a pulse, saw the organs displayed around her and then called it immediately and set up the barricades. We\u2019re in an alley. We can keep this site closed up all day and into the night,\u201d Jude said. \u201cAnd thank God,\u201d he added gruffly, \u201cthey stopped the media and the internet and Facebook crowd from snapping any photos.\u201d</p><p>Fullbright acknowledged his satisfaction with an inclination of his head. He eased the coat she had been wearing from her lower body.</p><p>Jude steeled himself; he almost had to turn away.</p><p>Whitney went a pale shade of gray and another officer turned away, making the same horrible retching noises as the previous young officer.</p><p>\u201cGet it out of here!\u201d Fullbright warned with a growl.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a time of death?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Fullbright waved away a swarm of flies that were now buzzing around the victim.</p><p>\u201cGive me a chance, Detective. Give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>Jude stood unmoving. He felt the air and it felt chill, but not cold. In fact, it was warm. Thankfully, there had been no rain the night before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to estimate 4:00 a.m., or between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m.,\u201d Fullbright said, taking the body\u2019s temperature and moving an arm to find the state of rigor. He looked around. \u201cI believe that at that time of night, he would have been all alone in the alley, but I don\u2019t think the young woman ever had a chance to scream. It\u2019s hard to see, I realize, with the face in the shape that it is, but you\u2019ll note that beyond the bruised lips and the blood\u2014there, her tongue is protruding. I need to get her to the morgue, but I believe that she was strangled. She blacked out before he killed her...she might have gone without so much as a whimper.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cFrom a cursory examination, I can tell you that the intestines are on the shoulder. I believe that several of her organs are\u2014gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, of course, I won\u2019t know more until the autopsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have her ready at the morgue in three hours, Jude,\u201d Fullbright assured him.</p><p>Jude felt Whitney looking at him.</p><p>And he knew what she was thinking.</p><p>Annie Chapman, the second of the Ripper\u2019s canonical victims. She was found in just such a display, her tongue protruding, her body disemboweled\u2014several organs missing entirely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The weight of the world\u2014or at least the entire steel empire and granite of Manhattan\u2014seemed to be weighing down on him. He\u2019d thought they could concentrate on the area where the construction site had been utilized by the movie crew. He\u2019d thought they would find the killer in the midst of the filmmakers. But now, they were in the Bowery. Melody Tatum had been an escort, not an actress.</p><p>The killer\u2019s sphere was widening.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d suspected himself, as an itching, back-burner thought, from the moment he had come to the site of Virginia Rockford\u2019s murder, that the slashing deaths of his Jane Does were associated with the murder of Virginia Rockford. He just hadn\u2019t wanted to believe that a modern-day Ripper could be at work in his streets.</p> <p>Sayer called out to him. \u201cForensics is asking if they can move in. They\u2019ve been working the perimeter. Are they good?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked down at Fullbright. \u201cFive minutes. I want the hands bagged. I want her body-bagged just as she is\u2014we\u2019ve a better chance of preserving evidence on the clothing and all if we get her down to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>Jude walked over to Judith Garner, a woman he considered to be one of the city\u2019s best forensic detectives. She was like an iron horse; wild red Irish hair turning gray, eyes silver, face gaunt\u2014mind like a computer.</p><p>\u201cGarner, anything and everything from the perimeter here. With any luck, the alley hasn\u2019t been disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCigarette butts, gum wrappers, dog hairs, coffee cups and the entire contents of the Dumpster\u2014I got it, Jude. Hairs, fibers, footprints, but now we\u2019ll have to take those of half the police force. I will be thorough...you know that,\u201d she promised him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the purse, too. Doesn\u2019t look as if the killer ever opened it, but this guy is wearing gloves. Oh, by the way, her business cards identify her as \u2018a premium date for the businessman on the move.\u2019 She might have been a high-class hooker, but it seems that her employment is on the books. She\u2019s with Harold Patterson\u2019s Elite Companions.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cThanks,\u201d he told her. She studied him, shaking her head. He knew, of course, that most of the force was feeling very sorry for him. This killer wasn\u2019t leaving behind any evidence; he was apparently aware that any trace could help the police discover his identity. This was the kind of case where the suspects might be limitless, and if the killer wasn\u2019t apprehended, he might as well leave the state and hide behind a gigantic tiki beverage on a distant island, under an assumed name.</p><p>He saw that Whitney was still back by the body. He could see her golden eyes and the empathy within them. She hunkered down by Fullbright as he bagged the hands. Fullbright nodded at something that she said.</p><p>Jude felt his muscles constrict.</p><p>Ripperologists.</p><p>He knew that they were making comparisons.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t the East End of London.</p> <p>No, it was the East End of New York.</p><p>How in the hell did he get every woman in Lower Manhattan to stay off the streets at night? And how would Manhattan itself survive, if the killing continued and the panic increased?</p><p>His phone buzzed and he answered it.</p><p>\u201cCrosby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Green. When you can, head in to the station.\u201d</p><p>Jude was puzzled. \u201cSir, I\u2019m on-site with the victim. When I leave here, I\u2019m heading off to the victim\u2019s place of employment\u2014Harold Patterson\u2019s Elite Companions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a woman here named Daisy Harding who knew your Jane Doe wet. She recognized her from the paper. The young woman\u2019s name was Sarah Larson. She wanted to be a Broadway dancer. She started turning tricks when that didn\u2019t pan out. The girl was an orphan from Kansas City, Kansas. No family and only a few friends. Get on down here as soon as you can, Jude. The murder you\u2019re covering is on all the news stations already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t have gotten that much information. The two officers who discovered the body did everything right\u2014they barricaded the entire alley immediately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and I know they tried to shield the body as best as possible, but this is New York, Jude, you know that. That alley has windows and the neighbors have camera phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine exactly what the reporters are using as a headline,\u201d Jude said wearily, aware that his search revolved around a nutcase who thought he was the mysterious and infamous Victorian killer.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s back,\u201d he said.</p><p>And, in a way, the killer was proving that it was true.</p><p>Life was all about perception.</p><p>6</p><p>Daisy Harding was a slender young woman with large brown eyes and short-cropped brown hair. She moved with tremendous grace, and Whitney wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that she was a dancer. She had just gotten into the chorus of an off-Broadway play called The Girl Next Door, and she was quick to tell them that she\u2019d been about to head back to her native Arkansas, since she\u2019d been barely surviving.</p><p>She was distressed but articulate as she spoke to them, telling them how she had met the victim, Jane Doe wet, now identified as Sarah Larson, when they had both auditioned for a show the year before. Sarah had been a dancer, a good one, but the city was filled with hopefuls from all over the country who were auditioning for Broadway shows.</p><p>\u201cI know that she did some extras work, and she got a job at a coffee shop,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cAnd then the coffee shop started cutting down on employees and hours, and everyone else was doing the same. She took a job at a place called Not Your Mama\u2019s, and she thought she was going to be a dancer, but it turned out that it was a strip club. She actually started making some money, but she was miserable. And then...\u201d Daisy paused, shaking her head. \u201cThen she started taking drugs and drinking to cope. And then I think her drug habit got expensive, so she started working on the side.\u201d Again, Daisy hesitated, wincing. \u201cHooking. The last time I saw her was about a month ago. She knew that I was upset for her, and she told me not to worry. She was going to get it together. She was going to go out and get more movie and television work as an extra, and she\u2019d finally get out of what she was doing.\u201d A large tear rolled down her cheek. Jude pushed a tissue box closer to her.</p><p>So she, too, had been involved in the film world, Jude thought.</p><p>\u201cYou were trying very hard to be a good friend, Miss Harding. I\u2019m sure that you did everything that you could,\u201d Jude told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t. If I had, she\u2019d be alive,\u201d Daisy said.</p><p>Jude looked down for a minute. \u201cThat was a computer image we had in the paper, Miss Harding. But, now that you\u2019ve given us a name, we can verify that she is your friend. She must have someone somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daisy Harding said. \u201cShe told me that she\u2019d been in a home with dozens of kids, all of them just waiting to be eighteen and get out. She\u2019d spent a couple of years working different places to get to New York. And...she had the kind of friends you look at when you\u2019re at an audition and hope they break an ankle so that you get the job. It\u2019s competitive out there. I don\u2019t mean that we\u2014as a whole\u2014are hateful or would really hurt anyone. It\u2019s just there are so many people trying to get work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Whitney said softly.</p><p>\u201cMiss Harding,\u201d Jude promised, \u201cwe\u2019ll find out what happened to your friend. I promise, I won\u2019t stop until we do.\u201d</p><p>Daisy started to cry again softly. Whitney left her chair and walked around to the young woman. \u201cYou\u2019re doing everything you can for her now, Daisy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re helping us find out about her, and that will help us find out about her killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, yes, oh, please, at the least, get some kind of justice for her! I had a home and a family, and now, I\u2019ve been lucky here. We weren\u2019t rich, but my parents would send me money when I couldn\u2019t get a show, or when I couldn\u2019t get any kind of job at all. Sarah...she had no one. No help. It\u2019s not...it\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Whitney saw Jude\u2019s mouth tighten grimly; she could almost read his mind. No, life wasn\u2019t fair. But what had happened to Sarah Larson went far beyond that sentiment, and he didn\u2019t mean to let her die without catching her killer and bringing him to justice.</p><p>\u201cYou think...\u201d Daisy began, her voice hoarse, \u201cyou think that the same man killed that actress in the street, and that he...he\u2019s killed this new woman, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Miss Harding. We\u2019re investigating every angle,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Tears still bright in her eyes, Daisy finished telling them everything she could about Sarah Larson. When she left the station at last, Ellis Sayer threw some sheets on the table in the conference room where they\u2019d been speaking with Miss Harding. \u201cLimo drivers of interest, six of them,\u201d Sayer said. \u201cI sent Alex Lacey and two other men to go through the company. The time cards, mechanics and bosses match on most points, but these guys were the last on the job, if you want to speak with them.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAm I your second in command for nothing?\u201d Ellis asked him dryly. Whitney liked Ellis Sayer; he always looked a bit down, sad and weary, but he seemed steady. So far, he\u2019d followed through like a bulldog on the tasks he was given.</p><p>\u201cGet Lacey in here with me,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThat way he\u2019ll catch any contradictions.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Whitney. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay for this,\u201d she said.</p><p>When Ellis walked out, she noted that Jude seemed anxious. \u201cYou want to get to the strip club, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, rubbing his temples. \u201cBut Sayer has the drivers here. I know Lacey does a thorough job of questioning, but...we\u2019ll keep the pressure on. There\u2019s a lot I want to get to during the day. Melody Tatum\u2019s boss, pimp or whatever. The strip club\u2014it\u2019s going to be damn hard to stay hot on a single trail when victims are popping up all over. But one thing I\u2019ve learned is that people don\u2019t like coming in. They feel that if we\u2019re questioning them, we think they\u2019re guilty, not just looking for information. The drivers are here...we\u2019ll speak with them now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jude spoke to the drivers one by one, asking them first, in a friendly fashion, if they minded being recorded. Baskin, Lumis and Finn had been told to take whoever Angus Avery told them to take anywhere Avery said they were to go. Baskin had wound up running errands for Avery himself\u2014buying tobacco, a special mineral water and picking up his glasses, which he had left in his apartment. Lumis had run with the costume designer to a fabric shop, picked up special makeup for Sherry Blanco at a Fifth Avenue shop. Finn had spent most of the day sitting in his car; at four he had made a run, collecting costumed extras from a theatrical agency. All three had returned their cars and clocked out by six. A man named Joe Hutchins had been assigned to Sherry Blanco; he returned her to her maisonette on Park Avenue at four-thirty, and returned his car. Sam Eagan had driven Bobby Walden; Walden had left the set at seven, and the car had been turned in right after. Eric Len had driven Angus Avery, and he verified that he had taken the director to speak at the dinner, and then brought him home and returned his car. Nothing that any man said contradicted what any other said. All cars had been returned before nine-thirty the night of Virginia Rockford\u2019s murder.</p><p>When the interviews were over, Whitney asked Jude, \u201cWe\u2019re heading to Not Your Mama\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore following up on Melody Tatum?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m trying to ascertain if we are seeing a pattern,\u201d he told her. He shook his head. \u201cEllis Sayer will make sure that no one leaves the city\u2014and that Harold Patterson is available when I\u2019m ready to drop in on him,\u201d he added dryly. He actually offered her a grim and weary smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>It seemed that today was going to go just a little bit differently; Jude actually waited for her to grab her shoulder bag before heading out with his long strides.</p><p>As they walked down to the car, he was on the phone with Hannah, having her draw up the address of the establishment. It was in the Bowery, on the edge of the old Five Points area. It wasn\u2019t just a strip club; it was one of the seediest joints Jude had ever seen. The interior was dark and filled with curved back booths covered in some kind of black velvet that reeked, most probably there since the early seventies. When he and Whitney entered, blinking to adjust their eyes to the darkness, it looked as if rats scurried away. Giant rats; the clientele who had been in the club who, in all likelihood, had pockets full of drugs. There was one woman dancing; she had the look of someone very young\u2014and far too slim to be an exotic dancer.</p><p>Cocaine. Cocaine took that kind of toll on the body, he thought.</p> <p>A woman walked forward; either a waitress or a manager. She was the opposite of the woman dancing\u2014tall and buxom, over forty and if he had to pick a single word to describe her, he would probably think, blowsy.</p><p>She seemed to have radar for cops and was well on the way to absolute belligerence as she approached them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just ruined our business for the day,\u201d the woman complained. \u201cOur permits are in order. What do you want?\u201d She looked from Jude to Whitney as she spoke, and she was obviously sizing Whitney up as a new morsel to put on the menu.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could ruin your business for eternity,\u201d Jude said, keeping his tone even. \u201cAre you the owner? Owner or manager, I\u2019m thinking, because it doesn\u2019t look as if you\u2019re on the drugs you get your girls taking\u2014free, at first, I imagine. Then you get them hooked and they\u2019re yours until they\u2019re all used up.\u201d</p><p>She was angry, of course.</p><p>\u201cI am the owner, Myra Holiday. What is it that you want\u2014Officer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDetective, Ms. Holiday. Detective Crosby. And this is Agent Tremont, FBI. Congratulations. You\u2019re a suspect in a murder investigation.\u201d</p><p>That at last brought a real reaction from her. \u201cMurder? No way in hell could we be associated with a murder investigation.\u201d</p><p>Whitney arched a brow and lifted the newspaper with the picture of Sarah Larson.</p><p>\u201cSarah quit. She had some big-time offer, and she was quitting. She told me that she\u2019d gotten a real chance. You\u2019re in the wrong place\u2014you ask the other girls\u2014she left here about two weeks ago, full of herself. She said that she couldn\u2019t tell us what was going on, but that we\u2019d be seeing her soon enough, and that we\u2019d all be pea green with envy.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was angry, he saw, looking at the woman with fury and loathing. \u201cYou saw the paper\u2014you saw the paper and you knew exactly who the woman in the picture was\u2014but you had no intention of helping the police!\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t want any trouble. And you say she\u2019s dead? Well, she was always after something, always after somebody with money. And she was willing to go anywhere with anyone. She was gone from here, I swear it! You can ask any of the girls. They\u2019ll tell you that what I\u2019m saying is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was willing to go after anyone with money after you turned her into a junkie,\u201d Jude said, his voice soft.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill anybody!\u201d the woman protested.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve managed to kill a lot of women throughout the years, Ms. Holiday,\u201d Jude said. \u201cI\u2019ll need a list of your regulars.\u201d</p><p>The woman started to laugh. \u201cMy regulars? I don\u2019t have a list of any regulars. What, do you think customers sign in or something? I don\u2019t have any lists. And I didn\u2019t call the police because Sarah Larson was just trouble. A little bitch. I haven\u2019t seen her\u2014I\u2019m telling you that she was out of here weeks ago, and no one has heard from her since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to suggest, Ms. Holiday, that you get something together for me, because we are in the middle of a major murder investigation\u2014and I\u2019m going to have a team out here to rip the place up looking for evidence. Some of them are really good friends with some of the vice and fraud guys, and...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed; the woman was suddenly white, and not because he had threatened her with a vice squad. She was horrified.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you think that Sarah\u2019s murder had something to do with...the women who were butchered. You think that she was a victim of the Ripper?\u201d</p><p>Jude shook his head with disgust. \u201cShe was murdered and dumped in the river, Ms. Holiday, and you couldn\u2019t even bother to identify her for the police. We don\u2019t know if her murder was associated with the other murder. We do know that she\u2019s dead, throat slashed, and that you\u2019re going to cooperate in any way humanly possible. I have a team coming in to speak with your girls, and to go over this place with a fine-tooth comb, and if you make me have to waste the time to get a warrant, I\u2019ll make sure that I take so much of your time, you\u2019ll be ready for retirement when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, whatever you want,\u201d Myra told him.</p><p>Whitney brushed by her and headed for the skinny woman dancing on the stage.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Whitney called. The skinny woman didn\u2019t notice her at first. She was just swinging around the pole, eyes lackadaisical, moving only vaguely to the music.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Whitney called again.</p><p>The girl blinked, noticing her. She smiled curiously. \u201cHey, sugar. You don\u2019t look like the kind of woman who likes women, but, hey, you are a pretty thing and I promise I can make you real happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with you,\u201d Whitney told her, flashing her badge.</p><p>The woman froze, and looked backstage as if she wanted to run. Whitney quickly hopped on stage and showed her the picture of Sarah Larson. \u201cWas she your friend?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>Again, the girl looked longingly backstage, dying to flee.</p><p>\u201cLook at me\u2014talk to me,\u201d Whitney said firmly.</p><p>The young woman\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cThat\u2019s Sarah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cShe was my friend. She\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know who she was seeing,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>The skimpily clad girl winced, shaking her head. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t seeing anyone. She said if you closed your eyes and dreamed, it didn\u2019t matter that they were smelly creeps. She wouldn\u2019t have seen anyone here, I mean, not beyond work. She told us all that we had to be strong and keep dreaming, even when...she was going to be a star. She was a real dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she left here, to go somewhere else?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>The girl nodded, slowly at first, then strenuously. \u201cShe said she was going to go off and be a star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? With and for whom?\u201d Whitney persisted.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t tell us. She said that she\u2019d been promised a role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a dancer?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded, looking past her at Myra.</p><p>\u201cThink, please, it\u2019s very important,\u201d Whitney persisted gently.</p><p>\u201cI swear, that\u2019s all that she would say,\u201d the skinny woman said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cCandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d Jude said, coming forward.</p><p>\u201cDebbie. Debbie Mortensen,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>Whitney started to hand her a card; she realized that the girl had nowhere to put it, except in the string of the ridiculous studded thong she was wearing. Jude drew out his own card and joined it to Whitney\u2019s, then stuck both cards in the band of the thong. \u201cThe police need your help. Anything you can think of might be important. Other officers will be around questioning everyone here\u2014talk to them, or call us.\u201d</p><p>He turned and strode out. Whitney followed him. He dialed Sayer and told him to get officers down to the place to question everyone involved. He called Hannah and told her to get on the business records.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe Myra or Debbie?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo, I do believe them. And one of those girls will notice if someone was in here who was a bit above the usual clientele.\u201d</p><p>As they stood there, Debbie Mortensen, now wrapped in a red, faux-silk housecoat, came rushing out into the street.</p><p>\u201cI thought of something!\u201d she told them. In the garish light of day, her age was visible. Debbie Mortensen wasn\u2019t a girl. She had to be at least thirty-five. And, like Myra, she was scared. Her face was white and pinched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Whitney said gravely.</p><p>\u201cTalk, please,\u201d Jude told her.</p><p>\u201cThere was a guy that she was into, not long before she left,\u201d Debbie said. \u201cHe\u2014he was weird. He looked like he came off a movie set. I mean, he was wearing some kind of weird hat and a cloak. Like...like...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack the Ripper?\u201d Whitney offered.</p><p>Debbie\u2019s eyes widened and she nodded. \u201cI never really saw his face because he kept the hat low and he sat in one of the back booths all the time. Sarah was kind of amused by him. She gave him a\u2014a lap dance. Then it seemed that they were talking. I noticed her close to him in the back booth. In fact, when he left, she did a leap off the pole and went running after him. I remember, because when she came back in, I teased her about it. She said that he\u2019d disappeared\u2014it was like he went out to the street and vanished into thin air. But she wasn\u2019t worried\u2014she was going to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say that he was going to make her rich and famous?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Debbie shook her head. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t long after that Sarah left, and when she left, she did say that we\u2019d all see her soon\u2014we\u2019d see her rich and famous. She disappeared. She disappeared, just like he did, I guess.\u201d Debbie hugged her arms around her chest and started to shiver. \u201cI mean, for real, just the way that he did. I\u2019d forgotten to give her back a necklace. I rushed into the street, and she was gone. Just as if she\u2019d vanished into thin air.\u201d She backed away from them suddenly, her mouth gaping. \u201cHe was Jack the Ripper!\u201d she said, hysteria rising in her voice. \u201cOh, my God, we\u2019re all in danger here. I don\u2019t know what to do. I have to pay rent...I have to eat.\u201d</p><p>You have a cocaine habit, Jude thought. Yes, that has to be fed.</p> <p>\u201cThere are shelters,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf you come to the station, we can help you get your feet back on the ground. There are programs to help women in your situation. You can clean up.\u201d</p><p>Debbie Mortensen stared at him as if he was crazy.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I know!\u201d she said, and she turned and raced back into the club.</p><p>On the sidewalk, Whitney looked at Jude. \u201cIt seems that the victims are all practicing prostitution in one way or another,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at her and sighed. \u201cShe was going to make them all pea green with envy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Whitney nodded. \u201cThe movies,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re back to the movie that was being made downtown\u2014gaslight era. The site where the House of Spiritualism once stood.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. \u201cWe\u2019re back to the movies, Agent Tremont. Someone involved with that movie is totally insane, or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas a very strange way of trying to make sure it has promotion,\u201d Jude told her. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, taking her arm. He realized that it was too easy to touch her. And that it wasn\u2019t bothering him to have her with him. She was bright. She listened, and she stepped in just when it seemed that she should.</p><p>He liked her.</p><p>And he was fascinated by her. He was certain he\u2019d never met anyone quite like her. Anyone who looked like her, with such a unique and compelling golden beauty.</p><p>He gave himself a mental shake. He was a cop, she was an agent. And women were dying.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCoffee and lunch\u2014with the lists of those involved in the movie. Coffee because I need it. Lunch because I have an autopsy coming up, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll want it after.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere I know we won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they sat across from one another at the dining room in his apartment. Coffee was brewed, and sandwiches and chips lay on a plate between them.</p><p>Whitney liked his apartment; it was neat, comfortable and eclectic. Like his father, Jude Crosby had books\u2014his were everywhere. He seemed fond of old leather and hard wood, organization and comfort.</p><p>She looked at his books. Many were obviously works he had acquired because of his obsession: histories of law enforcement, a book on truly comprehending the Constitution, forensics books and more.</p><p>He was a mystery fan, too, so it seemed; shelves were filled with books by Childs, Ellroy, Connelly and several more contemporary authors. Again, like his father, he seemed to be a fan of the classics, and he had beautifully bound collections of Shakespeare, Dickens and more. His shelves were strewn about the apartment; even the dining room had a bookshelf.</p><p>Jude had apologized to her, leaving her to make the sandwiches while he collected information on the movie crew and cast with the notes Sayer and his group had entered into a file that he could reach on his computer. He checked his watch, aware that the hour for the autopsy was approaching. She didn\u2019t think he was late to any event often.</p><p>Whitney, reading over the list in front of her, frowned, looking at Jude, who sat across from her at his handsome mahogany dining table. He had loosened his collar and it was obvious he had been running his fingers through his hair. She looked back to the list she\u2019d been reading quickly; the case was riddled with urgency, and she had found herself thinking that he was a remarkably attractive man, somehow rugged and macho, and still courteous and aware of those around him. It was a strange mix and in it all, he came off, she realized, as ridiculously sexually appealing. She blinked, trying to refocus. She\u2019d been busy in the last months, learning a new life. Training had been rugged for a film major, and she\u2019d given it all her effort. She hadn\u2019t stopped living; she and the team had become close, almost like a well-oiled machine that could think as one. They\u2019d learned to work, and still smile and even laugh sometimes as they did. But she hadn\u2019t really thought about sex, much less a particular man, in forever, so it seemed.</p><p>And, no matter what the sizzle he seemed to create in her bloodstream, she was working. And it was doubtful that he was really thinking of her at all\u2014except as the agent with whom he was forced to work.</p><p>\u201cThe newest victim, Melody Tatum,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that she was associated with the film in any way, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSayer has team members at her escort service. When the autopsy is over, I\u2019m heading there to speak with the owner-slash-manager of the business.\u201d She saw him check his phone, reading his text messages. \u201cNothing much is ever what you expect. The strip club is owned by a woman\u2014we met that charming opportunist already\u2014and the owner-manager of the escort service is Harold Patterson. I knew that of course, but, I guess I\u2019d still have thought it was going to be a woman. Someone who\u2019d done the escorting herself before reaching a point where she could live off the backs of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you wouldn\u2019t want the world to discriminate, would you?\u201d Whitney asked him. \u201cMaybe Harold Patterson did a little escorting himself. Don\u2019t be biased now.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, an actual, easy grin. \u201cNope. It\u2019s just interesting, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever want the world to discriminate in any way, shape or form. But what I want isn\u2019t going to change expectations. I look forward to meeting one of the others of the profession.\u201d</p><p>Whitney smiled, lowering her eyes and looking back at her notes. She was beginning to really like Jude Crosby. She\u2019d been lucky in her life to hit very little prejudice herself, but she was a mixture of races, and she wasn\u2019t a fool\u2014there were people out there who still couldn\u2019t really deal with the idea of an equal world. Jude Crosby wasn\u2019t just paying lip service. She felt that he\u2019d seen an awful lot in his years working the streets, and that his mind was set. He didn\u2019t judge a person by gender or color and probably not by sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation, or any particular choice in life that didn\u2019t cause injury to others.</p><p>Not good, she warned herself. There was no way out of the fact that he drew sexual attraction by his very existence.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been good that he was such a strong individual. Liking him so much was a whole different story.</p><p>People had died, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cSamuel Vintner. The guard was apparently the last one on the set. He is an ex-cop. Two other girls had tried to hang around\u2014they\u2019d wanted Virginia Rockford to leave with them. Missy Everett and Jane Deaver. They left together, and were lucky enough to find a cab. There was still one down that far on Broadway, and they grabbed it together, afraid that another wouldn\u2019t come. They said that Samuel Vintner and Virginia Rockford were the last people on the set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and, sadly, having been a cop, or even being a cop, doesn\u2019t mean that someone is legitimate. But it\u2019s not the cop,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh? And why not?\u201d</p><p>Jude hesitated. He grimaced. \u201cGut feeling,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd\u2014I just don\u2019t see an old used-up cop on duty as the last guard at a movie site as having any kind of stake in anything that\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would know how to avoid detection,\u201d Whitney pointed out.</p><p>Jude looked at her. \u201cAnyone can get online, and everyone watches television. Most people are aware that sometimes perpetrators can be arrested because of DNA, trace evidence, skin cells...assuming, of course, that we have some kind of comparison to make. And you do have just cause for search warrants, DNA and so on. You know that. The thing is\u2014this guy will make a mistake, whether he\u2019s insane or a person with an agenda.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cJack the Ripper got away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack the Ripper might not have gotten away. Anything we know about the killer is really a theory, and nothing more. Supposition. And Jack the Ripper was busy in London in the 1880s. We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d</p><p>Whitney jumped, suddenly hearing a rapping sound that seemed to come from the walls. It was followed by a \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>She was instantly ready and alert, but didn\u2019t draw her weapon; the \u201chey\u201d didn\u2019t sound threatening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jude explained. \u201cHey,\u201d he called back. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want company?</p><p>\u201cDad, come on in. We\u2019re thinking aloud with each other. Another mind won\u2019t be a bad thing at all,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>Andrew was still a little hesitant when he came in the room.</p><p>\u201cI never mean to interrupt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not interrupting at all,\u201d Whitney replied, grinning.</p><p>\u201cDad, sit, do you want a sandwich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I heard voices. I was just checking to make sure that it was you,\u201d Andrew said. He shrugged to Whitney. \u201cThat\u2019s the best you can do when you live next door to your son. Stay away when you should, check up on his interests when you should.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you do a great job of it,\u201d Jude assured him.</p><p>Whitney thought that his affection for his father was real and admirable. They did treat one another as equals, even though the parent-child connection existed as well. Their bond was tight, and she was only sorry that it made her like Jude Crosby even more. He was really far too easy to like.</p><p>Jude set down the papers he\u2019d been looking at and shook his head. \u201cBut, if you heard voices in here you didn\u2019t think were mine or a friend\u2019s, you needed to stay on your own side and dial 911.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I was patrolling the streets when you were still in diapers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, okay, Dad. Do you have anything for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, yep, I do,\u201d Andrew said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that would be...?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cBlair House!\u201d Andrew announced with pleasure. \u201cI have a book that lists as its sources a number of books at the NYU library. In the history section there\u2019s a copy of a ledger that\u2019s at the Pierpont Library. The family who owned Blair House from the 1860s to the 1890s was in financial trouble by the end of the century. They kept the place as a boarding house. And guess who stayed there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonathan Black?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>Andrew stared at her again. He nodded, mesmerized anew. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a signature\u2014Jonathan Black\u2014of a man who signed in as a guest in March 1891. One month before the murder of Carrie Brown. So, before he wound up at the House of Spiritualism, Jonathan Black checked into Blair House. That had to be one really bad, creepy dude. I wonder if he watched the people over at the House of Spiritualism, and then moved in on them!\u201d</p><p>As they listened to Jude\u2019s father\u2019s announcement, Whitney\u2019s phone began to buzz. She quickly looked down at the text that had come to her. It was from Jackson Crow. As usual, he was brief. \u201cHave arrived. Settling into Blair House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jude asked her.</p> <p>\u201cMy team has arrived,\u201d she said. She thought that something passed through Jude Crosby\u2019s eyes. Was it regret? Something just a little bit sorrowful? She felt something of a strange regret herself.</p><p>She\u2019d liked working with him. They\u2019d begun to...bond, after a fashion.</p><p>And now...</p><p>\u201cWell, Jackson is just the man who can really add experience to the investigation,\u201d she said briskly.</p><p>\u201cWe need to finish up here then. I have my own agenda,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThere are five from the film I want to interview personally\u2014the two stars, Blanco and Walden, Samuel Vintner and the girls who saw Virginia Rockford last, Missy Everett and Jane Deaver.\u201d Jude paused, looking at Whitney. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn where the Ripper might have wound up. I\u2019m certain Jonathan Black, Jack the Ripper or whoever the fellow might have been did not arise from the grave to start murdering people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Whitney said, \u201cJude, we do need to know who researched Jonathan Black and the murders that happened in that age. It is obvious now that someone is repeating them. Checking the library records at NYU and Pierpont might help us find out who.\u201d</p><p>Jude took a deep breath, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does seem apparent now.\u201d Disgusted, he shook his head, and leaned toward her, his tone like solid steel as he said, \u201cOne thing, however, is true. Jack is not back. There is a killer out there, and I swear, this time, he\u2019s not going to become a mystery for the ages. I\u2019m going to find the bastard.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>\u201cCome on, clue me in on everything,\u201d Angela said, and walked down the hallway and through the door to the kitchen. There was a little table in the breakfast-nook area. She poured herself a cup of coffee and headed toward it. \u201cI want more of a feel for what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Ellis had made the trip to the airport to collect the rest of the team\u2014and all their equipment. But he left them to settle in with Jude after they stopped by the station to introduce the team around. Whitney wasn\u2019t sure about her own feelings toward Ellis. He always appeared weary and tired. But Jude seemed to believe in him. And if Jude believed in him, he had to be one of the good ones. He was different, though. He didn\u2019t seem to have much of an open mind regarding anything that wasn\u2019t hard evidence. He was a cop who worked by the book. He would be methodical and thorough, she thought.</p><p>\u201cTragic, scary events,\u201d Whitney assured her, but she poured herself a cup of coffee and walked over to join Angela at the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know that. But, you believe that whatever\u2019s going on calls for our skills set? I was surprised that Jude whisked Jenna away with him to the autopsy, but she might bring out the answers about that death,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>As Whitney had suspected, Jude and Jackson had hit it off immediately. They were both no-nonsense and determined, low-key and yet as steadfast and persistent as a pair of bulldozers. When Jude left with the two agents, Jake Mallory paired off with Will Chan to set up the equipment as she had determined it should be.</p><p>\u201cThe cops seem to be treading water\u2014all we have to go on is the similarity to the Ripper and a possible link to that movie,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>Angela nodded. \u201cWhatever the reason, I\u2019m glad to be here. The house is quite beautiful, and it\u2019s amazing that it has remained as untouched and pristine as it has all these years, what with the continual progress and rebuilding in a city the size of New York,\u201d she said.</p><p>Whitney was glad to see Angela, as she had been glad to see the rest of the team. They had come to a point where they worked wonderfully together; they knew one another, and they were actually something of a family. And, of course, if they were a family of any kind, Angela was the matriarch even if she was in her early thirties. But she\u2019d come from law enforcement, and despite her lovely and fragile blond appearance, she was tough as nails, and wasn\u2019t afraid of her talents dealing with the past\u2014including the dead.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m reading and understanding all the information correctly, it\u2019s the property next door that is so notorious. And still, Blair House has been here forever. It must have some salacious history somewhere in there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might all be connected, you know. Jude\u2019s dad was a cop, and he\u2019s an amazing researcher. He has a library you wouldn\u2019t believe. Anyway, he found a copy of a ledger kept at the Pierpont Library\u2014the family took in boarders...among them, Jonathan Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to get to the library and see what we can find out. But Blair House itself doesn\u2019t have a history of terrible violence or the like.\u201d</p><p>Whitney shook her head. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve discovered yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you come across the unusual?\u201d Angela asked Whitney.</p><p>\u201cNot what we would consider unusual,\u201d Whitney told her. \u201cBut...\u201d She thought Angela Hawkins the most intuitive in their group. If there were spirits\u2014or energy\u2014left behind, Angela was the one who could usually sense them first and open her mind to the pain and loss of the past, drawing them out.</p><p>They\u2019d all learned quickly to respect one another\u2019s talents. Jackson was still the one to insist they find the flesh-and-blood truth in any situation, and he tended to be quiet when it came to his belief in his own intuition, but he respected the opinions, feelings and intuitions of his group.</p><p>\u201cAh! You do know. You just doubt yourself,\u201d Angela told her. She shivered. \u201cThough, it\u2019s really strange down here\u2014with that...abyss next door. I can only imagine the night, the darkness, the loneliness... I might imagine a thing or two myself. What did you see?\u201d</p><p>Whitney laughed ruefully. \u201cI tried all night, speaking aloud to any ghosts that might be around, and they totally ignored me. But when I woke in the morning, there was a woman looking at me. She never seemed solid\u2014when I blinked, she was gone. She was in late-Victorian attire, and if I had to guess, I\u2019d say she\u2019d been around in the 1890s. So, I might have wanted to see someone so badly that I imagined her, or she was someone who does haunt this house.\u201d She hesitated a minute. \u201cAnd, I saw a dog\u2014her dog, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d Angela sounded curious. \u201cHow interesting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen animals before,\u201d Whitney reminded her. \u201cCivil War soldiers on horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doubting you at all,\u201d Angela assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s possible your vision might have died by violence, and that the dog might have died first, trying to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they both disappeared quickly,\u201d Whitney told her.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Angela ran her fingers through her mane of blond hair thoughtfully. \u201cSometimes, as we know, ghosts are shy, terrified of the living, or they don\u2019t know how to communicate, even when you\u2019re open to them. When we can get closer and closer to the reason they\u2019ve remained, we can coax them out... I\u2019m going to spend the early part of the afternoon just getting to know the house. Later, maybe before sunset, we should explore the property next to us\u2014en masse, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you felt anything about the house?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, either,\u201d Angela told her. \u201cPlaces this old always seem to speak to something inside us\u2014give us an inner awe\u2014whether they\u2019re inhabited by spirits that can\u2019t move on or not. They\u2019re filled with history and time. But I can\u2019t say that the local ghosts ran out to meet me,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cPatience is needed. And, as we\u2019ve all learned, we don\u2019t know why certain people...communicate with other people. Dead or alive,\u201d she added. \u201cWhere do you feel we\u2019re going to be as a team? I liked Crosby\u2014very much. And he seemed perfectly willing to have the team on his task force.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whitney shrugged. \u201cRelatively accepted, no one smirked at me too visibly at the task force meeting. And you saw how intrigued they all were to meet you at the station house. They\u2019ve had to have seen the press about us being ghost hunters, but our solve rate always has a perfectly rational explanation. Jude wouldn\u2019t believe in a ghost if the entire population of Trinity Cemetery crawled out of their graves to say boo. But he\u2019s a decent guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still convinced that it all has to do with Jack the Ripper and someone obsessed with him?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cAngela,\u201d Whitney said, \u201cyes, I\u2019m convinced. There were two pre-Ripper murders\u2014Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman\u2014and those coincide with the Jane Does. And now, Virginia Rockford and Melody Tatum. I was there when the medical examiner gave his preliminary on Melody. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a doubt that this killer intends to carry out the same streak of murders as Jack the Ripper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen Jude\u2019s father\u2019s library might help us.\u201d</p><p>Angela laughed suddenly. \u201cI just realized\u2014you met the detective\u2019s father. Have you two set a date yet?\u201d she teased. \u201cHe\u2019s impressive. His size alone must intimidate the criminals in his world from the onset of any investigation. Quick work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Whitney protested. She hoped she wasn\u2019t blushing. If she was, she hoped that her biracial coloring was hiding the fact. \u201cLike I said, Jude\u2019s father is a retired cop. I think Jude often speaks with him about his cases. Anyway, I\u2019m still reading the book, but it was written by a retired cop who was in New York when Carrie Brown, the so-called American victim of Jack the Ripper, was murdered. What\u2019s difficult is that there are no records on the man, Jonathan Black, who this author suspected of the crimes\u2014and of being the Ripper. The only real mention of him seems to be in that ledger. I haven\u2019t had a chance to verify that no other records exist on such a person coming into the country, or living at Blair House, or at the House of Spiritualism. But one theory is that he became so debauched and terrifying that he scared the devil worshippers he lived with, and that they killed and interred him somewhere at the site.\u201d</p><p>Angela was thoughtful. \u201cIf there\u2019s more information regarding either of the properties to be found on the computer, Jake Mallory can find it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we can get a list at the library\u2014they take names before allowing people to handle rare books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s a tech at the police station Detective Crosby seems to believe in implicitly. Her name is Hannah Mills, and I get the feeling that if he asked for her to be on the task force, she had to be good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Jake get down to speak with her. If they combine their efforts, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be better off,\u201d Angela said. She glanced out the window at the construction site.</p><p>\u201cJude\u2019s father is pretty good, too, so it seems,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cThe more I think about it...he\u2019s a civilian now...we\u2019ll keep track of his findings, but we can\u2019t really bring him on this,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cAndrew\u2019s not afraid of much,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWe always take any help\u2014we just need to keep civilians safe, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that Jude is grateful, and that he\u2019s also careful to see that what information he receives from his father is kept under his hat,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Jackson is thinking about the situation?\u201d Whitney asked Angela. She hoped that her team leader would agree with the psychological assessment she had made of the killer at the task force meeting earlier. Jackson had worked with behavioral science units for years, had a firm understanding of psychology\u2014and was extremely familiar with that of killers.</p><p>This case had become personal somehow. Maybe because she empathized too much with the victims. Maybe because she had been the first to arrive in New York; Jackson had figured that she knew Lower Manhattan well since she\u2019d gone to NYU, and that she\u2019d make an excellent team representative while the rest of them gathered information and equipment.</p><p>She\u2019d never walked the streets as a hooker, she thought dryly, but she had seen a lot of pain and desperation in the streets of her native New Orleans, and she had seen how easy it could be for people to become desperate for the simplest necessities of life.</p><p>\u201cThe killer is so controlled,\u201d she murmured, shivering suddenly. \u201cAngela, the two Jane Does were killed like Emma Smith and Martha Tabrum\u2014murders that are accepted not as Ripper killings but as precursors to the events, precursors that wound up in the police files of the time. Down to the one being attacked, and dying en route to the hospital\u2014the other was pulled from the river. Assuming that we have someone trying to reenact what happened in Victorian London, he is still willing to take major chances, because the one girl was left alive, though so near death that she couldn\u2019t really help the police. That takes nerve\u2014I mean, killing someone that way was such an incredible risk! I\u2019m worried this killer could go on and on, because there are other victims in the original investigations and old files as well. Today, the cops and experts who study the files seem to agree on the five nineteenth-century victims\u2014but that\u2019s not the point. There were so many other victims who were being investigated at the time. Then, of course, there\u2019s the belief that he came to the States and killed Carrie Brown here. Police records say that Carrie Brown was the only woman butchered like a true Ripper victim, but that didn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t other murders\u2014or that the Ripper did die in New York if indeed he came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of killing for someone to reenact,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Whitney nodded, frowning. \u201cThere were \u2018accidents\u2019 at the site, too, when they were setting up to film the movie. Angus Avery, the director, believes beyond a doubt that there\u2019s something evil about the site. There\u2019s something going on, but, of course, I don\u2019t know what. I do think that once we\u2019ve had a chance to explore the construction area, we\u2019ll...well, we\u2019ll be on to something.\u201d</p><p>Angela rose to put her coffee cup in the sink. \u201cNo one goes there alone, Whitney.\u201d</p> <p>Whitney laughed. \u201cTrust me! I have no wish to wander around there alone. Ugh! But I do think that we need to get some cameras going in that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Tell Will, and the two of you decide just what equipment you\u2019re going to need and we\u2019ll all be your grunts this evening,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cThere is something very different in the contemporary murders,\u201d Whitney said, looking at Angela.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is far more than a century later,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Whitney shook her head gravely. \u201cThe Ripper\u2019s second victim was found more than a week after the first. But this man has killed two nights in a row. He\u2019s accelerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should get to the library,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Whitney agreed.</p><p>\u201cOur poor girl was already suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, but she hadn\u2019t been drinking the night she was killed. Stomach contents were well-digested, suggesting that it had been some time since she\u2019d eaten. I don\u2019t believe that the murderer had to have had a medical degree, but he definitely had some knowledge of anatomy\u2014the uterus and its appendages have been removed. The incisions have no hesitation, and are clean. There is no injury to the cervix uteri. The rectum has been avoided, while the upper portions of the vagina and two-thirds of the bladder have been taken from the body. They were not discovered on or anywhere near Melody Tatum.\u201d He paused, looking at Jude. \u201cTo my knowledge, they have yet to be discovered anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Jude shook his head. Dr. Fullbright had been meticulous. Officers had canvassed the entire area. The forensics team had been over the entire alley. Dumpsters had been pulled apart; not an inch had been overlooked.</p><p>He heard Fullbright\u2019s voice drone on; it didn\u2019t matter what he was saying. The woman on the autopsy table had been brutally butchered\u2014that much was apparent to the most untrained eye. And Jude knew as well that everything that Fullbright found was going to be consistent with the findings on the body of the Ripper\u2019s second victim, Annie Chapman.</p><p>The city was filled with possible suspects.</p><p>He had to narrow it down.</p><p>No matter what, it seemed to come back to the movie. He didn\u2019t know about Melody Tatum yet, but he was sure that he would discover that she\u2019d been promised a role in it\u2014or that she...</p><p>Had she slept with someone involved? Plied her trade upon the actor who had an agenda?</p><p>Time! They needed more time; even with the task force relentlessly questioning people for hours, there just wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><p>Fullbright finished the official autopsy after removing sections of tissue and drawing fluids for analysis. He stepped away from the table, stripping off his gloves and lifting his mask. He spoke to Jude, Jackson and Jenna.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jude,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I\u2019m one of those armchair detectives, always trying to study the newest on the Ripper case. I swear, it was almost as if the killer had an old autopsy diagram of Annie Chapman on him when he killed and mutilated this woman.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cI want the details kept confidential; I talked to Sayer just now, and he and his people have wasted hours listening to the confessions of petty criminals and plain old nutjobs, all just trying to get their names in the paper. And it\u2019s even harder to deal with the true mental patients who begin to think that they\u2019re evil. Sayer had one call from a prisoner who said that his astral self committed the murders, and another who told him that Jack the Ripper had scooped him up in a spaceship and then sent him down with instructions on what to do.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Fullbright nodded sympathetically. \u201cMy office will refer to the police spokesperson on any matter, Jude. But, I\u2019m afraid that the public will grow into a frenzy anyway. They\u2019ll think what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough, but let\u2019s not give them any validation,\u201d Jude said. He looked over at Jackson Crow. The man was his own height, with straight ink-black hair that gave credence to a Native American background. He had been quiet and grave during the autopsy, respecting Jude\u2019s position as the lead detective. Jenna Duffy, soft-spoken, her words musical with the hint of an old-world lilt, had been equally respectful, but her green eyes had been ever watchful as the autopsy had taken place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now Jude wanted an opinion; he knew all about Jackson Crow. Hannah had filled him in during a quick phone conversation just outside before he\u2019d joined the others in the autopsy room. Crow had an interesting background with the feds, having saved two team members who should have died with the others. He\u2019d been on leave after that, and then given the position to head the special team. He\u2019d had years of experience at Quantico before his current position, and was reputed to have a bull\u2019s-eye ability when it came to pegging the traits and psychology of a killer.</p><p>Jackson said, \u201cWhoever you\u2019re dealing with is organized and intelligent. You certainly wouldn\u2019t see him on the streets dripping the blood of his victims. He has a plan, and he\u2019s carrying it out. This isn\u2019t Victorian London, and he knows it. Whether he believes that Jack the Ripper came to the United States or not, he is working on that theory as he carries out his crimes, which makes him very dangerous. He\u2019s going to go for the next accepted step in the career of the past killer. Next up, you can expect a double event. One woman will be found quickly with her throat slashed. Then he\u2019ll find another, and he\u2019ll make sure that he has the time to carry out the mutilations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time does he need?\u201d Jude asked, looking from Fullbright to Jenna Duffy.</p> <p>The two looked at each other. \u201cFifteen to thirty minutes?\u201d Jenna asked Fullbright.</p><p>\u201cGive or take, depending on his skill,\u201d Fullbright said.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of weapon is he using?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say\u2014the blade is at least six inches,\u201d Fullbright told him. \u201cBut there are so many knives available today...might be a military weapon, or it might be a chef\u2019s knife. Six inches at least, and very sharp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jude said. \u201cKeep me posted, if anything,\u201d he told Fullbright.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Fullbright said.</p><p>As they left the building, Jude\u2019s phone rang. It was the deputy chief, suggesting another meeting for the next morning with the task force, and a briefing with the precinct beat, with a thorough briefing to be recorded for every law enforcement officer in New York City. Jude agreed, and told Jackson Crow the plan.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning, fine. Then I\u2019ll have you drop us back off at Blair House so that Whitney can walk us through the murder of the starlet, and we\u2019ll start exploring the area where the filming took place.\u201d</p><p>Jude agreed.</p><p>When he dropped the agents off, he was surprised that he wanted to go in, or ask that Whitney come out, just so that he could say hello, or make sure that she was...</p><p>Safe. She was an agent. She had sworn to lay down her life, just as he had.</p> <p>He\u2019d liked her as a partner; he wasn\u2019t sure when he had realized that. He wasn\u2019t easy. It had taken him a long time to get used to Monty, and when they had bonded, they had bonded. In a day, it had become easy to have Whitney at his side. As he drove away from Blair House, he made a call and made sure that his next interview subject\u2014the jerk who owned the escort agency\u2014would be waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was so exciting!\u201d Janice Hodge said. They stood in her office at the library. She was the librarian and historian charged with the care of archival documents. \u201cI can\u2019t help it\u2014I do tend to be starstruck, though, you just wouldn\u2019t believe it, we get so many celebrities here! But, then, of course, look at the pay-back some wonderful actors give the city. Think of what De Niro did with the film festival. And you can just honestly be walking down the street, and there\u2019s Nathan Lane in front of you!\u201d</p><p>She was an attractive young woman in a jacket, pencil skirt and stilettos\u2014not the old image of a librarian by any means.</p><p>But Whitney gently led her back to the subject at hand. \u201cWhat we need is to find out about research done on Jonathan Black. There\u2019s supposedly a ledger here\u2014probably in one of the rare-book rooms\u2014with information regarding the old House of Spiritualism, and Jonathan Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Well, of course, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. We had\u2014supervised, of course\u2014a number of the people from that shoot in here. The director and the two leads in the movie. Oh, and a prop man, and a set designer, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry Blanco, Bobby Walden and Angus Avery?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could give us a list,\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but I can\u2019t tell you exactly what they read. We supervise the rooms, naturally, and many books are kept under lock and key beneath glass, but when people are studying the history of the city in a certain room, we\u2019re not always sure which books they were looking at.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d be really grateful for your most recent list,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Oh, that murder was horrible,\u201d Janice Hodge said, shaking her beautiful, long brown hair. \u201cAnd so sad. Can you imagine how wonderful it was, though, before the dreadful business began?\u201d She sighed and then smiled. \u201cMr. Avery even suggested that I should be in the movie!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t take him up on it?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was actually at a library conference the last few days\u2014in Houston. But...I\u2019m a single mom of three. I can\u2019t afford to leave the day job. I can\u2019t even take a chance on losing the day job, no matter how starstruck I might be. If you\u2019ll hold on just a minute, I\u2019ll copy off the list for you.\u201d</p><p>When she returned, Whitney thanked her and she and Angela left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m amazed you didn\u2019t study it right away,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019d had a reaction, I\u2019d just as soon it not be seen,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cBut let\u2019s look at it now!\u201d</p><p>Out on the street, Whitney studied the piece of paper. \u201cAmazing, really,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cThe number of people who seem to care about history,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWell, the number of people in the city is amazing,\u201d Angela reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Whitney said. She kept reading. \u201cSo we know about the principals in the movie, and it\u2019s not a surprise, and they can certainly explain being there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think? Actors would be in on the research?\u201d Angela asked.</p><p>\u201cNot usually, but Angus Avery probably dragged them in\u2014made it like a promotional thing. He doesn\u2019t seem to miss a beat. So, we have the three of them...and there\u2019s a whole group here associated with the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who else?\u201d Angela demanded.</p><p>Whitney looked at her and shrugged, still feeling a bit of unease. \u201cAndrew, Jude\u2019s dad, was in here about\u2014\u201d she studied the dates on the sheet \u201c\u2014three weeks ago. And here\u2019s another name I know.\u201d She broke off and dialed her cell phone. Jude answered, and she told him where she and Angela had been.</p><p>\u201cAnything unusual in there?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThe movie people paid a visit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father\u2014a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not a surprise, either. Dad is always at the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dr. Fullbright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Jude said. And that was all.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Detective Magnor Honeywell,\u201d Whitney told the others, \u201cthe House of Spiritualism began benignly enough\u2014the spiritualism rage was still going on, and all kinds of tarot readers and mediums took up residence here. It was an abandoned church, more or less put out of business because of St. Paul\u2019s and Trinity. Whatever the Constitution might say about freedom of religion, the people still weren\u2019t tremendously accepting of anything beyond their own Protestant beliefs. The foundations became a basement, and at first, because it was rather dark and eerie, most of the s\u00e9ances and readings were done in rooms in the basement. The police did raid the place, but when they arrived, there was nothing to be found, other than tarot cards, books and a lot of tea\u2014I believe a number of the spiritualists read tea leaves as well. But, according to rumor, when the mysterious Jonathan Black moved in, the devil worshipping began, with markings on the floor, black masses, worship of relics\u2014having belonged to an infamous historical personage\u2014and all that kind of thing. The black masses also took place in the basement. Magnor Honeywell writes a truly gut-wrenching portrait of the era and the final demise of the Five Points sector. In the tenements themselves\u2014without benefit of anything that might be construed as devil-worshipping evil\u2014they were constantly finding the bodies of children dead of disease or starvation. There were hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of immigrants pouring into the country on a daily basis, and therefore, record keeping was poor, and there can be little documentation of the fact that many people ever lived much less died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, on to the basement,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cEveryone is armed...and hard hats and lights? It is a construction zone, and the mayor is apparently terrified that one of us is going to kill him or herself. The only reason we can legally go in unescorted by a contractor is that the mayor is so desperate to find the killer, and I think he believes he\u2019s grasping at straws himself to think that we might find anything in the rubble that can help us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so let\u2019s head on over,\u201d Jake said, grinning sheepishly. \u201cThese may be feather-light cameras and recorders, but they\u2019re damn heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, quit whining,\u201d Will said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the heavy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have,\u201d Jake said lightly. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m going to need a masseuse on the expense account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, you won\u2019t get one,\u201d Angela teased. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to hope that your beloved Ashley is able to make a trip up here, if this goes on too long.\u201d</p><p>Jake was engaged now, but he and his fianc\u00e9e both knew that his work and his dedication to the team would frequently make for separations. He\u2019d found the perfect woman: Ashley Donegal understood his situation completely. But then Ashley had been involved personally in one of their investigations, and if she were to join them at any point, she\u2019d be an asset. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna murmured, \u201cWe need to do this. Jackson is right, the next time the killer strikes, it\u2019s going to be a double event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnward to the House of Spiritualism,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>He led the way; the last out of Blair House, Whitney made sure that she locked the door as they departed, and she locked the gate as well. She wasn\u2019t sure if locking the gate\u2014or even the doors\u2014could protect them if someone was determined to break in, but she had no intention of making it easy for anyone. She looked back at Blair House as she followed the others.</p> <p>That afternoon, they\u2019d finished positioning their powerful magnifying cameras toward the property next door, but even so, Whitney knew, the darkness and shadows would stop them from discovering what she was expecting to find in the basement area of the House of Spiritualism. She and Will had discussed their options, and they had ten of what Jake described as the \u201cfeather lights\u201d to be set up in the foundations along with an equal number of recorders; until they explored the site, they wouldn\u2019t know if they\u2019d figured accurately.</p><p>The gate at the construction site meant little. It was a bad lock, and the fencing around the site was chain link. Around the block on the other side, they saw that a single night watchman was on duty at his canvas-covered tent. She was sure that he made certain no pedestrians or cars entered through the main gate, yet she was equally sure that he remained at his post through the night, and didn\u2019t wander into the vast expanse of the property.</p><p>Jackson waved his light toward the guard to let him know that it was the team entering the property. Then he set his powerful beam on the ground that lay before them, and started toward the abyss of the foundations.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Jenna demanded suddenly, pointing her own beam toward what appeared to be a lump to their right, near the deconstruction of some scaffolding. Jackson quickly turned her way, approaching the site. A tarp lay over what might have been a body.</p><p>Jackson drew the tarp aside.</p> <p>For a moment, Whitney\u2019s stomach twisted. There appeared to be a female in late-nineteenth-century dress, white button-up blouse and navy skirt, face-down in the dirt. But Jackson quickly hunkered down, touched the form and let out an audible sigh of relief. \u201cMannequin,\u201d he said. \u201cShe must be left over from some kind of shoot.\u201d</p><p>They moved on. A treacherous flight of steps led downward into the gaping hole of the foundations. Plywood covered some areas over the foundation support walls, and in other areas, they could look up to the night sky. They moved on down, Jake and Will warning one another to be careful with the equipment.</p><p>The original structure must have been very large, perhaps a good ten thousand feet just on the ground floor. While their lights displayed the usual\u2014hard earth for the floor, with remnants here and there of brick and wood, along with brick support walls\u2014they also created shadows and proved the fact that the foundation itself had been broken up in many areas.</p><p>\u201cI think this is the largest section, right here, at the base of the stairs,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd if Magnor Honeywell was right in his assumption of where black masses might have been carried out, I believe it would have been right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s set up two of the cameras,\u201d Will told her.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Jake said, setting down his burden.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll do this in threes,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cJake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, hang with Will and Whitney and help unpack,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Jackson grinned. \u201cAngela, Jenna and I will venture around the walls,\u201d he said.</p><p>For once in her life, Whitney wished she could be the one exploring rather than working on the technical side. But she set to work with Will, unpacking their cameras and recorders.</p><p>\u201cWill these broadcast on the screens back in the hallway at Blair House?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, each camera has to be set, but each camera has a dedicated screen,\u201d Whitney assured him.</p><p>\u201cOne at each end?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>Whitney nodded, and then realized that he might not see her; his flashlight was angled on the boxes.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Jake, grab the tripod there for me, please?\u201d she asked, heading toward the far wall with one of the cameras. \u201cThese batteries are supposed to last twenty-four hours, so we\u2019ll have to change them again tomorrow evening, starting out a little earlier.\u201d</p><p>Jake came with the tripod and she set up the camera. She hit a switch, turning it on. She heard a little whir; she\u2019d poised the camera angle on the stairway, but the little whir assured her that the motion detector was working. The lens would follow them while they were in the foundations. It would later direct itself toward anything that moved.</p><p>They did get a lot of shots of rats that way, but they\u2019d also managed to capture unusual phenomena in the past.</p><p>A green light came on, assuring her that the remote was feeding into the screens back in the main hallway of Blair House.</p><p>Jake walked over to where Will was setting up, straightening out the legs of the tripod being positioned on the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Whitney started to follow him, when she froze, aware of a sound behind her. She turned quickly.</p><p>At first, she saw nothing.</p><p>Then she heard the sound again. It was a soft whining.</p><p>The camera clicked and whirred, turning itself.</p><p>There, against the shadows of the far rear wall was a dog.</p><p>No. The dog. Huge, furry and beautiful. It was the mixed-shepherd hound she had seen when she had awakened this morning.</p><p>The phantom dog that had guarded the phantom woman.</p><p>He trotted up to Whitney; she hunched down and stroked his massive head, and it seemed to be real. She watched and felt it as he licked her fingers.</p><p>And faded into the night.</p><p>8</p><p>Harold Patterson wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.</p><p>He was tall, slim and fit, with a head of rich dark hair that was as sleek as his designer suit. His office was posh, on the twentieth floor of a renovated building in Tribeca. Before entering the man\u2019s office, Jude read the notes that Sayer had texted to him. Fellow is slimy as a rat but has a law degree; he can carry off prostitution as legally as the Catholic Church hires nuns. Melody Tatum was not scheduled to escort anyone anywhere last night; she\u2019d asked him to leave her off the bookings, but I\u2019m obtaining a warrant anyway to check out his client list, and what bookings were made for last night.</p><p>Now Jude looked at the man himself, sitting across the elegant, polished cherry-wood desk that was the centerpiece of an office designed to make a wealthy client feel that he or she was among equals, and as such, safe.</p><p>\u201cThis is truly horrible, which I told your comrade Detective Sayer. Melody was a beautiful woman, and she had such a touch of class about her. And you realize, of course, that congressmen, businessmen, busy men come to this city and they\u2019re expected to make appearances at cocktail parties, dinners and all manner of social occasions. Not to mention the fact that a man with numbers spinning in his head might just need a night out at a theater or a concert, and desire a companion with whom to discuss the event. Melody was an amazingly kind and sympathetic woman\u2014she wasn\u2019t just beautiful,\u201d Patterson said.</p><p>Jude leaned forward, not about to be intimidated by his surroundings, and certainly not about to believe the spiel about his escorts being nothing other than educated sounding boards or eye candy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not concerned with anything that has to do with your real business practices, Mr. Patterson. You\u2019re a pimp in a suit, and your girls are better-dressed hookers.\u201d</p><p>Patterson\u2019s face mottled and he looked as if he was going to explode with a denial, but Jude rose to his full height and stared down at the man. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about that at the moment. If I did, it wouldn\u2019t matter. But you can spout your legal rights and the Constitution at me for hours. The city is in crisis, and we can acquire all the warrants we need. There is just cause. I\u2019m concerned with the death of Melody Tatum, and the fact that a modern-day madman is at work in the streets of New York trying to prove that he\u2019s Jack the Ripper reincarnated. I want to know who Melody was seeing the night she was killed. Unless, of course, she happened to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Patterson, clearly tongue-tied, opened his desk drawer and produced a ledger. \u201cMy God! I\u2019ve never even hit a woman! I didn\u2019t kill her\u2014I was with Holly Blum, another of my employees, all night. She\u2019ll testify to that, swear on a dozen bibles! I don\u2019t know who Melody was with! Honestly. And I\u2019ve handed over the list of clients who come through here. Honestly. And they can take my computer\u2014you can bring in all your techs.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cOnly thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing is?\u201d Jude demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing, really,\u201d Patterson mumbled quickly.</p><p>Jude leaned on his desk, and brought his face down close to Patterson\u2019s. \u201cOnly thing is what?\u201d</p><p>Patterson winced. \u201cI, uh, I\u2019m not always sure they give their real identities.\u201d</p><p>Jude eased back. Patterson hadn\u2019t killed anyone; gut instinct.</p><p>\u201cCongressmen, yeah, accountants, sports stars\u2014movie people?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGuys with money who want a girl who doesn\u2019t look like a two-bit floozy come here. It\u2019s not like they hand me their personal credit cards,\u201d he said. He looked up at Jude. \u201cYou said I was a pimp and my girls were hookers. Well, a john is a john as well, whether he\u2019s a horny teen looking for a quick hookup, or a guy in a designer suit who wants the illusion that he\u2019s with a do-over \u2018Pretty Woman.\u2019 Producers, directors, presidents\u2014they all have the same basic biology.\u201d</p><p>Jude drew the man\u2019s ledger over to him, flipping through the pages, looking at the names, running his finger down the pages.</p><p>His finger stopped. He looked over at Patterson.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>Frowning, Patterson looked at the entry.</p><p>Jonathan Black.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Patterson said.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is it?\u201d Jude demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just a phone call...and you can see by the date\u2014he was scheduled to go out with Melody more than a week ago,\u201d Patterson said.</p><p>\u201cJust a phone call? You don\u2019t demand payment in advance?\u201d Jude asked.</p> <p>\u201cCash,\u201d Patterson said.</p><p>\u201cYou just send a woman out on the streets with a man who promises to pay cash?\u201d Jude said incredulously.</p><p>Patterson seemed to be shrinking in his chair. \u201cMany men don\u2019t want their identities known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he come in with the cash?\u201d Jude demanded.</p><p>Patterson winced again. \u201cIt was in an envelope under the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod help me, by any wild chance, do you have the envelope?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Patterson, as he had expected, shook his head. \u201cI tossed it,\u201d he said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cAnd the cash is in the bank, right?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Patterson brightened. \u201cOh, no!\u201d Again, he practically bit his own tongue shutting up. He couldn\u2019t have been much of an attorney, Jude decided.</p><p>\u201cRight. It wouldn\u2019t be in the bank. It would be under-the-table income,\u201d Jude said. He leaned toward the man again. \u201cI need it.\u201d</p><p>Patterson looked a little ill again.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at it,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cI\u2014uh\u2014I went out and splurged on this suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole thing? Patterson, damn it, do you have anything left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe...maybe.\u201d He stood and reached into his pocket and drew out a slim leather wallet. He dug in it and leafed through his bills, producing one. \u201cThis...well, I\u2019ve mixed up money, but I wasn\u2019t carrying any other hundreds...this is the last, I think!\u201d</p><p>Jude reached for a tissue, took the bill from him and wrapped it. He doubted they could really gain anything from it; a killer organized and meticulous enough to have gone this far had probably worn gloves when he\u2019d handled the money. They were likely to get dozens of prints, and possibly, none of them the killer\u2019s.</p><p>But he was grasping at straws. And he\u2019d found one.</p><p>\u201cWhitney?\u201d She stood and turned around.</p><p>Jake, tall, handsome and lanky, was staring at her with concern.</p> <p>She winced. \u201cDid you see it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog?\u201d Whitney let out a breath. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jake walked over to her and set his hands on her shoulders. \u201cWhitney, because I didn\u2019t see it doesn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t there. You mean a ghost dog, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI guess seeing a ghost dog isn\u2019t all that helpful, is it?\u201d</p><p>Jake affectionately touched her cheek. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, do we? You may have a key to many pieces of information through that dog,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Whitney heard a shuffling sound from the stairway. Startled, she and Jake spun around.</p><p>Jude Crosby was coming down the stone steps that remained on the ground that led into the foundations.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he called.</p><p>Whitney was surprised to see him there. She was equally surprised that they hadn\u2019t heard him coming; they had to be more vigilant.</p><p>\u201cIs anything new?\u201d Whitney asked, breaking away from Jake and walking toward him. \u201cYou met with the guy who runs the escort agency\u2014Patterson?\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to another meeting with the director, Angus Avery, and a few members of his cast and crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found something that points to the film crew?\u201d Jake asked. Will walked curiously toward them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He paused a minute. \u201cI found the name Jonathan Black written in Harold Patterson\u2019s ledger. Naturally, whoever he is, Patterson never saw him. He dealt with him over the phone, but he had an appointment with Melody Tatum a week before the murder. Jonathan Black can\u2019t be that unusual a name, but under the circumstances...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the circumstances,\u201d Whitney said evenly, \u201cI\u2019d say that our killer definitely believes that Jonathan Black was Jack the Ripper, and that he\u2019s taking on his persona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sound theory,\u201d Jude agreed. \u201cI\u2019d hoped that knowing who had been in to study the rare books would be more helpful. I\u2019m not surprised that either my father\u2019s name or Fullbright\u2019s name were on the list. Fullbright is an armchair detective, fascinated by the Ripper and the past\u2014and the possibility that he came to the States. And my father is such a history buff. And I\u2019m not surprised about the film crew. Angus Avery claimed to be working on accuracy. He\u2019s an excellent excuse for having looked into the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong with his key actors,\u201d Whitney added.</p><p>\u201cAccuracy again, I guess,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThe list is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Jude told her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that we still don\u2019t have a real shred of forensic evidence against anyone\u2014though I\u2019m now trying for a print on a hundred-dollar bill. The only witness we had to the night that Virginia Rockford was killed is Captain Tyler, and I doubt he\u2019d do well on the stand, even if he had actually seen anyone he could identify\u2014other than a cloaked figure that looked like Jack the Ripper. But, yeah, I think someone who has something to do with that film is involved\u2014gut feeling, if you will. We\u2019ll go over what we\u2019ve discovered, the autopsy reports and discuss the psychology of the killer further at the meeting in the morning.\u201d He paused, looking at Whitney. \u201cI knew you were here, so I thought I\u2019d stop by and see if there was anything you needed\u2014or anything you\u2019d discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, we\u2019re just on setup,\u201d Whitney told him.</p><p>He nodded, but she was pretty sure he was thinking that it hadn\u2019t taken a special team to arrive at the Ripper theory. He was skeptical that cameras in the foundation of an old building\u2014even a building where terrible things had once been done\u2014could really make a difference.</p><p>Yet, he had been told to work with their unit of the FBI; he would do so.</p><p>\u201cJude, if we can discover more about the person this killer is trying to emulate, it will tell us more about him, and hopefully, help you trip him up,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jude said politely. \u201cProfiling a killer can be extremely helpful.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not exactly profiling when you get the information from a ghost, Whitney thought. But she kept silent.</p><p>Jackson appeared with Jenna and Angela and greeted Jude with, \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>Jude briefed Jackson and the others on his meeting. \u201cI\u2019m praying we don\u2019t get another victim tonight,\u201d Jude said. \u201cI\u2019ve got patrol cars doubled up all over Lower Manhattan\u2014the Bowery isn\u2019t that far from the south end of Broadway, and I have a feeling the killer is going to stick to the area. It\u2019s a gamble, but if this killer is working on the identity of Jonathan Black as the Ripper, then he will keep his murder spree down in this area.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI see that you\u2019re busy, and I know that Whitney\u2019s expertise is film, but that\u2019s why I really came by\u2014Angus Avery seemed to have some kind of rapport with you, Whitney. I thought it might work well if you accompanied me to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised; she tried not to show it. \u201cI can finish up here with Jake\u2019s help,\u201d Will said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure the police consider the interview far more important than our work down here with cameras\u2014always a long shot,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cWhitney, yes, go on with Detective Crosby,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and was surprised at how glad she was to leave the foundation of the old building, and the miasma that seemed to loom there.</p><p>Or maybe she was just glad to join Jude again.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter; Jackson had assigned her to go.</p><p>Tonight, Angus Avery was simply annoyed. His two young stars, Bobby Walden and Sherry Blanco, were nervous, anxious\u2014and bored. Missy Everett and Jane Deaver, the girls who had been prostitute extras and had last been with Virginia Rockford, were scared, huddled together on a couch. They seemed so nervous, in fact, that they didn\u2019t even seem excited to be in the company of greatness\u2014Angus Avery, the director, and Walden and Blanco, the two stars of the movie O\u2019Leary\u2019s. Which was good; they were unaware that the two spoiled celebrities seemed to think nothing of them at all. The security guard, Samuel Vintner, sat by himself, rolling his hat and looking awkward in the plush lounge of the five-star hotel that housed Avery.</p><p>He was sure that all of them would have bolted when he was on his way over if it weren\u2019t for the two members of Sayer\u2019s team who had escorted them to the lounge and held sentinel at the door until Jude had arrived with Whitney.</p><p>\u201cDetective, I\u2019m happy to help with this investigation, but I\u2019m a busy man. I\u2019m the director, you know. The producers are under the gun to come in under budget. I\u2019m naturally horrified that young women are being murdered, but you\u2019re a cop and I\u2019m a filmmaker. I need to be making my film. We\u2019re already going to go over by several days and several million dollars,\u201d Avery complained. He looked toward the two men at the door and added in an aggravated tone, \u201cMy costume department has been ravaged, our wardrobe mistress is in tears daily and I met with you immediately to tell you what I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to get a real picture of what went on that day,\u201d Jude said. He smiled pleasantly. \u201cYou\u2019re quite something, Mr. Avery. Impressive, the way you look into realism.\u201d</p><p>Avery frowned. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only did you look up information at the library\u2014studying rare ledgers\u2014but you brought along your lead players.\u201d</p><p>Sherry gasped. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t actually known just which document the trio had studied, but now they did.</p><p>\u201cYou signed in, right?\u201d Jude asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Avery said, waving a hand in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we give the film the edge of realism. And I\u2019m a tough taskmaster as a director. It\u2019s not who you are all the time, it\u2019s also what you want in a situation. And if you understand your situation, you can be passionate about it. The film is about a time in history. I wanted Bobby and Sherry to understand history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014great,\u201d Sherry said.</p><p>\u201cDitto. I enjoyed the library,\u201d Bobby said.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that we went to the library makes us suspects?\u201d Avery inquired, frowning. \u201cIf an interest in special documents makes us suspect, then you\u2019re going to have a lot of suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jude said easily. He changed his line of questioning. \u201cAgent Tremont has worked in film. She\u2019ll understand anything you have to say when I may not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and frankly we\u2019re intrigued by the set, and the information you gave us previously, Mr. Avery,\u201d Whitney said. She offered him an easy smile. He seemed somewhat mollified.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what else I can tell you. The movie is a major production, you know. And we were filming that day, before breaking down to set up at the next location. I should have never chosen that location, never! It might have been the so-called Darby Building that was recently brought down, but it was once the House of Spiritualism, and I don\u2019t like to be a superstitious man, but I honestly feel that there is something simply evil there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d Bobby muttered. \u201cSorry, Mr. Avery, I just didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like it. I wouldn\u2019t have been hanging around that place once it got late!\u201d Sherry Blanco protested.</p><p>\u201cIt was creepy,\u201d Jane Deaver said. \u201cI hated being there. And we tried to get Ginger to leave with us. We tried!\u201d Huge tears formed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone lurking around the set? Did you feel as if you were being watched? Was anything out of the ordinary?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Missy said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. I mean, it was just creepy!\u201d Jane said. \u201cWhen night came, the lighting was so low and there were shadows everywhere, and the shadows seemed to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShadows move when the object casting them moves,\u201d Bobby Walden said quietly. \u201cThere were people all around\u2014until late.\u201d He looked at Whitney. \u201cYou know, the wardrobe folks, the crew. Breakdown calls for a lot of workers, and the camera crews were wrapping up. Production assistants were wrapping up...and then it\u2019s the end of the day. People get the hell out of there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho was left at the end?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cSammy was still there,\u201d Missy said, pointing at the retired cop. \u201cSammy was with us on the sidewalk, just outside the chain-link fence, until the cab came.\u201d</p><p>Samuel Vintner, ex-cop, going to ruin, with gin blossoms on his cheekbones and a paunch, grew red and shook his grizzled head. \u201cI\u2019d have been there for Virginia Rockford, too, but she\u2014sorry, don\u2019t mean to speak ill of the dead\u2014but she just bitched at me. I even offered her a ride home. She didn\u2019t want me around her, so I went to make sure that the crew was out and that the gates were all locked again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the cheap padlocks,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014that\u2019s the city, not us!\u201d Sammy protested. He looked at Jude. \u201cI swear, yeah, I may have been one of the last people to see her alive, but I tried my best to make sure she was safe, and when she was on location, she was safe. I offered her a ride. She told me no, she wouldn\u2019t drive with me if I were the last creep on earth. She was in a huff, angry about something. She left, headed straight to walk north on Broadway and when she was locked out, and I went to the guard on the other side of the block\u2014the city fellow\u2014and told him I was leaving. The place was empty. I\u2019d seen to that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go from the site, Mr. Vintner?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cHome, where my wife warmed up my dinner. My sister-in-law\u2014who hates me, by the way\u2014was there. They\u2019ll both tell you that I was home thirty minutes after the set closed for the day. Miss Rockford was angry\u2014and, sorry, it\u2019s true, she wasn\u2019t the nicest person in the world\u2014and she left in kind of a huff, treating me like I was a gnat in her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even speak with Ms. Rockford!\u201d Sherry Blanco said. She was an attractive woman, extremely pretty, blue-eyed and blonde and slim as a reed. Her words betrayed little empathy, despite the public service announcement she had done.</p> <p>\u201cNot once? Not once during the shoot?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t in the scene she was in. I was on set that day, but I left by three-thirty. Look, I\u2019m sorry, truly sorry for this woman. But bad things happen in this city every day, and I can\u2019t let them all tear me apart. I left the set early. Detective, you can\u2019t possibly suspect me!\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled, not agreeing that it would be impossible. \u201cMs. Blanco, we were hoping that you might have met Miss Rockford, and perhaps exchanged a few words with her. Or that you might have seen someone perhaps watching her on the set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t speak with her.\u201d She waved a hand in the air. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said, fluttering her lashes at him, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you just don\u2019t understand a movie set, and the logistics that go with it all. There might have been another major player in the movie that I didn\u2019t meet. It depends on your call times and scenes, and who is in the scenes. You just don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d Whitney said sweetly.</p><p>Sherry Blanco stared at Whitney, irritated. \u201cLook! I didn\u2019t speak with her! I didn\u2019t see anyone hanging around her. Bobby talked to her, though. She and Bobby were in a steamy scene together, one of the last filmed that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was nice to her,\u201d Bobby said, startled, and edging away from his costar. \u201cWe were working together. Of course I talked to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was waiting for you!\u201d Missy Everett said, suddenly bolting to her feet as if she\u2019d erupted from the couch. \u201cYou had to know it\u2014I knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bobby gasped.</p><p>\u201cShe was waiting for you! She thought that you were going to call her to hang out with you for a while when the filming was done,\u201d Missy said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jane Deaver agreed. \u201cWhen we tried to get her to leave, she said that she was going to hang out with you.\u201d</p><p>Bobby reddened to the shade of a tomato. \u201cI\u2014I talked to her. I didn\u2019t make a date with her or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she sure thought that you did,\u201d Jane said, staring at him accusingly.</p><p>Jane caught her friend by the shoulders and drew her back to the sofa, whispering something.</p><p>Bobby suddenly seemed distraught. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if she believed that. And, I hate to say it, but if she planned on spending time with me, it\u2019s not because she was bowled over by me\u2014she probably thought it might get her attention from the right people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane, you know that\u2019s true!\u201d Missy said softly.</p><p>Jude was pretty sure it was a warning that if she wanted to work again, she needed to calm down about Bobby Walden.</p><p>Missy said, \u201cLook, we liked Ginger, and we weren\u2019t happy about leaving her, but she insisted. We didn\u2019t see anyone\u2014Sammy walked us to the street and we got into a cab together. I didn\u2019t see anyone watching Ginger in any weird way during the day, except, of course, the actors, who were supposed to be sizing up the available prostitutes. And they all turned it on and off. Detective, you know that we really have spoken with other cops\u2014they were all over us and everyone else who had been at the site, down to the limo drivers.\u201d</p><p>Jude smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s their job, you know,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey check and verify everything. They even know that a cabdriver named Abdel Mohammed picked you two up and dropped you at the B-Way Caf\u00e9 up in Midtown.\u201d</p><p>Missy and Jane looked at each other with wide eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know his name, did you?\u201d Missy asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cWell, when there are two of us, I don\u2019t usually go getting chummy with the cabdriver!\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Angus Avery said. He tapped his watch. \u201cTime. Time is money. Directors who come in way above budget don\u2019t get hired again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Avery!\u201d Whitney said, her eyes golden and luminescent. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you have to worry. We\u2019ll be sure that the media know just how helpful you\u2019ve been. That\u2019s going to be tremendously important when your work is judged. You can be the man who helped the women of New York City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whores of New York City,\u201d Sherry Blanco muttered.</p><p>They all turned to look at her. \u201cI do read the papers, you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she reads People and US Weekly,\u201d Bobby muttered.</p><p>\u201cBobby, you\u2019re just being cruel. And I\u2019m not being stupid or mean, just truthful. This has been all over the news. They identified the girl from the river\u2014in fact, I heard that one of the educational channels is going to do a sob-story thing on her called The Girl from the River! What was her name? Sarah whatever. She couldn\u2019t get real work, so she started stripping. I saw Virginia Rockford on that set, and she may not have hung up a shingle, but she was for sale. And now that poor woman this morning...Melody Tatum. High-priced escort! Well, in truth, they were all whores. That\u2019s who the Ripper went after, right?\u201d She looked at Jude hopefully.</p><p>Jude felt tension searing him like a blade; Whitney set a hand on his arm and squeezed lightly.</p><p>\u201cMs. Blanco,\u201d Jude said, \u201cno one really knows for certain who the killer will target next, and it doesn\u2019t matter if anyone knows those who were killed, or is like those who were killed. With this killer, he seems to be moved by his perception of the victim, and God alone knows how he might perceive anyone out there. Especially a high-profile actress.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whitney jabbed him in the elbow as Sherry Blanco\u2019s face whitened. No, he didn\u2019t want her to walk the streets shaking; he did want her to give a damn that women were dead.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey were brutally murdered. And we need any piece of information, no matter how trivial, that anyone can offer to help us catch him.\u201d</p><p>Sherry leaned forward then, pale, and looking somewhat contrite. \u201cHonest to God, Detective, I just never spoke with Virginia Rockford during the day. But that site was creepy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally creepy when it turned dark,\u201d Missy said. \u201cThe lights aren\u2019t all that great down there, you know. I mean, the real lights, the streetlights, not the set lights. If anyone moved on the street, it cast giant shadows over the stage flats that were up. We had all kinds of facades going during the day, but they were mostly just painted wood, put up and pulled down for the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be using the exterior of Blair House for a number of green-screen shots we took that day,\u201d Angus explained slowly to Jude, his tone indicating that since Jude wasn\u2019t in the film business, he was most probably dense. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll edit the image of Blair House into the action shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I got it,\u201d Jude said. \u201cWe had an eyewitness down in the area when Virginia Rockford was filmed. The eyewitness saw a man in a cloak, or a coat with caped shoulders, on the street.\u201d Inwardly he winced. \u201cHe was carrying a medical bag\u2014and wearing a stovepipe hat, or something similar. Was there an extra on the set in that attire that day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They all looked at each other. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in period costume. The movie is called O\u2019Leary\u2019s and it is about the destitution and dire situations in Lower Manhattan and how it was cleaned up at the end of the nineteenth century,\u201d Bobby said. \u201cBut no one had any kind of medical bag, I don\u2019t think,\u201d he said, looking at Angus Avery.</p><p>Avery sighed. \u201cDetective, I just don\u2019t think you understand the scope of what went on that day. Sets went up, and sets came down\u2014that meant hundreds of crew members. We had gangs fighting in the streets. That meant more than a hundred extras. You must know all this\u2014the police have lists of every single person hired that day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd a number of the extras would have worn that kind of cloak and hat,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember that the costumer gave anyone a medical bag\u2014or that anyone in Wardrobe handed any of the extras any kind of medical bag,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, though, that I wished I\u2019d never chosen that location,\u201d Angus said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you choose the location, Mr. Avery?\u201d Whitney asked. \u201cFeeling the way you do about it\u2014I mean, you were the one to tell us about the structure that had been there before the recently demolished building.\u201d</p><p>Avery lifted both his hands and rubbed his fingers together toward the ceiling. \u201cMoney! Everything in film is money. We could set up easily, and break down easily, and the city was willing to rent it for a song. If I could only go back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the woman found this morning wasn\u2019t on the set and wasn\u2019t in the movie,\u201d Sherry said. \u201cSo, Angus, for you to be upset with yourself over the location isn\u2019t at all necessary. You\u2019re not to blame. The killer was out there.\u201d She walked over to the director, and gave him a consoling hug.</p> <p>Jude knew that he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere that evening. He stood and told them gravely, \u201cThank you all for meeting here and speaking with us. The station number and my cell is on my card. Please, if you think of anything that can help us, call. Day or night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Avery said, standing. It almost seemed as if he was shaking Sherry Blanco off as he did so.</p><p>Avery looked around the room. \u201cWe\u2019re done here,\u201d he said, wanting the extras, his two stars and Sammy Vintner out\u2014leaving him alone.</p><p>There was an awkward pause as everyone stared at Jude in silence. He nodded, looked at Whitney and turned to head out of the room and to the elevators.</p><p>\u201cAvery wants them all out,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I got that feeling,\u201d Jude told her.</p><p>\u201cBut it seems they all want to talk to one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll wait and watch them,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>\u201cWhere will that get us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but let\u2019s see who leaves first.\u201d</p><p>Downstairs, they went to Jude\u2019s car parked on the street. He slid into the driver\u2019s seat and she walked around to the passenger\u2019s side.</p><p>They had barely closed the doors when Samuel Vintner came out and strode in the direction of the subway.</p><p>Not sixty seconds later, Missy and Jane came out together.</p><p>Next, Bobby Walden. Jude picked up his cell phone and pressed a single digit. \u201cSayer, you\u2019re near the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in back of you about a block,\u201d Sayer told him.</p><p>\u201cBobby Walden is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m tailing him.\u201d</p><p>Whitney sat quietly at his side. \u201cBobby Walden?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her. \u201cHis alibi had him home alone. He said his driver picked him up and brought him home, and when the task force queried the car company, the driver verified that he\u2019d brought him straight home. That doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t go back out. He\u2019s a principal in the film, and the girls said that Virginia Rockford thought she had a hot date with him. I\u2019d just like to make sure that he does go home and stays home tonight.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet. They were both hoping that the killer didn\u2019t strike again that night. They waited.</p><p>\u201cSo, Sherry Blanco is sleeping with the director, and not her costar,\u201d Jude commented.</p><p>Whitney laughed softly. \u201cAnd see, you didn\u2019t even have to major in film to figure that one out, Detective!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t seem to want her clinging to him,\u201d Jude commented.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she got him to change his mind,\u201d Whitney said lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do imagine she could be persuasive,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Whitney queried, a teasing note in her voice.</p><p>He turned and looked at her, and smiled suddenly. The tension of the past two days had seemed monumental. Though his job meant much more than just something to do for a living, sometimes he had to remember that he was still kicking and breathing himself.</p><p>\u201cNot my type at all,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThat girl has a streak of ambition sharper than a blade and she\u2019s... I don\u2019t know. I imagine her walking around her own house in little heels that click on the floor with some kind of a froufrou yappy dog in her arms, making sure at all times that everyone around her knows that she\u2019s a movie star. I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s stupid\u2014she just doesn\u2019t care about the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting! And harsh,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you describe Miss Blanco?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe might keep a cat instead of a froufrou dog,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cA Persian, perhaps. Or a designer cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesigner cats exist?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cI do believe that Sherry Blanco was having a thing with the director, but I\u2019m willing to bet that the \u2018thing\u2019 is no more,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cShe is scared, and I think she\u2019s trying to be honest. And it\u2019s better that she\u2019s honest than act as if she\u2019s lost her best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still too ambitious for me.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhat do I know? I have some friends who have worked Broadway, and they\u2019re all really nice. Sherry Blanco doesn\u2019t seem to be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome actors and actresses are nicer than others. And some cops are nicer than others,\u201d Whitney pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9!\u201d</p><p>Whitney turned to him. \u201cWhat difference does it make if Sherry Blanco was sleeping with Angus Avery? The fact that he can act like a lecher wouldn\u2019t make him a murderer.\u201d</p><p>Jude said quietly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might show where alliances lie. She was ready to throw Bobby Walden to the wolves tonight. We were supposed to believe that he had planned to meet Virginia Rockford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken about an accomplice,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cDo you believe that Sherry Blanco could be that person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I believe that if Angus Avery needed an alibi, Sherry Blanco would lie through her teeth for him, smiling and fawning all the while,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but when you\u2019re an actress, you need to know the directors, not so your fellow actors,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Directors cast movies, not actors.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, his cell phone rang. It was Ellis Sayer.</p><p>\u201cA limo picked Bobby Walden up at the cross street and drove him straight to his place up by the park. I saw him get out and go into the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a patrol car sit on him,\u201d Sayer told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s keep an eye on him tonight,\u201d Jude agreed.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Sayer said.</p><p>He hung up. Whitney was frowning in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOld Shakespeare,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cCarrie Brown, the American victim who was killed in like manner to the Ripper victims... What I was thinking was that they called her Old Shakespeare because she was always quoting Shakespeare, and she either performed in the theater at some time, or, at the very least, had experience with plays in one way or another. She seemed to have been well educated, even if she had become an alcoholic and a prostitute before she died. Maybe the killer isn\u2019t targeting prostitutes, but actresses\u2014or would-be actresses!\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Whitney debated mentioning the fact that they hadn\u2019t eaten; it was late.</p><p>She was tired and hungry, and she was curious about anything that the team might have found in the foundations of the House of Spiritualism, but she also felt as if she had been saturated with the sadness and horror of the murders. Bobby Walden had been taken home that night; Angus Avery had spoken at a dinner. That didn\u2019t mean that one of them hadn\u2019t driven back downtown. She needed a break to clear her head and step back, and wonder just what it might all have to do with the past. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What they had to do was pray that they could find a piece of evidence that truly pointed them in the direction of the killer\u2014before he struck again.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t known for being shy, and yet, she felt somewhat awkward around Jude. Her first impression of him had been that he was just a hard, cold, macho cop, and that she had to stoically and quietly hold her ground. But the more she was with him, the more she liked him, and the more she accepted that fact, the more she accepted that she was physically attracted to him. She also had to accept that he was extremely attractive in all the right ways; many women probably felt the same\u2014simple biology, he was rock solid, tall and strong, the kind of man whose survival instincts would have made him most appealing once upon a time\u2014and that he appeared totally indifferent to his effect on those around him. He was confident, but not cocky, and could be aggressive, but also careful in his treatment of people, as in the case of Captain Tyler. If he had something to go on, she was certain he could be harsh but fair in an interrogation room as well.</p><p>\u201cFood,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cPardon?\u201d he asked. Apparently, he\u2019d been deep in thought.</p><p>He looked at her and she smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel the need to stop\u2014refuel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, food,\u201d he said. He smiled in return, and shook his head. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s true, the first forty-eight hours in any case usually points to whether or not you will solve a crime, but even then, and in the midst of some pretty bad cases in New York, I usually have a sense of self-preservation. You can\u2019t turn off the thinking about a case, but you still remember to live and breathe. With this\u2014\u201d He broke off, shaking his head. \u201cWe have dozens of capable men and women out there working around the clock in one way or another, but I still feel as if it\u2019s all on me. Food, yes. Food would be good. There\u2019s an all-night diner on Avenue A that\u2019s pretty decent. Are you good with your team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can reach me anytime they want,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd if they haven\u2019t gotten hold of me yet, they\u2019re doing fine without me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking toward the road again, and he was back in thought. But when they reached the restaurant, and they\u2019d chosen a booth and ordered food, he looked at her with a polite grin. \u201cMiss Whitney Tremont, FBI agent with a special investigative unit. Tell me more about yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh! An interrogation,\u201d she said, nodding gravely.</p><p>\u201cNo bright lights, no fists thumping on the table, no mirrored room,\u201d Jude said. \u201cJust the facts, missy, just the facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I did major in film at NYU, but I\u2019m from New Orleans, born at Tulane Medical Center.\u201d Her smile deepened. \u201cAnd my great-grandmother is one of the most respected voodoo priestesses in New Orleans\u2014she doesn\u2019t raise the dead or sell love potions or stick pins in dolls or anything like that\u2014the dolls are for tourists to buy. She is a brilliant and fascinating woman. My mother was a teacher, my father was a philosophy professor, and his background was French. I was raised attending Mass at the cathedral in Jackson Square every Sunday morning, but I also really respect my great-grandmother\u2019s beliefs. Her life is all about balance, and she has tremendous faith. She\u2019s a wonderful woman\u2014you would really like her. It\u2019s pretty obvious that I come from a complete ethnic olio, and I believe my mom\u2019s father was a Cherokee, though Dad\u2019s folks arrived off a boat from Marseilles. Voodoo has a lot in common with Catholicism, and the two worked well enough together in my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with any faith\u2014Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, you name it,\u201d Jude said. \u201cNot when it\u2019s a faith that brings people through life respecting life and his fellow humans, believe me. All New Yorkers don\u2019t think that a voodoo priestess has to be a quack.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI watch the Discovery Channel!\u201d</p><p>Whitney laughed. \u201cMaybe I do get defensive sometimes. Far too often, people do mock each other\u2019s beliefs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFace it\u2014wars are fought over minor differences in belief,\u201d he said. He drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cFilm to the FBI. And you\u2019re not in the audiovisual department. How did the career segue come about?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>She hesitated again, and then shrugged. He knew they set up cameras everywhere; he knew they looked into the past. He\u2019d surely read up on Adam Harrison, and knew that many people considered them to be quacks. He\u2019d known from the beginning about the cameras\u2014he\u2019d already asked her if she filmed ghosts.</p><p>\u201cI was working on a project for one of the educational channels, but, of course, they, like everyone\u2014so it seems these days\u2014have to bring in the advertising dollars, and so you have to have shows that lure in an audience. You may not want to believe this, but while we\u2019re often looked on as imaginative or quacks, the majority of American people do believe that the paranormal exists in one form or another, so ghost shows are immensely popular. Anyway, I filmed some truly strange phenomena, and the producers were convinced that I\u2019d rigged the film, and I hadn\u2019t done so. I refused to unrig what wasn\u2019t rigged. They\u2019d been planning on doing more of a storyboard, with ghosts appearing and disappearing, and they were dismayed that what I caught was something, but not a woman in white fluttering across the screen. I was young\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d he asked her with a teasing note in his voice.</p><p>She laughed, giving him the point. \u201cI\u2019m not just out of high school,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m short and look younger than I am. I\u2019m twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vast age,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>\u201cAge is irrelevant\u2014it depends on where you\u2019ve been and what you\u2019ve done in your time on earth, my friend,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThen I think I\u2019m feeling about a hundred and eight right now,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Whitney grinned. \u201cWell, you\u2019re well preserved.\u201d</p> <p>Their food arrived; they\u2019d both opted for omelets, which seemed a fitting meal since it had gotten so late that dinner and breakfast might be combined.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she told him, \u201cI resigned from the project. I was lucky, because I had a book on the market about the philosophy of world religions, and although it was never on any bestseller lists, it has steady sales, and those sales saved me from poverty while I mulled over my next move. I\u2019d pretty much decided to go into filming my own documentaries when I was called by Adam Harrison and asked to join the team. Jake Mallory had been an agent for almost fifteen years, but the rest of us were drawn from other walks of life. I think our first case was an experiment on Adam\u2019s part, but the six of us worked well together. They sent us through training and we all became agents officially.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI admit, I\u2019ve never worked with any other agents, and even in the bureau, we are unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost busters?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t really read the tone of his voice. \u201cWe have an amazing success rate on the cases with which we\u2019ve been involved. Ordinarily, it\u2019s not just profiling a killer or his victims, but a situation. That\u2019s often done by discovering what went on in the past.\u201d</p><p>That brought Jude back around to the case. \u201cAll right, then, let\u2019s take our situation. A tough one. You may be right, that actresses, not prostitutes, are being singled out. Which brings us back to the film. Except, of course, we could all still be wrong on this\u2014Jane Doe dry might have died because she was randomly attacked, and Sarah Larson might have met with your usual run-of-the-mill heinous killer. We had nothing to go on, nothing at all. The thing is, when we discovered Virginia Rockford\u2019s body, she was so mutilated, and she had been left so blatantly in the open, that it does seem like the killer is demanding attention\u2014Ripper- style attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRipper-style\u2014but if there is one killer and the victims were all his, he\u2019s really starting to escalate on the rate of the murders,\u201d Whitney said to him.</p><p>He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cVery scary thought. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t convinced that the women were all killed by the same man until it began to appear that there was a pattern between the victims\u2014they were all women who wanted something. They wanted the dream. They wound up doing what they needed to do, in their own minds, at least, to get by. But they wanted to be entertainers\u2014stars. Each of those women might have been easily seduced by someone who was promising them a role in a movie. What someone could do that better than the director?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe producer,\u201d Whitney told him dryly. \u201cIn this case, as in many, there are half a dozen producers, but not one of the real money people is in New York, from what I\u2019ve read about the shoot. So, yes, the director. And, as far as extras go, they\u2019re often brought in by a casting agency. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Angus Avery would certainly have the power,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cYes. But, remember, you pointed out that we don\u2019t really have to work with facts\u2014perception would work just as well. Anyone involved with the shoot could probably convince a woman who was dying to break into films that he had the power to get them a small role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jude agreed.</p><p>They\u2019d finished their omelets; the check came. Whitney reached for her wallet. \u201cHey, please, it\u2019s my pleasure to take you to dinner,\u201d he told her politely. \u201cContrary to popular belief, NYPD cops are paid enough to eat,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAgents, too. But I doubt either of us is going to get rich in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t fight for the check. She thanked him, and they walked back out to his car. The night was clear and beautiful.</p><p>And quiet.</p><p>She felt his hand at the small of her back. \u201cI should get you back to Blair House.\u201d The sound of his voice was husky. The touch of his hand seemed to send electrical currents along her spine.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>Jude walked Whitney into the house.</p><p>Will Chan was seated in front of the bank of computer screens they\u2019d set up in the broad hallway of Blair House. He rose, smiled and stretched when they came in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank God!\u201d he said. \u201cI need a breather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, I\u2019m sorry. How long have you been sitting there?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout fifteen minutes,\u201d Jenna announced, coming into the hallway from the kitchen. \u201cDon\u2019t let him give you a hard time... We\u2019ve all taken turns at the computers since we\u2019ve been back at the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Jude said, walking to the bank of screens. \u201cWhat\u2019s causing the shadows?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Whitney came to stand by him.</p><p>The feed from the two cameras set in the main sector of the foundation next door seemed to show some kind of motion. Dark shadows appeared close to the ground, almost as if a dusty fog had settled close to the floor, fog that undulated and breathed.</p><p>Jude looked at Whitney. \u201cWhat is going on over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know in a minute,\u201d Will said. He pointed at the screens. \u201cThere they are now\u2014Jackson and Jake.\u201d</p> <p>Whitney saw that her teammates had returned to the foundation; the motion-sensing cameras had turned toward them when they entered. Will spoke into the remote microphone. \u201cWell? Anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jackson and Jake were wearing clip-on receivers and transmitters. \u201cNothing,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything that would explain the darkness we notice moving around on the screens?\u201d Whitney called to them.</p><p>Jude\u2019s gaze was set on the screens. His features betrayed no emotion other than curiosity. Whitney had to wonder if he was skeptical, thinking that they were setting up some kind of a show.</p><p>\u201cNothing. We\u2019re going to walk around here for a minute, going from section to section. Let us know what you\u2019re seeing\u2014that darkness persists, right?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that area, that area right there, in the main section of the flooring.\u201d</p> <p>To Whitney\u2019s surprise, Jude walked to the screen. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, touching it. \u201cThere are the boundaries of that darkened area. Look at the floor. It\u2019s got strange discoloration,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Will said, sitting down and watching the screen. \u201cThere was a structure there that was demolished, and then another that was demolished as well. You can see the structural walls, but there might have been nonstructural walls that were broken through over time. Both buildings might have had different layouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but look,\u201d Jude said, his finger moving in a pattern over the screen. \u201cSomething was drawn on the floor with some kind of paint or dye at some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, do you think?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>Whitney narrowed her eyes, watching Jude\u2019s finger move.</p><p>\u201cA pentagram,\u201d she said. \u201cA downward-pointing pentagram.\u201d</p><p>Jude straightened. \u201cI\u2019m taking a walk over there,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>Whitney wanted to go with him, but she thought that she shouldn\u2019t. Whatever he did or didn\u2019t experience, she thought it would be best if he did so on his own, or with Jackson and Jake being the only members of their team present.</p><p>He left them; Whitney joined Will in one of the rolling chairs in front of the bank of screens. She spoke with Jackson as Jude walked from Blair House to the property next door. \u201cJackson, Jude just pointed it out. The discoloration on the floor isn\u2019t random aging. An upside-down pentagram was drawn in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not much of a shock,\u201d Jackson called back to her. \u201cNot if the so-called House of Spiritualism began as a haven for Satanists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d She hesitated, but Jude couldn\u2019t have gotten in there yet. \u201cJackson, that black miasma seems to emanate from it.\u201d</p><p>Jake was standing not far from Jackson, still, and listening. \u201cThere\u2019s someone out on the street,\u201d he told Jackson.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jude\u2014he\u2019s on his way over,\u201d Whitney informed them.</p><p>A minute later, she saw Jude coming down the steps. He had made quick time, but she had learned that his strides were long and that he walked fast.</p><p>\u201cIt is a pentagram,\u201d Jude said, looking at Jackson and Jake before beginning to follow the broken markings on the floor. \u201cIt looks like it was drawn with some kind of chalky brick substance or dye. There might have been some kind of flooring placed over it at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people here when it was called the House of Spiritualism might have kept a false floor over it, something that they could easily roll out if the police came\u2014not that having it would have been illegal. Freedom of religion applies to Satanists as well,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cBut I doubt they wanted it known that they were welcoming Satanists,\u201d Jude said. \u201cOr that, perhaps, the \u2018spiritualism\u2019 in the name was their own euphemism for Satanism. To the best of my knowledge, it can often mean many different beliefs and practices, but in Lower Manhattan at the end of the eighteen hundreds, most of the population was Christian, and worshipping Satan would have meant, to them, sinful orgies, all manner of debauchery\u2014and blood sacrifices. Many killers throughout the years, such as Gilles de Rais, as far back as the fourteen hundreds, committed hundreds of brutal murders with some excuse that a demon or the devil had demanded the blood sacrifice. And, of course, as the years pass, new groups make idols of such men as Gilles de Rais, Jack the Ripper and other killers.\u201d</p><p>Will looked at Whitney, startled by Jude\u2019s speech. Whitney shrugged. \u201cHis father has a huge crime library,\u201d she told Will.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s good to understand history, as we all know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo they had a pentagram on the floor. They seemed to worship evil. I wonder what else was down here, and if someone today knew exactly what was here, and what was going on. Do you see any signs that anyone has been...down there lately?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>All three faces stared at the camera, as if they could see her and didn\u2019t understand such an obvious question.</p><p>\u201cI mean...does it look as if someone has been down there practicing any kind of Satanic rituals? Is there any sign of blood?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot visibly or obviously,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWe can get a forensics team down here,\u201d Jude said. \u201cCheck it out.\u201d</p><p>The forensics team isn\u2019t going to tell us why it seems that there\u2019s a black fog that lies low to the ground on film, Whitney thought.</p><p>But she wondered if bad things had gone on down there\u2014recently\u2014as well as in the past, and she knew that they were all wondering if Sarah, Jane Doe wet, had been killed in the night in the darkness of the abyss before her body had wound up in the river.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re coming up,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s late. We\u2019ll look at everything with rested minds in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Jude returned with Jackson and Jake to Blair House, then bid them good-night, reminding them to lock themselves in and be wary.</p><p>Jackson didn\u2019t reply that he was an armed federal agent, to Whitney\u2019s surprise. As such, he knew that it was never amiss to remember to be careful.</p><p>Whitney wanted to walk to the door to tell him good-night; she didn\u2019t allow herself to do so. Actually, she didn\u2019t want him to leave.</p><p>Or, if he was leaving again, she wanted to go with him.</p><p>But that was ridiculous, of course. They had barely met; they were both part of a task force. They hadn\u2019t met at a social function, or a bar\u2014or even dating online.</p><p>Even so, she felt that she knew him. If she didn\u2019t know him, she knew him well enough to know that she wanted to know him better. The sexual attraction she was feeling was almost overwhelming, and since that was the case, it was a good thing that she didn\u2019t walk to the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all hope it\u2019s a quiet night,\u201d Jackson said, bidding Jude good-night. When the door was locked, Jake looked at Whitney, giving her an odd smile.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, kid, and get some rest. I\u2019ll watch the screens tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should do some of the staring at the screens,\u201d she said. \u201cFilm is my forte. I really should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some rest,\u201d Jake finished for her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on this a day longer than the rest of us, and these are long days.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him. She loved Jake\u2014he was like a brother. But she looked at Jackson, ever their quietly strong leader, who was watching her.</p><p>Jackson just nodded gravely. \u201cGet some rest. You\u2019ve been on all this too intently for way too many hours. We\u2019ve got this covered.\u201d</p><p>Jude felt odd as he left Blair House\u2014almost as if he\u2019d left something behind.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a something.</p><p>It was a someone. Whitney.</p><p>It was amazing to think how quickly things could change; he had thought of her as young, and he had thought of her as annoying at first. Not only had they saddled him with a federal team, but they\u2019d given him one comprised of inexperienced children.</p><p>Now...</p><p>Now, she had somehow become an important part of the investigation. Now, he wished that he\u2019d met her anywhere except on the job, and that he knew how to take a break and let the rest of the task force run while they went out for a drink. He wondered if he needed to stop working with her, if the light scent of her perfume hadn\u2019t somehow permeated his senses and therefore his mind, so that now he was thinking about her when he wasn\u2019t even with her, longing to stroke the exotic golden-amber color of her skin, test the softness of her lips...</p><p>Killer. Serial killer on the loose, he forced himself to remember.</p><p>And he could demand that his mind return to the case, because they were following only leads and people so far, and they had nothing tangible, nothing on which they could begin to pin a case.</p><p>The movie, it all came back to the movie. Or maybe it didn\u2019t, but it did seem a viable direction.</p><p>They could all still be way off base. Not on the fact that someone had studied the case of Jack the Ripper and took it to heart. New York was a massive city. Lots of people knew all about the filming, and some of them presumably knew about Blair House, or the House of Spiritualism. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He called his father, because he knew that Andrew wouldn\u2019t call him, assuming that he was busy, but that he\u2019d naturally want to be kept up on the case.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Whitney doing with that book?\u201d Andrew asked him. \u201cWeird, I know, but I think that the site itself may have something to do with the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe site made me do it,\u201d Jude said, his tone weary. He\u2019d heard every excuse known to man in court, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if someone opted to use the ghosts of the past as a defense.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, son, and you know it\u2014a sick mind can grasp on to a lot, and even when someone knows right from wrong, they can certainly use some kind of knowledge as a spur to commit crimes. Take the religions of the world\u2014the good ones,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can twist and turn tenets of peace into terrible mandates that somehow miss the entire message of love and goodness to one\u2019s fellow human being. So, take someone into the occult\u2014which can just be a love of the earth, the use of herbs and so on\u2014who is fascinated by death, cruelty and the dark side of human nature. They could twist their beliefs into some kind of house of worship for sure. We venerate the saints\u2014they venerate blood and brutality.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and then told his father, \u201cWe found an outline of an old pentagram in the floor\u2014forensics will go in tomorrow and take a look around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t the pentagram over a century old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me wonder what else might be there. Or, if someone is using it again. I can\u2019t help but wonder if one of the early victims might have been attacked there. I want to know if there\u2019s any blood that can be detected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what else I can find in my collection about old New York. Who knows, I may find something,\u201d his father told him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you can always head back over to the NYU library, or connect with your friends at the Pierpont,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize until that moment that he was going to question his own father.</p><p>He was relieved by the answer.</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019re right. Maybe I should. But there\u2019s still so many books that I have here...I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to find a book anywhere that says \u2018read me for the answers\u2019! It\u2019s going to be a hunt. But I\u2019m on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>When he hung up, though it was late, he called Hannah. Her workday was a typical nine-to-five, but she stayed up late at night, watching television\u2014and now, of course, flirting with the new fellow in her life.</p> <p>Hannah loved television and loved to compare her work and what she learned from the detectives with what was shown on the screen. One day, she told him, she was going to be a consultant on a crime show.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jude! How\u2019s it going\u2014the lists are endless...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going, Hannah. I\u2019m going to have a crime scene team out at the old construction site tomorrow. I was thinking you should be with them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cExcept...I am a computer tech, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, but you\u2019ve been compiling lists, checking facts...you might be helpful on site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, thanks!\u201d she said. Then she added, \u201cJude, I\u2019ve found out a lot of stuff about Harrison\u2019s team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t called me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did tell you what I knew when they were first called in\u2014it\u2019s all just speculative media reporting really. But Adam Harrison got into finding people to help with special investigations years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Whitney had told him that Adam Harrison had approached her after she had left her job. She\u2019d been going to do her own documentaries. She hadn\u2019t lied to him about anything.</p><p>But it seemed the whole world saw the group as ghost busters.</p><p>\u201cHis son was supposed to have been some kind of psychic, and he became fascinated with the occult. You know, kind of like the magician Harry Houdini. When his mother died, he was determined to speak to her through the \u2018veil,\u2019 or whatever. Well, here\u2019s the thing\u2014in all the instances his teams worked on, the case was solved and the stranger occurrences proven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ghosts did it?\u201d Jude demanded skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...but to have been asked onto that team, well, each member had to have some kind of psychic ability, and it looks like it\u2019s real. I mean, neither any of the people he worked with previously or the members of this team have gone on record that there are ghosts involved\u2014in fact, the leader, Jackson Crow, has always been one of those people out to find the real cause, but...\u201d</p><p>Great. He really was working with ghost busters.</p><p>That should help him keep his distance.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t. He felt something like a body burn when Whitney was near. Natural, he tried to tell himself. She was young, she was beautiful, she was as sensual as...spun gold. He was human.</p><p>\u201cGuess what they\u2019re called\u2014off the books?\u201d Hannah asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKrewe of Hunters. K-R-E-W-E,\u201d Hannah spelled out. \u201cTheir first case together was in the French Quarter, in New Orleans, and I guess that\u2019s what they wound up calling themselves.\u201d</p><p>Krewe of Hunters, of course, mysterious old New Orleans. Filled with ghosts of the past, aboveground cemeteries...cities of the dead. Where else would ghost busters want to get started? he asked himself, his mental tone a mocking one.</p><p>\u201cJude, you there?\u201d Hannah asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, Hannah. Sorry. Meeting at 8:00 a.m., remember, every day until we catch the bastard or the task force is disbanded. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d He hesitated, trying to remember that they all had lives, too. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with your fellow, Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not exactly my fellow, Jude. But, it\u2019s nice. He calls every once in a while, and sometimes I find him waiting for me at the coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a budding relationship to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But work comes first.\u201d</p><p>At his apartment, he threw off his jacket and sat in front of his own computer.</p><p>There was a tap at the connecting door.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Dad,\u201d he said.</p><p>Andrew entered, bearing a glass. \u201cThought you could use this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBourbon and soda,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>Jude laughed. \u201cBring it on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound worn out. You okay?\u201d Andrew asked him sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019ll catch him,\u201d Jude said grimly. They had to catch him.</p><p>\u201cThey never caught the real Ripper\u2014and they never caught the fellow who really murdered Carrie Brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the investigation capabilities we have now,\u201d Jude said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t have ghost busters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>Jude stared at his dad, smiled slowly and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019ve known all along that everyone on the special team must have psychic ability.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shrugged. \u201cWell? Surely you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that they investigated using local stories and history. I knew that they looked into people who thought that ghosts existed, or that ghosts told them to murder people or... I didn\u2019t really accept the fact they all believed completely in spirits themselves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, you need to get off your high horse,\u201d Andrew told him. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to the world we don\u2019t know, and a lot we\u2019ll never know. So, you think you\u2019re all procedure and facts, just the facts and nothing more. But I\u2019ve heard you say a dozen times that you have a gut feeling about something. It\u2019s all the same. Don\u2019t throw away all the good you may get because you\u2019re so convinced you\u2019re right that there\u2019s nothing in the world that isn\u2019t totally solid.\u201d</p><p>He was startled; his father seemed almost angry.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014they\u2019re ghost busters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for them. And if ghosts can solve this horrible case, let them!\u201d</p><p>Jude stared at him silently.</p><p>Andrew went on. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading up today. Stuff I guess you know, but still good to think about. Most serial killers today come from working-class backgrounds and kill because it gives them a sense of power. But, historically, many people who had power and wealth killed because they considered themselves above mortal men. They killed because in their minds they had a right to kill. I guess that\u2019s part of the psychopathic personality, and still, obviously sick, these people can be organized and good-looking and brilliant\u2014as in the case of Ted Bundy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re the one with the degree in criminology,\u201d his father said with a smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go back over to my side.\u201d</p><p>Jude lifted his glass. \u201cThanks for the drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Good night.\u201d</p><p>His father went through the door and closed it. His cat leaped up onto his lap and purred. For the moment, he wished he was the damn cat.</p><p>That night, they studied the video that had been taken at the site next door.</p><p>There were definitely shadows to be seen; strange shadows, the kinds without the light sources to have been created on a natural level.</p><p>Whitney touched the screen. When she did so, she felt a strange surge of electricity sweep through her.</p><p>She had seen the dog there.</p><p>She was certain that the dog had protected the woman. She kept staring at the screen, and she saw something behind the dog.</p><p>\u201cCould this be the shape of a woman?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course it could be,\u201d Angela told her.</p><p>Will pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something. And none of us was there to cast that shadow...we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d</p><p>They could see the shadows, but they really had no answers at the moment. They all needed sleep.</p><p>Whitney was wound tightly when she first tried to lie down and sleep. But as she lay staring at the ceiling, she heard a tap at the door. Angela walked in, bearing a teacup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHerbal tea? Or a bit of caffeine so I can better lie awake?\u201d Whitney asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cDecaf with a shot of whiskey,\u201d Angela told her, handing her the mug and curling up at the foot of the bed. \u201cI thought I\u2019d help you get to a REM sleep where maybe your subconscious will let you sort out some of the things running around in your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr open it up to voices from the past?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p> <p>Angela nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re our great communicator,\u201d Whitney told her. \u201cAnd, of course, Jenna is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I think that you\u2019re the one these ghosts may talk to,\u201d Angela told her. \u201cI ran through the footage from the site next door. There was a shadow when you bent down. You saw the dog again, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Whitney nodded.</p><p>\u201cDogs are our greatest companions, you know. Take Greyfriars Bobby, the little terrier who sat on his master\u2019s grave daily until he himself died. Anyway, I\u2019m going to bed, too, so scream like a banshee if you need any of us or even if you\u2019re frightened...it\u2019s just us, and not one of us will think a thing of it if you see a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Angela stood and left her and Whitney started to sip the tea.</p> <p>She picked up the book that Andrew Crosby had loaned her, the Honeywell book about the House of Spiritualism. She found herself looking in the index for the word dog, but didn\u2019t find it. But she found several pages listed under the name Annie Doherty. Curious, she began flipping through the pages. Annie Doherty had come from a stable home in Westchester, New York; her father had been a preacher. But Annie had fallen in love with a seafarer. She had run away from her father\u2019s strict dominance to follow her lover, a man named Leland Robinson, and come to the tip of Manhattan, where he had promised her he would be staying, near the docks. By the time she reached Manhattan, Leland Robinson had left on a ship. With the few funds she had, Annie found lodging at Blair House. While most of the theaters had moved north up Broadway, a small playhouse, the Travertine, had still been open just north of Wall Street, and Annie had tried to make a living selling oranges in front of the building. She had longed to become an actress and would sing in the streets as well for whatever pennies those coming and going from the theater would throw. She lived there almost a month before she disappeared, leaving behind her large shepherd-mix dog. The then owner had been furious since he\u2019d been left a sizable bill, and he\u2019d reported her for skipping out. But Annie hadn\u2019t gone home, and she hadn\u2019t taken her meager belongings. Nor had she taken her dog, a pet she had seemed to love deeply. The police assumed she fell into mishap, but nothing was ever discovered on the whereabouts of the young woman.</p><p>Whitney set the book down. She knew that many murder victims, caught up in the overcrowded tenements, had disappeared or died\u2014their decomposed bodies eventually found\u2014with little or nothing done for them. Police reports had sometimes been written up, but more often their sad lives had simply been forgotten. In the cases where the bodies had been discovered, they had usually wound up in paupers\u2019 graves.</p><p>Whitney marveled that so little had been done to find the mysteriously vanished young woman. Honeywell, the cop, seemed disgusted by the situation as well. But he did excuse the department at the time, writing, \u201cImmigration was massive; half the immigrants were in the country illegally. Handling one of the about-to-be-demolished tenements was like going to war each day.\u201d</p><p>But Annie Doherty hadn\u2019t disappeared from a tenement; she had been living at Blair House. She\u2019d left her clothing and her beloved pet behind.</p><p>She set the book down. \u201cAnnie?\u201d she said softly. The owners of Blair House had supposedly been decent people, running a very decent boardinghouse. Could Annie have died here?</p><p>The dog she was seeing had to be Annie\u2019s, which would mean that the woman who appeared with the dog had to be Annie.</p> <p>She picked the book back up and rifled through the pages again.</p><p>Annie Doherty had disappeared in April 1891, the same month in which Carrie Brown had been murdered.</p><p>She took a long swallow of her tea, the questions in her mind driving her crazy. Why would these alleged Jack the Ripper victims simply disappear, or be discovered as refuse, decomposed corpses, which the police would not recognize as victims, when he left his London victims so blatantly exposed? Had there been a copycat killer, not getting it quite right, at the House of Spiritualism at the time, and had that person been Jonathan Black?</p><p>Could such a man possibly have been organized and intelligent enough to switch his modus operandi, and dabble in Satanism, or pretend, at least, to be a great leader in the psychic realm to gain power at the House of Spiritualism?</p><p>And, if so, she asked herself wearily, did the past actually have anything to do with the current killer\u2019s blood spree?</p><p>Yes, quite possibly. If it had been some kind of sacred venue for Satanists, with symbols...maybe more, icons there that had been worshipped. Yes, someone knowing all that history could well warp it into a new murder spree.</p><p>At last, despite the frenzy in her mind, the tea and simple exhaustion began to weigh on her and she began to doze.</p><p>That\u2019s when she felt the wet nose on her fingers and heard the dog\u2019s soft whine.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said quietly, and sat up. His head rested easily on the bed. He looked at her with huge, mournful brown eyes.</p><p>She stroked his head, and his fur felt soft and real. \u201cWhat is it, boy? What are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>She looked beyond the dog. Her bedside light was still on, but the corners of the room were in shadow. She searched to see if the woman\u2014Annie Doherty?\u2014had appeared with the dog. But she didn\u2019t see anyone, and she forced herself not to be afraid of the fact that a real dog seemed to be imploring her for help.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Help me\u2014I want to help you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He ran toward the door, barked softly and wagged his tail.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you want to go out?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>The dog ran back to her, and then back to the door again.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She got out of bed, grabbed her terry housecoat and slid her feet into her slippers, and walked to the door. The dog pawed it, continuing to wag his tail.</p><p>Whitney opened the door, and the dog ran out into the hallway, and then down the stairs.</p><p>Jake was seated in front of the computer screens; he started when she ran down the stairs. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded, blinking, jumping up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dog,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Where\u2019s the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the door. The dog had now raced to the front door, where he looked back at Whitney and wagged his tail. Then he pawed the door.</p><p>She saw Jake\u2019s frown. He might not see the animal, but he\u2019d heard the sound of the door moving slightly in its frame.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to go out. Jake, he\u2019s leading me somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Whitney started to rush for the door. Jake grabbed her arm. \u201cWait!\u201d he told her.</p><p>He had his cell out and he dialed a number. She could hear Jackson\u2019s sleepy voice come through the phone. \u201cWhitney wants to follow a ghost dog.\u201d</p><p>Jake listened and snapped the phone closed. \u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Jackson, with Angela behind him, came hurrying down the stairs. Jackson had thrown on jeans and a shirt, and he wore his agency-issued Glock in a shoulder holster. He carried a wide-beam flashlight. Angela had merely thrown on her robe.</p><p>Jackson told them curtly, \u201cAngela will lock behind us. Jake, you and I will go with Whitney. And the\u2014dog,\u201d he said, pausing to frown. Jackson clearly didn\u2019t see the dog. \u201cAngela, keep watch on the screens and warn us if anything shows up.\u201d</p><p>Angela stared at Whitney, nodding.</p><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d Whitney asked her.</p><p>\u201cI see...something,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there. I swear it!\u201d Whitney told them.</p><p>\u201cGo, go on!\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Whitney was glad that Jake had stopped her; she wasn\u2019t going to take the time to dress or arm herself, but she\u2019d be safe with Jackson and Jake.</p><p>She unlocked the bolts on the front door. The dog raced out. Whitney followed him; the others followed her.</p><p>The dog took them where she knew it would\u2014the construction site.</p><p>The ghostly animal that had felt so real slipped through chain-link fence as if he were mist.</p><p>Jackson opened the padlock and they went in.</p><p>The dog raced to the old foundations, and disappeared down the stairs.</p><p>Whitney ran after him, mindful of the rubble-strewn ground, and came to the great gaping chasm and the stairs that led down to it.</p><p>Jackson arrived with his wide-beam flashlight, and Whitney started down the steps. She came to the central room, where, despite her training, she felt chills snake along her spine and a sense of fear tremble in her limbs.</p><p>Instinct! she thought.</p><p>The dog stood in the middle of the pentagram, looking at her expectantly. He turned and raced around the supporting wall, and disappeared into the dark.</p><p>Whitney ran after him, and, with each step, she felt a greater sense of choking fear. She knew. She knew that beneath the ground and remnants of flooring, they would find the body of Annie Doherty.</p><p>10</p><p>Jude woke as suddenly as if had he been slapped in the face.</p><p>He reached for the Smith &amp; Wesson that he kept on his bedside table at night and jerked to a sitting position, trying to ascertain what had awoken him. There was nothing in his room; there was nothing at all that hinted of an intruder or any kind of danger. He silently walked through his apartment, barefoot and in boxers, but there was nothing amiss.</p><p>He returned to his room and quickly stumbled into his jeans and a pair of loafers, shirt, holster and jacket. Still, there was nothing, no unusual sounds in his apartment, or coming from the streets. It was a quiet time in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, but New York never really slept.</p><p>Dressed, his gun in hand, he walked through the living room, looked in his computer room and carefully and silently opened the door to his dad\u2019s apartment. Andrew was in his room, snoring softly. Nothing seemed to be amiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Jude was so disturbed that he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to sleep, and despite himself, one word, a name, kept ripping through his mind.</p><p>Whitney.</p><p>Not even sure what he was doing, he headed for the street. A cab had just stopped at the avenue; it would take time to get his car out, so he started to run to the intersection, whistling loudly and waving his hand. The cab waited.</p> <p>When he was seated in it, he wondered if he wasn\u2019t a fool, or if the workload was really playing with his mind. He was heading to Blair House and the construction site in the wee hours of the morning because something in his sleeping mind had made him think that Whitney might be in danger. What the hell. He\u2019d heard of stranger things. He could have called one of the team; should have called one of the team.</p><p>But he was already in the cab. He\u2019d just head down and see what he could see. And if there was nothing\u2014which was likely\u2014he could still talk to Jackson. If they were ghost busters, as the rumor mill seemed inclined to call them, they wouldn\u2019t think that he was that crazy. Or maybe they would. What the hell, he was started on the way now, might as well see it through.</p><p>He realized that the feeling she was in trouble, in danger, was persisting in his mind. Despite getting in a cab in the middle of the night, he was still afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be there in time. He had the cab stop in front of Blair House; the hall lights were on.</p><p>They were always on; someone was always watching the screens.</p><p>As he leaned forward to pay the driver and ask him to hold on, he noted that there seemed to be a spot of brightness that rose above the meager illumination of the streetlights in the area. \u201cMove down the block, please,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>There was someone in the foundations of the House of Spiritualism.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2014let me off here.\u201d</p><p>The padlock wasn\u2019t unlocked, which should have been reassuring. If Whitney had come here in the middle of the night, as insane as that might be, she would have been with someone else; they had a right to be there, and they would have unlocked the padlock.</p><p>They were trained, he reminded himself.</p><p>Of course the padlock was locked. They wouldn\u2019t have left an easy entry for an intruder.</p> <p>If it was indeed the Krewe of Hunters who had come here.</p><p>Jude crawled over the fence, cursing as he did so. The chain link was poor, and the tips were bare. He tried his best to protect his body parts, hoping his insanity wasn\u2019t going to lead to partial dismemberment. He leaped to the ground and hurried across the stretch of rubble to the stairs.</p><p>The light was emanating from below. Drawing his gun, he started quietly down the stairs.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and gave himself a mental shake.</p><p>He was afraid for Whitney.</p><p>There was something wrong with this place; he wasn\u2019t prone to unease, nor was he superstitious, or afraid of the dark.</p><p>But there was something like a miasma here, something that felt heavy in the air, something that seemed to hint of death and decay and even...</p><p>Evil?</p> <p>The dog walked to the rear of the room. He sat\u2014almost leaned\u2014against the far wall and began to whine.</p><p>\u201cI hear it,\u201d Jake said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there,\u201d Whitney said, pointing toward the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s something there he wants us to see, or find. Jake, I was reading Andrew Crosby\u2019s book. A young woman named Annie lived in Blair House at the time of the Carrie Brown murder. I don\u2019t know why, exactly, but I think the dog has something to do with her...and he wants us to find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, you want to dig up the ground,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014yeah, I\u2019m sorry, I do. Can we?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>Jackson frowned, drawing a finger to his lips. He and Jake drew their weapons and eased against the wall.</p><p>They heard Will\u2019s voice come to them softly over through their radio setup. \u201cYou\u2019ve got company\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then they heard, \u201cIt\u2019s the police!\u201d The deep, rich voice boomed then echoed in the cavernous space of the foundations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jude,\u201d Whitney said, though she was sure that Jackson and Jake realized who had come upon them as well.</p><p>\u201cFBI!\u201d Jackson called back. \u201cJude, it\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>As Jude came around the structural wall, everyone sheathed their guns.</p><p>He appeared in the glow of Jackson\u2019s light, hair tousled, looking tired and confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing down here?\u201d he asked them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we do\u2014investigate,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night? In a dark hole in the ground?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have cameras going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Whitney said, looking at him with her huge golden eyes luminous. \u201cWhat are you doing here, though? Is there something new, a lead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jude replied with the single word. Something passed through his eyes, but so quickly she might have imagined it. And yet, for that moment, she almost felt as if he had reached out and touched her, and the hot arrows that flew through her bloodstream were shocking, alarming\u2014and seductive. But he had already turned to Jackson. \u201cA hunch. Or less. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I just decided to slip down to the area myself, and when I saw an extra glow of light from this place...I came on down. But what did bring you here?\u201d</p><p>Jackson said, \u201cA hunch.\u201d</p><p>Jake stepped in to clarify. \u201cWhitney has been reading that book your dad loaned her. She found a reference to Blair House, and a young woman named Annie who disappeared at the same time as the Carrie Brown murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe author believed that she disappeared here because, of course, he hated everything going on at the House of Spiritualism,\u201d Whitney said, staring straight at Jude.</p><p>He nodded, frowning. \u201cI have a forensics team coming out in the morning\u2014a crime scene unit.\u201d</p><p>Jackson cleared his throat. \u201cNo new victims tonight, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jude said. He wasn\u2019t distracted. He kept staring at Whitney.</p><p>\u201cJust what do you want to dig and what do you plan to dig with?\u201d he asked her. He groaned softly before she could answer. \u201cConstruction site, and though the work is on hold, I figure under the tarp in that back section we\u2019ll find some pickaxes and shovels.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJust this area, right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hunch?\u201d Jude asked her.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>She thought that he groaned softly again, but she couldn\u2019t be sure. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see what\u2019s here, shall we? I can call in backup, you know. Even at this hour. For once, I can have what I want without question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s work this alone, and see what we get,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBecause, if it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Whitney added, \u201cthen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just do it,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>He headed farther back into the foundations, where plywood made something of a roof over the gaping pit, and waterproof canvas tarps had been molded over equipment. Jackson arrived with his wide-beam powerful flashlight, and they ripped away one of the tarps. They\u2019d found of cache of tools, including spades, picks, shovels and saws that had all been stowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised the construction workers left these,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThey usually value their personal tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCity of New York,\u201d Jude told him. \u201cLook at the handles\u2014these are city property. That means be careful. They\u2019re probably old and overused.\u201d</p><p>Whitney watched as the three men chose picks; they found a small spade for her. \u201cBe careful of our little site as well,\u201d she said.</p><p>She caught Jude\u2019s hand as Jackson and Jake headed toward the section of floor where the dog had led her. \u201cI know why you didn\u2019t call for backup or help just now,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, you don\u2019t want to appear to have been part of a ghost-hunting expedition,\u201d she said, wishing an edge of bitterness hadn\u2019t risen in her throat.</p><p>He looked at her for what seemed like an eternity. Then he offered her a wry smile. \u201cWell, there is that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe some things should just be kept tight. I know about your team, and I myself have nothing but suspicion and theory.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and nodded gravely. \u201cJude, we have more than that. There was and is a Jonathan Black. I don\u2019t know if the historical one was the real Ripper or not, but he was a murderer who used the House of Spiritualism for his own ends. He might have killed women\u2014Annie Doherty at least\u2014with the excuse of it being a Satanic sacrifice. I think he killed them in the area of the pentagram, and buried them in the floor in the next room. I don\u2019t know where that will lead, or if it can really help us, but finding the truth can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She was surprised and he offered her a small, grim smile and lifted a hand to move a strand of stray hair from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dig, shall we?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The dog had disappeared; maybe Jude\u2019s arrival had been just too much for him.</p><p>For a few moments, the only sounds down in the foundations were grunts and the sound of the pick hitting hard earth.</p><p>Then, Whitney cried, \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>They all stopped and stared at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear it\u2014there was something different, something hollow sounding\u2014right where Jude is!\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. He tentatively struck the earth. The sound was different.</p><p>Whitney rushed forward with her spade and began digging more gently at the earth. In a moment, she had her hands in the dirt, dusting away. In areas, brick remained. In other areas, there was just dirt and earth.</p><p>She revealed brick; a pasty-colored, poorly laid area of brick. Jackson grabbed the flashlight from where he had set it on the floor. \u201cDifferent flooring,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jude fell to his knees and carefully began to lightly chisel with the tip of his pick at the mortar between the homemade bricks. One began to loosen, and Whitney fell to her knees across from him, gingerly prying it away as Jude released it at last. He was able to grab a second brick before it fell, and she reached past him for another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLord!\u201d Jude stared at Whitney across the hole they had created.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you find Annie\u2019s bones?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked over at Jackson. \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be at least a dozen skeletons in this hole!\u201d</p><p>Despite the very early hour at which they had found the skeletons, the sun was up by the time the right people had arrived to start working the site. Because the poor souls in the hole had long been buried, they were down to skeletal remains and bits of clothing. Forensic anthropologists and archaeologists joined the crime scene unit arriving on the scene.</p><p>Jude worked with the techs in the area of the pentagram, where, he believed, if a modern-day Jack the Ripper had twisted history, he might have brought his earlier victims as he felt his way into the murders.</p><p>Sean Meyer, head of the unit, tried to ascertain just what Jude was trying to find; Jude pointed out what he assumed were the lines of the pentagram in the ground, and explained that he believed, due to the killer\u2019s determination to emulate Jack the Ripper, that he had certainly looked into the history of the House of Spiritualism, and though police had never proven foul play had taken place at the time, the killer believed that it had. He might have practiced the art of murder at the site.</p> <p>Meyer\u2019s people went over the floor for trace evidence, which might mean nothing; construction crews had been at the site, movie people had been at the site, members of the New York Film Commission had been at the site and safety officers had been there as well, since a movie crew was setting up at a dangerous location. Those working on set construction had been given strict boundaries, but the city was in the midst of budget cuts, which meant that protecting the integrity of the rules might have been nearly impossible. Not to mention that the one guard might not have seen teenagers who scaled the poor chain-link fencing\u2014which did have signs in many areas warning of injury and death, to keep the curious out\u2014or idiots who thought of themselves as a cult and also read the history regarding the place.</p><p>\u201cMeyer, I understand all that,\u201d Jude told him quietly. \u201cWhat I want to find out is if we have any evidence of recent violence having taken place here\u2014murder. If it happened, I believe it happened on the pentagram.\u201d</p><p>Meyer nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll let my people work on trace first, and then we\u2019ll bring in the Luminol and the cameras. You know, I\u2019m sure, that Luminol can destroy other evidence, so we\u2019ll go there last. And you know, too, that it will also pick up feces, animal blood...and if someone has bleached out the place, that will give us problems as well. What we pick up is the iron in blood, so there aren\u2019t any real guarantees, and, as I was saying, we may pick up other sources of iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Meyer agreed.</p><p>Police photographers now waited for the go-ahead with their long-exposure camera equipment to capture the blue chemiluminescent appearance of any blood spray near the pentragram.</p> <p>Hannah arrived at the scene, assuring him that Deputy Chief Green had seen to it that the time for their task force meeting had been changed, and the time was now TBA. She bore the gift of a cardboard tray with cups of coffee. Jude accepted his gratefully, and walked around the supporting wall to observe the forensic anthropologists at work. He mused wryly that where they had taken pickaxes to the ground with a vengeance, the work was now being done with tiny picks and very small, soft-haired brooms. Angela had joined her team; he assumed Will and Jenna were watching the proceedings on the screens back at Blair House, since he had asked that their cameras and recorders not be disturbed.</p><p>Hannah hovered near him, but, eventually, she struck up a quiet conversation with Jake, growing more animated as she talked to him. Eventually, she walked over to Jude and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to go over with Jake to Blair House and see his trail of investigation.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cSure. Two heads are better than one, so they say.\u201d He glanced at Jake with a shrug. \u201cEspecially two brilliant heads.\u201d</p><p>As they left, Jude heard Hannah say to Jake with awe, \u201cYour fianc\u00e9e owns a plantation? A real plantation?\u201d</p><p>They left; the digging went on.</p><p>He noted that Angela and Whitney hovered together, speaking softly now and then. Jackson, arms folded over his chest, watched the proceedings.</p><p>Eventually, the crime scene unit finished all the initial photography and trace, and sheeting was rigged over the pentagram to create darkness.</p><p>Jude walked over to the section, taking a position where Meyer said he could observe and be out of the way. The photographers were ready; the Luminol had been prepared. Jude knew it was important that it be sprayed expertly and evenly.</p> <p>And it was. And in the thirty seconds that followed, he saw the floor light up.</p><p>The cameras caught the glow and the patterns.</p><p>The room lit up like blue lightning.</p><p>The rigging was moved.</p><p>Meyer looked at him grimly.</p><p>\u201cYou were right. There was a bloodbath down here.\u201d</p><p>There were three members in the team who had come to remove the bones, one with the New York Police Department, and two from the museum. A no-nonsense woman named Dr. Mary Drew was calling the shots; Whitney quickly learned that she was one of the most admired experts in her field. She supervised the removal of the bones. Years had gone by in which they\u2019d lain undisturbed, but the conditions had been right for some preservation, she informed them. Simple biology, soft tissue decayed, and the decay created the browning they saw on the remnants of fabric that really didn\u2019t seem to go to any of the skeletons. It had also seeped into the earth, so they\u2019d be taking dirt samples along with the bricks that had housed the skeletons in the hole within the hole.</p><p>While Dr. Drew was talking to them, Dr. Wally Fullbright arrived at the scene. He quickly assured them that they would have all the facilities they needed at the morgue to work with the bones. Mary Drew frowned, certain that her facilities at the museum were better when they were working with remains that were certainly well over a hundred years old. They bickered politely, but Fullbright held the trump card; the deputy chief of police wanted the remains studied at the New York City Morgue because they might be part of a current investigation.</p><p>Fullbright didn\u2019t interrupt the proceedings; he didn\u2019t even put on gloves, but he hunkered down by the bones that had already been painstakingly removed and looked at Dr. Drew. \u201cThey were beheaded?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHard to say until we\u2019ve had a chance to study them,\u201d she said. \u201cBy now, the disarticulation is almost complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll women?\u201d Fullbright asked.</p><p>\u201cSo it appears, so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered thirteen skulls, so I\u2019m going to assume that thirteen were buried here,\u201d Dr. Drew told him.</p><p>\u201cFullbright, did you read anything that would indicate what happened here?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fullbright asked, frowning.</p><p>Jude smiled. \u201cYou spend a lot of time studying old documents at the Pierpont Library. Did you glean anything that might help here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou checked up on me?\u201d Fullbright asked him, clearly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYour name was on a list,\u201d Jude explained.</p><p>Fullbright chuckled. \u201cYou know that I\u2019m fascinated by all this. No, actually, I didn\u2019t find anything more than we already know. Most of the references are vague\u2014the outside world speculated, but they didn\u2019t really know what was going on here. All I can say is that someone was heavily into the concept that human sacrifice was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so I\u2019d say,\u201d Jude agreed.</p><p>He walked over to Whitney, and nodded. He was excited to think that she knew about the history of the Ripper in America, and he seemed thrilled to find that the House of Spiritualism had hosted incredible horrors.</p><p>\u201cBut there was nothing that ever suggested Jack the Ripper was a Satanist,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, he was just a butcher, and the police were so inept back then. In London, the Metropolitan police were pitted against the City of London police, and the investigation was hampered entirely by politics\u2014I mean, who erases evidence because it might cause someone to be offended?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Juwes are not the men to be blamed for nothing,\u2019\u201d Whitney quoted. In London, they had discovered the words written over a doorway after the night of the \u201cdouble event\u201d when two victims had been killed.</p><p>The words may or may not have been written; they were never even photographed. They had been ordered removed; the words, it was feared, would cause racial rioting among those of different beliefs crowded into the East End at the time.</p><p>\u201cPersonally,\u201d Jude said, joining them, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that our killer will reenact the double event\u2014the Mary Kelly killing and then the Carrie Brown murder. They happened the same night those words were written. And no matter how ridiculous the theories out there may be, he\u2019ll kill as many people as armchair detectives and historians have credited to the original man.\u201d</p><p>By late afternoon, both teams were wrapping up. Jude realized that his back hurt, his muscles hurt, and that he was exhausted.</p><p>Ellis Sayer and a number of his team arrived. Ellis eyed him for a few minutes and then said, \u201cYou look like hell, Jude. You\u2019ve got to have some faith in me and the others\u2014get some rest. We\u2019re a task force, remember? I\u2019ll alert you to anything I learn.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cThankfully, so far, we don\u2019t have another victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Ellis said. He still had a dejected-basset-hound look to him. He reached into his jacket pocket and produced a notepad. \u201cWe\u2019ve interviewed everyone on the set by now, and we\u2019ve made it through the security company and the limo drivers as well. I have the names of the six limousine drivers who were assigned to the director and the stars. They\u2019ve all been interviewed and, according to the drivers, they picked up and dropped off the major film entities just as we were told. But you may find something I haven\u2019t. One drove Sherry Blanco, one drove Bobby Walden, one was assigned to Angus Avery and three were on call to drive anyone back and forth as requested.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jude told him. Whitney was walking over to him. She greeted Ellis courteously, looking at him as if waiting for something new. Ellis recognized the look and quickly informed her, \u201cNo, sorry. I haven\u2019t anything else. Well, other than the fact that they should make a giant hotel out of this place\u2014people seem to love ghoulish crap. They\u2019ll pay the big bucks for such a haunted property. I imagine the movie will really make a fortune\u2014the publicity it\u2019s getting is going to make it spiral right off the charts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Whitney agreed. She looked at Jude. \u201cWe have food next door.\u201d</p><p>Ellis sniffed. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t noticed that he hasn\u2019t eaten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come over, thanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>He started to walk with Whitney, leaving Ellis in charge, but then he hesitated. \u201cEllis, can you get a rush put on the forensics on the limos that carried people from that set? We had them taken in, but I haven\u2019t heard anything back from the team that was inspecting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been on the crime scene evidence. I\u2019ll push it on the limos,\u201d Ellis told him wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s damn hard when everything is a rush. They\u2019re calling out the troops, and bitching about overtime all the same.\u201d He shook his head and walked away, ever the good cop.</p><p>\u201cSimple, quick\u2014and we can feed tons of people, if need be,\u201d Jenna Duffy said, tucking a stray strand of light auburn hair behind her ears. She flashed Jude a smile. \u201cShepherd\u2019s pie, a rather good early dinner, if I do say so myself. Will is our expert sushi chef, but it\u2019s hard to feed the masses that way. Help yourself, please. Beer and soda are over there...\u201d</p><p>Whitney slid up behind Jude, taking a paper plate from the pile on the kitchen counter and handing him one. She was surprised that she\u2019d gotten him to leave the site and come over; she felt that there was nothing more either of them could do there at the moment. \u201cHey, eat up. You have a large machine there to keep going,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cLarge machine, eh?\u201d he replied. \u201cAre you suggesting I need to diet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, you seem to be doing well with the machine. I\u2019m suggesting you dig in, and make way for those behind you!\u201d</p><p>He grinned, offering her his place. The others, except for Jenna, had already filled their plates. Walking into the hallway, he saw that Angela and Jackson had their plates at the bank of screens, and were watching the continuing action at the site next door. Hannah was with Jake in the den, enjoying his computer and programs, and Will Chan was waiting politely with Jenna so that she would prepare a plate of food for herself. Jude tried to wait politely as well, but Jenna and Will shooed him and Whitney out of the kitchen. \u201cTV is on in the front parlor, you might want to take a look at the news programs,\u201d Will told them.</p><p>\u201cWe hooked up the cable while you were at the site today,\u201d Jenna explained. \u201cYou can get over eight hundred channels from I don\u2019t know how many companies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful\u2014I guess,\u201d Whitney said. She dared to catch Jude\u2019s arm and steer him in the right direction.</p><p>The front parlor was filled with period furniture\u2014except for the television and new cable system. They settled on the sofa in time to catch the weather, but then local news came back on. A pretty anchorwoman announced, \u201cMore shocking news today from downtown. Experts are now excavating the construction site off Broadway in the lower East End because skeletal remains have been found on the site. The Darby Building was slated for demolition last month and imploded, but the foundations had been deemed sound. However, before the Darby Building, a reputed destination for the city\u2019s Satanists known as the House of Spiritualism occupied the land before the turn of the twentieth century. Speculation is running high. Murder victim Virginia Rockford, working on a movie at the site, was found killed Ripper style just days ago. A little over a mile away in the Bowery, the body of Melody Tatum was also discovered. Police spokespersons have little to offer the public at the moment. We\u2019ll bring you Deputy Chief Green, taped this afternoon, right after our commercial break\u2014and an exclusive interview with the beautiful actress Sherry Blanco regarding the upcoming epic O\u2019Leary\u2019s, with a clip from the movie.\u201d</p> <p>Jude let out a groan and winced.</p><p>\u201cThe movie just became an epic,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cAnd who would cash in on that?\u201d Jude asked rhetorically. \u201cAngus Avery, Bobby Walden and the ever-caring Ms. Sherry Blanco. Women are dead, bones have been dug up\u2014and the public is still going to want to see Sherry Blanco,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Whitney nudged his arm. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I lose my appetite,\u201d Jude agreed.</p><p>His gaze didn\u2019t leave the television screen, but, mechanically, he took a bite of the shepherd\u2019s pie. It was good\u2014Whitney already knew, having had Jenna\u2019s shepherd\u2019s pie before. The aroma had been enough to make her realize she was starving.</p><p>Jude\u2019s second bite was far more energetic, and while they went through commercials that sold floor cleaners, cars and a product to extend a man\u2019s penis, he wolfed down the food on the plate.</p><p>The anchorwoman came back on; Deputy Chief Green announced that every policeman in the five boroughs was on high alert, that a task force was working all hours and that the FBI had a special unit on the case as well. The chief ended the interview by accepting a question about the House of Spiritualism, and saying that the police were exploring all possible angles. He tried to leave the podium, but one reporter demanded to know if the deputy chief believed that Carrie Brown had been a victim of the Ripper, and he paused, obviously irritated. \u201cI have no personal beliefs on the matter. I\u2019m concerned with what\u2019s happening on our streets right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he targeting prostitutes?\u201d another reporter called out.</p><p>\u201cAll women should take great care with any new acquaintance. It\u2019s a time for extreme vigilance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d cried the same reporter, \u201cit does seem true, doesn\u2019t it? This killer isn\u2019t after affluent women or mothers of kindergarten children!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still can\u2019t say who the killer will target. Excuse me, that is all I have right now!\u201d</p><p>Deputy Chief Green managed to escape. The anchorwoman came back with a perfectly coiffed Sherry Blanco at her side. Sherry was visibly distressed. \u201cPoor Ginger!\u201d she said, and tears formed in her eyes; one slid down her cheek and she dabbed at it with a tissue. \u201cWe were all so heartbroken!\u201d She shivered. \u201cAnd it could have been any of us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the movie come out as scheduled?\u201d the anchorwoman asked.</p><p>\u201cWe filmed today in Brooklyn, so, despite what we all have to bear, we\u2019re working hard to see that the fans and our producers are happy,\u201d Sherry assured her.</p><p>Jude made a sound.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Whitney protested softly. She took his forgotten dinner plate from his hands and set it on the table. \u201cDon\u2019t blame an entire industry. I know a lot of actresses who are really nice, and would be making real announcements, begging people to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily, it seems that everyone really kept mum at the site today,\u201d Jude said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that all the details don\u2019t get out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since it\u2019s in off the street and teeming with cops, the reporters couldn\u2019t get close,\u201d Whitney reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d Jude said dolefully.</p><p>The anchorwoman directed her audience to watch the clip; it wasn\u2019t one in which Virginia Rockford was featured. Sherry Blanco, in period dress, was trying to head home from O\u2019Leary\u2019s, the fictional pub in the Five Points district, when she was accosted by thugs. Bobby Walden appeared, dominating the screen, sending them off. Sherry\u2019s character looked at him with love and uncertainty in her eyes, and turned to run away while Bobby gazed after her in turn.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Jude rose, found the remote and changed channels until a National Geographic show on great blue whales appeared. Jude sank back down on the sofa, closing his eyes. Whitney set her own plate down, and took her seat by him again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find the truth,\u201d she told him. Her voice was filled with certainty.</p><p>He took her hand and squeezed it. She remembered thinking that it would be nice to close her eyes as well.</p><p>The next thing she knew, she woke up.</p><p>Jude was slumped against the end of the sofa. She was slumped on top of Jude. No, she was cuddled up, curled against Jude. He felt warm and solid, vital and alive.</p><p>Someone had put a blanket over them.</p><p>He was still holding her hand, long, strong fingers threaded through her smaller, slimmer ones.</p><p>As her eyes opened, so did his.</p><p>Briefly, there was something different in the gray gaze he gave her.</p><p>Something soft, and electric, at the same time.</p><p>Desire.</p><p>She knew that it had been mirrored in her own.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>There was wariness in his eyes as well.</p><p>She looked away quickly. Well, he was a solid, white cop who was all hard evidence and facts; she was a woman of mixed heritage that included voodoo, and\u2014oh\u2014a ghost buster as well.</p><p>No hope, no future...she thought.</p><p>But, she realized with sadness, desire remained.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cCrosby! Hey!\u201d</p><p>Startled, Jude sat up, easing Whitney with him to a sitting position just as Ellis Sayer came hurrying into the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, what is it, Ellis?\u201d he asked. Whitney was trying to compose herself, smoothing down the now-wrinkled cotton blouse she wore beneath her tailored denim pantsuit.</p><p>\u201cI think I have something. Someone. I came here first\u2014you didn\u2019t pick up on the phone, and I figured you might be here.\u201d</p><p>Jude stood. The detective was making no sense. \u201cWho do you have with you, and what did you find?\u201d</p><p>Ellis\u2019s droopy hound-dog features actually shone for once.</p><p>\u201cCome to the porch,\u201d he urged them.</p><p>Jude stepped by him. In the hallway, Angela was still standing by the door, and Jude realized that she had opened the door to Ellis, who hadn\u2019t said a word to her, but had surely seen him and Whitney on the sofa, and just marched right to them. Will was sitting at the bank of screens, looking as surprised as Angela. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela still even had the door open. She stared at Jude, and then followed the trio out to the porch.</p><p>Captain Tyler was standing there wearing a coat that had caped shoulders, much like the kind seen on the killer in every Jack the Ripper movie ever made.</p><p>Captain Tyler\u2019s eyes lit up as he saw Jude, and then Whitney.</p> <p>\u201cCaptain Tyler,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be at a veterans\u2019 shelter.\u201d</p><p>Jude asked, \u201cCaptain Tyler, where did you get the coat?\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked confused, not sure who to answer first. \u201cDo you have coffee? Food?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Whitney said, taking his arm and glancing at Jude. He knew he could be too brusque, and that she had the right touch with Captain Tyler. Whitney had incredible sympathy for the downtrodden, and it seemed that her instincts were usually on the money. He nodded; he understood her silent warning. They needed to take this slowly.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Jude said huskily, \u201cwe need that coat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find another one for you,\u201d Whitney assured him.</p><p>Tyler looked at them, and then shed the coat. Whitney quickly secured a garbage bag for the garment, hoping to preserve what evidence might be left.</p><p>When it was safely sealed, Ellis Sayer let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cIn this case,\u201d he said quietly to Jude, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to drag him in, and we needed the damn coat, but he wouldn\u2019t give it to me. I knew he meant something to you and to the case, of course, and that\u2019s why I came straight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ellis,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ellis told him.</p> <p>Jude set a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not our killer, but he may be an essential witness. And you\u2019ll notice his condition. His mind is shot and we\u2019ll have to handle him with kid gloves, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d Ellis said.</p><p>Jackson was in the hallway when they entered the house. He glanced at Whitney, and then walked forward. \u201cWelcome, sir,\u201d he said to Captain Tyler.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir!\u201d Captain Tyler offered a hand to Jackson. \u201cCaptain Tyler, retired, sir! And you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson Crow. Please, we\u2019d love to have you join us for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Breakfast? They\u2019d slept through the night? Jude wondered.</p><p>That was bad, very bad. Except that it had been good. He could still recall his dreams. She\u2019d been with him, and he\u2019d been weary, but she had touched him, and in his dreams, she\u2019d been naked, crawling over him. They\u2019d made love passionately without a word, and he\u2019d felt her against him, the pressure of her breasts against his arm, the softness of her body curved to his...</p> <p>The last had been true.</p><p>The first...</p><p>Good God, he could only pray that he hadn\u2019t....</p><p>What the hell was he thinking? They were as far apart in thought and belief as the sun and the moon.</p><p>\u201cRight this way, Captain Tyler, please!\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>They seated Captain Tyler at the breakfast table in the kitchen. Coffee was placed in front of him. \u201cI\u2019ll start the eggs,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cDo you like cheese in them? Ham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that would be delightful,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jude sat down across from the man. Ellis stood in the doorway, watching and patiently waiting. Whitney quickly went about scrambling eggs while Jackson popped bread in the toaster and Angela took a seat at the end of the table.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Tyler, this is very important. You went to a veterans\u2019 home, right?\u201d Jude asked him. \u201cThe deputy chief told me that he\u2019d make sure that you were helped there, and that someone would see to your records and a permanent shelter for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, thank you. The police were wonderful,\u201d Captain Tyler said, sounding entirely lucid.</p><p>\u201cSo where did you get the coat?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cIn a Dumpster off Broadway,\u201d Captain Tyler said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not exactly up to standards in today\u2019s style, but it\u2019s warm. It\u2019s a wonderful coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a wonderful coat,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>Tyler stiffened. \u201cSir! It was my only coat now. I gave the pea jacket to old Harry, who hangs around the new subway station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make sure you have a coat, maybe even a stylish new coat,\u201d Jude told him. \u201cBut it\u2019s very important that you tell me the exact location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a Dumpster. About a block north of Trinity,\u201d Captain Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now, one more question, Captain Tyler,\u201d Jude said. \u201cHow did you wind up back by Trinity if you were at a shelter in another borough?\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s white brows arched high, and then furrowed. His hands began to shake around his coffee cup.</p><p>Jude reached out a hand and gently touched his. \u201cCaptain Tyler?\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked up at him. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember anything. I was at the home...there were very nice people there. I had a very long shower, and it was so good. I went to sleep, in a bed, with clean sheets. I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right...drink your coffee, Captain.\u201d He looked down the table at Angela. \u201cJenna Duffy is an RN, right?\u201d</p><p>Angela nodded, rose and went into the hallway. They could hear her calling up the stairs. \u201cJenna? Are you awake? Could you come down, please?\u201d</p><p>The eggs were cooked; Jackson added toast to the plate Whitney prepared and she set it in front of Captain Tyler. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just relax, Captain. Your memory will be better if you don\u2019t force it.\u201d</p><p>Jenna Duffy came into the kitchen. Angela indicated Captain Tyler.</p><p>\u201cCaptain,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThis is Agent Duffy, and she\u2019s a nurse. She\u2019s going to take a look at you, if she may.\u201d</p><p>Tyler saw Jenna and his eyes lit up with appreciation. \u201cYes!\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Jenna walked around the table to him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Captain Tyler. I just want to see your eyes, if I may?\u201d She lifted his lids, studying the man\u2019s bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, young woman. Beautiful accent! Irish, of course,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jenna nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy mother, bless her soul, was an Irishwoman!\u201d Captain Tyler said.</p><p>Jenna took his eggs away, and he stared at her like a child who had been slapped\u2014through no provocation\u2014by a parent. \u201cHe\u2019s been drugged,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what is in his system, but I\u2019d get some tests done on him before allowing him to eat anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Captain Tyler demanded.</p><p>Jude stood. \u201cSir, I\u2019m so sorry, but this is incredibly important. I have to take you to see a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not sick! I\u2019m hungry,\u201d the man said, indignant.</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019ll get you food just as soon as I can.\u201d Jude took Tyler\u2019s arm and started out of the kitchen and along the hallway.</p><p>\u201cEllis, can you drive us?\u201d Jude said. \u201cI\u2019d thought we were dealing with his usual loopiness, but Jenna believes he was drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I go where you send me. Where to? Headquarters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Captain Tyler balked. \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead yet, young man!\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, of course not. They have wonderful laboratories there. And it won\u2019t take long. And then we\u2019ll get you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Just so long as you know that I\u2019m really not dead yet,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>As they walked, Jude spoke to Ellis, telling him to get his men busy on the Dumpsters that needed to be searched.</p><p>\u201cJude, you know that we had Forensics all up and down the street the day that Virginia Rockford\u2019s body was discovered. I swear, there was no Dumpster left unturned that day,\u201d Ellis said.</p><p>\u201cI know. But it needs to be done again,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>He got to Ellis\u2019s unmarked simple black sedan and looked back. Whitney was at the door. He realized that they were both a mess; they hadn\u2019t changed since they\u2019d made the discovery in the foundations, dug into the earth, worked all day and fallen asleep on the sofa. If he was a mess, maybe she didn\u2019t mind being a mess.</p><p>\u201cAgent Tremont?\u201d he said.</p><p>He saw Whitney look at Jackson; their team was tight. Jackson nodded, and Whitney hurried down the steps.</p><p>\u201cAgent Tremont will be with us. I\u2019m getting accustomed to working with her,\u201d Jude told Ellis.</p><p>Jude slid into the backseat with Captain Tyler while Whitney sat up front with Ellis. It didn\u2019t take them long to cover the distance to the Office of the Medical Examiner, only this time, Jude didn\u2019t head for the morgue. Instead, he headed to the lab of Dr. Gil Sullivan, with whom he had worked many times before. Of course, he had usually brought him mysterious substances, rather than a living subject.</p><p>Jude explained how Ellis had found Captain Tyler downtown, wearing the coat, and that, as Dr. Sullivan could well imagine, they needed the coat tested as well as Captain Tyler himself. The coat he would bring to One Police Plaza, but he was pretty certain Captain Tyler needed to be tested quickly.</p><p>\u201cCaptain, how are you? I\u2019ll be kind and quick,\u201d Dr. Sullivan told him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m retired navy myself, sir,\u201d Sullivan assured Captain Tyler, leading him into one of the rooms where the captain could lie down on a white-sheeted bed.</p><p>Jude, Whitney and Ellis were left in a small employee lounge. Jude dug in his pockets for change and found enough for three cups of watery coffee. Better than nothing at this point.</p><p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI\u2019ll get with the men on the Dumpsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks, Ellis. But get some rest, too. Either that,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cor fall asleep on the job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellis actually laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get some sleep somewhere along the line. Keep me posted on anything you need.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was surprised when he smiled at her. \u201cAgent Tremont,\u201d he acknowledged and nodded goodbye.</p><p>When Ellis had gone, Jude sat next to Whitney. He had to smile. There was a large smudge of dirt on her cheek. He reached out with his thumb, rubbing it off. She watched him with her huge golden eyes as he did so. He started to speak, and he wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to say, but it didn\u2019t matter, because his cell phone rang.</p><p>It was Ellis Sayer on the line already as he was driving.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve put a \u2018Crosby needs it now!\u2019 on the forensics for the limos,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI have the drivers on alert that you\u2019ll be talking to them. Right now, they\u2019re making comparisons to tissue and blood samples from our Jane Does to the blood we\u2019ve managed to extract from the foundations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe House of Spiritualism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a twenty-four-hour watch on the property now. The bodies have all been...exhumed? Anyway, they\u2019re at the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll take a look while I\u2019m here,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that the coat probably came from the movie\u2019s costume department. We\u2019ve gone through every thing they had and haven\u2019t found a thing,\u201d Ellis said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t note that one was missing?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cAll of theirs are present and accounted for\u2014unless someone in costuming is lying,\u201d Ellis told him.</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Thanks,\u201d Jude said. He hesitated. \u201cAnd no new victims yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that we know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ellis.\u201d He was thoughtful a minute. \u201cLet your men handle the Dumpsters. I need you to get to the veterans\u2019 home where Captain Tyler was taken. I need to know exactly what he ate, if he was given any drugs, if anyone came to see him and exactly who reported to work and was in the building in the last twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>When they hung up, he knew that Whitney had heard the majority of the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coat,\u201d Jude said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with costuming?\u201d</p><p>Whitney was thoughtful a minute. \u201cThey keep close tabs on costumes, they\u2019re expensive. If one was missing and I were the wardrobe mistress...I have to admit, I\u2019d think about lying. If a coat was missing and she hadn\u2019t reported it, she\u2014or he\u2014could be in trouble. Trouble as in losing a job if it came up later that a costume had just disappeared and nothing was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould someone fix documentation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked at him with a dry grin. \u201cPeople can doctor just about anything.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThis is crazy, though. I guess Ellis wasn\u2019t supposed to have found the guy on the street that quickly.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWith any luck, we can find out who drugged Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith any luck,\u201d Whitney agreed. They both knew that the personnel at the veterans\u2019 hospital would be underpaid, understaffed and overwhelmed.</p> <p>Jude hoped that maybe a security camera of some kind had actually worked. As he mulled that over, Dr. Sullivan came out to speak with them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve something for me?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, your Captain Tyler was drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what, how and when?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>\u201cGHB,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said, \u201cGamma-hydroxybutyric acid. Essentially, it\u2019s a date-rape drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d Jude said softly. \u201cEasy to mix up a batch...you don\u2019t even have to be a chemistry major.\u201d</p><p>The doctor shrugged. \u201cThe government tries to control it, and it\u2019s on the same lists as LSD and heroin. But, as you said, anyone can mix up a batch in his or her kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he ingest it?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWith a cup of coffee, probably. Or a glass of water, maybe even a glass of juice.\u201d Sullivan shook his head. \u201cHere\u2019s the real problem with the drug, of course. It erases memory. Sometimes, in rape cases, the women remember snatches of events, or maybe something like a one-frame picture of where they were. In some cases, the victims remember nothing at all. People have died from overdoses, so we\u2019re lucky Captain Tyler is alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was planned that Captain Tyler be alive,\u201d Jude said thoughtfully. \u201cDr. Sullivan, would you see that he gets some lunch and some rest? And I have to make some kind of arrangements for him. I don\u2019t want Captain Tyler back on the streets, and I don\u2019t want him back at the home. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t fret on that,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring him home for the night.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cMy mother is in town. She needs someone to hover over other than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s above and beyond,\u201d Jude said. \u201cI can find another shelter. I can even bring him in to the hospital for observation. I have a neighbor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine with me,\u201d Sullivan assured him. \u201cHonestly. I like the old codger. Who knows, maybe Mom will like him, too. She\u2019s driving me insane, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m not expecting him to have any recall, but in case he does, I\u2019ll know how to talk him through whatever memory may come back up, and I\u2019ll contact you the second that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, then, thank you. I want to drop the coat off at my office, but I want to check up on the skeletal remains as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes! I heard about the find,\u201d Dr. Sullivan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got bags here.\u201d</p><p>The remains from the House of Spiritualism were in an autopsy room, lined up one after another. The remnants of clothing had been carefully bagged and tagged.</p><p>The bones looked lonely on the tables, sad and white, the empty-socket eyes seeming to stare out into space, like props at a movie set or a Halloween scare event. But they were real.</p><p>Fullbright was there when they arrived. \u201cWouldn\u2019t give up the supervision on this!\u201d he assured them. \u201cWe\u2019ve found plenty of nicks on the bones, and I\u2019d bet a year\u2019s pay that they were all nearly beheaded. Jack the Ripper strangled his victims. I believe that these women were awake and aware when their throats were slit. But we\u2019ve only begun the work. We\u2019ll know more when we\u2019ve had more time.\u201d</p><p>Jude looked at Whitney; she appeared ashen.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked her softly.</p><p>She nodded, but something in the room was still disturbing her.</p><p>\u201cHave you estimated the age of the bones?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, the clothing patterns and remnants\u2014even stained and such by fluids\u2014definitely appear to be late Victorian,\u201d Fullbright said. \u201cWe\u2019ve estimated the age of most of the victims to be late teens to early twenties. Some have very bad teeth, which would suggest that they had been poor, immigrants perhaps. Sadly, yes! The refuse of life of that pitiable time.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cKilling them was easy. I don\u2019t know if they were even missed with more than a passing thought. Come tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be able to give you a closer age estimate and even race, maybe nationality, of most of them. Well\u2014\u201d he glanced over at the forensic anthropologists, busily working \u201c\u2014I and my comrades of this adventure will be able to tell you much more tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, are you really all right?\u201d he asked Whitney as they left the building. \u201cI can get you back to Blair House. I become obsessed, but I don\u2019t have the right to drag you along with me all day. In fact, I really don\u2019t have the right to separate you from your team at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m glad to be with you, and I\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d she said. She looked ahead as they walked. \u201cIt was just...the skulls. The jaws on some were disarticulated from the skulls, and it looked as if they were staring at some horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cI can take you back to Blair House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to work this,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>She was such a proud little thing, and her stature, the way she carried her body, gave her a presence that wasn\u2019t due to her size. He couldn\u2019t help feeling as they walked that he wanted to shield her from the unpleasantness at hand. He reminded himself that she was an agent.</p><p>That didn\u2019t stop them from being people. It didn\u2019t stop him from that growing feeling that they were meant to be together. So she had annoyed him at first, but that initial annoyance had turned into something else quickly. He wouldn\u2019t have been human, he\u2019d have had to have been a eunuch, not to feel a sizzle of instant awareness when she was near. Awareness quickly became realized as basic desire, and he was a fool to keep needing her around him.</p><p>But he did. And he couldn\u2019t even say that she wasn\u2019t good with him, working the case, because she was.</p><p>And, hell, he was a cop. He had strength of purpose, damn it. He could force himself to a steel-willed control.</p><p>His dreams were his own, even his dreams of hot, carnal, naked passion. She didn\u2019t need to know that he kept imagining her naked.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they had the coat delivered to and registered into the lab; Jude made sure it was in the hands of Judith Garner, who was still, along with her crew, wrangling the evidence gathered from both the Broadway and the Bowery sites.</p><p>Jude was fairly certain by then that he had himself\u2014and his wandering mind\u2014in check.</p><p>He told Whitney that he wanted to check in with Hannah, and they did so. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything new yet,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I started on background checks yesterday, and Jake Mallory and I divided the work\u2014we have hundreds of names to go through. I\u2019ve got the programs situated to spit out all kinds of concurrences, similarities, mental defects, sealed juvenile records, you name it. We\u2019re working on anyone even remotely connected with the film, and with Blair House, and the House of Spiritualism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Jude reminded her, \u201canyone who has worked in a slaughterhouse, in an autopsy room, with medicine and anatomy in any way. And anyone who knows something about law enforcement, evidence, what we can really find and what we can\u2019t find.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Hannah said. She started counting off on her fingers, \u201cThe killer knows how to get around detection, the killer knows where certain body organs are, the killer apparently knows the city and the system.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat could be a lot of New Yorkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on the limo drivers and the principals in the movie first\u2014and look up everything you can find on Samuel Vintner, retired cop, dial-a-guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cAnd you know I would have let you know immediately if I\u2019d found anything on him. No college degree, and he passed the police academy as a C student, I guess you\u2019d say. He was on a beat\u2014in Brooklyn\u2014for twenty years, and retired. He never came near the morgue, the best I can find. He never worked in a grocery store as a butcher, much less in a slaughterhouse. Detective Sayer\u2019s people interviewed his wife, and she said that he was home in time for dinner, just like he was supposed to be, and he wasn\u2019t covered in blood.\u201d Hannah paused, looking at the two of them. \u201cYou guys are a mess. You slept in those clothes, after digging all day. Ugh.\u201d She grinned suddenly. \u201cI should have made you get up when I left last night, but you were so cute sleeping. And I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not getting a lot of sleep these days.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBut, if you\u2019re representing the NYPD and the bureau, you might just want to take showers!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSoon, Hannah, I promise,\u201d Jude told her. \u201cWhat about Angus Avery? He may be our man.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI did a background on him right away, Jude,\u201d she said, sounding hurt. \u201cHe went to NYU, and then to the University of Southern California. He has all kinds of writing and directing credits. As far as information I can track goes, he has never worked in the medical field, or in groceries\u2014as a butcher, or in a slaughterhouse. He grew up in the Village, though, so, I would assume he knows Lower Manhattan well. Oh, he wrote the story\u2014the screenplay\u2014for O\u2019Leary\u2019s. And it was considered a coup for him when he was able to hire Sherry Blanco for the leading role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Sherry? What about Bobby Walden?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, they both have confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\u201d Hannah said, her eyes rolling. \u201cI think Bobby got even more money because Sherry agreed to be in the film when she found out that Bobby was her costar. He\u2019d been slipping, you know. That turkey called A Slice of Christmas? I mean, come on, a Christmas slasher film? Anyway, Bobby is still stardust, I guess. Must be all the action flicks he did.</p><p>\u201cSherry\u2019s a little different. She went to UCLA for one year, and then she was hired for a music-video show, and she has been working nonstop since then. She never even had to wash a dish or bartend\u2014her parents were putting her through. Bobby Walden was a child prodigy, and was already on the kids\u2019 channels by the time he was eighteen...tutors on set and all that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDig deeper,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>She might have been upset, but she was looking past him\u2014at Whitney. He wasn\u2019t sure what kind of expression Whitney had given her, but it caused Hannah to smile.</p><p>\u201cYour wish is my command. Go. Go get cleaned up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t yet,\u201d Whitney told her. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to the shelter for the veterans of foreign wars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d Hannah asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone drugged, kidnapped and deserted Captain Tyler,\u201d Jude explained. \u201cAnd I need to get my car\u2014can you give us a ride?\u201d</p> <p>12</p><p>Ellis Sayer had already arrived at the veterans\u2019 home and was questioning patients and workers in one of the employee lounges. As Whitney listened to Jude speak with the desk clerk, she heard the conversation recede as if she\u2019d moved to a distant place. She felt her heart break as she looked around; no one deserved the finest the American public could give more than the men and women who served in the military. She knew that they\u2014just as she had\u2014signed a contract with their branch of service, one that explained that they were putting their lives on the line. Every police officer, every National Guardsman and woman, every person in law enforcement, as well as in the military, knew that they put their lives on the line.</p><p>But none did so with the expectation of facing enemy fire in the way that these soldiers had.</p><p>At first, she thought that the hallways were just busy. Then, with a chill sweeping over her, she realized that she was seeing the dead.</p><p>She swallowed hard, frozen at first.</p><p>It had started in the autopsy room. She had looked at the bones on the tables, and she had imagined them rising and acquiring surreal bodies out of the air that surrounded them. She had seen the gaping mouths, opened in horrendous screams that she thought she could hear.</p><p>And now, it was worse...</p><p>They walked by her sadly; soldiers who had made it home, but not made it back to health. Men minus arms and legs, limping along on prosthetic legs, or with metal and rubber extensions where arms had once been attached to their bodies. There were those who were pale and gaunt, and had evidently died from organ damage that just couldn\u2019t be repaired, or diseases that just couldn\u2019t be cured. This was not really a hospital; it was a shelter that offered medical aid.</p> <p>One man in particular stopped and stared at her. Whitney stared back, and realized that he knew that she saw him, and was surprised. She saluted him.</p><p>\u201cWhitney?\u201d Jude said and she started. \u201cThe night manager for C Wing is in with Ellis now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She followed Jude down a long hallway. He apparently knew where he was going, because he only paused once, looking at the doors around them. He opened one and walked in.</p><p>A heavyset woman was seated at a table, wringing a handkerchief in her hands. She stopped speaking when Jude and Whitney entered, eyeing them worriedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mrs. Dean, continue,\u201d Ellis said, looking at Jude and Whitney. He grimaced. \u201cThey\u2019re my colleagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all right.\u201d Mrs. Dean took a deep breath. \u201cI saw Captain Tyler at nine o\u2019clock\u2014that\u2019s our basic bedtime here. But, of course, our soldiers and sailors are not forced to go to sleep then. Medications have been given out. Dinner is long over, and it\u2019s quiet time. I checked in on him because he\u2019s such a sweet man. And I think he was going to adapt okay. A doctor saw him yesterday, and he was waiting for some test results before starting on a medication regime. I gave him a mild sedative, just to sleep\u2014an ibuprofen with an added sleep aid, doctor\u2019s orders. It wouldn\u2019t have knocked him out, and it wouldn\u2019t have done anything to his memory. And I was at the desk all night, except that if I wasn\u2019t, Mary was there.\u201d She gasped suddenly. \u201cExcept when the alarm went off in Admiral Clift\u2019s room. We both went running\u2014he\u2019s one of the World War II vets, quite old and frail, and we both rushed in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with Admiral Clift?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>A look of realization came over Mrs. Dean\u2019s face. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing.\u201d She fumbled with her handkerchief. \u201cThat\u2019s when someone got to Captain Tyler!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why no one was notified this morning that Captain Tyler was gone?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re not required to check out. Well, of course, we expect the courtesy of being told when our vets are leaving. We have only so many beds, and we\u2019re trying to create a place where they can find homes and receive medical help without actually living in a nursing facility. Like assisted living, with a better quality of life,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Tyler was brought in by the police. We should have been notified,\u201d Ellis Sayer said crossly.</p><p>Mrs. Dean was upset, but she was also defensive. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to speak to the day crew about the morning. I have no idea why no one was notified!\u201d</p><p>Whitney stepped in then, smiling. \u201cMrs. Dean, could you show us Captain Tyler\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, dear, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jude looked at Ellis, who grimaced. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Whitney had longed for Angela\u2019s talent\u2014a real ability to wait, to simply be there, sympathetically, in touch on a different plane, and allow the dead needing help or closure to see that she might see them, and come to her. Now, with the dead suddenly so apparent to her, filling the hallways, she felt a sense of overwhelming unease; she had never thought that she would see so many, so suddenly...so many...</p><p>She nearly walked into a member of the living, believing that he was one of the dead.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d she told an older man. He was in uniform, and though frail, his physical health seemed to be fine. He lifted his hat to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, young woman, it\u2019s all right. A lovely young woman may walk into me anytime,\u201d he said, and moved on around them. \u201cHeading to bingo, Mrs. Dean!\u201d he said. He paused and looked back at Whitney. \u201cMarnie! Would you like to come to bingo with me?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dean whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s Major Radison. He thinks you\u2019re his daughter, Marnie. Just tell him that you have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to come!\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, sweetheart. Plan to come on a bingo night when you can stay!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe offer many group activities here,\u201d Mrs. Dean murmured. \u201cMajor Radison is another of our World War II veterans. His daughter, Marnie, died last year, and her family lives out in Arizona, so they\u2019re not here often. Sad, truly. For him, the Alzheimer\u2019s is a blessing. He doesn\u2019t know that she died.\u201d</p><p>She pushed open a door to a cheerful room. The bed was even made and decorated with a pretty quilt. The other furnishings offered utility with grace. There was a desk as well as a dresser, and on a counter at the back, a microwave.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>Jude, she noticed, had paid little heed to the room. He had gone to the window. He didn\u2019t touch it, but looked at the mechanism. \u201cWe\u2019re on the ground floor,\u201d he noted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, we have many rooms on the ground floor,\u201d Mrs. Dean said.</p><p>\u201cEllis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, forensics on the window,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI\u2019ve already called\u2014should be a team here soon. Gloves?\u201d</p> <p>He offered a pair to Jude, and Jude accepted them, and struggled briefly to get them on his long-fingered hands. He opened the window and stuck his head out. \u201cFootprints, too, the ground is soft, they might find something. And the parking lot is just about fifty feet away,\u201d he said. He turned. \u201cWho is on the morning shift?\u201d he asked Mrs. Dean.</p><p>\u201cGertrude, but she\u2019s gone home now,\u201d Mrs. Dean said.</p><p>Jude looked at Ellis. \u201cWe\u2019ll need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll get over to see Gertrude.\u201d</p><p>Jude appeared frustrated but resigned. \u201cAll right, Mrs. Dean, thank you for your time. No one has touched anything in this room since Captain Tyler was here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe cleaning crew comes in from 7:00 a.m. through 4:00 p.m. every day,\u201d Mrs. Dean told them. \u201cBut we received Detective Sayer\u2019s call, and we were able to stop them before they came in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it was left like this, with the bed made?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cJust as you see it,\u201d Mrs. Dean agreed.</p><p>Jude flashed Ellis a look of gratitude and Ellis Sayer nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve already been in here. There were no glasses, cups or anything else. And the crime scene unit will dust all the furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dean, you didn\u2019t see anyone here last night that shouldn\u2019t have been here, or anything unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing... I didn\u2019t even think the alarm was unusual until you asked, and we knew that Captain Tyler was gone. Thank God that he\u2019s all right, but then he has been living on the streets a very long time\u2014he does know his way around, bless him,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Whitney set a hand on her shoulder. \u201cThis is a home, not a fortress or a prison, and I can see that you try very hard to make the veterans happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I should have...I should have been aware. We take precautions with our senile guests, and certainly, with those suffering from brain damage. I should have thought about that alarm and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dean, if you should think of anything, or hear anything, please notify me right away,\u201d Jude said, handing her a card.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>She turned and walked out of the room. They followed.</p><p>Major Radison hadn\u2019t gone to bingo. He was still standing in the foyer, smiling, as he looked at the pictures of the administrators. \u201cMajor Radison, bingo is about to begin,\u201d Mrs. Dean reminded him.</p><p>The elderly man looked at Whitney and smiled again. \u201cMarnie, are you coming?\u201d</p><p>She was about to make a polite response when she saw the first ghost who had seemed to recognize her in the hallway. He was frowning, watching her. Slowly, he pointed a finger at Major Radison.</p> <p>Whitney frowned in turn, but then she wondered if the ghost was trying to help her.</p><p>\u201cMajor, before you go, did you hear or see anything unusual last night?\u201d Whitney asked him.</p><p>\u201cMiss,\u201d Mrs. Dean said softly, \u201cthe man suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s. I\u2019m afraid that he can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Jude said softly. \u201cWhitney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajor?\u201d Whitney prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhy, come to think of it, child...\u201d Major Radison said thoughtfully. \u201cSomeone walked into my room with a cup and said that I needed my medicine. But then he looked at me, and said he had the wrong room, he was very sorry,\u201d the major said.</p><p>\u201cWas he\u2014a nurse?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, a most unusual nurse, if you ask me. He was wearing some kind of ridiculous cloak\u2014in a hospital! It\u2019s not even cold in the hospital. And he had a big hat\u2014he looked like something out of an old-time movie! Ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous!\u201d Major Radison said, shaking his head with confusion and disgust.</p><p>\u201cI told you that he couldn\u2019t help you!\u201d Mrs. Dean said.</p><p>\u201cMajor, I\u2019m going to send a sketch artist to see you,\u201d Jude said. \u201cDo you think he could help you draw the man you saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, of course!\u201d the major told him, apparently quite happy to be of service. He turned to Mrs. Dean. \u201cI know what I saw,\u201d he said with quiet dignity.</p><p>\u201cOr, better yet, if you\u2019re willing, I\u2019ll send an officer to pick you up and bring you downtown. I\u2019d like to have you look at some pictures as well, and see if you recognize anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am willing, sir, always to serve my country!\u201d He bowed to Whitney. \u201cBut, it must be tomorrow morning, sir! You see, now, I am on to bingo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I sent out the artist tonight, but had you picked up to come down to the station in the morning?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cI shall be happy to assist, after bingo,\u201d Major Radison said.</p><p>With a clipped bow, he left them.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Dean,\u201d Jude said. Then he smiled at Whitney and opened the door for her.</p><p>Whitney turned back to see the ghost soldier who had pointed to the major when they\u2019d been about to leave.</p><p>He saluted her gravely. She didn\u2019t give a damn what anyone thought; she saluted in return, and then stepped on out the front door, and into the gray mist of a fog-filled twilight.</p><p>Little felt as good as the hot shower Jude took when he reached his apartment at last. He scrubbed thoroughly, and the water seemed uplifting, allowing him to believe that they would sift through the haystack and find the truth. As Agent Mulder from the X-Files always said, The truth was out there. He\u2019d been a fan of the show; seeking the truth about aliens was more entertaining than that sought in the mind of a human psychopath.</p><p>Sometimes, it did seem that the truth was hidden in a vast galaxy, but he had hope that Major Radison did have moments of pure lucidity, and that he could give them some kind of picture of the man who had come to drug and kidnap Captain Tyler.</p><p>Emerging from the shower, he longed to forget the case.</p><p>He knew that he could not. Jude had no problem believing that, whether he suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s or not, Major Radison still met the killer entering the wrong room. Somehow, he had known about Tyler, and decided that the homeless veteran would make a good scapegoat. Except that something about the situation was disturbing.</p><p>If the killer was playing Jack the Ripper, they knew damn well he wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>He felt refreshed, and yet restless.</p><p>And at odds.</p><p>He worked fine alone. When he was off, he knew how to play alone, or enjoy time with his father, friends, or even heading out for the night, when there were those times he\u2019d meet a woman, and they\u2019d wind up spending the night. Since his last fiasco, however, he\u2019d determined to keep it casual, and not out of vindictiveness or bitterness. He knew cops who had good marriages. He knew more cops\u2014especially detectives\u2014who had broken marriages. Better to keep his distance.</p><p>He deserved a break, and he knew he had the right to take it. And that he wasn\u2019t a one-man island\u2014the NYPD didn\u2019t work that way. But there were too many threads unraveling; he was almost certain that the blood discovered via Luminol at the site would prove that the first two women had been attacked there, at the pentagram, just as the others had been attacked before them more than a century earlier. He\u2019d be lucky to get test results tomorrow from the crime scene unit techs working on the blood and trace at the site, and from those working on trace from the limos he\u2019d asked to be inspected. Still, he was restless; he wanted to get into the killer\u2019s mind.</p><p>And, tonight, he didn\u2019t want to be alone. He didn\u2019t want to pull out his jazz or blues collections, and didn\u2019t want to wander the streets, or watch sports in one of his favorite bars. He didn\u2019t even want to drop in on his father\u2014who was wonderful at helping him sort out his mind.</p><p>He wanted to return to Blair House.</p><p>And he had a very sound reason; Jackson Crow was a behavioral specialist, a profiler. And while he was forming his own suspicions, there was no one better to discuss such suspicions than the head of the crack team sent to help him.</p><p>And, of course, he\u2019d spent the day out with Whitney, and he needed to see what headway, if any, members of the special unit had made.</p><p>As he drove, he pondered the way that Whitney had been at the veterans\u2019 home\u2014strange. At first, it had almost seemed that her mind was wandering. Yet when they had interviewed Mrs. Dean, she had, as usual, stepped back, speaking only softly at what always became the right time.</p><p>Good cop, bad cop, he thought. He and Monty had played that game often enough. It seemed that he and Whitney had fallen into the strategy as well. He was too curt and too quick, and she stepped in, flashing her beautiful smile with her soft green-and-gold eyes, and her words would never try to excuse his behavior, just clarify and soften.</p><p>But her intuition in speaking with Major Radison had been uncanny.</p><p>Just as her suggestion that they dig beneath the bricks in the flooring at the House of Spiritualism. She\u2019d found bodies; many of them.</p><p>When he parked in front of the house, he half expected to find that the team wasn\u2019t there, that they\u2019d gone next door again, perhaps to dig in new ground. But he saw that patrol cars were sitting in front of the construction site, and that Blair House was aglow with lights.</p><p>He parked and headed up the walk. He was surprised that the door opened before he could reach it. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d come,\u201d Whitney said, smiling as she greeted him. She was wearing a casual knit dress that bared the fine structure of her throat and collarbone, and the sleekly muscled perfection of her lower legs. He felt an instant heat sweep through him; it wasn\u2019t unpleasant. It was caused by seeing her there, and by the sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cShowered even,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou look fine in the dirt of the ages, at least to me,\u201d she assured him. \u201cDo you like sushi? Will was our cook tonight. We\u2019re having a working dinner\u2014Jackson has a board going like the one you use at your task force meetings, and we\u2019re all discussing what we know about the case. I hope you\u2019ve come with a little time?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love sushi and I\u2019m more than intrigued to see what you behavior people have to say about our killer,\u201d Jude said. Yet, at the moment, he didn\u2019t really want to see Jackson, or any of the rest of the team. He wanted to reach out and draw Whitney to him, and forget everything around them.</p><p>Dangerous, he warned himself. Crazy.</p><p>\u201cCome on into the kitchen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He did so. The others greeted him as if it was perfectly natural that he had come. In fact, it seemed they\u2019d been expecting him.</p><p>\u201cWhitney has filled us in on the events at the veterans\u2019 home,\u201d Jackson said, shaking his hand in greeting. \u201cHopefully, that evidence will lead right to the killer. Take a seat, please, have something to eat, and I\u2019ll explain our board. What we\u2019ve done here is connect the past with the present.\u201d Jackson pointed out the mapgraph they had created.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I can follow it pretty easily,\u201d Jude said. \u201cYou have Emma Smith and Martha Tabrum...the woman reported attacked by soldiers, who died the morning following the attack...and the woman whose throat was slit, whom the experts don\u2019t believe were Ripper victims aligned with Sarah Larson and our Jane Doe whom we still can\u2019t name. You have Virginia Rockford and Melody Tatum aligned with Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman. On the other side of the line, you have Carrie Brown\u2014the New York victim of a like murder, and then...I\u2019m not sure about the other names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are people I\u2019ve dismissed, though to some speculators they\u2019re also victims of the New York Jack the Ripper,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t believe that Carrie Brown was killed by Jack the Ripper. There were too many differences outweighing the similarities, in my mind. The Ripper\u2019s victims were manually strangled and their throats were slit. In the Carrie Brown case, she was strangled with a piece of her clothing, and her throat was not slit. The other cases are even more ridiculous. One was killed in her house in the midst of a robbery, and the mutilations didn\u2019t occur in the same manner, or at all. The Ripper never left his knife\u2014the Carrie Brown murderer did. So, in my mind, our American \u2018Ripper\u2019 was not the same man. I do believe, however, that he was the elusive Jonathan Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell is our killer doing?\u201d Jude said. \u201cIn my opinion, the Jack the Ripper of Victorian London fame was either in a mental hospital or dead after the Mary Kelly killing\u2014if her killing wasn\u2019t just a copycat killing. Whatever it might have been, I don\u2019t see such a murderer sanely taking a break so as not to be detected. Our killer is imitating Jack the Ripper\u2014as if he had come to America, and so, he believes the Carrie Brown killing to be attributable to the Ripper. But here\u2019s where I grow extremely wary\u2014with the coat deliberately given to the captain, it appears that the killer is trying to set someone up to take the fall.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson sat down. \u201cI\u2019ve been mulling this over all day, ever since Ellis appeared with Captain Tyler. If it didn\u2019t appear that the killer was doing his best to imitate the Ripper, I\u2019d assume he was just trying to cast blame on someone else, in fact, to pin the murders on someone else. But I find it unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we be looking at another person\u2019s involvement? When you consider the London murders, it\u2019s clear they grew steadily more violent,\u201d Jude pointed out. \u201cPolly Nichols was severely slashed. By the time he got to his next victim, he hacked up her organs. He grew fonder of killing\u2014and mutilation. I don\u2019t see such a man calmly determining that he\u2019d better make it look as if the butler did it. So, who tried to set up Captain Tyler\u2014and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll have luck in the morning when you bring Major Radison to the station and show him some mug shots, along with pictures of a few of our principal players,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re bringing him down to the station,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think the surroundings will bother him?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jenna told him. \u201cI think he will actually feel better. Everyone will be kind to him at the station and will want his opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m glad. I just wonder how much he\u2019s actually going to be able to help,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhoever it was bothered to come to the hospital in a cloak, or something similar\u2014and a hat. He might have gone all the way\u2014with stage makeup,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cIt always seems to bring us back to the movie being made\u2014O\u2019Leary\u2019s,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd Will is right. Anyone working around a set long enough has to learn something about makeup. So, was it really a mistake that the kidnapper who drugged and took Captain Tyler went to the wrong room\u2014or did he do it on purpose? He was perpetuating the Jack the Ripper myth, even in \u2018stealing\u2019 and setting up Captain Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhitney, tomorrow you need to get to the location where O\u2019Leary\u2019s is now shooting,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA task force meeting will take place tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d Jackson assured him gravely.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the sushi?\u201d Will asked.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cSushi\u2014dinner,\u201d Will said, waving his chopsticks in the air.</p><p>Jude laughed. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s great, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>When they finished, Will and Angela went to study the bank of screens in the hallway. Whitney urged him to come back to the den, where Jake Mallory was set up. \u201cYou know that Hannah and I are sharing our information. We\u2019ve done personality studies with Jackson on some of your movie principals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are your conclusions?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re looking at three possible suspects. Obviously, that\u2019s if the killer is working with someone. None of us believes that Sherry Blanco\u2014though certainly a narcissist\u2014has the necessary strength to pull off the murders. But it could be that she is in on what\u2019s happening, if there are two people at work, which seems possible.\u201d</p><p>Whitney looked at Jude. \u201cYou know, the royal family conspiracy theory maintained that the prince had help in the killings\u2014his physician, Sir Richard Gull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGull was the carriage driver\u2014there to whisk the prince away,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cSo, Sherry could be the person making sure that the killer makes a clean escape,\u201d Jake told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd she could just be a spoiled star,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cAnd we could be barking up the wrong tree entirely.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, stretching. A yawn escaped her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she said.</p><p>Jude rose. \u201cI\u2019ll get out of here, let you have your house back and get some rest for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should just move in here while the investigation is going on,\u201d Jake told him.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve got an apartment not that far,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Move in. Nice idea. Close to Whitney. Not having to leave...</p><p>\u201cWell, good night. I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t get out that quickly. As they started through the hallway toward the front door, they passed the bank of screens. Angela was leaning forward, pointing at something on it. \u201cIt\u2019s still there, the shadow that seems to lurk just above the ground.\u201d</p><p>Jude walked over to look. Lights set up at the empty excavation site glinted off the patrol cars now permanently parked along the chain-link fence. But despite the lights, a shadow undulated just above the surface of the ground.</p><p>\u201cIs it the film?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Whitney said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s high-speed film...captures light, shadow, movement and changes in temperature, really. Movement in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s just a breeze\u2014and the night is foggy,\u201d he said.</p><p>No one answered him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, there should be no activity,\u201d Angela murmured. \u201cThe bodies there were found, and they were dug out of the pit where they were buried without prayer or ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose bodies were discovered,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jude groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting there are more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cMore victims?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Whitney looked at him at last. \u201cMaybe not. According to the Honeywell book your father loaned me, Jonathan Black just disappeared. The city was in an uproar; the House of Spiritualism came under so much fire that the city fathers decided that it was going to be razed, and it was. They\u2019d lost power. According to the book, the followers had grown afraid of Jonathan Black, who, it seemed, was their power for some time. It is possible that they got together and basically assassinated him. And if they did so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey buried him in the walls or the foundations somewhere,\u201d Jude finished for her. He stared at Whitney. \u201cDo you know where he\u2019s buried? I mean, like you knew how to find the bodies last night?\u201d</p><p>Whitney shook her head. \u201cNo. We don\u2019t know where his body might be, if it is there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, a new Satanist might have worshipped his body, a piece of his body...or even some kind of relic he might have used as his \u2018cross\u2019 for others to respect as a symbol of some kind of supernatural power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you where his body might be. Not yet,\u201d Angela murmured.</p><p>Jude turned. He had to get out of Blair House. He didn\u2019t want to become known as a ghost buster, with his department snickering behind his back.</p><p>But if Whitney had been the one to ask him, he realized, he\u2019d have stayed through the night.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>In seconds, Jude was out in the street, revving his car\u2019s engine and heading home.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even reached the house before he wanted to go back.</p><p>Tonight would bring those same dreams again. There would be some kind of gentle breeze blowing and moonlight slipping through the windows. He would see her as she came into his arms, as they fell onto the bed together, as he felt her sleek naked flesh next to his own... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he parked for the night, he prayed that his dad would have a bourbon waiting for him.</p><p>A big one.</p><p>And he wondered if even that would help.</p> <p>The dog came to Whitney again that night. She had lain down, her mind still reeling, and closed her eyes. For once, she hadn\u2019t been thinking about the case. She was remembering that she had basically spent the night before sleeping on top of Detective Jude Crosby. His fingers, so long and strong, had held her own. She\u2019d felt the rise and fall of his breath, and the heat and vitality of his muscles, the breadth of his chest...</p><p>The memory was interrupted by the sound of a soft whine, and then again, a damp nose against her fingers.</p><p>She opened her eyes. He was seated at the side of her bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWe found your mistress. We\u2019ll make sure that she\u2019s buried in a cemetery. I\u2019ll make sure that prayers are said. It will be all right.\u201d</p><p>She looked across her room. The bathroom light was on. In its glow, she saw the woman.</p> <p>\u201cAnnie. Annie Doherty?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>The image faded.</p><p>The ghost dog remained.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to sleep, I really have to. You want something else from me, but if I don\u2019t sleep, I\u2019ll never know what it is,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>The dog whined and wagged his tail.</p><p>Then she felt a sense of pressure as he jumped up onto the bed. In typical dog fashion, he circled three times and then lay down, facing her, his eyes sad.</p> <p>She suddenly wondered if he had come to watch over her.</p><p>\u201cWere you really allowed to sleep on the bed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The dog wagged his tail; the long furry appendage seemed to thump on the bed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. We\u2019re going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>To her amazement, she lay down and quickly felt dreams overtake her.</p><p>They weren\u2019t nightmares. They were sweet dreams. She was lying with Jude Crosby, and it was the most natural thing in the world. And they weren\u2019t cramped up on a couch; they were in a bed.</p><p>Her sleep deepened, and it became restful.</p><p>Until she heard her cell phone ringing in the morning, so constantly that she thought it would vibrate right off the bedside table.</p> <p>She fumbled, knocked it to the floor, found it, saw that the caller was Jude and answered quickly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve found trace evidence in the limo that was assigned to Angus Avery,\u201d he said. \u201cBlood drops\u2014the blood was Virginia Rockford\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Jude sat across from Angus Avery in a situation very different from the last time they had met. There was no pleasant New York bustle going on around them now. The chairs were rigid, cold and uncomfortable, the lights harsh.</p><p>He\u2019d been read his rights, but he still appeared to be stunned. He hadn\u2019t demanded to be left alone while he waited for his attorney to show up. Jude hoped that would take some time. It was rush hour, so it might. Angus Avery certainly had a high-powered attorney, who would get the man out on bail, unless an underpaid district attorney could convince the judge that he was a flight risk or too dangerous to be on the loose.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane!\u201d Avery told him, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m a filmmaker, not a killer! I cooperated with your questions. You have...you have blood in a car that carried me to a dinner. I wasn\u2019t in that car again. This is...what do you call it? It\u2019s not proof\u2014its circumstantial evidence, that\u2019s what it is. You have people searching my apartment now, right? You won\u2019t find anything. And why won\u2019t you find anything? Because I didn\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>Jude knew that Sayer and the deputy chief were standing behind the mirror, monitoring the proceedings. Others were surely there as well.</p><p>The limo driver, Eric Len, was cooling his heels in another interrogation room. In a few minutes, Sayer would go speak with him. They\u2019d give him a few minutes to sweat, and then tell him that Angus Avery had implicated him. Outright lies often tripped up an accomplice.</p><p>But Jude didn\u2019t feel right. Avery was literally in tears, protesting his arrest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it!\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cHow did Virginia Rockford\u2019s blood get in that limo?\u201d Jude asked him. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019d like to help you out.\u201d He actually meant the words. He\u2019d suspected that the director might be involved, but now, something about the situation seemed far too easy. \u201cThere\u2019s more, Mr. Avery, I\u2019m afraid. There were hairs and epithelial cells that match your DNA found on the cloak that Captain Tyler was wearing when he was found after being kidnapped from a veterans\u2019 home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give permission for my DNA to be taken!\u201d Avery protested. \u201cThat\u2019s my right\u2014you didn\u2019t have just cause. You can\u2019t bring my DNA into court!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Avery, I took your DNA from a cup that you\u2019d been drinking from at the diner where you met with me, and it was perfectly legal,\u201d Jude told him. \u201cIf you want to come clean with me, I can help you. We can talk with the D.A., you know that. You know that people deal all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it! I\u2019m being framed,\u201d he said desperately.</p><p>\u201cIt may be circumstantial evidence, but it\u2019s just about overwhelming,\u201d Jude told him. \u201cAnd the city is in a panic over these murders. You\u2019re in real trouble. You need us. You need our help.\u201d</p><p>There was a tap on the door. A small, slim, middle-aged man in a crisp black Versace suit walked in. \u201cMy client has nothing else to say. We need privacy.\u201d He produced a card and handed it to Jude. \u201cAlton Morrison III, Detective. I\u2019ll be representing Mr. Avery.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was stunned. She had expected that if the police really caught the killer he\u2019d confess. He\u2019d be proud of his work, though sad he hadn\u2019t accomplished the scenario it seemed he had planned. But, of course, human nature could be strange.</p><p>It was all over by the time she and Jackson arrived at the station. Eric Len had demanded an attorney immediately, but not before he had sworn that he\u2019d returned the car to the garage just as he had said\u2014and as records showed\u2014and that he had gone home, alone. His wife couldn\u2019t verify that information for him because she was back in China, visiting family. But he knew nothing. Nothing. He had never lied.</p><p>Angus Avery was taken to be arraigned that afternoon.</p><p>His high-powered attorney couldn\u2019t get him released on bail, but he did manage to negotiate a house arrest, since the police evidence was circumstantial. He could return to his apartment with an ankle monitor. For his own safety, and the possible safety of the people of New York, he would also be closely monitored by the police\u2014in other words a beat cop would be assigned to watch his comings and goings.</p><p>The police were appalled; the public was divided. Naturally, there was a press conference, and Avery denied passionately that he was guilty; he was being framed, and he suspected the NYPD who were desperate to say that they had solved a murder\u2014they were arresting an innocent man, just as they had arrested and jailed an innocent man in the 1890s for the murder of the Ripper victim Carrie Brown. In court, he swore he would prove himself innocent.</p><p>Whitney saw little of Jude that day; he was busy with the lab, with paperwork, with discussions with the prosecutors, making sure that all the evidence was in order. The team stayed at the station long enough to contribute what they could, and then returned to Blair House to discuss the arrest. Jackson didn\u2019t seem convinced that Angus Avery had committed the killings, but he didn\u2019t say that it was impossible. The police had a weak case against the limo driver at best; there was no more reason or evidence that he should have smuggled the car out of the garage after its return than anyone else. Jackson determined that they would remain in the city at least another week, helping to tie up loose ends, if need be, and also because the film they continued to see on the bank of screens from the foundation abyss at the property next door was a phenomenon they all wanted to explore. They were cleared through the bureau, the NYPD and the city.</p><p>It seemed a restless day. Whitney sat with Angela at the bank of screens that afternoon, just watching the strange shadows. But they didn\u2019t change, and they didn\u2019t do anything. She went upstairs to lie down, surprised that she was so tired when she hadn\u2019t really done anything.</p><p>In time, Angus Avery would certainly break. He would explain how he had gotten the car out of the garage, and how he had kidnapped Captain Tyler.</p><p>If he was indeed guilty.</p><p>Jude had told her briefly that the task force would remain together, gathering evidence on the chauffeur, Eric Len. So far, they really had nothing on him except that the car had been assigned to him, and he had been Avery\u2019s driver.</p><p>She felt...dissatisfied. Somehow, she had thought that they\u2019d have a more thorough completion of the case, that they\u2019d understand what had happened, how and why.</p><p>As she lay on her bed, she heard the dog again. She sat up. He appeared by her side again, whining softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name!\u201d she told him, stroking the soft ears. \u201cMost people can\u2019t see you. Not even my friends\u2014though Jake can hear you\u2014but I can. I even feel how soft your fur is, even though you\u2019re a ghost dog.\u201d</p><p>The dog whined softly again. He wagged his tail.</p><p>She started, hearing a rap at her door. Angela\u2019s voice came to her quietly. \u201cWhitney, Jude is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>The fluttering of her heart alarmed her, and she smoothed down her shirt and her hair as if to soothe it. He\u2019d probably come about something to do with the case.</p><p>She left her room and walked calmly down the stairs. Jude was there in the hallway, watching the screens with the others. \u201cIt has to be something in the air. Or a chemical that seeped into the floor that only shows on your high-resolution film,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>The others didn\u2019t answer him. He didn\u2019t notice. He had seen her coming down.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything new?\u201d she asked him. He had looked perplexed at the station, as if he, too, had found the closure of the case to be anticlimactic.</p><p>He shook his head. And then his lips curled as he gave her the grin that never failed to start that electric sensation in her veins. \u201cI came to see if you wanted to go to dinner with me without having to discuss blood and murder\u2014or Jack the Ripper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angela and Jackson looked at her and smiled like a pair of tolerant parents. Jake emitted a cough and lowered his head, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, guess I should invite you all,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Jake stood up, laughing openly. \u201cRight. That\u2019s what you want. Go on, get out of here\u2014and just give us a call if it gets too late. Shoo, children!\u201d</p> <p>She looked at Jude. He had no answer for the others; he was looking back at her with humor in his gray eyes, and more\u2014the whatever that was between them that had made Jake laugh.</p><p>She met his gaze and smiled her acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019ll just get my purse.\u201d</p><p>She did so. Out in his car, he looked at her again. \u201cSteak, sushi, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mexican...what would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivacy,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He put the car into gear and headed straight for Hell\u2019s Kitchen. He\u2019d barely closed the door to his apartment before she turned into his arms.</p> <p>And he enveloped her in his.</p><p>His mouth was wonderful on hers, everything that she had expected and imagined. He could kiss with force and coercion, his mouth so firm but never hurtful. Just standing there, still fully clothed, she felt as if she shared a greater intimacy with a single kiss than she had known before in her life.</p><p>She felt his hands on her body, his fingers at the small buttons of her blouse. Their mouths were still locked when she touched his holstered gun and he touched hers, and they both laughed, and breathlessly removed the guns and their holsters.</p><p>They were still in the hallway, lips meeting and parting, some kisses long and deep, deliciously sloppy, hot and wet, and some brief as they parted to get a better hold on a button or a zipper. Whitney was half undressed when they heard a sound coming from the computer room.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell!\u201d Jude murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell!\u201d Whitney agreed, trying to rearrange her blouse.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jude protested. \u201cThe bedroom, go\u2014I\u2019ll send my father away!\u201d</p><p>She grabbed their guns and holsters and scurried through the apartment, listening to his voice, and hearing the sound of the door shutting between the two apartments. She hesitated in the hall, and plunged into a room. There had only been a choice of two; she\u2019d chosen correctly.</p><p>His room was lined with books, hardwood, art deco furnishings and a large bed that was covered with a black-and-crimson comforter. She set the holsters on the bedside table and turned, and as she did so, she found herself swept up and back in his arms, breathless, and heedless, her heart pounding and her body thrumming with expectation.</p><p>They plummeted to the bed together. Again he kissed her, trying to do away with the last of her buttons. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted this,\u201d he said hoarsely, \u201csince I first saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then, of course, we bonded\u2014over the autopsy table,\u201d she said, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cSince I first saw you,\u201d he repeated, pressing his lips to her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a liar. You thought I was an annoying college kid sent to darken your day.\u201d</p><p>He paused, shrugged and grinned. \u201cAll right, well, an annoying college kid, but...\u201d He paused, staring down into her eyes. \u201cA golden one. I wanted to touch you. To reach out and touch you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were really beautiful, too,\u201d she said softly, running her fingers softly over the hair on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cLiar, you thought I was an annoying macho cop,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cBut a damn good-looking one.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. His fingers entwined with hers as he leaned against her again, and their kiss then was long and passionate, filled with sweet liquid hunger. When they broke apart, they struggled with one another\u2019s clothing, as if neither could be freed from it quickly enough, as if the clothing burned, and only their naked flesh touching could ease the fire.</p><p>Not the case at all, Whitney thought, enlivened, awakened by the contact. She felt his heart, his breathing, the thrumming that seemed to pulse through his body as it did hers. He was everything she had imagined, long and hard and rock-muscled, so vibrant in his every move. Macho man, indeed. He seemed the leader in their urgent desire to be together, but she realized that it was only the hunger searing through him, and something of a desperate desire to please her, and make her want him as he wanted her. He need not try...</p><p>His mouth roamed her body and returned to her lips. She explored the length of his back, pressed her lips to his shoulders, delicately teased along his torso and slipped her fingers between them, cradling the rise of his erection. His body jerked and trembled, his lips found her flesh, her breasts, and he eased from her, moving down the length of her body. She trembled and undulated, and then writhed, feeling the pressure of his body on hers, and the seduction of his mouth and tongue. In seconds, a jolt ripped through her; she cried out, twisting, tugging him back into her arms, finding his mouth, and then his shoulders, feeling the jerk and ripple of his biceps and his abs, and the sheer sleek pleasure of his flesh.</p><p>In seconds they were entangled again, exploring and seeking one another\u2019s bodies, and then they rolled, and suddenly he was within her, and it was as if her mind and heart and soul stopped as one, and then began to tremble in the damp heat that arose between them, so slick and hungry and urgent. He knew how to tease and seduce, and how to give, and then give way when they reached that point where satiation was a thirst that had to be quenched. She climaxed at a point of delirium, and clung to him, feeling the volatile shudder of his body in the violence of his own, and she felt his arms around her, the coolness of the sheets and the sheen of perspiration that covered them both. And they lay entwined, he within her still, she wishing that they could remain so forever. It was long moments before he lifted her chin, met her eyes and brushed her lips with the whisper of a kiss.</p><p>\u201cGold,\u201d he told her. \u201cSpun gold.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSheer macho power!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a good way. Champagne?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cThat will do, but not yet,\u201d she told him, finding his lips again and rolling onto his chest. Her turn. She kissed his chest, lowered her liquid caresses and made love to him, teasing him, telling him not to move, until he had to move, cradling her to him, rolling again and again, and making love side to side, kissing and not, moving languidly and then again with the speed of light. When they lay at last, spent again, she found herself suddenly wondering at her abandon and passion, and whispering, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t do this...often.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and they lay there a moment. And then her grin faded. \u201cThat was so strange...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re supposed to say something like, wow, that was great, the best I ever had,\u201d Jude told her.</p><p>She smiled, touched his cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I mean, I have wanted...well, you, many a time in the last few days. But this has to be the best I\u2019ve ever had because it\u2019s the first time since I came to New York that I actually didn\u2019t think about the case!\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cBeer. We do get to celebrate, I believe. Case over. Done.\u201d He stood, untangling himself regretfully from her to do so. \u201cI actually am hungry. We can go to dinner at some point. Or call out for delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather like that idea,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jude grinned and left the room, easy and natural in his nakedness. She watched him go, and she thought again that he was a beautiful man, and she wondered, now that she knew him, if anyone could ever be the same. She didn\u2019t want to think about that; she didn\u2019t want to think about leaving New York. She didn\u2019t want to think about not seeing Jude.</p><p>She started, feeling something leap up on the bed.</p><p>Sitting up, she stared down the length of the sheets.</p><p>There was a cat there.</p><p>She blinked. It remained.</p><p>\u201cAre you real?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The cat let out a meow and padded its way toward her. She reached out. The cat came to her, happy to have its ears scratched. \u201cYou\u2019re real, right?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2019t be the person always haunted by animal ghosts, right? I can feel you, but I can feel the dog that comes to me at Blair House, the dog that led me to the bodies.\u201d</p><p>The cat allowed herself to be stroked, and then leaped off the bed and disappeared. Jude came back a moment later, carrying a wooden tray with two beer bottles and a plate of cheese and crackers.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much. If you\u2019re hungry, maybe I should call now. There\u2019s a great Chinese place just down on the corner that delivers.\u201d</p><p>Whitney reached for one of the beers and took a long swallow. She tried to speak naturally. \u201cDo you have a cat?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAllison. Was she in here? The bedroom is supposed to be off-limits. I\u2019m sorry\u2014hope you\u2019re not allergic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I love animals.\u201d She took another long swallow of her beer and sat up. She smiled for a moment. She wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d carried through on any of her intimate dreams and fantasies regarding Jude; she had certainly never imagined how easy it would be to sit cross-legged and naked with him on his bed, drinking beer and eating cheese and crackers.</p><p>But she noted that he was distracted again, and she didn\u2019t question him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just not as celebratory as we should be,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He looked at her, startled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Neither of us feels like the case is completed. What does Jackson have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson tends to be quiet and think things through,\u201d Whitney told him. \u201cHe said that he could see several scenarios. Men with wealth and power\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they can feel entitled. Or maybe Avery didn\u2019t feel so entitled. Maybe his finances weren\u2019t that hot, and everything was riding on this movie. The killer was organized, so maybe Angus Avery really did plan it all out, and those girls died the way they did with him having a very special agenda.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s the thing. The movie will sell like hot-cakes,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not completed, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014the producers will bring in a director to finish the movie. No one will let go of a box-office blockbuster like this is sure to be,\u201d Whitney assured him.</p> <p>Jude munched a cracker and then said thoughtfully, \u201cWell, Angus Avery was in the city when the first two girls were killed. He did have a motive, twisted as it might be. He knew the history of the House of Spiritualism, and he certainly had the kind of movie money at his disposal to get around. Anyone out there might have studied the Ripper case, and Carrie Brown is of historical note, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014it just doesn\u2019t sit right. It would have been easy enough, I think, for anyone to have slipped into the veterans\u2019 home\u2014it\u2019s open to visitors, and it\u2019s not a prison. They\u2019re still feeling their way on how to run the place. But whoever did this seemed familiar with police procedure. I suppose that Angus Avery could have worked with any number of police consultants over the years. And he would know that he had to kill quickly\u2014before a victim could scratch him, or get a hold of him in any way that would give us DNA. These days, I\u2019m sure, with the number of police-procedural shows, most people are aware that DNA can be a clincher in court. He would know, too, that the law would require due process...but so would anyone. Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t get as well\u2014he knew nothing about anatomy, as far as we can discover. Not that the Ripper murders were necessarily carried out by someone with real medical knowledge\u2014but the killer did know something about anatomy.\u201d</p><p>Whitney shrugged. \u201cMaybe he studied anatomy books?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cThing is, a lot of this is harder than some people realize. You need strength to strangle someone. You really need strength to nearly sever a human head.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOne of the limo drivers had to be involved. That, or the killer had to have an accomplice. There had to be some blood on him, and that costume would have been noticed in the subway\u2014even in New York.\u201d He took another long swig of his beer, and moved the tray onto the bedside table. He leaned toward her. \u201cThere\u2019s still work to be done, I\u2019m afraid, if I\u2019m going to accept all this. But, at least, I can pray that the murders will stop.\u201d</p> <p>Whitney nodded. She tried to shake off the somber mood of their discussion. \u201cI say we call in for Chinese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s great,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to phone Angela and let her know that I\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, stroking her cheek. \u201cCall Angela, and tell her that I\u2019ll have you back in the morning,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>It was an amazing night; the Chinese food was delicious. Whitney wasn\u2019t even sure what they ate. She teased him about being a cat person; he told her that cats were independent, and so, made very good pets. \u201cDogs are great animals, but they need a lot of attention,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Whitney thought about her ghost dog. \u201cThey give a lot of love,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThat may be true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut cats rule. And,\u201d he said, pulling her close to him, \u201cpeople can give devotion and love and all that, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot to mention really great sex?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t actually been an invitation, but he took it as such. When they were exhausted and replete again, it was late, and they both drifted off to sleep, still entangled with one another, as if they needed to connect forever.</p><p>But that night, Whitney dreamed. She was back in her room at Blair House, and she woke because the dog was tugging at her nightgown. She didn\u2019t want to waken, but she did. She sat up. The dog wasn\u2019t alone. Her room was filled with women. Annie Doherty stood at the front of the group, her eyes sad and entreating. Behind her were other women; at first, she thought that they were all in period dress. But then she realized that there were four who were not. She recognized the face that Jake Mallory had created on the computer, the face of Sarah Larson. And there was Virginia Rockford, and behind her, Melody Tatum. And in the far corner, Jane Doe dry, the girl who still had no name.</p><p>One by one, they turned and started out of the room.</p><p>The dog remained, tugging at her nightgown, whining and thudding his tail. She was supposed to follow, she knew.</p><p>They led her down the stairs and out of the house, and the night was misty and dark. They walked down the block, and she could see faint lines, as if of a movie projection in the air, where the House of Spiritualism had once stood. And she could see the maw of the foundation.</p> <p>Down to the depths, where the darkness writhed. It was the same shapeless...shape that they had seen on their screens.</p><p>Whitney didn\u2019t understand what she was supposed to see\u2014the bodies of the women murdered at the House of Spiritualism had been discovered; the bodies of the current victims were at the morgue as well.</p><p>But there was something else there. And she was supposed to find it.</p><p>She felt as if the abyss were sucking her in, as if she were moving on some kind of astral plane in that direction.</p><p>She paused. The shadow rose from the ground and took form\u2014the silhouette of a man in a cloak and a tall hat, and he held a long-bladed knife. She saw a woman walking near him, and saw the man reach out, and he jerked her against his form, his one hand choking her...</p><p>She began to slump against him.</p><p>He ripped the knife against her throat, and shadow blood began to spurt from the wound.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud screeching noise burst upon her. She awoke, startled, not sure where she was.</p><p>She felt warm arms around her; naked flesh, powerful arms.</p><p>\u201cJust the phone,\u201d Jude said, rising by her side and fumbling on the nightstand for his phone.</p><p>He answered it. \u201cCrosby.\u201d</p><p>His features went taut, his mouth pursed into a grim line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the way,\u201d he said.</p><p>Whitney stared at him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another victim\u2014off Broadway. Her throat was slashed, probably half an hour ago now. She was discovered by one of the police officers patrolling the area. The blood was still oozing from her throat and her body was still warm.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Just like Elizabeth Stride, the fourth victim of Jack the Ripper. This woman\u2019s throat had been slit, but there was no sign of any mutilation on her body. The officer had come upon the killer, and interrupted him before he could carry out any further atrocity.</p><p>Hunched down by the body, Jude felt numb and dull as Dr. Fullbright performed his cursory inspection of the victim before the body was taken for autopsy.</p><p>Could he have stopped this anyway? Doubtful.</p><p>But he stood, searching the street. He looked over at Sayer, who was standing quietly about five feet away.</p><p>\u201cEllis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d Ellis said quietly, \u201cI have our entire task force and half the beat police in the city walking the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a second murder,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a second murder very soon, and when we find that body, it will be more horribly mutilated. This killer is definitely imitating the past closely, and the women in the Victorian East End were killed within the hour\u2014the double event. Someone else is going to die soon\u2014if he hasn\u2019t chosen his second victim already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she died just minutes before 1:00 a.m.,\u201d Fullbright announced. He looked up at Jude. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t really need me here to know that\u2014Officer Grayson walked this street at a quarter to one and walked it again thirty minutes later and found Miss Laurie Thibault.\u201d</p><p>Jude felt as if he could barely stand still; he was powerless, and he loathed the killer with a frightening vengeance. They were being played, and in a city the size of New York, there was little that he could do about it. Hundreds of police officers were now searching the area.</p><p>They knew the victim\u2019s name because her handbag was still over her shoulder. She had performed in a burlesque show running in a tent near South Street Seaport, according to the flyers in her handbag. Since her cell phone was in her bag as well, they\u2019d been able to call the director of the show, who had already told them that they\u2019d been to a party at the Ritz downtown; she had left to get a cab home at eleven-thirty, and no one knew what had happened from there.</p><p>Jackson stood near him; he had already assessed the body. Whitney was at his side. The rest of the team was with the police, searching the area and desperately trying to stop the next murder.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Whitney gasped suddenly.</p><p>Jackson looked at her, waiting. Jude walked to her, taking her by the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThe construction site!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe have cameras in there\u2014we\u2019ve observed from the beginning,\u201d Jackson said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThe next victim won\u2019t be down in the deep section. We\u2019ll find her somewhere along the chain-link fence.\u201d</p><p>She turned, hurrying down Broadway. Jude, Ellis and Jackson followed her.</p><p>Jude damned the city for not having brighter lights in the area. Budget cuts, he thought resentfully. Running, he saw that there was some kind of dark blob on the sidewalk. A chill swept through him.</p><p>She had been right. Whitney had been right.</p><p>He got ahead of her, calling out for the others to stay back.</p><p>The woman lay on her back, her arms fallen to the side. Her palms were upward, and her fingers were slightly curled.</p><p>Jude hunched down. His hands were already gloved. He didn\u2019t touch her to see if she was alive\u2014it was more than evident that she was not. Her one leg was crossed over her body; her abdomen was sliced open, and her organs had been ripped out and arranged around the body.</p><p>He steeled himself and took a deep breath.</p><p>How in the hell had the killer managed what he had at this time? The place was crawling with cops, and there were lights everywhere now...</p><p>He had functioned by sleight of hand, Jude thought. While all the attention had been at the first murder scene, he had carried out his gruesome mutilations. He\u2019d had to have known as well that he would be in extreme danger of being caught. Perhaps that had made it all a greater thrill for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The double event. The killer had gone for the double event on the night that Angus Avery had been under house arrest. The body of this woman lay identical in pose and mutilation to that of Catherine Eddowes, fourth Ripper victim. When the autopsy was performed, he knew the findings would be nearly exact.</p><p>She was warm.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been dead long.</p> <p>He spoke into his radio mouthpiece. \u201cGet Fullbright over here. Get him over here now. And get every man on the street moving. Subways, alleys\u2014set up a roadblock along Broadway. I don\u2019t care if we bring the entire city to a halt.\u201d</p><p>He stood, feeling as if his veins and muscles were made of ice, as if he had grown very old. Then he walked over to where the others were standing a distance from the body. \u201cEllis, stay with Fullbright, please. Keep every available person searching the streets. Somewhere nearby, we\u2019re going to find the words The Juwes are not the men to be blamed for nothing written over a doorway\u2014and there will be a bloody piece of our victim\u2019s clothing beneath it.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the street. He stood and started walking. A bit in the distance, he could see the spire of Trinity church. He considered himself a decently spiritual man, if not a religious one. At that moment, he wished he could go into the church, fall on his knees and beg God to send them all a miracle.</p><p>He started for the church, but then he paused.</p><p>He knew where he would find the writing.</p> <p>Whitney must have read his mind.</p><p>\u201cBlair House,\u201d she said from behind him.</p><p>They were both right; the gate to the house was open. They didn\u2019t need to speak to one another to remember to touch nothing.</p><p>On the porch lay a bloody strip of fabric, ripped from the last victim\u2019s skirt.</p><p>And over the door of Blair House was written in chalk the words that Jude had just said.</p><p>The Juwes are not the men to be blamed for nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get Forensics,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need several teams out here on the streets tonight. No one sleeps.\u201d</p><p>If the city had been in a panic before, it was afire now.</p><p>The papers and media carried nothing but information on the New York murders, and the hotels in Lower Manhattan were emptying.</p><p>Angus Avery screamed for his freedom, demanding that he be set free from his electronic monitor.</p><p>But because of the evidence against him, Deputy Chief Green could continue to hold him; it was more than possible that the murders had been committed by more than one person, and that Avery\u2019s accomplice had purposely timed the double event when he was under monitor and guard, therefore trying to prove his innocence.</p><p>Jude spent the day at the station reinterviewing every possible suspect and witness. He had in Captain Tyler and Major Radison, as well. He had in the best possible sketch artist, and he gave the sketch to both Hannah and Jake Mallory, and both returned the typical Victorian gaslight picture of the Ripper, excellent 3-D images.</p><p>He questioned both men further about the killer\u2019s face.</p><p>Captain Tyler proved to be no help. He hadn\u2019t seen the man\u2019s face; he had only seen the figure at a distance. Nor had his memory returned about anyone having been in his room. He\u2019d had some water before he went to sleep...he often did when he could. But he hadn\u2019t seen anyone in his room.</p> <p>Major Radison gave the question of the man\u2019s face deep thought. \u201cIt was very odd,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOdd how?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>\u201cLike\u2014blank. As if he was wearing some kind of Venetian carnival mask,\u201d Major Radison said after a minute. \u201cAs if there was really nothing there, just a white face with no expression and nothing...live about it. Nothing real at all.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat back, drumming his fingers on the table. A mask. That brought him back to costumes and make-believe\u2014the movies.</p><p>But it was true that Angus Avery had not left his apartment during the night. His ankle monitor had not gone off. Any device could be hacked, Jude knew, but several cops had been watching the director\u2019s place. It would have been damn hard for them all to be crooked.</p><p>He allowed the old soldiers who had tried valiantly to help to return to the veterans\u2019 home. They had become good friends, so it seemed, in the time they had been at the police station. Trying to help had seemed to strengthen them both, and Tyler was mortified that he couldn\u2019t help more. Jenna, at the station with Jackson, Whitney and Jake, assured the captain that he had done a great deal for them, and it was not his fault that he could remember nothing\u2014it had been the drug.</p><p>He had Mrs. Allie Lipton, the wardrobe mistress from the movie set, brought in. At first, she stubbornly denied having made any mistake on her calculations; she knew that Angus Avery was strict. He had to stay on budget. He wouldn\u2019t stay on budget by having to replace costumes stolen by two-bit extras.</p><p>But then he asked her why one of the limo drivers had had to go to a fabric store.</p><p>She was an older woman, plump, somewhere over fifty. He saw her hesitate, though she quickly gathered her wits and said, \u201cCostumes are always tearing, and I\u2019m always mending something. He went for patches, thread, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, a receipt was turned in. I\u2019ll get a copy of that receipt,\u201d Jude told her. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have it, believe me, I\u2019ll track down your purchase.\u201d</p><p>She sat very still, and then her lower lip began to tremble. \u201cOne of the cloaks disappeared\u2014they\u2019re actually caped coats, you know\u2014regular coats with sleeves, and then a short cape over the shoulders. I didn\u2019t dare tell the director. He would have said it was my fault. And I could swear that every extra on the set returned his or her costume. I could swear it! Avery would have fired me for not having control. I can\u2019t get jobs as easily as I used to\u2014you\u2019ve got to believe me, Detective, the movies are run by the young.\u201d</p><p>Jude stared at her. He wanted to tell her that her lie might have cost lives, but it wouldn\u2019t have been true\u2014they had suspected that the killer\u2019s period costume had come from the movie set.</p><p>\u201cWhen did the cloak disappear?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAt the shoot at the construction site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no\u2014two weeks before that,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe\u2019d been working on Staten Island. That\u2019s when the cloak disappeared. I didn\u2019t try to replace it until we had the same number of extras working again. That\u2019s why...that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t believe that its disappearance could be related to the killing that night. And the papers said that there were Jack the Ripper victims, but they didn\u2019t say that anyone had actually seen Jack the Ripper walking around. Please, please, you can\u2019t tell Mr. Avery. Of course, Mr. Avery has a court date now, but...oh, he couldn\u2019t have anything to do with this! Detective, I know that you have this information, but, please, please, please, don\u2019t report me to the powers that be at the movie company. I used my own money to buy the fabric to replace the cloak. Please.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for Allie Lipton. \u201cI need the information for our investigation, Mrs. Lipton. I\u2019m not the movie police.\u201d</p><p>He let her go; she could return to work. Apparently, the assistant director was filming action shots that day with the film\u2019s stunt performers.</p><p>Sherry Blanco came back in, her lawyer in tow this time. Jude was surprised, but he had nothing against the lawyer sitting in.</p><p>\u201cMiss Blanco, we\u2019re not accusing you of anything, but I\u2019m afraid that you were working with a murderer at some point during this film,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked at her lawyer, and then at Jude. \u201cI told you, and I don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t understand this. I don\u2019t know the extras. Sometimes I don\u2019t even see the extras.\u201d She sat back, shaking her head, and then she leaned forward again. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to pull any kind of...rank here, but I\u2019m the star. Stars don\u2019t have to know the extras, or even the bit players. I don\u2019t eat with the others, I don\u2019t get warm and chummy with the others. And, hey, I\u2019m not a nasty person. I do make friends, but you have to realize, people want to use me, too. I have to keep my distance.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She wasn\u2019t going to give him anything. He was going to give her something to think about. \u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s good. Because the killer could still be working on your set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arrested Angus Avery, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo women were killed last night, remember?\u201d Jude countered.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should let Angus go,\u201d she said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. And maybe he has been working with someone. Killers who work together have certainly caused a great deal of death and agony over the years. But you are the star. I guess you don\u2019t have to worry, walking out of your trailer or getting into a limo.\u201d</p><p>She turned white.</p><p>\u201cDetective!\u201d her lawyer snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes? Can you point out what\u2019s untrue about my words?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her attorney wasn\u2019t a fool. He stood, drawing her up by the elbow. \u201cMy client isn\u2019t under arrest. She has answered all your questions, and we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>Jude stood and smiled. \u201cThank you so much. Enjoy your day, Miss Blanco.\u201d</p><p>When they left, he discovered that Deputy Chief Green wanted to see him in the lab. He knew that Whitney and Jake had been at the computers all day with Hannah, searching for any trigger in the background of any possible suspect or major player in the case. But he and Jackson weren\u2019t heading to the computers; they were off to see Judith Garner in the lab.</p><p>As they walked to the lab, Jude again felt a sinking feeling.</p><p>\u201cA letter\u2014we\u2019ve received a letter,\u201d he said, seeing Green. In London, back in the day of Jack the Ripper, the police had received hundreds of letters from those wanting to solve the case, and those convinced they were, or knew, Jack the Ripper.</p><p>Green nodded grimly. \u201cIn the mail, postmarked Lower Manhattan,\u201d Green told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s an exact copy of the letter sent to George Lusk, head of the Whitechapel Vigilante Committee\u2014the \u2018From Hell\u2019 letter. It\u2019s one of the few letters they considered not to be fake, am I correct?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are,\u201d the deputy chief told him. \u201cIt\u2019s not a photocopy, or out of a copier. The killer forged the handwriting. And,\u201d he added painfully, \u201cit came from a tissue we believe to belong to the second victim last night.\u201d</p><p>In the lab, Judith Garner had the letter under glass as she prepared it for the many tests she would do. She greeted Jude with tight grim lips. \u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He read the letter; he\u2019d seen the copy at Scotland Yard, but he hadn\u2019t memorized it. Odd to think that once, he\u2019d thought of the Jack the Ripper case as little more than a social commentary, when he was learning about law enforcement, and a lesson in the improvement of law enforcement and new techniques in investigative tools over the years.</p> <p>But he could remember the letter, and the words were the same, just as the stains on the paper seemed to be the same.</p><p>From hell</p><p>Mr. Lusk</p><p>Sor</p><p>I send you half the Kidne I took from one woman and prasarved it for you the tother piece I fried and at it was very nise. I may send you the bloody knif that took it out if you only wate a whil longer.</p> <p>Signed</p><p>Catch me when you can Mishter Lusk</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dancing around us, Jude. He\u2019s making a mockery of one of the finest police departments in the county,\u201d Green said.</p><p>Jude opted not to remind him that he hadn\u2019t been entirely convinced that they had finished with the arrest of Angus Avery. They still had a killer out there.</p><p>He looked at Judith. \u201cAnd the tissue that came with it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHuman kidney,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet if it will prove to have belonged to our second victim from last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have anything else?\u201d he asked her hopefully.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she protested, \u201cI found the trace on the coat. My team found the blood in the limo. And I\u2019m still working on that hundred-dollar-bill you gave me. So far, I\u2019ve found a lot of cocaine, and fingerprints on top of fingerprints. We\u2019re still sorting them all out, but even then, we\u2019re going to have to go through hundreds and hundreds. We\u2019ve worked around the clock in here, too, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know, Judith. Thank you.\u201d He looked at Deputy Chief Green. \u201cI want to get Bobby Walden back in for questioning, too. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come in with an attorney this time. And the team has been out at the garage where the limos are serviced and parked, but I want to see the place myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all going to have to wait. Fullbright is expecting you in autopsy,\u201d Green told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through every extra hired by the movie company,\u201d Hannah said, leaning her head on the computer. \u201cI studied the records of two hundred people. I found two medical students, but both were indisputably on duty at the hospital last night and the night that Virginia Rockford was killed. I searched out every record on Harold Patterson, the high-class pimp, and he\u2019s never even had surgery. I\u2019ve gone through records and alibis until I can\u2019t see anymore,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re actually looking in the wrong direction,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Both Hannah and Jake looked at her, frowning.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cThe killer seems to know something about anatomy. He\u2019d have to\u2014right? Not like a doctor, but at least like a butcher. But we think he also knows something about law enforcement and crime scene investigation. All things easily obtainable online these days\u2014but, as we all know, online information isn\u2019t always reliable, and crime shows and books are works of fiction. This guy has been really good. The first two murders\u2014not the accepted five Ripper murders, but the ones we have in the files\u2014might have been practice for him. Especially with Sarah Larson\u2014 Jane Doe wet. Maybe he messed up, and maybe he was afraid that he had left some kind of evidence on her, and that\u2019s why she went in the water. She was there at least a week, and her body was sorely compromised. With the woman who is still Jane Doe, he was careful and lucky\u2014no one did miss her, but the way that she was stabbed, it was doubtful that, had she lived, she would have ever been able to speak. They weren\u2019t just victims he used to follow the Jack the Ripper path\u2014they were experiments for him. And, I could be way off base, but who would understand forensic science and crime detection better than a cop or some kind of a crime scene official?\u201d</p> <p>Jake and Hannah stared at her. \u201cDo you know how many people you\u2019re talking about?\u201d Hannah asked woefully.</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cNo. She\u2019s on to something. He hesitated. \u201cWhat about that detective\u2014Ellis Sayer? He seems to follow a little too closely in Jude\u2019s wake. Perhaps he\u2019s someone who wants to be a bigger part of the case than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllis Sayer?\u201d Hannah said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cJust give a look,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Ellis!\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we should investigate,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>They did. And they could find nothing on him other than the fact that he had been with the police force over twenty years, climbing the ranks through hard work and commendations.</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know where he was at the time of the murders,\u201d Jake pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe was always available after,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cJake, look through all that and see if he ever did any work in film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllis?\u201d Hannah asked. \u201cYou must be joking!\u201d</p><p>They looked.</p><p>They found no film connection, and no medical training\u2014and no work at a grocery store, butcher shop or any place that might have taught him a thing about anatomy.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2014go back a page!\u201d Jake told Hannah.</p><p>She frowned and clicked a button. \u201cWe\u2019re on Facebook, Jake\u2014what do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the side there\u2014\u2018friends\u2019 pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in a play!\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a college production of Hamlet,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t hang him on a college theatrical,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I guess he bears watching,\u201d Whitney murmured.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jake agreed. \u201cYou know who else takes anatomy classes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Whitney and Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cArt students,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Hannah groaned and threw herself at the computer.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Jake said, rubbing her back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to really look into the NYPD,\u201d Whitney said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to sit here, on an NYPD computer, and keep looking up a bunch of detectives and officers who could get really pissed and get me fired?\u201d Hannah demanded in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it from Blair House,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cThere are cops all around Blair House,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be safe,\u201d Jake said with a grin.</p><p>Whitney frowned. \u201cJude is attending at the morgue. Autopsy is scheduled for the double-event victims today,\u201d she reminded them.</p><p>They both looked at her.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me just one moment,\u201d she said. She stepped aside and called Jude\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said when he answered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he returned. He sounded weary and dejected.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to autopsy?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI attended the others,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cSleep with a cop, and all of a sudden he doesn\u2019t want to call you for an autopsy.\u201d</p><p>She hoped that she had brought at least a flicker of a grin to his lips. \u201cWhitney, I don\u2019t think that I even need to be there\u2014I know what Fullbright will find. No trace, no evidence. The first victim will have strangulation marks, and her throat will have been slashed nearly ear to ear\u2014like Elizabeth Stride. The second victim is going to have the same mutilations as Ripper victim Catherine Eddowes. I\u2019m going to go and spend several hours and watch the horrible cruelty that an intelligent, narcissistic psychopath can inflict on another human being. I\u2019m not sure I should be wasting my time. We\u2019re missing something. We\u2019re missing something that we should see clearly, and I just need to go over and over all the records and notes that we have.\u201d He was silent a moment. \u201cDo me a favor, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this killer sees us. He knows all of us who are cops, and he sure as hell knew that an FBI team was staying at Blair House. Be careful. Be really careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrol cars are prowling all around Blair House, Jude. It\u2019s probably the safest place in the world right now. And you do know that I carry a gun, right? But, actually, you just gave me an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her voice. \u201cWe were going to head to Blair House to check out the NYPD, but I think I\u2019ve just had a better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe NYPD,\u201d he said thoughtfully once she\u2019d explained. \u201cSomeone on the inside. That\u2019s a terrifying thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re grasping at straws, maybe. But we knew from the beginning that it was a mammoth haystack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the idea I gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop in on your father.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Fullbright wasn\u2019t horrified; he was fascinated. \u201cIt\u2019s uncanny,\u201d he told Jude. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely uncanny, the way this killer has replicated the past.\u201d</p><p>Jude stood silently. The body on the table was hardly recognizable as a woman. The killer had slashed her earlobes and her face. He had carried out the mutilations in very little time. He had planned it all carefully. He had staked out his victims, and he had somehow coerced them to meet him, or he had stumbled upon them.</p><p>No, he had selected his victims. He had gone to the strip club and selected Sarah Larson, a woman who had longed to be a Broadway dancer. He had selected Melody Tatum, paying cash to make sure that he\u2019d have a woman where he wanted her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was attending burlesque shows, seeking those who might tend to be for sale.</p><p>He had money\u2014he had paid cash for Melody.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can tell me that can help me find the man killing these women? I don\u2019t need a lecture\u2014I\u2019ve seen the Ripper files,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>Fullbright looked at him, confused. \u201cJude, her clothing is over at the lab. I haven\u2019t anything on the body. We\u2019re in serious trouble when he decides to take his next victim. He\u2019ll emulate the murder of Mary Kelly, and you\u2019ll recall, he killed her at her apartment. He took his time, and he wallowed in a complete bloodbath.\u201d</p><p>Jude turned on his heel and left. He kept thinking about Whitney\u2019s suggestion that they might be dealing with someone in law enforcement. Someone who knew what the task force workers were doing\u2014and how to avoid them.</p><p>It was a thought he didn\u2019t want to consider.</p><p>He looked at his watch; he wanted to get out to the garage, and he wanted an interview with Bobby Walden. He decided to deal with Bobby first, but when he checked with Ellis Sayer, Ellis told him that he\u2019d been trying to pin down Bobby Walden all day.</p><p>\u201cHe was supposed to be filming some kind of a gang scene today, and he said that he wanted nothing more than to cooperate with the police, but he wouldn\u2019t be finished until five. Want me to get up to the set? I\u2019m at the garage now. And you\u2019re going to want to see this. It\u2019s the most piss-poor security I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014there\u2019s a gate where the cars come in and out and register. And then there\u2019s a back fence with a gaping hole in it a mile wide. Anyone who knew where the keys were kept in the office could have walked through the fence and taken one of the cars out. Management has apparently planned on fixing it for months, but they just haven\u2019t gotten to it\u2014never had any kind of trouble before, so they say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake sure someone goes through all the cameras from the Brooklyn Bridge because I believe they might have caught something. The car had to have come back over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve done that,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we found the car on the film, but we\u2019ve enhanced and enhanced, and you can\u2019t see a face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tags\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuddied, front and back. We couldn\u2019t even go into court and verify it was the same car,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThis is the most organized killer I\u2019ve ever come across,\u201d he said. \u201cI know my job, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up to the set,\u201d Jude told Ellis. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring Jackson Crow with me. Maybe he can tell me if there\u2019s something strange I don\u2019t sense in any of the actors up there. Keep working the garage\u2014look for anything that can help us.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, realizing that he didn\u2019t want Ellis questioning Bobby Walden. Ellis? He couldn\u2019t let himself become paranoid. Logic, timing.</p> <p>Good old Ellis wasn\u2019t a killer. Unless he could teleport.</p><p>He still wished that Monty wasn\u2019t in the hospital.</p><p>And he realized that, since he\u2019d spoken to Whitney, he suddenly mistrusted everyone. That was no way to run a task force, and yet, maybe it was the way that he had to be.</p><p>Andrew Crosby said it was fine for the little trio to come over when Whitney called him. He didn\u2019t question their motives.</p><p>But, first, they stopped by Blair House for Jake\u2019s laptop so that they could access his codes and programs. The street had reopened, but the police presence in front of the House of Spiritualism site and Blair House was still heavy. Will had remained at Blair House that day, following the police proceedings and studying the markings on the wall. Angela was with him, going through the film from the night before in hopes that one of the cameras might have caught something. They had both agreed that it would be good for the three of them to settle into Andrew\u2019s house for the afternoon, especially if they intended to look up records on New York\u2019s finest.</p><p>Whitney told Angela that as ridiculous as it might sound, she was wondering about Ellis Sayer.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it is curious, the way he was the one to find Captain Tyler. And it is curious that Captain Tyler was kidnapped from the veterans\u2019 hospital\u2014and that Ellis found him wearing the coat,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll get him over here later tonight,\u201d Angela said. \u201cWith just Jude, if we\u2019re growing suspicious of everyone else. I don\u2019t like to believe that the culprit could be a cop or an agent. But we can\u2019t eliminate any possibilities.\u201d</p> <p>Angela watched her curiously as she spoke. \u201cHey, help me out in the kitchen for just a minute before you leave, will you?\u201d she asked, \u201cHannah, you and Jake don\u2019t need Whitney if you\u2019re only going to grab a computer, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>Angela drew Whitney into the kitchen and leaned against the counter. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to you last night. You knew where the second victim in the double event was going to be found. How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Angela, I was having the nicest evening of my life, and then I fell asleep. I dreamed I was here at Blair House, and the dog came to me\u2014and all the victims. They led me back to the foundations of the old House of Spiritualism. And that thing\u2014that seething black shadow we keep seeing on film\u2014rose and became a silhouette of the movie image of the Ripper. I think...that the old ghosts were trying to warn me, except that others were with them\u2014Sarah, Jane Doe\u2014she didn\u2019t give me her real name\u2014Melody and Virginia Rockford. Somehow, it goes back to the site. I wish I could figure out how!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to visit the site again,\u201d Angela said. \u201cAnd you need to pay heed to that dog. He led you right to his mistress\u2019s grave site\u2014and to the other skeletons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut last night was a dream, Angela. When we found the skeletons, I was awake when the dog came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out what that site has to tell us,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>Jake stuck his head into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve got the laptop.\u201d He arched his brow. \u201cYou need more time?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s go on over to Andrew Crosby\u2019s apartment,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cYou never know what he may have to tell us.\u201d</p><p>The cast and crew of O\u2019Leary\u2019s was valiantly struggling on, a man in a sweatshirt bearing the title of the movie informed Jude and Jackson. He was one of the film\u2019s executive producers, Griffin Byrd. They were having the assistant director work with crowd scenes that day, and they weren\u2019t avoiding Lower Manhattan, they were merely choosing sites to the north because there was obviously more space. Or so he put it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Angus Avery is guilty and, of course, he has our support,\u201d Griffin told them. \u201cThis business is terrible\u2014absolutely terrible. But you\u2019ve had our cooperation all the way. We were out of the Broadway site before the investigation really began, and we\u2019ve opened our props and costumes to the police, and the sets, of course. To our knowledge, everyone has cooperated fully. Sherry wasn\u2019t on the shooting schedule today, and I understand that she did come into the station. Bobby is just finishing a gang scene. I\u2019ll have him in here\u2014\u201d he paused to indicate the trailer where they sat, apparently Byrd\u2019s on-set office \u201c\u2014to speak with you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Byrd, if I were you, I\u2019d shut down production until this situation is solved,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not me\u2014shutting down would cost us millions,\u201d Byrd said.</p><p>\u201cI thought this started out as a low-cost production,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Byrd seemed to smirk at him. \u201cYes, that is millions,\u201d Byrd said.</p><p>Jude forced himself to smile. \u201cMr. Byrd, the killer dressed up in a costume from this set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you arrested Angus Avery, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Byrd responded.</p><p>\u201cMind if we watch the filming?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Byrd frowned, as if that was a confusing question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a closed set\u2014there\u2019s been so much publicity,\u201d Byrd said.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m FBI,\u201d Jackson said politely. \u201cAnd Detective Crosby is NYPD. We\u2019re hardly your customary gawkers.\u201d</p><p>Byrd apparently wasn\u2019t happy, but he couldn\u2019t think of a sound reason to refuse.</p><p>Jude was glad they had come out; the scene had just finished shooting, and Bobby Walden seemed to be hurrying away from the office.</p><p>\u201cMr. Walden!\u201d Jude called.</p><p>Still in costume, breeches and a drab gray poet\u2019s shirt, Bobby paused. He turned back slowly, and then waved to them. \u201cHey, I was just going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only need a few minutes,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>A score of extras was walking behind the facade; flats that had nothing behind them except for the costume and prop tents that had been set up. The camera people were pulling equipment, and techs were running around as well, closing down for the day.</p><p>Bobby strode toward them. He smoothed back a handful of dark hair. \u201cBummer, huh? Who\u2019d have figured old Angus, eh? And I guess he really was innocent\u2014or had an accomplice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we use your trailer?\u201d Jackson inquired of Griffin Byrd, making certain that his tone implied that they wished to interview Bobby alone.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. I\u2019m just in from the West Coast, gentlemen, so you\u2019ll forgive me if I leave you for the day? I\u2019m always available,\u201d Byrd assured them.</p><p>Jude glanced at Jackson, and he knew that they were thinking on similar lines.</p><p>Byrd didn\u2019t give a damn about any of the actors. He was a money man. He\u2019d help the police; he\u2019d hand over his own mother if that meant saving the movie.</p><p>Bobby came into the trailer and threw himself on the sofa, as if he were a nineteenth-century tough. He stared at them. \u201cGuess you guys had something wrong, though, huh, what with what happened last night. There you go\u2014another major bummer.\u201d</p><p>Jude realized he didn\u2019t like Bobby. He really didn\u2019t like Bobby Walden. But that didn\u2019t mean that he was guilty of anything other than being a self-serving prick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBobby, we know that a cloak was stolen from wardrobe on this movie set, and worn by the killer who attacked Virginia Rockford,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Bobby stared back at him, a flash of confusion in his eyes. \u201cYeah\u2014it was worn by Angus Avery. I thought that was what you all figured.\u201d He sat up suddenly. \u201cThey don\u2019t include details on the news. Were the other women\u2014the women killed last night\u2014all chopped up?\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t answer. \u201cBobby, do you realize that if you know anything at all, you could be charged as an accessory to murder? And if you can help us and you don\u2019t, other people can still die.\u201d</p> <p>Bobby\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know a damn thing. And if another woman is murdered, it\u2019s because you\u2019re inept.\u201d He stood. \u201cCatch me if you can\u2014isn\u2019t that what Jack the Ripper wrote when the London police couldn\u2019t find a bull\u2019s-eye ten feet in front of them? If a cloak was missing, and it was found with Angus\u2019s DNA or whatever, you\u2019ve got your answer. Oh, but wait\u2014Angus didn\u2019t kill anybody last night, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night, Bobby?\u201d Jude asked him.</p><p>\u201cOn set until seven\u2014and my limo driver took me home. My doorman saw me go in, and I promise you, he didn\u2019t see me go out,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>\u201cSo, you were home alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I was with a young lady. And if you want me to say more, you\u2019ll have to speak to my attorney. I don\u2019t kiss and tell. Why the hell would you suspect me? I\u2019m a star!\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cMay I change out of my costume now? It\u2019s been a long day!\u201d</p> <p>15</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a reference to the Cult of Satan,\u201d Andrew said, bringing a book over to the desk where Whitney was sitting.</p><p>Jake and Hannah were busy at the computer. Since it was awkward for them all to stare at the screen\u2014and Hannah and Jake were experts, and she was not\u2014 Whitney determined to let Andrew delve through his collection of books on New York history and tell her more about New York\u2019s past.</p><p>He produced a book. \u201cI just read through this earlier. I\u2019d heard rumor the Cult of Satan had a secret sign, see there\u2014it was the emblem of Gilles de Rais.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe serial killer who abused and murdered children\u2014hundreds of them\u2014in fifteenth-century France,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve actually tossed his name around a few times since this all began.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s his coat of arms, with the blue edge and the fleur-de-lis. It was used as an emblem by the Cult of Satan. They would embroider it somewhere on their clothing, and show it to one another, because they didn\u2019t want their beliefs known. That book is on the cult. I guess it\u2019s not shocking. Life in Five Points must have been miserable, and poverty always breeds violence in one way or another. I suspect that the House of Spiritualism began as a place for tarot card readers and spiritualists, but Jonathan Black did move in and take over. Well, you\u2019ve found the women he sacrificed. After I talked to you on the phone I looked up what I could find on the place, but there really wasn\u2019t much more. Except that I thought you might find this interesting. Satanists also valued reliquaries.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany religious tenets respect reliquaries,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about that as well\u2014that a modern killer might be worshipping the body\u2014or fragment\u2014in a locket or a reliquary of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I think you were on the right track all along, and this may help you. In this book I discovered that Jonathan Black was rumored to have had an exceptionally \u2018holy\u2019 relic, if you will. He had a finger bone that had belonged to none other than Gilles de Rais.\u201d</p><p>Whitney stared at him. \u201cAnd our killer knew, after more than three centuries, that he had the finger bone of Gilles de Rais?\u201d</p><p>Andrew smiled. \u201cIrish and Catholic here, Whitney. We believe in our relics, no matter how many years have passed. We cherish splinters of what we believe to be the true holy cross. It wouldn\u2019t be that different for a Satanist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. We\u2019ve talked about that, but I hadn\u2019t imagined anything so specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t know anything\u2014it\u2019s a theory.\u201d</p><p>Whitney was thoughtful. She let out a sigh. \u201cA good one. Jonathan Black was supposedly killed and buried at the site when he scared even his own followers? I wonder if they saw all those women die\u2014and began to wonder if they might be next.\u201d</p><p>Hannah came rushing into the office. \u201cGuess what we found out?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cDr. Wallace Fullbright has often been consulted for films and television. And, tada! He\u2019s worked as an extra in seven movies in the last ten years!\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Jake said, coming in behind her, \u201cwe missed something in the records the other day. We didn\u2019t go back far enough. Ellis Sayer worked as a vet\u2019s assistant during his high school years. He could have assisted at many a surgery. Mammalian anatomy is pretty similar, when you\u2019re talking mainly cats and dogs. Not to mention the fact that the man has attended dozens of autopsy operations.\u201d</p><p>Jude and Jackson met up with the team and Hannah at the house at around seven; he was tired and hungry.</p><p>He listened to Jake and Hannah\u2019s new evidence. \u201cNo, we can let Ellis off the hook,\u201d Jude said, leaning back on the sofa, closing his eyes and gratefully taking a long swallow of his beer.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jude, I know you work with the man\u2014\u201d Jake began.</p><p>Jude opened his eyes and looked at Jake, grimacing. \u201cI don\u2019t deny that anyone can wear a mask, that we only think we really know people. But Ellis showed up too quickly on the scene to have carried out the last murders, at least, those which were carried out while Angus Avery was locked up. Ellis was with the first body last night when we found the second. The killer works with amazing speed, but Ellis couldn\u2019t have been where he was that fast. And I don\u2019t want to shoot down any theories, but Fullbright was at the morgue until he was called to the scene. I saw him arrive in the morgue vehicle. Hell, Fullbright is so excited about this rather than appalled, it has chilled my bones. But he\u2019s an M.E., and really good at what he does, and a body is a challenging puzzle to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, you\u2019ve got to realize that what you\u2019re saying is true\u2014and not true. Ellis Sayer had a right to be there with the body. Fullbright would have had the opportunity to destroy trace evidence on the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say it\u2019s one of the actors on the movie,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being fair!\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>They all looked at her.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend has been an extra on movies. And he\u2019s the nicest guy in the world. You\u2019re being cruel to actors,\u201d Hannah said.</p><p>\u201cHannah, actors are fine people. Many are nice. Some may be crazy,\u201d Jude said patiently. He sighed deeply. \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t believe the timing would have allowed Fullbright or Ellis Sayer to have been involved. But I\u2019m close to the two of them, and I don\u2019t want it to be either one of them. I suspect an actor. Hannah is seeing an actor, so she doesn\u2019t want it to be an actor. We\u2019ll take the personal out of it. I\u2019ve replayed the scenarios over and over in my head since I spoke with you, Whitney, and realized that yes, it could be someone really close,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cI still say that Bobby Walden or Sherry Blanco are involved,\u201d Hannah insisted.</p><p>\u201cDr. Wallace Fullbright,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cOne of the above. Or one of the other cops on the task force,\u201d Jude said wearily. \u201cOr half the city of New York.\u201d</p><p>Will Chan was thoughtful. \u201cActors convince you that what isn\u2019t real is real. They have a talent to evoke emotion,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd magicians work off sleight of hand, convincing you that you\u2019re seeing what you\u2019re not,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cA good magician can make you believe just about anything. Now you see it\u2014now you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And it\u2019s a subtle talent. Bobby Walden might be a screen star, a personality,\u201d Jude said, \u201cbut a great actor he isn\u2019t. \u201c</p><p>\u201cSherry Blanco won\u2019t be taking away any awards, either,\u201d Whitney agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe should have them all to dinner,\u201d Jackson suggested quietly.</p><p>Whitney grinned at him. \u201cJackson, neither Sherry Blanco nor Bobby Walden would accept an invitation to come to dinner here,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>Jude looked at Jackson. \u201cBut, hey, we do take whatever we can get. The more people you eliminate, the better the focus on other suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the millions of people in Manhattan,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>But Jude shook his head. \u201cWe know the killer. I honestly believe that\u2014it\u2019s someone who is close to us, or someone we\u2019ve had an interest in. And the killer\u2014the second killer, because I don\u2019t believe that Angus Avery is innocent, just that we\u2019re supposed to think that\u2014is high on his success regarding the last two kills. He feels that he is invincible. We\u2019ve talked to and interviewed the killer, or he\u2019s someone we see every day. As far as wearing a costume and mask through his day-to-day life, he\u2019s doing that beautifully. But we know him, and he knows us, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s so easy for him to be a step ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really think we should ask Ellis Sayer and Fullbright to dinner?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWe are bound by the law. We\u2019ve arrested Angus Avery because we had the evidence with which to arrest and charge the man. Our evidence trail is going nowhere. We have to trip this person up before they kill again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if we\u2019re wrong? What if it isn\u2019t Ellis or Fullbright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we may not learn the truth from a dinner. But at this point\u2014what the hell? The two of them will accept an invitation. Let\u2019s go for it.\u201d</p><p>It was Whitney\u2019s turn to cook.</p><p>She\u2019d decided on some down-home cooking and though she really should have had a lot more simmer time, she decided to throw together a jambalaya. Jude came into the kitchen while she was stirring her spicy mixture together. He slipped his arms around her waist and leaned low, inhaling the scent of her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was surprised at his action, but it didn\u2019t disturb her. The team knew about their relationship, and they all seemed to approve. She thought, too, that he needed a human touch that night.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d she asked, turning into his arms.</p><p>\u201cHell, no, I\u2019m scared to death. This guy is following in the Ripper\u2019s footsteps, but he isn\u2019t going by any timetable. More time passed between the second kill and the third and the fourth. Last night, he killed two. And if he manages to follow the Ripper\u2019s trail, the next event is someone indoors, and it will be the most gruesome murder yet. We have one man locked up who may or may not prove to be guilty, and it doesn\u2019t matter, because the murders are continuing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay here tonight?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMaybe. I know that I\u2019m exhausted. This afternoon, I did mistrust everyone around us. But logically, I realized I know who it can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it can be Ellis,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cBut you\u2019re still willing for us all to set him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll prove anything against him.\u201d</p><p>Whitney hesitated, looking at him. \u201cI think it\u2019s someone who is a member of the current Cult of Satan.\u201d</p> <p>Jude looked at her.</p><p>\u201cThe Cult of Satan was what Jonathan Black became high priest of\u2014at least, I think,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cI think that somehow, our guy was at the site next door\u2014he may have even slipped in at night, like teenage kids are bound to do at dangerous but spooky places. He knew all about Jack the Ripper\u2014and all the theories that the Ripper killed Carrie Brown, and he knew that Jonathan Black had been here, that he had a base of operations here. Whether any of these theories is true or not, it\u2019s as you once said\u2014perception matters. I was with your dad today, and he showed me an emblem that all the members wore sewn secretly into their clothing somewhere. And he also told me that Jonathan Black was said to have had a cherished relic\u2014something that contained a finger bone from the skeleton of Gilles de Rais\u2014and he thought that his power came from the relic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds reasonable,\u201d Jude said, and he smiled. \u201cSo, do I strip-search every suspect?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but, if we do have a suspect...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>They heard the bell out at the gate ring. \u201cOne of our guests is here.\u201d</p> <p>Whitney stayed with her jambalaya. Jude answered the door. It was Ellis Sayer who had arrived. She listened, as best she could as the others discussed the case with Ellis in the hallway. They seemed to be concentrating on the movie cast and crew, and Ellis was right there with them.</p><p>Angela came in to help her set the table. Whitney arched a brow to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling guilty. He seems like such a nice man. He has really humbly thanked us for having him over,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I feel like we\u2019re beating a basset hound,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, the table was set. The doorbell rang again; Dr. Fullbright had arrived. He was loud and cheerful, thanking them all for having him for their get-together of the minds. The group moved in for the meal.</p><p>Will\u2019s place remained empty for the moment; he was still watching the screens.</p><p>The others began to sit, and Jude asked about drinks, offering Ellis a beer.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know. Are we working tonight?\u201d Ellis asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a beer,\u201d Fullbright said. \u201cI\u2019m not working, and that\u2019s for certain. I don\u2019t care if more bodies come in. Tonight, I\u2019m off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllis, I\u2019m having a beer, you can have a beer,\u201d Jude told him.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Thanks. I think this case is getting to all of us,\u201d Ellis said.</p><p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d Jude said, \u201cit\u2019s still six separate murder cases, you know? So, tonight, we can throw out any speculation, any idea, because one thing is certain\u2014this guy is damn good. Hey, Fullbright, what do you think about the killer\u2019s medical knowledge?\u201d</p><p>Fullbright took a long swallow of his beer. Even in a knit polo shirt and jeans, he managed to look like a mad professor. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, running his fingers through his unruly hair. \u201cThese days, you can learn just about anything on a computer. But there\u2019s a difference between seeing how something was done, and then actually managing to do it. Back in Victorian London, there were slaughterhouses and butchers everywhere, and people probably knew a lot more about mammalian anatomy than they do now, just in general. But did Jack\u2014or our modern killer\u2014have surgical skills? I don\u2019t think so. I think the old\u2014and the new\u2014have a basic understanding of anatomy. And that they\u2019re good with a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActors?\u201d Ellis said. He shook his head wearily. \u201cDo you know how many we\u2019ve interviewed? Some of them as nice as can be, and horrified, and helpful. Some of them scared of the cops\u2014even when we try to tell them our investigation has nothing to do with a drug bust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, any luck in the alley where Captain Tyler said he found the coat?\u201d Jude asked Ellis.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Jackson stood with his drink. \u201cCheers for this one evening, anyway, while we all seek the truth. To Whitney! Whitney is an amazing cook\u2014she can whip up true Creole in a matter of minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she is true Creole!\u201d Jenna said.</p><p>\u201cA total olio of humanity, actually,\u201d Whitney said, grinning at Ellis.</p><p>Whitney realized she felt horrible. She actually liked Ellis a lot. But then, Jude did, too. And he was willing to let them try to draw him out.</p><p>In fact, he was helping them get Ellis a little inebriated, or he was going to do his best to help.</p><p>\u201cI think we have to look more and more closely at the actors in the movie, too,\u201d Jenna said. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re pretty damn sure that we have Angus Avery on Virginia Rockford\u2019s murder, but, obviously, he wasn\u2019t working alone. Or someone planted the evidence in his car. I still say it had to be the actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that you need to look to the past,\u201d Fullbright said. He shook his head. \u201cJude, I don\u2019t want to depress you, but the original Ripper got away. Whoever is doing this is brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant, but we all know that even the most brilliant criminal can get careless,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t found anything, anything at all, on the bodies?\u201d Angela asked. \u201cDr. Fullbright, they really need you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, what you all should do is force yourselves not to think about it for a night,\u201d Fullbright said. \u201cCome back at it with fresh minds.\u201d</p><p>And then, when talk diverged into miscellany, Jude turned the conversation back to the case. \u201cIt was amazing how you found the captain\u2014wearing that cloak,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ellis said.</p><p>\u201cExactly where did you find him?\u201d Whitney asked. \u201cI know that when we were first looking for him, we searched all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe City Hall subway station,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t give us specifics, we keep watching the areas near where the victims were discovered.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the table at them all. \u201cSomeone knew that, right? Someone who has been watching us? I was supposed to find him, wasn\u2019t I? I was actually used, I think.\u201d</p><p>Ellis looked at Jude. \u201cI\u2014or another police officer\u2014was supposed to find the captain. And he was supposed to have been arrested, and the public uproar would cause charges against Avery to be dropped.\u201d</p><p>Jude lifted his beer to Ellis. \u201cIf Angus Avery was being framed, then I\u2019d say, yes, you were being used. You\u2014or whatever cop stumbled across the captain. If Angus is one of the murderers, you might have been used, as well. He might have gone and kidnapped Captain Tyler, and planted the evidence, knowing that his partner was going to strike the next night and get him off the hook. Or, the killer is really relishing his accomplishments, and taking dangerous chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You think you\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Ellis said.</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing. You did what you had to do,\u201d Jude assured him.</p><p>\u201cActors,\u201d Ellis said again, his basset head hanging.</p><p>\u201cYou were an actor,\u201d Whitney reminded him.</p><p>Ellis looked truly puzzled. He laughed. \u201cI was in a play in school because I was madly in love with Briana Vanney. That\u2019s my theater experience!\u201d He frowned and wagged a finger at her. \u201cYou investigated me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just happened to see a picture.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou investigated me,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWe looked into everyone, Ellis. It was just curious. I thought I\u2019d mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had such a crush on Briana Vanney,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe all do strange things for love,\u201d Jude murmured.</p><p>Ellis stood. He wavered a little bit. \u201cI have to go home. I have to go to sleep. Hell, Jude, I don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been long, hard days,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cHey, just go take a rest on the sofa,\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>\u201cEllis, that\u2019s a great idea. Just go and lie down for a while. Trust me\u2014I had to get through medical school,\u201d Fullbright told him. \u201cYou can\u2019t burn the candle at both ends forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should just go home,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cMost of the guys\u2014they\u2019re working in twelve-hour shifts, and somehow, they manage to go home and let it go for the hours they\u2019re off. Somehow, Jude, you can\u2019t do that with a case. Neither can I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo lie down, Ellis,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m insisting you do right now\u2014as head of the task force, I\u2019m ordering you to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Ellis looked at them all. Then he looked sadly at Whitney. \u201cI\u2019m not an actor. If I were, I wouldn\u2019t have been on the force. I\u2019d be trying for fame and fortune, and I\u2019d have appreciated it. And I\u2019m a good cop. I sure as hell would never break the law on purpose, much less hurt anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With that, he turned and walked into the living room.</p><p>\u201cCops,\u201d Fullbright said when he had left the room. \u201cThey can be just as aggravating as actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr M.E.s,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not exactly Mr. Personality, and I know it,\u201d Fullbright said. \u201cWhy the hell do you think I work with the dead?\u201d</p><p>By the time they finished the meal and cleaned up, Ellis was snoring softly on the sofa. Jude told Whitney that they should leave him there while he made some phone calls. She spelled Will, sitting before the bank of screens in the hallway, watching the strange rise and fall of the shadows in the foundations next door. While keeping one eye on the strange phenomenon that never changed, she fast-tracked the film from the night before. She realized that the killer had managed to dispatch his victim and eviscerate her just out of range of every camera that they\u2019d set up.</p><p>At midnight, Jude and Jake came to find her; Jude had been making phone calls, reverifying alibis, and Jake had been running more programs, delving deeper into the backgrounds on the actors, actresses and crew on the movie set. They\u2019d gone back through the security tapes from the various ATMs on Broadway from the night Virginia Rockford had been murdered, but once again, the killer had eluded the film. Jackson had given Hannah a ride home around midnight.</p><p>\u201cBack to me,\u201d Will told Whitney. \u201cGo to bed.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the two of them. \u201cEllis is still on the sofa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave him there,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>She was surprised. \u201cHe\u2019s a cop. He has a gun. And we sleep in this house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone will be watching him through the night,\u201d Will assured her.</p><p>Jude offered her a hand.</p><p>She accepted it. Obviously, he was staying. It was probably far beyond the wrong side of protocol, but they seldom went by protocol. And every human being needed downtime; this was downtime.</p><p>The room was in shadow; she\u2019d left the bathroom light on and it cast a gentle glow into the bedroom.</p> <p>She\u2019d barely closed her door before she turned into his arms. They wound up on the bed in a tangle of clothing, and as they clung to one another, desperate for the release in so many ways, they managed, bit by bit, to shed the annoying cloth that separated them. Guns wound up on either bedside table; shoes were kicked to the far corners of the room. Nothing felt so good, or so right. Immersed in his masculine scent and touched by the powerful heat of his body, Whitney felt the world disappear, and despite the urgent vigor of their love-making, she felt as if the world washed away. Energy and electricity seared through her, and she delighted in stroking the ribbed muscles of his shoulders, chest and abdomen. She found her own power in stroking his sex teasingly, and she forgot everything as their flesh rubbed erotically together, as he kissed and touched her intimately, and entered into her, filling her not just with delightful little orgasms, but with a sense that she was whole, and hungry for the ultimate climax. He moved slowly and almost teasingly, and she arched harder and harder against him until she felt the delicious, sweet burst of release, and in seconds, felt the shuddering impact of his body as he reached the same pinnacle. He fell down beside her, pulled her against him and whispered, \u201cI think you\u2019ve allowed me to survive this with a mind left.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t survived it yet, but she kept silent on that, brushing a kiss against the dampness of his chest.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak again; they had been sleep deprived since she had come to Blair House. She wasn\u2019t aware then if he lay awake or if he had drifted; she only knew that sleep swept over her like a comforting blanket.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she was dreaming, or if she had wakened. She felt first the soft wet touch of the dog\u2019s nose on her hand, urging her to awake. She opened her eyes, and they were back.</p><p>Annie Doherty stood at the foot of the bed, and the other victims, past and present, were arrayed around her. She thought somewhat hysterically that it was getting crowded in her room; there were so many victims now. And they all stared at her beseechingly.</p><p>The dog whined. He barked, wagging his tail. He headed for the door; she didn\u2019t. He came back.</p><p>She rose, and started to follow the dog; the victims were disappearing through the walls that led to the upstairs landing and the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhitney!\u201d</p> <p>She heard her name, but it was as if she was being called from somewhere far away. She knew that whatever it was that she needed to know, the dog was trying to tell her.</p><p>She opened the door to the hallway.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t manage to open it. She felt arms on her shoulders and she turned to see Jude\u2019s concerned face. \u201cWhitney, you\u2019re sleepwalking. And you\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>So she was. And now she was awake. But she still felt the urgency because of her dream. \u201cJude, we have to go next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night, Whitney. We\u2019ll go in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head vehemently. \u201cNow, Jude. Now. I\u2019ll get dressed. We have to get the others, and we have to go next door.\u201d</p><p>She shook free from his touch and hurriedly gathered her clothing from wherever it had fallen on the floor. He did the same, and collected their guns and holsters from the bedside tables. Whitney raced ahead of him, banging on Jackson and Angela\u2019s door, and running along the hallway doing the same to the others. Will, alarmed by the noise, came running to the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Whitney heard Jude run down the steps to try to explain while she woke the others.</p><p>Jackson wasn\u2019t with Angela. He\u2019d been downstairs with Will; they had meant to keep an eye on Ellis through the night.</p><p>Looking disheveled but quickly alert, the Krewe of Hunters assembled in the downstairs hallway. Whitney glanced at Jude. He wasn\u2019t protesting, but she thought that he was surprised that none of the others seemed to think that Whitney was crazy.</p><p>Ellis woke up, dazed, and then became alert. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Oh, God, not another murder\u2014not the Mary Kelly repeat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring him with us,\u201d Jude muttered low against Whitney\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cIntuition! It\u2019s our specialty,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>\u201cWill, stay on-screen. Jenna, you\u2019re with Will. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Two patrol cars were on the street, watching the site. An officer emerged from one of the cars, flashing his beam at them. \u201cStop. NYPD.\u201d</p><p>Jude walked forward, showing his badge. \u201cDetective Jude Crosby. We\u2019re going into the site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, of course,\u201d the officer said. \u201cNow?\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYes, keep an eye out, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><p>Whitney was beginning to feel like a fool. The dog and the women had disappeared when Jude had stopped her. A good thing, of course. If she\u2019d made it past Will and Jackson in the hallway, she\u2019d have been arrested by the officer for indecent exposure.</p><p>She bit her lower lip, waiting for Jackson to open the gate.</p><p>And then she saw the dog. He was halfway between the gate and the foundations, barking, wagging his tail, urging her forward.</p><p>\u201cI see him,\u201d Jake whispered softly at her side.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Angela said.</p><p>They followed the dog to the site, and down the stairs.</p><p>They had all been right. This special unit was special, all right.</p><p>The group of them started walking toward the hole, and they moved with purpose, or awareness of something he hadn\u2019t caught.</p><p>He felt as if cold fingers crept along his spine, but Jude kept his face as expressionless as he could, and followed. They were crazy, but...</p><p>They\u2019d found the skeletons of the 1890s murder victims, and that had brought in an excavation, and the historians and anthropologists were still set up, painstakingly digging bit by bit. What was Whitney going to find that the experts hadn\u2019t?</p><p>He thought he heard a dog barking from somewhere, and then it seemed that an entire neighborhood of canines woke up.</p><p>He looked to the sky. It was a full moon as well.</p><p>Maybe the dogs were reverting to wolflike behavior, and baying at the moon.</p><p>Whitney stopped in the middle of the pentagram. So far, the dig into the foundations had been kept to the other side of the structural wall.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Whitney said.</p><p>\u201cHere, what?\u201d Jude demanded, not able to keep quiet anymore.</p><p>Whitney looked at him. He\u2019d come to know her very well. He couldn\u2019t exactly put a name to the way he felt about her, but he felt his body tense and his heart seem to tear apart. Shimmering and bright, she was someone in his life who was suddenly able to understand him. She was sensual, she was ecstasy and she was a sweet, cooling shower of light that eased him when he needed it most.</p><p>And she had to be...special.</p><p>She was going to lie to him; he could see it in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomething I read...or something your father told me. Here. We have to dig here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a historical site,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already been digging here. We may disrupt something the historians or the crime scene techs have going.\u201d</p><p>He could just imagine the red tape. He could imagine what Deputy Chief Green would have to say to him. \u201cYou were there? You allowed this, after teams of scientists had been called in?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be back on patrol, or worse. His ass would be fired. Generations of New York City cops in his family, and he was the first who would be fired.</p><p>Jackson said quietly, \u201cIf Whitney is convinced, we need to dig. Now.\u201d He looked at Jude. Jude was the final barrier. \u201cI swear to God, it\u2019s important if she says so.\u201d</p><p>Jude threw up his hands.</p><p>Oh, yeah. He\u2019d be branded as special, too.</p><p>He thought about the corpse of the woman on the gurney at autopsy that day, and he lifted his hands in a shrug. \u201cAt this point, what the hell.\u201d</p><p>Once again, they headed to dig out the shovels and picks and spades. He, Jackson and Jake took up the picks. \u201cI should help,\u201d Ellis said.</p><p>Whitney told him, \u201cLook for an area that might have been dug in the last six months or so. You\u2019ll know because you\u2019ll hear something hollow, or you\u2019ll hit soft dirt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of the pickaxes striking hard brick seemed loud in the night. Jude felt his shoulders bunch and his muscles burn as he heaved hard and hit brick, and then brick again.</p><p>And then, something soft. He paused; the others had paused as well, hearing a hollowlike sound of emptiness.</p><p>He fell to his knees, digging at the mortar and earth around the bricks. The others were down beside him; they looked like a group of pups themselves, searching for a bone.</p> <p>Nothing, just dirt, and more dirt.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, please!\u201d Whitney urged.</p><p>\u201cGet the whisks from the other side,\u201d Angela suggested.</p><p>The others stepped back while Jude and Whitney carefully dusted away at the dirt. They came to the remnants of a large pine box and pulled it away.</p><p>Jude sat back on his haunches, stunned.</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t found another victim.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jonathan Black,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThe man who probably killed Carrie Brown, and made the world wonder if the Ripper had come to New York.\u201d</p><p>There, in a little cache that had been protected by the pine, lay another skeleton. A crushed stovepipe hat lay halfway over the disarticulated skull. Remnants of a cloak, vest and shirt seemed glued to bone by dark matter.</p><p>Whitney reached for a chain that lay around the neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jude asked her, grabbing her arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gone?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cOur killer was obsessed with Jonathan Black. He discovered where the cultists buried him when he went so berserk they were terrified of him themselves. The killer found the grave site, and he took the relic\u2014the supposed finger bone of Gilles de Rais\u2014for his own. He thinks it gives him power. The power of evil\u2014or of Satan.\u201d</p><p>Jude was still puzzled. \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything,\u201d Jude said. \u201cMaybe...maybe here he left a trace.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>It seemed that their nights were destined to be long.</p><p>Once again, scores of people were quickly called out.</p><p>The crime scene unit, let by Judith Garner, arrived, along with the anthropologists and the historians; evidence was sought while the historical scientists tried to preserve the integrity of the find. Jude had to control his impatience\u2014he understood the importance of discovery for the sake of history, society and life to come.</p><p>He stepped in when Judith argued with one of the historians.</p> <p>\u201cCrime scene unit first,\u201d insisted Jude.</p><p>Turning, he realized that Deputy Chief Green was on-site himself. He nodded, agreeing with Jude\u2019s action.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more you can do here, Jude,\u201d Green told him. \u201cAnd you look like hell\u2014you should get some sleep. We\u2019ve got more units from the FBI following up on the massive number of people to be interviewed, regarding all the victims. We have people on this, Jude. You\u2019re still lead, but you have to let others do more of the legwork. Right now, I want you at the station. I want a thorough report regarding this situation tonight. Then, I\u2019m ordering you to go home. Don\u2019t show your face again for at least ten hours, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to protest, and then he realized that Green was right; he would be worthless if he didn\u2019t get some sleep.</p><p>He walked over to where Whitney stood with her team, watching the proceedings. \u201cI\u2019ve been ordered to headquarters, and then to bed,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d Jackson asked him, \u201cyou keep files and notes at home as well, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. My files can be accessed from the station or my apartment,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe one thing we\u2019re not up to speed on is the state of your investigation when you had your first two victims\u2014Sarah Larson and Jane Doe dry,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have you bring Whitney with you. When you\u2019re finished at the station, you two can sift through those notes and see if there\u2019s something that might be pertinent now that we\u2019re sure the murders are connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really weren\u2019t certain that they were connected\u2014until the third murder,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too restless to sleep right now,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIt\u2019s still the middle of the night. Jackson needs to get some sleep because he\u2019ll have to coordinate with the other FBI units tomorrow, Will and Jake are going to stay on the screens and research and Angela will watch over the dig here. Maybe I can be of use going through your old notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drop you off on the way to the station,\u201d Jude told Whitney.</p><p>Before he left, he walked back to speak with Judith Garner. \u201cJudith\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d she said patiently, \u201cI know. Call you if I get anything at all. Well, we\u2019ll have all kinds of trace from the hole, I believe, but it will take time.\u201d She set a hand on his shoulder. \u201cFor a hot young man, you look like a dead rat the cat dragged in. You have to accept it\u2014you cannot work this alone. And none of us can stop crime from happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudith, we have to stop the next murder,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d she told him. \u201cDon\u2019t take this all on yourself. I have a night team working away on fingerprints on that hundred, so just maybe\u2014it\u2019s a long shot\u2014but maybe we\u2019ll get a hit on someone, a print that matches up to a suspect, new or old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Judith.\u201d</p><p>He left her, and Whitney joined him as they moved off from the site and headed down the walkway to the other side of the block, where he\u2019d left his car.</p><p>\u201cYou can find your way around the computer room, right? I\u2019ll make sure you have all my access codes, and you can also go through the folders. I have tapes from interviews and hand-written notes in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage fine,\u201d Whitney assured him.</p><p>He was still uneasy, though Whitney did carry a gun. Besides, no matter how special their team might be, she wouldn\u2019t officially be FBI if she hadn\u2019t passed strict standards on the target range.</p><p>At his apartment, he left the car in the street and walked her up to his door. He made a thorough search of the place.</p><p>Allison purred, standing by Whitney\u2019s ankles as she watched him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Whitney asked. \u201cBeing paranoid.\u201d</p><p>He walked back to her, taking her shoulders and keeping his distance. \u201cWhitney, what the hell happened tonight?\u201d</p><p>He saw something pass through her eyes. \u201cI guess I figured out something that I\u2019d read somewhere,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, and she offered him a rueful smile. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe the truth,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd then again, maybe it is the truth\u2014I read something, and it registered in my subconscious mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the truth\u2014as you see it?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhitney, please, don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at his face for a long moment. She was almost sad when she spoke at last, as if there was no choice but to say goodbye to a loved one. \u201cThere\u2019s a ghost dog that seems to like me. He belonged to Annie Doherty, one of Jonathan Black\u2019s victims. He apparently loved his mistress\u2014he\u2019s trying to help us. Actually, I see the ghosts of the victims, too, but they\u2019re silent.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away, chills racing along his spine again. Was it true? Was it possible? He couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><p>And yet, he\u2019d heard the barking of the dog that night at the site, and then all the local dogs had set up howling, as if in kindred spirit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get through the report as quickly as I can,\u201d he said. His voice sounded hollow.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what I believe. It doesn\u2019t matter what I believe. It matters that we find the killer. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude, you\u2019re blaming yourself for all this,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door, and then turned back. \u201cLock yourself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There are three bolts on the front door. Lock them all. There\u2019s only one bolt on each of the windows, but I\u2019ve checked them all. And, of course, my father is right next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, staring at him.</p><p>He looked at her for one more minute, and then he turned and headed out the door.</p><p>Whitney felt as if she had been deflated. She had never felt about anyone the way she felt about Jude. Never. It had happened so quickly, and yet, it even seemed as if she knew him as she had never known anyone before. He was so intense. Honorable, reasonable... She loved the way his mind worked, she loved watching him when he was trying to be patient, and she even loved it when he felt he knew what was right or wrong, and bullied on in with his thoughts, opinions or actions.</p><p>And now he thought that she was a crazy woman, haunted by a dog.</p><p>He probably thought now too that every horrible twist the movies had accredited to voodoo was true. Maybe he was beginning to wonder if she kept a dozen constricting snakes somewhere to dance with in rituals, too, and enjoyed sticking pins in dolls as a pastime.</p><p>She gave herself a stern mental shake. What anyone believed right now was of no importance, unless it pertained to the case.</p><p>She sat down at Jude\u2019s computer desk and keyed in his file code, bringing up the notes on Sarah Larson. She found herself smiling sadly as she read them. He had interviewed everyone on the waterfront, he\u2019d gone through the Port Authority. There had been no way to trace the woman\u2019s movements because no one had known who she was.</p><p>She closed the file and opened the one on Jane Doe dry\u2014the girl who was still unidentified, despite the fact that her picture had run in the newspapers and on television screens. How had she come to the city without anyone knowing or caring?</p><p>The world could be horrible, sad and cruel!</p><p>She\u2019d arrived at the hospital, dripping and bleeding, from massive wounds. Unlike the other victims, she had been sexually assaulted. She had never spoken; she\u2019d died en route. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jude had taken her picture to every bar in Lower Manhattan. One bartender, an improbably mustachioed sort, had thought that he\u2019d seen her in his bar, giggling with a man in one of the back booths.</p><p>Whitney jumped at the sound of a hard tapping. She instinctively drew her gun. She heard the sound of a door clicking and spun around, remembering at the last minute that it must be Andrew.</p><p>\u201cJude...you there?\u201d Andrew called. He stuck his head around the door. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt! Sorry about popping in when I shouldn\u2019t have. Jude\u2014oh!\u201d</p> <p>He had the door open; he saw Whitney standing by the desk, her gun aimed at his head.</p><p>\u201cOh, whoa, sorry!\u201d he said, stepping back.</p><p>Whitney let out a soft sigh and holstered her gun. \u201cAndrew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back any minute,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cWhat are you doing up? It\u2019s still the middle of the night, or maybe close to the crack of dawn.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m a night owl.\u201d He beckoned to her. \u201cCome to the doorway for just a minute and then I won\u2019t bug you. I wasn\u2019t sure what Jude would want, so I brewed coffee and poured him a good stiff bourbon.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll take the coffee, thanks,\u201d she told him. She stood and walked to the dividing door and looked inside. Her eyes widened. She hadn\u2019t seen this part of Andrew\u2019s place. It was Jude\u2019s old room, she thought. And he\u2014or his father\u2014was an eclectic collector of toys\u2014and things. He had Indian totems, African masks, animal skulls and spaceships on the mantel, along with his books on the shelves, and even stacked on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cCool place,\u201d she said. She narrowed her eyes looking at the skull of a steer; it was feathered, and rawhide ties held skins and bones in a ritualistic manner.</p><p>He eased her coffee cup into one hand. They had begun to suspect someone close. Someone smart, someone who knew who was going to be where when.</p><p>Her gun hand was free. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked him, pointing to the skull.</p><p>But Andrew Crosby was Jude\u2019s father. A former cop. Impossible.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh, that?\u201d he asked, his eyes lighting up. \u201cIt belonged to a Shoshone medicine man. It was a gift to me from his tribe. Right before my senior year of high school, I spent a summer working on the reservation, and we became very close friends. The feathers help the soul fly, so he said, when a person dies, or, they help the sick person fly back to health. The bones give the person strength. That sac is filled with small otter bones, which help a warrior learn to swim. That big bone is from a horse\u2014the prayers said that they help a person learn to be as swift as a horse. I think that one is a dog bone\u2014it\u2019s for faith and loyalty. I gave it to Jude when he was a kid\u2014he wanted to be an Indian. He believed that the Shoshone relic taught a man all that he should be. Can I show you anything else?\u201d</p><p>Careful that she kept him in her line of sight, Whitney went over to study the skull. Did anything appear to be a human bone? She didn\u2019t think so; she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>She turned around to look at other relics and collectibles in the room.</p><p>\u201cGreat spaceship,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I bought that at the first Star Wars convention Jude and I went to,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s just great, isn\u2019t it? They made toys so much better before. Oh, well, everything is becoming some kind of video game these days, and graphics are amazing on them, but as for real toys...\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAndrew, thanks. I have to get back to work,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you have time, come on over. I can show you Jude\u2019s childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that!\u201d She kept him in her sight as she made her way back to the door. \u201cThank you for the coffee. I\u2019ll make sure you get the cup back.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew waved a hand in the air. \u201cOh, I pick up all my stuff from Jude\u2019s once a week.\u201d</p><p>Whitney stepped back into Jude\u2019s apartment. She smiled at Andrew and then closed the door and bolted the lock on her side between the two apartments.</p><p>Back at the desk, she sat for a moment, stunned with her suspicion.</p><p>They\u2019d thought it would be someone who was close. Someone who knew police procedure. Someone who knew them, and all about them.</p><p>Who better than Jude\u2019s father, a man who had access to his computer, his desk, to every bit of information regarding the crimes?</p><p>She called Jake Mallory; she didn\u2019t want to suggest to Jude just yet that his father might have a Satanist\u2019s finger bone in with the relics or hidden in a shaman\u2019s magic skull\u2014a gift he had given to his son. She stumbled through her explanation of why she was suddenly suspicious of Jude Crosby\u2019s father.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be Andrew\u2019s Crosby; it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>And the relic had been, he had said, something he had gotten back when he\u2019d been in high school. He had given it to Jude....</p><p>But at this point, it seemed that nothing was impossible.</p><p>\u201cGet back to me quickly, Jake, please,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou should get out of there, Whitney. I\u2019ll come and get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? You don\u2019t have a car,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get one of the police officers\u2014there are still people prowling around next door, tons of cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, check out everything you can on Andrew Crosby for me first, please. And don\u2019t call a police officer\u2014I don\u2019t want any of this on record. You have all the information, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it,\u201d Jake said. He hesitated. \u201cWhitney, I know how you feel about Jude, and I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll be as discreet as humanly possible, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re calling me. About his dad, I mean. I\u2019ll call you right back, and then, I\u2019m coming for you. I mean, coming for you. I\u2019ll get a cab, and we\u2019ll be together, at least. Hey, gotta go\u2014 Angela\u2019s on the radio. There\u2019s something wrong over at the site. Sit tight\u2014no matter what, I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Whitney hung up. She tried to focus on the screen; she was armed. She could wait for Jake to call her back. She was in a locked room\u2014far safer than heading out to the street.</p><p>She nearly jumped a mile when she heard something hit the glass at the back of the apartment; she rose quickly, and strode into the back. Nothing had hit the parlor windows.</p><p>She walked into the side room, Jude\u2019s den. The fire escape led from the window in this room. She walked over to it; the glass was cracked, as if it had been hit by a rock. Or something heavier.</p><p>Maybe a brick from an old building?</p><p>She jumped again; there was a thud that came from somewhere in the building. She was tempted to dash to the front door and run out, but she wondered if that wasn\u2019t what someone hoped she would do.</p><p>But the house was clear. She walked back to the desk, looked around and picked up the cup of coffee and took a long swallow. She should just call Jude; she was paranoid, but that was the way it was.</p><p>She heard another noise\u2014a growl.</p><p>She frowned. The ghost dog was standing in the hallway, growling. There was something there that he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>She was startled; she\u2019d never seen the dog anywhere else before, just around the construction site or Blair House.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there!\u201d she said softly, and took another sip of the coffee.</p><p>There was something wrong with it now, she thought. She stared at the cup. Had it tasted this way, or had it changed in the last few minutes?</p><p>The dog barked at her, and then ran through the door to the hallway.</p><p>She dropped the cup and looked toward the door that separated the two apartments.</p><p>The thud!</p><p>The door was still closed, but the bolt had been jimmied open.</p><p>And she could feel whatever drug was now in the coffee beginning to take hold. Despite all the bright lights, the room was dimming, and her limbs were beginning to feel like water.</p><p>She could hear her cell phone ringing; she just couldn\u2019t answer it.</p><p>Jude glumly thought that at best he\u2019d soon be pulled off the case. He started to fill out his report for the night, but paused. What did he say? I was sleeping with an FBI task force member when she suddenly bolted up naked and started for the door; her ghost dog wanted her to get over to what is now an excavation site, and I\u2019ll be damned if he didn\u2019t show her where an old Satan-loving murderer was buried.</p><p>The facts; just the facts. The FBI team had become convinced\u2014through archives\u2014that they now knew where the body of the historical killer lay; it was important that they unearth it, because the theories regarding the current killings were all pointed in the direction of the killer believing he was following in the route of the man.</p><p>Backtrack a bit.</p><p>We were trying to draw out a cop\u2014and a medical examiner. And both appear to be exactly what they are\u2014Fullbright almost flippant but honest and earnest; Ellis Sayer as hardworking and hangdog as ever.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t look good on paper. But it felt good to think.</p><p>The offices were quiet. In the next room, he could see that a police officer had brought in two drunks who had apparently gone at one another in a bar.</p><p>He gave his attention back to the report swimming before him.</p><p>Expediency being the greatest necessity at the time, I deemed it best to dig, he wrote.</p><p>A creeping chill started up and down his spine. He felt something nudge his thigh.</p><p>Startled, Jude sat back. He didn\u2019t see anything. He felt the nudge again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He leaped to his feet.</p><p>He blinked. He had been too intensely involved with the case. His mind was playing tricks on him. He blinked again, but it didn\u2019t go away.</p><p>It was the outline of a dog. A big dog. Some kind of shepherd mix. Oh, God, he\u2019d been playing with the crazies too long. His mind...</p><p>The dog looked at him and barked and kept barking. It padded away from him, and then ran back to him. The dog wanted him to follow.</p><p>He hesitated, looking around. The drunks were still there; the officer was still there, the desk sergeant was still there. None of them seemed to be hearing a dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a deep breath. And then he followed the dog, mumbling something to the desk sergeant on the way out.</p><p>Each step of the way, the dog waited for him. He knew where Jude\u2019s car was. He jumped through the door and waited for Jude to get into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cWell, which way, boy?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cOr is this as far as the craziness takes us?\u201d</p> <p>The dog barked. Jude eased the car out. Traffic was minimal, but he didn\u2019t know where he was going. But each time he neared a turn, the dog went crazy until he veered his car into the right lane.</p><p>He had just realized that the animal seemed to be leading him home, when his cell phone began to ring.</p><p>He glanced at the caller ID. It was Judith Garner.</p><p>\u201cJude, I got a hit off the hundred-dollar bill. You\u2019re not going to believe it. I mean, I still can\u2019t believe that, good as we are, I got a known fingerprint off that bill!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudith, you\u2019re amazing,\u201d he said. He\u2019d just taken the turn down his street; the dog\u2019s tail thumped happily but silently on the seat next to him. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss your feet later. Who?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say goodbye; after she answered, he hung up and called Jackson Crow as he stepped down full throttle on the gas pedal.</p><p>The dog wanted him, and that meant...</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>She saw him standing at the doorway to Jude\u2019s office, and she wondered if she was imagining a man again, because he was wearing black, with a dark brocade vest and a shoulder-caped cloak. His hat was a stovepipe.</p><p>But he had no face.</p><p>No. She wasn\u2019t imagining him, and he wasn\u2019t a ghost. If only he were. He had no face because he was wearing a white theatrical mask; it was the sad face of the duo that signified comedy and drama.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never thought that anything could be so good!\u201d he said, staring at her. She was aware, although she couldn\u2019t see his lips, he was smiling. Gloating. \u201cThe others were really random. Well, I can tell you now, I guess\u2014Angus picked the others. He said it was easy. People will do just about anything for a few minutes of fame. All he had to do was tell them that he could get them into the movies. And, of course, he didn\u2019t run around finding brain surgeons! They fell for his lines so easily. They went where he wanted them to go. They did what he wanted them to do. Anything\u2014just for a chance to be in the movies. But, you know, the last girl he killed in London\u2014before coming to the States\u2014was Mary Kelly. Prostitutes then, prostitutes now. All they want is fame and fortune, and they want to use you to get it. Jonathan picked up a little cutie, even if she was a prostitute. But, you see, you\u2019re really no better. Young and gorgeous, and you\u2019re really kind of a whore, too, huh, sleeping with the cop when you haven\u2019t really known him long at all. You fit the bill nicely. And, imagine! You\u2019ll be found in the lead investigator\u2019s own apartment! Is that rich, or what?\u201d</p><p>Whitney told herself that she hadn\u2019t had that much of the coffee; she could move. She had to move. She had to draw her gun from her holster, and shoot the bastard.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t make her limbs work. He dropped his medical bag in the hallway, walked to her and stooped down and drew out her gun, studying it. \u201cYep, FBI issue. Not that it\u2019s going to do you any good now.\u201d He reached out and touched her cheek with his gloved hands. \u201cPretty, pretty, pretty thing! But you\u2019re really just a weirdo, you know.\u201d</p><p>He tossed her gun under the desk, still hunched down at her side.</p><p>Whitney was amazed when she was able to almost form a word. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAngus Avery is going to make my career skyrocket. And all the Sherry Blancos of the world will be nothing but dirt beneath my feet!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, he taught me all about Jonathan Black\u2014and the power of Satan.\u201d He gave a little shudder. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you figured out where Jonathan was buried. But Angus got it all right a long time ago. He is a New Yorker, and you\u2019re not, but...\u201d</p><p>He stood again. \u201cTime\u2019s a-wasting, girl! Your lover-boy cop won\u2019t take forever writing up that report.\u201d He looked at his watch and shrugged. \u201cI should have had hours, but...well, I\u2019ll make do with the time I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...how?\u201d Whitney managed to say.</p> <p>\u201cAh, how, you ask? You never figured that out? You just don\u2019t understand the power of fame, and you should. Of all people, you should have understood. It was easy. I worked downtown on that movie. I knew the police station. I hung around as near to it as I could, and I watched who came and went, and I listened to everything said by everyone who came from the building and passed me by. All I had to do was a little flirting with a pathetic computer nerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComputer nerd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah. She was the easiest. I met her at a coffee shop. I flirted with her. I told her I was going to make movies. She was so easy...I never let on who I was. I always pretended to be so flattered that she thought I looked like the Bobby Walden. I said I knew directors\u2014I said I could get her extras work, that I\u2019d done extras work...she was so gullible. She never knew how much she gave away!\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist bending down by her again. \u201cShe never will know. And if she begins to suspect that I\u2019m not the man she thought I was...well, I\u2019ve gotten really good at this. Angus taught me well. I know how to find little Miss Hannah, and make sure she disappears. If fact, when I finish with you, I think I\u2019ll pay a call on her.\u201d</p><p>He walked back to the hallway and picked up his medical bag. He opened it, and then held up a long, sharp knife. He glanced back over at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a Japanese carving blade, if you\u2019re interested. Light steel, and one of the finest.\u201d</p><p>He studied it with appreciation for a moment.</p><p>Whitney felt the seconds of her life dwindling away. Mind over matter wasn\u2019t working; the world was out of focus and she couldn\u2019t will her limbs to work.</p><p>But as he stood there, still admiring the glint of the steel, the door that separated the apartments suddenly flew open. Andrew Crosby\u2014blood dripping from his head\u2014reached for her, dragging her through the open doorway and into his apartment.</p><p>He slammed the door. Whitney felt pain in her hand as he stepped on her fingers. \u201cSorry, sorry, oh, God, he got your gun! I can\u2019t call for help, he smashed my cell. And yours...where the hell is your cell phone?\u201d He patted her body. \u201cShit! It\u2019s on the floor in there somewhere. Whitney, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to sit up and was intensely gratified to see that she could move again; the more she tried to move, the more she could.</p><p>\u201cHelp me up!\u201d she told him.</p><p>He struggled and did so. As she gained her feet, they heard the force of Bobby Walden\u2019s body slam against the dividing door. It shuddered, and held, but he slammed against it again.</p><p>A second later, the door splintered and broke. Whitney struggled for the buffalo skull hanging on the wall. Andrew didn\u2019t protest as she dragged it down. As Bobby crashed like a bull into the room, she cracked it with all her strength on his head.</p><p>He fell between her and Andrew, and he quickly staggered up, the knife still in his hands. He let out a bellow and turned on Andrew.</p><p>\u201cHere, you bastard! I\u2019m the one you want!\u201d Whitney screamed.</p><p>He turned, the white theatrical mask he wore seemingly cast in a puzzled expression.</p><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d Whitney cried. He understood her. Bobby Walden did not. Nor did he seem to realize that now, even if he killed them both, he was caught. He was never going to move on to superstardom\u2014his skin and blood were in the horns of the buffalo skull and Forensics would discover his identity for certain.</p><p>Andrew bolted for the door. Whitney tore back into Jude\u2019s apartment and dived beneath the desk. She couldn\u2019t reach her gun. It had skittered too far back.</p><p>And Bobby was coming.</p><p>For a moment, stars burst before her eyes, followed by blackness. She blinked. She came out from beneath the desk.</p><p>She was dimly aware that she heard a dog barking again, but she didn\u2019t know from where.</p><p>And a ghost dog couldn\u2019t help her now!</p><p>As Bobby Walden came in, pausing for balance against the door frame, Whitney stumbled into the living room, desperately seeking a weapon. She stood for a moment, swaying herself, darkness before her eyes. She blinked furiously. He was now stumbling his way after her.</p><p>She hurried for the rear den, falling against the door and then righting herself. There was only one bolt on the fire escape window.</p><p>It was like moving a thousand-pound steel object, but desperation, the fight for her life, sent adrenaline into her system, giving her strength. She got the window opened just as Bobby fell into the room.</p><p>She almost made it out the window; he caught her arm.</p><p>The barking was louder now.</p><p>He ripped her back into the room. He showed her his hands. \u201cWas Mary Kelly strangled first\u2014or did he just slice her throat? Your choice, Agent Tremont!\u201d</p><p>She saw stars beginning to pop out in front of her eyes again, but when she blinked, they were gone.</p><p>And something was different.</p><p>The room was filled with women. Ghostly shades and figures, in contemporary and period dress. Bobby must have felt them somehow, because he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all here, Bobby,\u201d she told him. \u201cThey\u2019re all here, all the women you and Angus Avery killed. They\u2019re here to see that you\u2019re dragged to hell.\u201d</p><p>He let out a roar of anger, looking around.</p><p>He could see them, she thought.</p><p>\u201cBitches, whores!\u201d he railed. \u201cYou got what you deserved! And she\u2019s going to join you, and we\u2019re all going to hell!\u201d</p><p>He fell down on top of Whitney and his fingers wound around her throat.</p><p>Andrew, his face and scalp bloodied, was just running out the front door when Jude arrived, screaming for help at the top of his lungs.</p><p>Jude caught him. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, I\u2019m all right. You\u2019ve got to get in there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhitney?\u201d he said desperately.</p><p>\u201cYour place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I left. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>The dog was ahead of him, barking insanely, as he raced up the stairs. Jude followed two steps at a time and tried to burst into his apartment. The bolts were solid; he\u2019d seen to it.</p> <p>Swearing, he rushed to his father\u2019s door, burst in and dashed through the splintered door to his own apartment.</p><p>The dog was ahead. He followed the dog.</p><p>Bobby Walden pressed his full weight into Whitney; she was tearing and ripping at his fingers, struggling desperately against him.</p><p>He would happily have shot the man, but the way that they were struggling... Whitney suddenly twisted and blocked his shot. He sheathed the gun and tackled the man who was on top of her, bringing them both off Whitney and rolling across his den floor.</p><p>Bobby Walden knew how to fight, but he didn\u2019t have Jude\u2019s size or strength, nor did he spend his free hours with a punching bag, learning how to burn off frustration.</p> <p>Bobby only got in one good jab; Jude was furious, seeing red, and he pummeled the man. Until he felt Whitney\u2019s fingers, weak, but tugging at his shirt.</p><p>\u201cJude...no. He\u2019s got to stand trial. He\u2019s got to help us sort through it all.\u201d</p><p>He eased back; his hands were bloody. For a moment, Bobby Walden, wound in the cloak, the mask ripped away, lay on the floor. His face was swollen, his eyes were nearly closed. He was alive\u2014Jude could see him breathing.</p><p>He stood up, reaching to drag the man to his feet.</p><p>\u201cBobby Walden, you\u2019re under arrest for the murder\u2014\u201d</p><p>To his amazement, the man suddenly screamed\u2014a piercing, bone-chilling scream that sounded louder than anything Jude had ever heard.</p> <p>The ghost dog started barking insanely again.</p><p>Jude twisted around, wondering what could cause such a shriek of pure terror.</p><p>He thought that he heard the swish of fabric. It seemed that there were shadows and strange forms in the air; he thought he caught a whiff of perfume.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d Bobby suddenly screamed. He broke loose from Jude and ripped his clothing and his flesh, bolting through the window to the fire escape. \u201cAh, hell!\u201d Jude raged, trying to fling himself after the man.</p><p>But it seemed that he couldn\u2019t get through the figures, as if the air had become water or rich honey, impossible to penetrate. But it wasn\u2019t the air; it was the women moving after Bobby Walden.</p><p>He made his way to the window, but Bobby\u2019s back arched against the metal rungs of the fire escape.</p><p>Before Jude could reach him, he fell...</p><p>He didn\u2019t hit the ground.</p> <p>He was caught on the metal rungs of the fire escape, and there were sickening moments in which the man sputtered and choked...until he strangled to death on the heavy rawhide loop he had around his neck. A talisman was attached to the rope.</p><p>The relic that held the finger bone of Gilles de Rais.</p><p>The barking stopped.</p><p>The room seemed to be freshened by a sudden rush of clean air.</p><p>Jackson Crow and Jake Mallory burst into the room, guns in position, followed by members of the NYPD.</p><p>Jude came to where Whitney was slumped on the floor and fell down at her side. He took her into his arms.</p><p>There was a great deal more to be done by law enforcement at that moment.</p><p>But...</p><p>No man was an island. Law enforcement wasn\u2019t one man. There was a task force working this case.</p><p>They could deal with the situation now....</p><p>No way he was writing another report tonight.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Whitney had been dosed with a powerful combination of drugs, all available to any good-looking marquee name. Jude was horrified to realize that the man had been using Hannah for information on what was going on with the case. Jude knew he\u2019d have to talk to her, and he sat for long periods of time wondering about people in general. Some of the victims Angus Avery and Bobby Walden had chosen had been hungry for fame and a better life.</p><p>But Hannah had just been hungry for attention from a man who had really seemed to care about her.</p><p>Whitney was kept in the hospital overnight.</p><p>Jude stayed by her side.</p><p>He had a feeling they would one day discover that Bobby Walden had employed knowledge he\u2019d learned about date-rape drugs earlier. He\u2019d been an up-and-coming star, and those women he had accosted before he had fallen in with Angus Avery\u2014and his particular form of the devil\u2014had probably never reported that he\u2019d raped them, if they\u2019d realized it. Who would have believed them?</p><p>It was good that Ellis was just what he seemed. A good cop.</p><p>And it was good that Wally Fullbright was what he seemed, too. An eccentric little man with a keen interest in mysteries and a talent at autopsy.</p><p>He left Ellis to deal with Angus Avery as they used what they had learned from Bobby Walden to try to piece together exactly what had happened.</p><p>Avery\u2019s house arrest was revoked. He answered a few questions, and they learned that he was proud of all that he had accomplished. He\u2019d known about Jonathan Black and been fascinated with theories about Jack the Ripper and Black since he\u2019d been a child growing up by the seaport. He\u2019d written the movie years before, and he\u2019d known that he had to re-create the fear of the late 1890s.</p><p>Jonathan Black had told him so.</p><p>They didn\u2019t learn much more about the details of who had done what because Angus Avery strangled himself to death in his cell at Rikers Island with the sheet from his bed. His death surprised everyone; he hadn\u2019t been on suicide watch.</p><p>Whitney and Jude knew, of course, that he\u2019d been prompted to his action by a different power.</p><p>Cops were supposed to believe in justice, not vengeance, Jude knew.</p><p>But he\u2019d seen the bodies of their victims on the autopsy tables.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel any sorrow.</p><p>He was due to receive a commendation that he didn\u2019t feel he deserved. What he did deserve, and what he was taking, was a long vacation.</p><p>Ellis Sayer was one damn good detective, and the world of New York would be just as well served with Ellis holding down the high-profile realm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know when Whitney\u2019s team would be called to another investigation; he just wanted every day with her that he could have. The team wasn\u2019t in a hurry to leave\u2014they still felt there was unfinished business at Blair House.</p><p>One night, when he\u2019d spent the afternoon next to Monty at the hospital, he headed over to Blair House in the early evening. Angela was preparing a roast. Jake\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was joining them at the house while they finished up in New York, and the two were musicians. He\u2019d been invited for a Krewe of Hunters evening, and he was grateful that they considered him part of their in-crowd.</p><p>When he arrived, he could see through the open gate that Whitney was standing in the front, looking perplexed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked at him and smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His heart thudded. \u201cOne more time?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She smiled and moved against him, lifting her head and coming on her toes to give him a kiss. \u201cOne more time with picks and shovels!\u201d she told him.</p><p>He arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cThe dog, Jude. I have to find the dog. The excavation team dug up an old metal tag. A dog tag. It had the name Rufus on it. I think\u2014I know you saw Rufus, Jude. I know that you did. I have to find him. We\u2019ve decided that, between us, and with a fund from city donations, we can actually bury the victims from the past\u2014and Jane Doe dry, until we find out who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we find out who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may never,\u201d Whitney agreed. \u201cWhen we bury Annie Doherty, I want to bury Rufus with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said they found his tag next door, at the excavation site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I think Rufus tried to protect his mistress. I believe someone got a hold of him, but he escaped. He came back, and the owners cared for him, never understanding why he sat in the yard, staring at the House of Spiritualism, barking now and then, and trying to get someone to understand. Please, Jude, I know this is hard, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dig,\u201d he said.</p><p>One by one, the others came out. Jude was silently glad to see that Jake Mallory\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was a sweet and beautiful young woman. He couldn\u2019t help but see that Ashley and Jake were so close, and he had to admit that he had felt a twinge of jealousy now and then.</p><p>But Ashley dug in with the rest of them, not at all surprised that they were going to search for the remains of a ghost dog.</p><p>As Whitney had thought\u2014though they did tear up the yard and make a mess of it\u2014they found the remains of a dog. They were tenderly gathered, and wrapped, and set in a show box to await burial.</p><p>It was a beautiful night; it was the first night he had really relaxed, it seemed, since he\u2019d been called in when the body of Sarah Larson had been pulled from the river.</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave until morning. Whitney, groggy, golden and beautiful, reached out her arms to him when he was ready to go. He paused, returned to her side and kissed her. But she couldn\u2019t coax him back into bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>At the animal shelter, the attendant told him that they didn\u2019t have any full-blooded German shepherds at the moment.</p><p>Jude smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t want a full-blooded shepherd. I want a mix. Something big and furry and lovable that enjoys people and needs a good home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s Ruff,\u201d the attendant told him.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cRuff\u2014that\u2019s what they called him when he was found on the street, I guess. Anyway, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been calling him here,\u201d the attendant told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Ruff,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even seen him yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m going to like him.\u201d</p><p>And he did. Ruff was a mixture of shepherd and something big\u2014maybe a wolfhound, or deerhound. He wagged his tail wildly when he met Jude, whined softly and slipped his wet nose against Jude\u2019s hand.</p><p>He filled out all the paperwork, paid the fee and left a donation, and left the shelter with Ruff, a shiny new collar and tags, and a long leash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whitney hadn\u2019t understood why Jude had been so eager to leave. When he called her to say that he was on his way back, she went out into the yard to wait.</p><p>They had the gate open, and she saw him drive up.</p><p>He got out of the car and opened the passenger side.</p> <p>The dog bounded to her as if he\u2019d known her all her life.</p><p>Jude came behind, impossibly tall and sexy, his hair falling lightly over his forehead and a grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a cat person?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...I\u2019m in love with a dog person,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd, somehow, canines have really grown on me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, threw her arms around him and kissed him. Then she drew back. \u201cJude, how are we going to work this out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told her. \u201cI only know that we will.\u201d He looked down at her for a long moment. \u201cI know that I met you, and my world changed. I changed. I love you. Too soon to say that? I hope not. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s too soon?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI love you,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>He pulled her close and kissed her. Ruff barked.</p><p>And Whitney knew that time and distance would mean nothing. Sometimes, that would be annoying.</p><p>But annoying could never interfere with anything this powerful and sure.</p><p>They would work it out.</p>  </body></html>"]
