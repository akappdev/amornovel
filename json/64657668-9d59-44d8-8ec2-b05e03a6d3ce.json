The bridesmaids were dressed in pink, and Faith\u2019s niece, just thirteen years old, looked as pretty as could be. The best man wore his dress blues, and Faith\u2019s brother was an usher. It was beautiful!</p> <p>The wedding day of these two kids\u2014Faith and Jeremy, together since high school\u2014was set to be one of the happiest days our town had seen in years. After all, the Hollands were a founding family here, salt of the earth types. They had more land than anyone in the Finger Lakes wine country, acres and acres of vineyard and forest, all the way down to Keuka\u2014the Crooked Lake, as we call it. The Lyons, well, they were from California, but we liked them, anyway. They were more the money type. Nice folks. Their land abutted the Hollands\u2019, so the kids were next-door neighbors. How sweet was that? And Jeremy, oh, he was a doll! He could\u2019ve gone pro in the NFL. No, really, he was that good. But instead, he moved back as soon as he became a doctor. He wanted to practice right here in town, settle down with that sweet Faith and raise a family.</p><p>The kids met so romantically, in a medical sort of way\u2014Faith, then a senior in high school, had an epileptic seizure. Jeremy, who\u2019d just transferred in, elbowed his way to her side, picked her up in his brawny football-hero arms, which, come to think of it, you\u2019re not supposed to do, but his intentions were noble, and what a picture it made, the tall and dark Jeremy carrying Faith through the halls. He brought her to the nurse\u2019s office, where he remained by her side until her dad came to get her. It was, the story went, love at first sight.</p><p>They went to the prom together, Faith with her dark red hair curled around her shoulders, her skin creamy against the midnight blue of her dress. Jeremy was so handsome, six-foot-three inches of sculpted football-god physique, his black hair and dark eyes making him look like a Romanian count.</p><p>He went to Boston College and played football there; Faith went to school at Virginia Tech to study landscape design, and the distance alone, as well as their age...well, no one expected them to stay together. We could all see Jeremy with a model or even a young Hollywood starlet, given his family\u2019s money and his athletic ability and those good looks. Faith was cute in that girl-next-door way, but you know how those things go. The girl gets left behind, the boy moves on. We\u2019d have understood.</p><p>But no, we were wrong. His parents would complain about the enormous cell phone bills, the vast number of texts Jeremy had sent Faith, almost like Ted and Elaine were bragging\u2014See how devoted our son is? How constant? How in love with his girlfriend?</p> <p>When home on break, Faith and Jeremy would walk through town hand in hand, always smiling. He might pick a flower from the lush window boxes in front of the bakery and tuck it behind her ear. They were often seen on the town beach, his head in her lap, or out on the lake in his parents\u2019 Chris-Craft boat, Jeremy standing behind Faith as she steered, his muscular arms around her, and didn\u2019t they look like a tourism ad! It seemed as if Faith had hit pay dirt, and good for her for nabbing someone like Jeremy\u2014we all had a soft spot for her, the poor little girl Mel Stoakes pulled out of that awful wreck. Laura Boothby liked to brag about how much Jeremy spent on Faith\u2019s flowers for the anniversary of their first date, for her birthday, for Valentine\u2019s Day and sometimes \u201cjust because.\u201d There were those of us who thought it was a little much, out here in the country of Mennonite farms and Yankee reserve, but the Lyon family was from Napa Valley, so there you go.</p><p>Sometimes you\u2019d see Faith and a few girlfriends at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, and one or two of them might vent about their neglectful, immature boyfriends who cheated or lied, who broke up via text or a status change on Facebook. And if Faith said something sympathetic, those girls might say, \u201cYou have no idea what we\u2019re talking about, Faith! You have Jeremy,\u201d almost as if it was an accusation. The mere mention of his name would bring a dreamy smile to her face, a softness to her eyes. Faith would occasionally tell people she\u2019d always wanted a man as good as her father, and it sure as heck seemed as if she\u2019d found one. Even though he was young, Jeremy was a wonderful doctor, and every woman in town seemed to come down with something or another the first few months after he set up his practice. He took time to listen, always had a smile, remembered what you said last time.</p><p>Three months after he finished his residency, on a beautiful September day when the hills burned red and gold and the lake shimmered with silver, Jeremy got down on one knee and presented Faith with a three-carat diamond engagement ring. We heard all about it, oh, sure, and the planning began. Faith\u2019s two sisters would be bridesmaids, that pretty Colleen O\u2019Rourke the maid of honor. Jeremy\u2019s best man would be the Cooper boy if he could come home from Afghanistan, and wouldn\u2019t that be nice, to see a decorated war hero standing up there next to his old football buddy? It would be so romantic, so lovely...truly, it made us all smile, just thinking about it.</p><p>So imagine our surprise, then, when the two kids were standing right there on the altar of Trinity Lutheran, and Jeremy Lyon came out of the closet.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Three and a half years later</p> <p>FAITH HOLLAND PUT DOWN her binoculars, picked up her clipboard and checked off a box on her list. Lives alone. Clint had said he did, and the background check showed only his name on the rental agreement, but a person couldn\u2019t be too careful. She took a pull of Red Bull and tapped her fingers against the steering wheel of her roommate\u2019s car.</p><p>Once upon a time, a scenario like this would\u2019ve seemed ridiculous. But given her romantic history, a little footwork was simply smart. Footwork saved time, embarrassment, anger and heartbreak. Say, for example, the man was g*y, which had happened not just with Jeremy, but with Rafael Santos and Fred Beeker, as well. To his credit, Rafe hadn\u2019t known Faith thought they were dating; he\u2019d thought they were just hanging out. Later that month, determined to keep trying, Faith had rather awkwardly hit on Fred, who lived down the street from her and Liza, only to have him recoil in horror and gently explain that he liked boys, too. (Incidentally, she\u2019d fixed him up with Rafael, and the two had been together ever since, so at least there was a happily ever after for someone.)</p><p>Gay wasn\u2019t the only problem. Brandon, whom she\u2019d met at a party, had seemed so promising, right until their second date, when his phone rang. \u201cGotta take this, it\u2019s my dealer,\u201d he\u2019d said blithely. When Faith had asked for clarification\u2014he couldn\u2019t mean drug dealer, could he?\u2014he\u2019d replied sure, what did she think he meant? He\u2019d seemed confused when Faith left in a huff.</p><p>The binocs were old school, yes. But had she used binoculars with Rafe, she would\u2019ve seen his gorgeous silk window treatments and six-foot framed poster of Barbra Streisand. Had she staked out Brandon, she might\u2019ve seen him meeting unsavory people in cars after they\u2019d flashed their headlights.</p><p>She\u2019d attempted to date two other guys since moving to San Francisco. One didn\u2019t believe in bathing\u2014again, something she might\u2019ve learned by stalking. The other guy stood her up.</p><p>Hence the stakeout.</p><p>Faith sighed and rubbed her eyes. If this didn\u2019t work out, Clint would be her last foray for a while, because she really was getting worn out here. Late nights, the eye strain associated with binocular use, a stomachache from too much caffeine... It was tiring.</p><p>But Clint might be worth it. Straight, employed, no history of arrest, no DUIs, that rarest of species in S.F. Maybe this would make a cute story at their wedding. She could almost imagine Clint saying, \u201cLittle did I know that at that very minute, Faith was parked in front of my house, chugging Red Bull and bending the law....\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d met Clint on the job\u2014she\u2019d been hired to design a small public park in the Presidio; Clint owned a landscaping company. They\u2019d worked together just fine; he was on time, and his people were fast and meticulous. Also, Clint had taken a shine to Blue, Faith\u2019s Golden retriever, and what\u2019s more appealing than a guy who gets down on his knees and lets your dog lick his face? Blue seemed to like him (but then again, Blue tended to like any living creature, the type of dog who\u2019d leg-hump a serial killer). The park had been dedicated two weeks ago, and right after the ceremony, Clint had asked her out. She\u2019d said yes, then gone home and begun her work. Good old Google showed no mention of a wife (or husband). There was a record of a marriage between a Clinton Bundt of Owens, Nebraska, but that was ten years ago, and her Clint Bundt a) seemed too young to have been married for ten years; and b) was from Seattle. His Facebook page was for work only. While he did mention some social things (\u201cWent to Oma\u2019s on 19th Street; great latkes!\u201d), there was no mention of a spouse in any of the posts of the past six months.</p><p>On Date Number One, Faith had made arrangements for Fred and Rafael to check him out, since g*ydar was clearly not one of her skills. She and Clint met for drinks on a Tuesday evening, and the guys had shown up at the bar, done the shark-bump test on Clint, then gone to a table. Straight, Rafael texted, and Fred backed him up with Hetero.</p><p>On Date Number Two (lunch/Friday afternoon), Clint had proven to be charming and interested as she told him about her family, being the youngest of four, Goggy and Pops, her grandparents, how much she missed her dad. Clint, in turn, had told her about an ex-fianc\u00e9e; she\u2019d kept her own story to herself.</p><p>On Date Number Three (dinner/Wednesday, in the \u201cmake him wait to measure his interest level\u201d philosophy), Clint had met her at a cute little bar near the pier and once again passed every criteria: held her chair, complimented her without too much detail (That\u2019s a pretty dress, she\u2019d found, set off no warning bells, unlike Is that Badgley Mischka, OMG, I love those two!). He\u2019d stroked the back of her hand and kept sneaking peeks at her boobage, so it was all good. When Clint had asked if he could drive her home, which of course was code for sex, she\u2019d put him off.</p><p>Clint\u2019s eyes had narrowed, as if accepting her challenge. \u201cI\u2019ll call you. Are you free this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Another test passed. Available on weekends. Faith had felt a flutter; she hadn\u2019t been on a fourth date since she was eighteen years old. \u201cI think I\u2019m free on Friday,\u201d she\u2019d murmured.</p><p>They stood on the sidewalk, waiting for a cab as tourists streamed into souvenir shops to buy sweatshirts, having been tricked into thinking that late August in San Francisco meant summer. Clint leaned in and kissed her, and Faith let him. It had been a good kiss. Very competent. There was potential in that kiss, she thought. Then a taxi emerged from the gloom of the famed fog, and Clint waved it over.</p><p>And so, in preparation of the fourth date\u2014which would possibly be the date, when she finally slept with someone other than Jeremy\u2014here she was, parked in front of his apartment, binoculars trained on his windows. Looked as if he was watching the ball game.</p><p>Time to call her sister.</p><p>\u201cHe passes,\u201d Faith said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem, hon,\u201d said Pru. \u201cOpen your heart and all that crap. Jeremy was eons ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Jeremy,\u201d Faith said, ignoring the answering snort. \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about his name, though. Clint Bundt. It\u2019s abrupt. Clint Eastwood, sure, that works. But on anyone else, I don\u2019t know. Clint and Faith. Faith and Clint. Faith Bundt.\u201d It was much less pleasing than, oh, let\u2019s say, Faith and Jeremy or Jeremy and Faith. Not that she was hung up on the past or anything.</p><p>\u201cSounds okay to me,\u201d Pru said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re Prudence Vanderbeek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Pru said amiably, chewing in Faith\u2019s ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClint and Faith Bundt. It\u2019s just...off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then break up with him. Or take him to court and force him to change his name. Listen, I gotta go. It\u2019s bedtime for us farm folk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Give the kids a hug for me,\u201d Faith said. \u201cTell Abby I\u2019ll send her that link to the shoes she asked about. And tell Ned he\u2019s still my little bunny, even if he is technically an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed!\u201d her sister bellowed. \u201cFaith says you\u2019re still her little bunny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYay,\u201d came her nephew\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cGotta go, kid,\u201d said Pru. \u201cHey, you coming home for harvest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. I don\u2019t have another installation for a while.\u201d While Faith made a decent living as a landscape designer, most of her work was done on the computer. Her presence was only required for the last part of a job. Plus, grape harvest at Blue Heron was well worth a visit home.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Pru said. \u201cListen, ease up on the guy, have fun, talk soon, love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p> <p>Faith took another pull of Red Bull. Pru had a point. Her oldest sibling had been happily married for twenty-three years, after all. And who else was going to give her romantic advice? To Honor, her other sister, if you weren\u2019t calling from the hospital, you were wasting her time. Jack was their brother and thus useless on these matters. And Dad...well, Dad was still in mourning for Mom, who\u2019d been gone for nineteen years.</p><p>The wash of guilt was all too familiar.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this,\u201d Faith told herself, changing the mental subject. \u201cWe can fall in love again.\u201d</p><p>Certainly a better option than having Jeremy Lyon be her first and only love.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of her face in the rearview mirror, that hint of bewilderment and sorrow she always felt when she thought of Jeremy.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Levi,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t keep your mouth shut, could you?\u201d</p> <p>TWO NIGHTS LATER, Faith was starting to think that Clint Bundt was indeed worth the ten minutes she\u2019d taken to shave her legs and the six it\u2019d taken to wrestle herself into the microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment she\u2019d bought on QVC last month. (Hope. It sprung eternal.) Clint had picked an upscale Thai place with a koi pond in the entryway, red silk wall hangings making the room glow with flattering light. They sat in a U-shaped booth, very cozily, Faith thought. It was so romantic. Also, the food was really good, not to mention the lovely Russian River chardonnay.</p><p>Clint\u2019s eyes kept dropping to her cle**age. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you look good enough to eat.\u201d He grinned like a naughty boy, and Faith\u2019s girl parts gave a mighty tingle. \u201cI have to tell you,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe very first second I saw you, I felt like I was hit on the side of the head with a two-by-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Faith said, taking a sip of her wine. So far as she could recall, she\u2019d been dressed in filthy jeans, work boots and soaked to the skin. She\u2019d been moving some plants around in the rain, trying to ease the mind of the city councilman who was concerned over the park\u2019s water runoff (which, please, had been nonexistent; she was a certified landscape architect, thank you very much).</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I was capable of speech,\u201d Clint now said. \u201cI probably made a fool out of myself.\u201d He gave her a sheepish look as if acknowledging he\u2019d been quite the love-struck suitor.</p><p>And to think she hadn\u2019t even noticed that he\u2019d been...well...dazzled by her. That\u2019s how it went, right? Love came when you weren\u2019t looking, except in the case of the millions who\u2019d found mates on Match.com, but, hey. It sounded good.</p><p>The server came and whisked away their dinner plates, setting down coffee, cream and sugar. \u201cDid you see anything you liked on the dessert menu?\u201d he asked, smiling at them. Because really, they were an adorable couple.</p><p>\u201cHow about the mango cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e?\u201d Clint said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll survive watching you eat it, but what a way to go.\u201d</p><p>Hello! Tingling at a 6.8 on the Richter scale. \u201cThe cr\u00e8me brulee sounds great,\u201d Faith said, and the waiter sped away.</p> <p>Clint slid a little closer, putting his arm around Faith\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou look amazing in that dress,\u201d he murmured, trailing a finger down the neckline. \u201cWhat are the odds of me getting you out of it later on?\u201d He dropped a kiss on the side of her neck.</p><p>Oh, melt! Another kiss. \u201cThe odds are getting better,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, Faith,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling her ear, causing her entire side to electrify.</p><p>\u201cI like you, too,\u201d she said and looked into his pretty brown eyes. His finger slid lower, and she could feel her skin heating up, getting blotchy, no doubt, the curse of the redhead. What the heck. She turned her face and kissed him on the lips, a soft, sweet, lingering kiss.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, lovebirds,\u201d said the waiter. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201d He set the dessert on the table with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d</p><p>The bark made all three of them jump. Clint\u2019s elbow hit her glass, the wine spilling onto the tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Clint said, shoving away from her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI do stuff like that all the time.\u201d</p><p>Clint wasn\u2019t looking at the wine.</p><p>A woman stood in front of their booth, a beautiful little boy dangling from her hands as she held him out in front of her. \u201cThis is what he\u2019s ignoring because of you, whore!\u201d</p><p>Faith looked behind her to see the whore, but the only thing there was the wall. She looked back at the woman, who was about her age and very pretty\u2014blond hair and fury-flushed cheeks. \u201cAre you...are you talking to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m talking to you, whore! This is what he\u2019s missing when he\u2019s wining and dining you. Our son! Our baby!\u201d She jiggled the toddler to demonstrate.</p><p>\u201cHey, no shaking the kid,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me, whore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy, put down!\u201d the toddler commanded. The woman obeyed, jamming her hands on her (thin) hips. The waiter caught Faith\u2019s eye and grimaced. He was probably g*y, and thus her ally.</p><p>Faith closed her mouth. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t... Clint, you\u2019re not married, are you?\u201d</p><p>Clint was holding up his hands, surrender-style. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said to the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s just someone I work with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, you are married!\u201d Faith blurted. \u201cWhere are you from? Are you from Nebraska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are, whore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint!\u201d Faith yelped. \u201cYou bas\u2014\u201d She remembered the kid, who looked at her solemnly, then scooped up a fingerful of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and stuck it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Faith said to Mrs. Clint Bundt (well, at least Faith wouldn\u2019t be saddled with that name). The kid spit out the dessert and reached for the sugar packets. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, whore. How dare you seduce my husband! How dare you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sedu\u2014doing anything to anyone, okay?\u201d Faith said, more than a little horrified that this conversation was taking place in front of a toddler (who looked like a baby Hobbit, he was so dang cute, licking sugar from the packet).</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a slut, whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Faith said tightly, \u201cyour husband was the one who...\u201d Again, the kid. \u201cAsk the waiter. Right?\u201d Yes, yes, get some confirmation from the friendly waiter.</p><p>\u201cUm...who\u2019s paying tonight?\u201d he asked. So much for the love she inspired in the g*ys.</p><p>\u201cIt was a business dinner,\u201d Clint interrupted. \u201cShe came onto me, and I didn\u2019t expect it, I didn\u2019t know what to do. Come on, let\u2019s go home, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd by home, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t mean your bachelor pad in Noe Valley, right?\u201d Faith bit out.</p><p>Clint ignored her. \u201cHi, Finn, how\u2019s it going, bud?\u201d He tousled his child\u2019s hair, then stood up and gave her a sorrowful, dignified look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Faith,\u201d he said somberly. \u201cI\u2019m a happily married man, and I have a beautiful family. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to work together anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cTake that, whore,\u201d said Clint\u2019s wife. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get, trying to break up my family!\u201d She put her hands on her h*ps and twisted out her leg, the Angelina Jolie Hip Displacement look.</p><p>\u201cHi, whore,\u201d the little boy said, ripping open another sugar packet.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. He really was cute.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak to my child!\u201d Mrs. Bundt said. \u201cI don\u2019t want your filthy whore mouth speaking to my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHypocrite,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Clint scooped up the boy, who\u2019d managed to snag a few more sugar packets.</p><p>\u201cIf I ever see you near my husband, whore, you\u2019ll be sorry,\u201d Mrs. Bundt hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a whore, okay?\u201d Faith snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d said his wife, giving her the finger. Then the Bundts turned their backs to her and walked away from the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Faith called. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept with anyone in three years, okay? I\u2019m not a whore!\u201d The little boy waved cheerily from over his father\u2019s shoulder, and Faith gave a small wave in return.</p><p>The Bundts were gone. Faith grabbed her water glass and chugged, then rested the glass against her hot cheek. Her heart was pounding so hard she felt sick.</p><p>\u201cThree years?\u201d said one of the diners.</p><p>The waiter gave her the check. \u201cI\u2019ll take that whenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said. Great. On top of all that, she had to pay for dinner, too.</p><p>\u201cYour tip would\u2019ve been a lot bigger if you\u2019d backed me up,\u201d she told him, digging in her purse for her wallet.</p><p>\u201cYou really do look great in that dress,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d paid the bill (and really, Clint, thanks for ordering a seventy-five dollar bottle of wine), she went out into the damp, cold San Francisco air and started walking. It wasn\u2019t far to her apartment, even in heels. The streets of San Francisco were nothing compared to the steep hills of home. Consider it her cardio. Pissed-Off Woman Workout. The Stomp of the Righteous and Rejected. It was noisy down here at the wharf, the seagulls crying, music blaring out from every bar and restaurant, a dozen different languages bouncing around her.</p><p>Back home, the only sound would be the late-season crickets and the call of the owl family who lived in an old maple at the edge of the cemetery. The air would be sweet with the smell of grapes, tinged with wood smoke, because already, the nights would be cooling down. From her old bedroom window, she\u2019d be able to see all the way to Keuka. She\u2019d spent her childhood playing in woods and fields, breathing the clean air of western New York, swimming in glacier-formed lakes. Her love of the outdoors was the main reason she\u2019d become a landscape architect\u2014the chance to woo people from their increasingly interior lives and enjoy nature a little bit more.</p><p>Maybe it was time to start thinking seriously about moving back. That had always been the plan, anyway. Live in Manningsport, raise a family, be close to her sibs and father.</p><p>Clint Bundt. Married with a kid. Such a hemorrhoid. Well. Soon she\u2019d be home with her dog. Liza probably was out with her guy, the Wonderful Mike, so Faith could watch Real Housewives and eat some Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s.</p><p>Why was it so hard to find the right guy? Faith didn\u2019t think she was too picky; she just wanted someone who wasn\u2019t g*y, married, unkind, amoral or too short. Someone who\u2019d look at her...well, the way Jeremy had. His dark, liquid eyes would tell her she was the best thing that ever happened to him, always a smile in their depths. Never once had she doubted that he loved her completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her phone rang, and she fished it out of her purse. Honor. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, feeling the faint pang of alarm she always felt when her sister called. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Dad recently?\u201d her sister said.</p><p>\u201cUm...yeah. We talk almost every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose you\u2019ve heard about Lorena.\u201d</p> <p>Faith twisted to avoid a cute guy in a Derek Jeter T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m a Yankees fan, too,\u201d she told him with a smile. He frowned and took the hand of an irritable-looking woman next to him. Message received, buddy, and jeesh. Only trying to be friendly. \u201cWho\u2019s Lorena?\u201d she asked her sister.</p><p>Honor sighed. \u201cFaith, you might want to get home before Dad gets married.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>LEVI COOPER, CHIEF OF POLICE of the Manningsport Police Department, all two and a half of them, tried to give people a break. He did. Even the tourists with the lead feet, Red Sox stickers and complete disregard for speed limits. He parked the cruiser in plain sight, the radar gun clearly visible. Hi there, welcome to Manningsport, you\u2019re going way too fast and here I am, about to pull you over, so slow down, pal. The town depended on visitors, and September was prime tourism season; the leaves were starting to turn, buses had been rolling in and out of town all week, and every vineyard in the area had some special event going on.</p><p>But the law was the law.</p> <p>Plus, he\u2019d just let Colleen O\u2019Rourke off with a stern lecture and a warning while she tried to look remorseful.</p><p>So another speeder just wasn\u2019t going to be tolerated today. This one, for example. Seventeen miles an hour over the limit, more than enough. Also, an out-of-towner; he could see the rental plates from here. The car was a painfully bright yellow Honda Civic, currently clocking in at forty-two miles per hour in a twenty-five-mile-an-hour zone. What if Carol Robinson and her merry band of geriatric power-walkers were out? What if the Nebbins kid was riding his bike? There hadn\u2019t been a fatal crash in Manningsport since he\u2019d been chief, and Levi planned on keeping it that way.</p><p>The yellow car sailed past him, not even a tap on the brakes. The driver wore a baseball cap and big sunglasses. Female. With a sigh, Levi put on the lights, gave the siren a blip and pulled onto the road. She didn\u2019t notice. He hit the siren again, and the driver seemed to realize that, yes, he was talking to her, and pulled over.</p><p>Grabbing his ticket pad, Levi got out of the cruiser. Wrote down the license plate number, then went over to the driver\u2019s side, where the window was lowering. \u201cWelcome to Manningsport,\u201d he said, not smiling.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>It was Faith Holland. A giant Golden retriever shoved its head out of the window and barked once, wagging happily.</p> <p>\u201cLevi,\u201d she said, as if they\u2019d seen each other last week at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHolland. You visiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s amazing. How did you guess?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, not amused, and let a few beats pass. It worked; her cheeks flushed, and she looked away. \u201cSo. Forty-two in a twenty-five-mile-an-hour zone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was thirty-five,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe dropped it last year.\u201d</p><p>The dog whined, so Levi petted him, making the dog try to crawl over Faith\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cBlue, get back,\u201d Faith ordered.</p> <p>Blue. Right. Same dog as from a few years ago.</p><p>\u201cLevi, how about a warning? I have a, um, a family emergency, so if you could drop the cop act, that\u2019d be super.\u201d She gave him a tight smile, almost meeting his eyes, and pushed her hair behind one ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the emergency?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather is...uh...he\u2019s not feeling well. Goggy\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you lie about stuff like that?\u201d he asked. Levi was well acquainted with the elder Hollands, as they made up about ten percent of his work week. And if Mr. Holland really was under the weather, he\u2019d bet Mrs. Holland would be picking out his funeral clothes and planning a cruise.</p><p>Faith sighed. \u201cLook, Levi. I just took the red-eye from San Francisco. Can you give me a break? Sorry I was going too fast.\u201d She tapped her fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019ll take a warning. Can I go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLicense and registration, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill got that branch up your ass, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLicense and registration, and please exit the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>She mumbled something under her breath, then groped around in the glove compartment, her shirt coming out of her jeans to reveal a patch of creamy flesh. Looked like the fitness revolution had passed her by; then again, she\u2019d always been a little lush ripe chunky, ever since he could remember. The dog took the opportunity to shove his head out again, and Levi scratched him behind the ear.</p><p>Faith slammed the glove box shut, shoved some papers in Levi\u2019s hand, got out of the car, nearly hitting him with the door. \u201cStay put, Blue.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at Levi.</p><p>He glanced at her license, then at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad picture,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWant a tissue sample?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be necessary. This has expired, though. Another fine.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and she crossed her arms under her chest. Still had that amazing rack.</p><p>\u201cHow was Afghanistan?\u201d she asked, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cReally great. I\u2019m thinking of getting a summer place there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I wonder, Levi? Why are some people always such hemorrhoids? You ever wonder that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Are you aware that antagonizing an officer of the law is a felony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. How fascinating. Can you get it in gear, please? I want to see my family.\u201d</p><p>He signed the paper and handed it to her. She wadded it up and tossed it in the car. \u201cAm I free to go, Officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chief now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSee someone about that branch.\u201d She got into the car and drove off. Not too fast, though not slowly, either.</p><p>Levi watched her go, releasing a breath. Up to Blue Heron Vineyard, the place her family had owned since America was a baby, to the big white house on the Hill, as her neighborhood was called.</p><p>He\u2019d always known Faith Holland, the kind of girl who hugged her girlfriends six times a day in school, as if it\u2019d been weeks since they\u2019d seen each other, not two periods. She reminded him of a puppy trying to woo prospective owners at the pound... Like me! Like me! I\u2019m really nice! Jessica, Levi\u2019s old neighbor from the trailer park and on-and-off high school girlfriend, had dubbed her Princess Super-Cute, always bouncing around in frilly outfits and pastel colors. Once Faith had started dating Jeremy...it was like eating a bowl of Lucky Charms topped with syrup, so sweet it made your teeth ache. He was surprised bluebirds hadn\u2019t fluttered around her head.</p><p>Funny, how she\u2019d never noticed her boyfriend was g*y.</p><p>Levi knew she\u2019d been back over the years\u2014Christmas and Thanksgiving, a weekend here and there, but her visits were short and sweet. She sure never stopped by the police station, though he was friendly with her family; sometimes her grandparents would ask him to stay for dinner after they\u2019d summoned him to the house, and once in a while, he\u2019d have a beer with her father or brother at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. But Faith would never think to drop by and say hello.</p><p>Yet once upon a time, when she\u2019d cried herself dehydrated, she\u2019d fallen asleep with her head in his lap.</p><p>Levi got back into his cruiser. Plenty of work to do. No point in dwelling on the past.</p><p>FAITH KNOCKED ON THE BACK door of her father\u2019s house and happily braced for impact. \u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cFaith! Oh, honey, finally!\u201d cried Goggy, leading the stampede. \u201cYou\u2019re late! Didn\u2019t I tell you dinner was at noon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust got hung up a little,\u201d Faith said, not wanting to mention Levi Cooper, Ass Pain.</p><p>Abby, now sixteen and so pretty, wrapped herself around Faith, burbling out compliments: \u201cI love your earrings, you smell so good, can I come live with you?\u201d Pops kissed both her cheeks and told her she was his prettiest girl, and Faith breathed in the comforting scent of grapes and Bengay. Ned hugged her amiably, despite being twenty-one, and tolerated a hair muss, and Pru gave her a hard hug, as well.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s absence was still the most powerful thing in the room.</p><p>And finally there was Dad, who waited his turn for a solo hug. His eyes were wet when he pulled back. \u201cHi, sweetpea,\u201d he said, and Faith\u2019s heart gave a tug.</p><p>\u201cMissed you, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, sweetheart.\u201d He ran a purple-stained hand over her hair and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Johnson\u2019s not here?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her day off,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. I just haven\u2019t seen her since June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t approve of Grandpa\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d Abby whispered as she petted Blue.</p><p>\u201cHi, sis,\u201d Jack said, handing her a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cHello, favorite sibling,\u201d she answered, taking a hearty slug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink it like it\u2019s Gatorade, sweetpea,\u201d her father chided. \u201cWe\u2019re winemakers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad,\u201d Faith said. \u201cNice aroma of freshly cut grass, a rich, buttery texture, and I\u2019m getting overtones of apricot with a hint of lemon. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you get any vanilla? Honor said vanilla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Far be it for Faith to contradict Honor, who ran everything under the moon at Blue Heron Vineyards. \u201cWhere is Honor, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that phone of hers,\u201d Goggy said darkly. She tended not to trust anything invented after 1957. \u201cGet in the dining room before the food gets cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was serious when I asked to come live with you,\u201d Abby said. Prudence sighed and took a slug of her own wine. \u201cPlus,\u201d Abby went on, \u201cthen I can establish residency in California and go to some awesome school out there at half price. See, Mom? Just saving you and Dad some money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s Carl, speaking of my favorite brother-in-law?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cHiding,\u201d Pru answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well! You must be Faith!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice boomed as the downstairs bathroom door opened, the sound of a flushing toilet in the background.</p><p>Faith opened her mouth, then closed it. \u201cOh. I\u2014I am. Lorena, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d</p><p>The woman Honor had warned about was a sight to behold indeed. Dull black hair, obviously dyed, makeup so thick you could carve in it and a squat body shown in horrifying detail through a clinging, leopard-print shirt.</p><p>The woman shoved a Sharpie pen in her cle**age where it stayed, quivering, like a syringe. \u201cJust touching up my roots!\u201d she announced. \u201cWanted to make a nice impression on the little princess! Hello there! Give us a hug!\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s breath left her in a whoosh as Lorena wrapped her in a python grip. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she wheezed as Pru gave her a significant look.</p><p>\u201cCan we please eat before my death?\u201d Pops asked. \u201cThe old woman here wouldn\u2019t let me have my cheese. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, die already,\u201d Goggy answered. \u201cNo one\u2019s stopping you. I\u2019ll barely notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Phyllis Nebbins would notice. She got a new hip two months ago, Faithie. Looks like she\u2019s seventy-five again, out there with her grandson, always with a smile. Nice to see a happy woman.\u201d</p><p>Goggy slammed down a massive bowl of salt potatoes. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy once you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful, Goggy,\u201d Ned said.</p><p>\u201cYou two are such hoots!\u201d Lorena practically yelled. \u201cI love it!\u201d</p><p>Faith sat down, inhaling the scent of Goggy\u2019s ham, salt potatoes and home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were two houses on Blue Heron Vineyard: the Old House, where Goggy and Pops lived, a Colonial that had been updated twice since being built in 1781\u2014once to install indoor plumbing, then again in 1932. Faith and her siblings grew up here, in the New House, a graceful if creaky old Federal built in 1873, where Dad lived with Honor and Mrs. Johnson, the housekeeper who\u2019d been with them since Mom died.</p><p>And speaking of Honor... \u201cSorry, everyone,\u201d she said. She paused, gave Faith a brief kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou finally got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Honor.\u201d She ignored the slight reprimand.</p><p>Pru and Jack were sixteen and eight years older than Faith respectively, and generally viewed their baby sister as adorable, if slightly incompetent (which Faith had never minded, as it got her out of a lot of chores back in the day). Honor, though... She was four years older; Faith had been a surprise. Maybe Honor had never forgiven Faith for stealing the title of baby of the family.</p> <p>More likely, though, she\u2019d never gotten over the fact that Faith had caused their mother\u2019s death.</p><p>Faith had epilepsy, first diagnosed when she was about five. Jack had filmed a seizure once (typical boy), and Faith had been horrified to see herself oblivious, her muscles jerking and clenching, eyes as vacant as a dead cow\u2019s. It was assumed that Constance Holland had been distracted by one such seizure and therefore hadn\u2019t seen the car that had smashed into them, killing Mom. Honor had never forgiven Faith...and Faith didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you just sitting there, Faith?\u201d Goggy demanded. \u201cEat up, sweetheart. Who knows what you\u2019ve been living on in California?\u201d Her grandmother passed her a plate loaded with smoked ham, buttered salt potatoes, green beans with butter and lemon, and braised carrots (with butter). Faith imagined she gained a pound just by looking at it.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lorena, you and my dad are...?\u201d Faith asked above the background noise of her grandparents bickering over how much salt Pops should put on his already heavily salted meal.</p><p>\u201cSpecial friends, sweetheart, special, special friends,\u201d the woman said, adjusting her rather massive br**sts. \u201cRight, Johnny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d he agreed amiably. \u201cShe was dying to meet you, Faith.\u201d</p><p>According to Honor, Lorena Creech had met Dad about a month earlier during a tour of Blue Heron. Everyone in the area knew John Holland had been devastated by his wife\u2019s death, had never wanted to date anyone, was happy among his children, grandchildren and grapes. Any attempts at a relationship had been gently rebuffed in the early days until it was accepted that John Holland Jr. would remain a widower the rest of his life.</p><p>Enter Lorena Creech, a transplant from Arizona, clearly a gold digger, and not a candidate for stepmother. All three local Holland kids had discussed this with Dad, but he\u2019d just laughed and waved off their concern. And while Dad was many things, Faith thought, watching as Lorena held the silverware up to the light, he wasn\u2019t the most observant of men. No one had anything against Dad finding a nice woman to marry, but no one wanted Lorena to be sleeping upstairs in Mom\u2019s old bed, either.</p><p>\u201cSo how many acres have you got here?\u201d Lorena asked, taking a huge bite of ham. Subtle.</p><p>\u201cQuite a few,\u201d Honor said icily.</p><p>\u201cSubdividable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, some of it is, Honor, honey,\u201d Dad said. \u201cOver my dead body, of course. More green beans, Lorena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d Lorena said. \u201cThe whole family together! My late husband was sterile, Faith. A groin injury when he was a boy. Tractor backed up, squished him in the soft parts, so we never could have kids, though, hell, we sure got it on!\u201d</p><p>Goggy was staring at Lorena as if she was a snake in the toilet. Jack drained his wine.</p><p>\u201cGood for you!\u201d Pops said. \u201cHave some more ham, sweetheart.\u201d He nudged the plate across the table toward Lorena, whose appetite was not restricted to the boudoir, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cSo, Faith,\u201d Jack said, \u201cDad says you\u2019ll be staying here for a while.\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded and wiped her mouth. \u201cYep. Finally gonna fix up the old barn up on Rose Ridge. I\u2019ll be here for about two months.\u201d The longest she\u2019d been back since her wedding debacle, and not just to fix up the barn, either. Both the mission and the length of time gave her a pang of alarm.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Abby said.</p> <p>\u201cYay,\u201d Ned echoed, winking at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with the old barn?\u201d Pops asked. \u201cSpeak up, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be turning it into a space for special events, Pops,\u201d she explained. \u201cPeople would rent it out, and it\u2019d bring in some extra income for the vineyard. Weddings, anniversary parties, stuff like that.\u201d She\u2019d first come up with the idea when she was in graduate school\u2014transform the old stone barn into something that blended into the landscape effortlessly, something modern and old at the same time.</p><p>\u201cOh! Weddings! I\u2019d love to get married again,\u201d Lorena said, winking at Dad, who simply grinned.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like too much work for you, sweetheart,\u201d Goggy said.</p><p>Faith smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s a great spot, and I\u2019ve already got some plans drafted, so I\u2019ll show them to everyone and see what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can do that in two months?\u201d Lorena asked around a potato.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Faith said. \u201cBarring unforeseen complications and all that.\u201d It would be her biggest project yet, and on home turf, too.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you do again? Your father\u2019s told me, hell\u2019s bells, all he can do is talk about you kids, but I forget.\u201d Lorena smiled at her. One of her teeth was gold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a landscape architect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see her work, Lorena,\u201d Dad said. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Daddy. I design gardens, parks, industrial open space, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a gardener?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I hire gardeners and landscapers, though. I come up with the design and make sure it\u2019s implemented the right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boss, in other words,\u201d Lorena said. \u201cGood for you, babe! Hey, are those Hummel figurines real? Those get a pretty penny on eBay, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were my mother\u2019s,\u201d Honor bit out.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. A very pretty penny. How about some more of that ham, Ma?\u201d she asked Goggy, holding out her plate.</p><p>Lorena...okay, she was kind of terrifying, there was no getting around it. Faith had hoped that Honor was exaggerating.</p><p>A prickle of nervous energy sang through Faith\u2019s joints. Before she left San Francisco, she and her siblings had had a conference call. Dad was slightly clueless, it was agreed\u2014he\u2019d once been nicked by a car as he stood in the road, staring up at the sky to see if it might rain\u2014but if he was ready to start dating, they could find him someone more suitable. Faith immediately volunteered for the job. She\u2019d come home, work on transforming the old barn, and find Dad somebody great. Someone wonderful, someone who understood him and appreciated how loyal and hardworking and kind he was. Someone to take away the gaping hole Mom\u2019s death had left.</p><p>Finally, Faith would have a chance at redemption.</p><p>And while she was at it, she\u2019d finally be able to do something for Blue Heron, too, the family business that employed everyone except her.</p><p>Dinner was dominated by Lorena\u2019s commentary, bickering between Ned and Abby, who really should be too old for that, as well as the occasional death threat between Goggy and Pops. Norman Rockwell meets Stephen King, Faith thought fondly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do these dishes. Don\u2019t anyone move,\u201d Goggy said, a hint of tragedy creeping into her voice.</p><p>\u201cKids!\u201d Pru barked, and Ned and Abby jolted into action and started clearing.</p><p>Honor poured herself an ounce of wine. \u201cFaith, you\u2019ll be staying with Goggy and Pops, did Dad tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Faith asked, shooting Pops a quick smile to make up for the panic in her voice. Not that she didn\u2019t love her grandparents, but living with them?</p><p>\u201cPops is slowing down,\u201d Pru said in a whisper, as both grands were a bit hard of hearing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not slowing down,\u201d Pops protested. \u201cWho wants to arm wrestle? Jack, you up for it, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today, Pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look good to me, Dad!\u201d Lorena said. \u201cReally good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your father,\u201d Goggy growled.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind Faith staying with you, would you?\u201d Dad asked. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve been getting a bit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit what?\u201d Goggy demanded.</p><p>\u201cHomicidal?\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>Goggy glared at him, then looked more gently at Faith. \u201cWe would love for you to stay with us, sweetheart. But as a guest, not a babysitter.\u201d Another glare was distributed around the table before Goggy got up and went into the kitchen to instruct the kids.</p><p>\u201cPops, I wanted you to check out the merlot grapes,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cCount me in!\u201d Lorena barked cheerfully, and the three left the dining room.</p><p>With Abby and Ned in the kitchen, it was just the four Holland kids around the table. \u201cI\u2019m really staying with them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d Honor said. \u201cI have a bunch of stuff in your room, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo check this out,\u201d Pru said, adjusting the collar of her flannel shirt. \u201cCarl suggested that I get a bikini wax the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? All of a sudden you\u2019re a prude? Who drove you home from that strip club when you got drunk, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was seventeen years ago,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo big deal. Carl wants to \u2018spice things up.\u2019\u201d Pru made quote marks with her fingers. \u201cThe man is lucky he\u2019s getting any, that\u2019s what I think. What\u2019s your problem, Jack?\u201d she called to Jack\u2019s back as he left.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about your sex life, either,\u201d Honor said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll return the favor and won\u2019t tell you about mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you have one,\u201d Pru said.</p><p>\u201cYou might be surprised,\u201d Honor returned.</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t talk to you guys, who am I gonna tell? My kids? Dad? You\u2019re my sisters. You have to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell us,\u201d Faith said. \u201cSo, no bikini wax, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Faithie.\u201d Pru leaned back and crossed her arms across her chest. \u201cSo he says to me, why not give it a try? Like the Playboy models? So I say to him, \u2018First of all, Carl, if you have a Playboy in this house, you\u2019re a dead man walking. We have a teenage daughter, and I don\u2019t want her looking at fake boobs and slutty hair.\u2019\u201d She shifted in her chair. \u201cA bikini wax! At my age! I have enough trouble with facial hair management.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of terrifying older women,\u201d Faith said, ducking as Pru tried to swat her, \u201cLorena Creech. Yikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked Jack to sit on her lap the other day,\u201d Pru said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen his face.\u201d</p><p>Faith laughed, stopping as Honor cut her a cool look. \u201cIt\u2019s funny until Dad finds himself married to someone who\u2019s only after his money,\u201d Honor said.</p><p>\u201cDad has money?\u201d Pru quipped. \u201cThis is news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he wouldn\u2019t get married without it being someone great,\u201d Faith added.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But this is the first woman he\u2019s ever had as his \u2018special friend,\u2019 too. And why her, I have no idea.\u201d Honor adjusted her hair band. \u201cShe\u2019s asked Sharon Wiles about the price of building lots the other day, so, Faith, don\u2019t waste time, okay? I don\u2019t have the time to cruise dating websites. You do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With that, she left, going back to her office, no doubt. All Honor did was work.</p><p>THAT NIGHT, AFTER FAITH had brought her stuff to the Old House and returned the rental car to Corning (Dad had said she could use Brown Betty, the aging Subaru wagon, while she was here), she climbed between the clean sheets in her grandparents\u2019 guest room and waited for sleep.</p><p>Mom wasn\u2019t the only one whose absence had been felt today. Faith still half expected to see Jeremy there, as well. He\u2019d always loved her family dinners.</p><p>And at the moment, he was probably just down the road.</p> <p>She\u2019d been home seven times since her wedding day, and she hadn\u2019t seen him. Not once. Granted, she\u2019d only been home for a few days at a time. She\u2019d been into town, to the bar owned by her best friends, Colleen and Connor O\u2019Rourke, but Jeremy hadn\u2019t shown up. He hadn\u2019t stopped by her family\u2019s house, though he did while she was away. People had gotten over the shock of his coming out, including her family (eventually). Jeremy had been a part of their lives, too, not to mention their doctor and next-door neighbor, though next door was a mile away.</p><p>But when she was home, he lay low.</p><p>For the first six weeks after their non-wedding, she and Jeremy had called each other every day, sometimes two or three times a day. Even with his stunning news, it was hard to believe they weren\u2019t together anymore. From the moment she\u2019d seen him by her bedside in the nurse\u2019s office, for eight solid years, she\u2019d loved him without one moment\u2019s doubt. They were supposed to be married, have kids, have a wonderful long life together, and the fact that all those future decades were just whisked away...it was hard to wrap her heart around it.</p><p>He tried to explain why he\u2019d let things go so far. That was the hardest part. She\u2019d loved him so much, they\u2019d been best friends...and he never even tried to bring it up.</p><p>He loved her, he said it repeatedly, and Faith knew it was true. Every day, every conversation, he apologized, sometimes crying. He was so, so sorry for hurting her. So sorry for not telling her, for not accepting what he knew in his heart.</p> <p>One night six weeks after their wedding day, after they\u2019d talked to each other in gentle voices for an hour, Faith had finally told Jeremy what they both already knew: they needed to truly break up. No more emails, no more calls, no more texts.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Jeremy had whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love you,\u201d Faith had said, her voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always love you, too.\u201d</p><p>And then, after a long, long moment, Faith had pushed the button to end the call. Sat there on the edge of the bed, staring into space. The next day, she\u2019d been offered a freelance job working with a well-known landscape designer at a new marina, and her post-Jeremy life began. Her father had come out to visit three times that year\u2014unheard of if you were a farmer\u2014and Pru and the kids had come once. They all had called and written and texted.</p><p>Forcing yourself out of love...it seemed impossible. Sometimes, she\u2019d forget\u2014someone asked her if she wanted kids, and her answer was, \u201cWe definitely do,\u201d and then came the slap of remembering that there would be no beautiful, smiling, dark-haired kids running through the fields of the two vineyards.</p> <p>And now, here in the Old House, it was impossible not to think of Jeremy. Memories of him were everywhere\u2014he\u2019d sat on the front porch, promising her father he\u2019d take good care of her. He\u2019d pushed Abby on the swing when she was little, took Ned for rides in his convertible, flirted with Pru and Honor, had beers with Jack. He\u2019d helped her repaint this very room the same pale lilac it was now. They\u2019d kissed right in that corner (lovely, chaste kisses, perhaps not what one would expect from one\u2019s twenty-six-year-old fianc\u00e9) until Goggy had walked in on them and told them there was no kissing in her house, she didn\u2019t care if they were engaged.</p><p>Faith had kept one photo of her and Jeremy, taken one weekend when they\u2019d gone to the Outer Banks...the two of them in sweatshirts, hugging, the wind blowing her hair, Jeremy\u2019s big smile. Every day, she forced herself to look at it, and a small, cruel part of her brain would tell her to get over it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t deserved him, anyway.</p><p>But for those eight years that they\u2019d been together...it seemed that the universe had finally forgiven her for her dark secret, had presented Jeremy as a sign of absolution.</p><p>Seemed like the universe had the last laugh, and its agent had been Levi Cooper. Levi, who\u2019d always judged her and found her ridiculous.</p><p>Levi, who had known and never said a word.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>LEVI COOPER MET JEREMY LYON just before senior year began. He never expected that they\u2019d become friends. Economically, that wasn\u2019t how things worked.</p> <p>Manningsport sat at the edge of Keuka Lake. The town green was ringed with picturesque businesses: antiques stores, a bridal shop, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Tavern, a little bookstore and Hugo\u2019s, the French restaurant where Jessica Dunn waited tables. Then there was the Hill, rising up and away from the village, the land of the rich kids whose parents were bankers and lawyers and doctors, or whose parents owned the vineyards themselves: the Kleins, the Smithingtons, the Hollands. Busloads of tourists would come in from April to October to see the beautiful lake and countryside, taste the wine and leave with a case or two.</p><p>Farther away from the lake were the pristine Mennonite farms, stretching on the hills, dotted with clusters of black-and-white cows, men in dark clothes driving iron-wheeled tractors, women with bonnets and long skirts selling cheese and jam at the farmers market on the weekends.</p><p>And then there were the other places, the long stretches of in-between. Levi lived at the base of the wrong side of the vineyards, where the shadow of the Hill made night fall a little earlier. His part of town had the dump, a grimy grocery store and a Laundromat where, legend had it, drugs were sold.</p><p>In elementary school, the well-meaning rich parents would invite the entire class to the birthday parties, and Levi would go, along with Jessica Dunn and Tiffy Ames. They\u2019d remember their manners and thank the mom for inviting them, hand over the gift that had strained the weekly budget. As for reciprocal invitations, no. You didn\u2019t have the class over for your birthday when you lived in a trailer park. You might hang out in school when you were young, might meet up in the summer to jump off Meering Falls, but way too soon, the economic divide started to matter. The rich kids started talking about what clothes they wore or what kind of new car their folks drove and where they\u2019d be going on vacation, and that time you went fishing off Henleys\u2019 dock didn\u2019t matter so much.</p><p>And so, Levi hung out with Jessica and Tiffy and Asswipe Jones, whose real name was Ashwick (the kid\u2019s mother had been addicted to some British television show and clearly had zero clue about kids and names). Levi and his half sister grew up in West\u2019s Trailer Park, in a cheap double-wide that leaked in two spots, no matter how many times he patched the roof. After his mom had Sarah when Levi was ten (and another man had moved out of the picture), it felt pretty cramped, but it was clean and happy. It wasn\u2019t horrible, not by a long shot, but it wasn\u2019t the Hill or the Village. Everyone understood the difference, and if you didn\u2019t, you were either ignorant of real life or from out of town.</p><p>On the first day of football practice a month before senior year started, Coach introduced a new student. Jeremy Lyon was \u201csomeone who\u2019s gonna teach you lazy-ass pussies how to play football,\u201d Coach said, and Jeremy went around and shook hands with every damn member of the team. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Jeremy, how\u2019s it going? Nice to meet you. Jeremy Lyon, good to meet you, dude.\u201d</p><p>Gay was the first word that came to Levi\u2019s mind.</p><p>But no one else seemed to pick up on it\u2014maybe because Jeremy could play. After an hour, it was obvious he was crazy good at football. He looked as if he\u2019d been in the NFL for years\u2014six-foot-three, rock-solid muscle and a frame that could withstand three linebackers trying to wrestle him to the ground. He could thread a needle with that football, could dodge and twist and slip into the end zone, using what Coach called \u201cNotre Dame razzle-dazzle.\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s job as wide receiver was to get downfield as fast as possible and catch those beautiful passes. He was pretty good at football\u2014which wasn\u2019t going to translate into a scholarship no matter how much his mom hoped it would\u2014but Jeremy was great. After four hours, the team started to speculate that they might have their first winning season in nine years.</p><p>On Friday of that first week, Jeremy invited everyone to his place for pizza. And quite the place it was; it was all modern and shit, windows everywhere, the kitchen floor so shiny that Levi took off his shoes. The living room furniture was white and sleek, like a movie set. Jeremy\u2019s room had a king-size bed, a state-of-the-art Mac, a huge TV with a PlayStation and about fifty games. His parents introduced themselves as Ted and Elaine and made it seem like nothing could be more fun than having thirty-four high school boys over. The pizza was homemade (in the pizza oven, which was one of four ovens in the kitchen), and there were platters of massive sandwiches on that expensive bread with the Italian name. Every kind of pop\u2014the fancy kind, not generic, like Levi\u2019s mom bought. They had a wine cellar and a special wine fridge and beers from every microbrewery around. When Asswipe Jones asked for a beer, Mrs. Lyon just ruffled his hair and said she didn\u2019t feel up for jail today, and Asswipe didn\u2019t seem to mind one bit.</p><p>Levi walked through the house, carefully holding his bottle of Virgil\u2019s root beer, and tried not to gape. Modern paintings and abstract sculptures, a fireplace that took up an entire wall, an outdoor fireplace on the deck, a fireplace in the rec room downstairs, where there was also a pool table, foosball, another huge TV and PlayStation and a fully stocked bar.</p><p>Then, abruptly, Jeremy was at his side. \u201cThanks for coming tonight, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Levi said. \u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. My parents went a little nuts, I think. Like, do we really need a statue of Zeus?\u201d He grinned and rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cHey, you wanna hang out tomorrow? Maybe catch a movie or just stay here?\u201d</p><p>Levi took a long drink of pop, then glanced at Jeremy. Yeah. Gay, he was almost sure. \u201cUh, listen, dude,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a girlfriend.\u201d Well, he slept with Jessica once in a while, if that counted. But still. Message given: I\u2019m straight.</p><p>\u201cCool. Well, you can both come if you don\u2019t have anything better to do.\u201d Jeremy paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody yet, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>It was a patent request, and why him, Levi didn\u2019t know. Eventually, he supposed, Jeremy would be told by some other rich kid that the Coopers were white trash, give or take, that Levi didn\u2019t own a car and worked two after-school jobs. But for now, a chance to hang out here, in this place, get a little peek at how the other half lived... \u201cSure. Thanks. I\u2019ll see if she\u2019s free. Her name\u2019s Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Seven o\u2019clock? My mom\u2019s a great cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, baby,\u201d his mom said, coming into the room with a tray of sandwiches. Seeing the two of them standing together, she froze. Her smile was suddenly just a stretch of the mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, Mom.\u201d Jeremy put his arm around his petite mother and kissed her on the head, then snagged a sandwich. \u201cShe beats me if I say otherwise,\u201d he added to Levi.</p><p>Mrs. Lyon was looking at Levi, a small frown between her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name again, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi,\u201d Jeremy answered for him. \u201cHe\u2019s a wide receiver. We\u2019re gonna hang out tomorrow, if that\u2019s okay. His girlfriend\u2019s coming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you have a girlfriend!\u201d The mom instantly relaxed. \u201cHow nice! Of course! Yes, yes, both of you should come over. It\u2019d be lovely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe might have to work,\u201d Levi said. \u201cI\u2019ll check. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your girlfriend have a friend?\u201d Mrs. Lyon asked.</p><p>\u201cThere she goes, trying to find her future daughter-in-law,\u201d Jeremy said, smiling easily. There was a crash from upstairs, followed by a curse. \u201cThat sounds like soda on white upholstery to me. Told you not to buy that couch,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a bunch of animals,\u201d his mom said.</p> <p>\u201cHate to break it to you, but we pretty much are,\u201d Levi said. Jeremy\u2019s grin widened, and he went with his mom to clean up the mess, presumably.</p><p>So, yeah. Jeremy was g*y. Or just...Californian. Or both.</p><p>Levi went back the next night, needing to hitchhike from his own house after his shift ended at the marina. He\u2019d spent six hours cleaning boats in dry dock, which, while exhausting, allowed him to work shirtless and be ogled by Amber What\u2019s-Her-Name, who was here for the weekend. Jess didn\u2019t want to miss the Saturday night tips, so Levi went alone.</p><p>At Jeremy\u2019s, they ate with the parents (duck, if you could believe it), then did the typical guy things\u2014ate some more, played Soldier of Fortune on the downstairs PlayStation. When Jeremy asked where Levi was thinking of going to college, Levi hesitated, not wanting to clue Jeremy in just yet that college was so far out of reach he wasn\u2019t even thinking of applying. \u201cNot sure yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Jeremy answered easily, though Levi had heard he was being heavily recruited. \u201cSo. Tell me who the cute girls are at school. I\u2019m hoping to have a girlfriend this year.\u201d</p> <p>It was so awkward that Levi almost winced. Still, there was something about Jeremy, an innocence or something. \u201cDid you have a girl back home?\u201d he asked, testing him.</p><p>\u201cNot really. No one special. You know.\u201d Jeremy looked away. \u201cWith football and classes and all, it\u2019s kind of hard to find the time.\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s experience had been completely different; girls propositioned him constantly. Unless you were a prepubescent freshman, some chick would throw herself at you, so long as you wore the uniform on Friday nights, no matter how bad the team had sucked.</p><p>When it got late, Levi said he\u2019d walk back, even though it was seven miles down the Hill and around the Village to West\u2019s. But Jeremy insisted on driving him; he had a convertible, for God\u2019s sake, and the thing was, he didn\u2019t act like an ass**le. \u201cGreat night for a drive, huh?\u201d Jeremy said amiably, hopping into the car without opening the door. Levi followed suit, which was what people did if they had convertibles, he guessed.</p><p>Jeremy talked all the way to Route 15, telling Levi about life in Napa (pretty awesome), the reasons his parents wanted to relocate (his dad had gotten an ulcer, and they figured New York was more mellow when it came to wine-making), asking him questions about Coach and some of the teams they\u2019d be facing.</p><p>\u201cRight here. West\u2019s Trailer Park.\u201d He waited for Jeremy to realize he\u2019d picked the wrong teammate to befriend.</p> <p>\u201cGotcha. Which one?\u201d Jeremy asked, turning into the drive.</p><p>\u201cLast one on the left. Thanks for the ride, man. And thank your mom for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was great to have you. See you at practice.\u201d</p><p>Then he waved and executed a neat little turn and drove off, the sound of the motor humming quietly in the distance.</p><p>And so a friendship began. Over the next month, Jeremy frequently asked Levi over for dinner until one day, Levi\u2019s mother snapped, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him here? Are you ashamed of us or something?\u201d When Jeremy showed up, he had flowers for Levi\u2019s mother, told Sarah she was gorgeous and made no comment on the water-stained ceiling, the jug wine in the fridge or the fact that the four of them could barely fit in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs that tuna casserole?\u201d he said as Levi\u2019s mother set the Pyrex dish on the table. \u201cOh, man, that\u2019s my favorite! I haven\u2019t had this in ages. My mom is so stuck-up about food. This, though. This is living.\u201d He grinned like they\u2019d just pulled off a bank heist and ate three helpings while Mom cooed and sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat is a very nice boy,\u201d she announced after Jeremy had left, her tone slightly reverent.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Levi agreed.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a little old for him.\u201d He grinned at her, and she did blush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be his girlfriend,\u201d Sarah said fervently.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a little young,\u201d Levi said, pulling her hair. \u201cGo brush your teeth, kid.\u201d His sister obeyed.</p><p>His mom ran a hand through her dyed blond hair, revealing black roots. \u201cWell. I just meant, a handsome boy like that, all that charm and nice manners. Maybe some will rub off on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s not the type to go running around with slutty girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s definitely not.\u201d Levi raised an eyebrow at his mom. She missed his point.</p><p>\u201cWhat you see in that Jessica Dunn is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe puts out.\u201d His mom slapped his head, and Levi ducked, grinning. \u201cShe\u2019s also got a great personality,\u201d he added. \u201cOr something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re horrible. Help me clean up. I bet your friend helps his mother.\u201d</p><p>One day, after school had started up again, Levi and Jeremy were heading into the cafeteria. The door was blocked by someone just standing there\u2014Princess Super-Cute, her red hair in a ponytail, always asking people to sign up to collect bottles or save the seals, her life\u2019s mission to make sure everyone on earth liked her. Now she was just standing there, oblivious to the throng of people who couldn\u2019t get in to eat lunch.</p><p>\u201cMove it, Holland,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Ah, shit, she was doing that thing, plucking at her little ruffly shirt and looking confused. Levi took a step forward, but before he could catch her, she crumpled to the floor and started jerking.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Jeremy blurted, flinging off his backpack to kneel at her side. \u201cHey, hey, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got epilepsy,\u201d Levi said. He pulled off his sweatshirt to stick under her head. A small crowd was forming, Faith\u2019s occasional seizure always a hit. Twelve years of the same kids...you\u2019d think people would get used to it. Each year, the nurse would come in to their classroom and give the epilepsy talk, like they all needed a reminder and Faith needed the embarrassment. It was the one time of year that he felt sorry for her. Well, then, and when her mom died.</p><p>Jeremy already had his arms around her. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to move her,\u201d Levi said, but Jeremy picked her up and was shouldering his way down the hall.</p><p>And that was that. The school talked about it for days; how Jeremy was like some kind of knight or something, how could Faith not fall for him, it was so romantic, didn\u2019t you kind of wish you had epilepsy or fainted once in a while? Levi\u2019s eyes actually got tired from rolling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love, my friend,\u201d Jeremy said a couple weeks later. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. She\u2019s beautiful. Like an angel.\u201d</p><p>Levi gave him a look. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Despite not having a father, Levi was what his boss called a man\u2019s man. Football since fourth grade, an aptitude with tools, his first girlfriend at twelve, first sex at fifteen. He\u2019d stayed back the year his father left and was therefore older than his classmates, had started putting on muscle in seventh grade, could drive sophomore year of high school, and those things ensured him some respect. He\u2019d always run with a pack of guys.</p><p>And guys did not talk about their girlfriends being beautiful like an angel. They talked about their tits, their asses, if and when they might put out. If a guy was really in love, he\u2019d just shut up and occasionally punch the person (often Levi) who speculated on the tits and ass of the girl in question.</p><p>Levi was no expert, but he guessed that Jeremy might not know he was g*y. Or if he did, he might not want to admit it. Jeremy was awfully careful in the locker room, which was odd for a kid who\u2019d played football for a decade. Most of the guys didn\u2019t think about it, though some liked to strut around naked, in love with their own junk. There were, of course, the g*y jokes, and Jeremy laughed cautiously, sometimes glancing at Levi to see if it was actually funny (it never was). Nope, Jeremy just kept his eyes down until he was dressed. When Big Frankie Pepitone got a tattoo on his shoulder, all the other guys admired it and made sure to give Frankie a slap on the newly inked and still angry-looking skin (because football players liked to hurt each other, after all), but Jeremy could barely drag his eyes up to the tatt. \u201cCool\u201d was all he said, and Levi got the impression that maybe Jeremy was afraid of what his face would show if he did look at Big Frankie.</p><p>Whatever. Jeremy was a good guy, and Levi didn\u2019t really care if Faith Holland was his beard or the love of his life. It was his senior year; he figured he\u2019d be enlisting, so he was going to have all the fun he could. And being around Jeremy was fun. The guy was funny, smart, laid-back and decent as anything. Levi and Jess, Jeremy and Faith hung out sometimes, catching a movie or going to the Lyons\u2019 house, because Faith had too many siblings, and why go to the trailer park when Jeremy\u2019s house was a fricking playland? But Jess didn\u2019t much like Faith (and did a deadly impression of her), so, often, it was just the three of them, Jeremy, Levi and Faith.</p><p>Faith Holland...she was a little hard to take, yeah. Kind of cutesy and bouncy and tiring. She was smitten with Jeremy and seemed to be auditioning for her role as his future wife, always fluttering her eyelashes and snuggling up close, and Jeremy didn\u2019t seem to mind. She\u2019d kiss up to Mr. and Mrs. Lyon, leaping to clear dishes and whatnot, and it was clear the Lyons thought she was wonderful.</p><p>\u201cThank God he finally found someone,\u201d Levi overheard Mrs. Lyon say to her husband one night, just as he was about to thank them for having him over.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Mr. Lyon answered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it\u2019d ever happen.\u201d They gave each other a look, then went back to watching CNN.</p><p>So maybe Levi wasn\u2019t the only one who thought Jeremy might play for the other team.</p><p>Senior year was the best year of Levi\u2019s life. Football season ended with Jeremy sending a thirty-nine yard pass into the end zone that Levi could\u2019ve caught just by flexing his fingers, so perfect was Jeremy\u2019s aim. The Manningsport Mountain Lions were divisional champs, though they lost in the next round. Didn\u2019t matter. They\u2019d had their best season in the history of the school, so it was hard to feel bad.</p><p>And Levi, who had no brother and no father and no uncles, had his first true friend, different from Asswipe and Tommy and Big Frankie. Jeremy was more mature in a lot of ways, someone who seemed to feel as comfortable at Levi\u2019s as he did in his parents\u2019 glamorous house, who laughed easily and didn\u2019t get wasted for fun, who never cared that kids from the Hill weren\u2019t supposed to hang out with kids from the trailer park.</p><p>He tried a little too hard with Faith\u2014once in a while, he\u2019d kiss her, and it practically made Levi wince, it was so awful. Jeremy did these old-fashioned, corny-ass things that no straight guy would\u2019ve ever dreamed of doing\u2014putting a flower in her hair, shit like that. And Faith, God, she ate it up. She\u2019d sit on his lap and suggest they all sign up to do a road cleanup, or maybe Levi and Jess would want to join the school chorus and go to the old folks\u2019 home and sing. Levi would occasionally point out that there were drugs for her type of condition. Faith would laugh, a little uncertainly, and then he\u2019d feel like he\u2019d kicked a puppy, and Jeremy would say, \u201cDude, be nice. I love her,\u201d and Faith\u2019s tail would start wagging again.</p><p>One spring night, Faith left the boys at the Lyons\u2019 place\u2014Ted and Elaine were away, and Levi suspected she was uncomfortable with the fact that he and Jeremy had appropriated two beers from the downstairs fridge, and God help her if she condoned such illegality. Levi watched her go from where they sat on the deck, her pretty hair gleaming in the sun, the Hollands\u2019 big dog running by her side. \u201cYou and Faith doing it?\u201d he asked out of idle curiosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cWe\u2019re...old-fashioned. You know. Might wait till we get married.\u201d</p><p>Levi choked on his beer. \u201cOh,\u201d he wheezed. Jeremy just shrugged, a smile still on his face at the thought of Princess Super-Cute.</p><p>Then, out of the blue, there came that week where Jeremy and Faith \u201ctook a break.\u201d Shocked the whole school. Jeremy was uncharacteristically glum and didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Finally, Levi imagined, Faith had snapped out of it and figured out that something was off where her boyfriend was concerned.</p><p>He had his own stuff to deal with\u2014a Division III college in Pennsylvania suddenly offered him a decent scholarship (thanks to Jeremy making him look so good all season). Between their offer and what he had saved, all Levi needed was five grand, and they could make it work.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t ask his mom; five grand was still way too much. He could\u2019ve asked Jeremy or the Lyons, and they would\u2019ve fallen over themselves handing it to him, but it didn\u2019t feel right. He didn\u2019t want to owe anyone.</p><p>And so, he asked his father. Figured Rob Cooper might owe him, instead. Tracked him down and found that the guy lived two towns over. Levi hadn\u2019t seen him in eleven years. Not one phone call, not one birthday card, but the guy lived twenty miles away in a nice ranch house painted dark blue, a new-model car in the driveway.</p><p>Rob Cooper might\u2019ve been a deadbeat dad, but he recognized Levi right away. Shook his hand, clapped him on the shoulder and brought him into the garage.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, I\u2019ll get right to it,\u201d Levi said. \u201cI need five grand to go to college. I have a football scholarship, but it\u2019s only a partial.\u201d He paused. \u201cI was hoping you might be able to help.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2014shit, his father had the same green eyes that Levi had, same solid arms\u2014his father nodded, and for one stupid second, Levi\u2019s heart leaped.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to help you, man. How old are you now? Eighteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen. I stayed back in third grade.\u201d The year you left.</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d His father nodded again. \u201cWell, the thing is, I just got married. Fresh start and all that.\u201d He paused. \u201cMy wife\u2019s at work. Otherwise, I\u2019d introduce you.\u201d No, he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cWish I could help you, son. I just don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>There were a lot of things Levi wanted to say. Things about back child support coming to a lot more than five grand. Things about how Rob Cooper had surrendered the right to call him son eleven years ago. About how he\u2019d stayed back in third grade because he\u2019d spent f**king hours after school every day, sitting on the stoop, waiting for that mustard-yellow El Camino to turn into West\u2019s Trailer Park because Levi knew, he knew his father wouldn\u2019t just go away forever.</p><p>But his mouth stayed shut, and shame burned in his stomach because he\u2019d let himself hope.</p><p>\u201cI played football, too, did you know that?\u201d his father asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cWide receiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Listen, I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Sorry again, Levi.\u201d</p><p>It was hearing his name said by that voice, a voice still so well remembered, that almost broke Levi. He walked down the driveway carefully, as if he\u2019d forgotten how, and got into Asswipe\u2019s battered truck. Didn\u2019t look back at his father and drove straight to Geneva to enlist. He wouldn\u2019t let his father take any more away than he already had. Got a little drunk with his old pals that night, had to have Jess put him to bed, but otherwise, no harm done.</p><p>By the end of that week, Faith and Jeremy had gotten back together, anyway. Blip on the screen.</p><p>When graduation came around, Levi had passed the Army\u2019s tests and was looking at sixteen weeks of basic training come August. All of a sudden, home suddenly became...everything.</p><p>Summer took on a bittersweet quality. He found himself sitting by his sister\u2019s bed while she slept, hoping she\u2019d do okay without him. Took her swimming, visited her Girl Scout troop and made all the little girls promise to send him notes and cookies. Brought his mom flowers one day, only to have her burst into tears.</p> <p>The dense green hills and rows of grapevines, the sweet smell of the air were all abruptly precious. It was hard knowing things would never be the same, knowing that he would change and leave behind his old life, that this perfect last year would never be repeated.</p><p>The night before he had to head off to Fort Benning, Mr. and Mrs. Lyon threw him a party, told his mom that she\u2019d raised a great man, and the three parents cried a little together. Jess broke up with him during the party, nothing big, just \u201cHey, there doesn\u2019t seem like a point in keeping this up, do you think?\u201d Levi agreed that no, there really wasn\u2019t. She kissed him on the cheek, told him to be careful and said she\u2019d write once in a while.</p><p>Jeremy picked him up the next morning. Levi kissed his mom goodbye, hugged Sarah tight and told them both to stop crying. Might\u2019ve wiped his own eyes, too. Then Jeremy asked him if he wanted to drive the Beemer, and hells yeah, he did.</p><p>They were quiet all the way to Hornell, where the bus would take him to Penn Station, then to Fort Benning. Jeremy was heading for Boston College next week to start football practice, where he\u2019d be backup QB to the senior starter. The gulf in their lives, the one that Jeremy never acknowledged, suddenly yawned between them. Jeremy would be a football god at a cushy school, possibly get tapped by the pros and, either way, would live a life of ease and privilege. Levi would serve his country in a war that most people didn\u2019t think was doing much good and hopefully not get killed.</p><p>Jeremy bought a couple of coffees and waited until the Greyhound pulled up in a cloud of exhaust and the driver got out for a smoke.</p><p>\u201cLooks like this is it,\u201d Levi said, hefting his duffel bag onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGet a window seat,\u201d Jeremy advised, as if he was experienced in the world of bus travel.</p><p>\u201cWill do. Take care, dude,\u201d Levi said, shaking his hand. \u201cThanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>It was a shitty little phrase conveying nothing. Thanks for not caring where I lived, thanks for trying to get me noticed by recruiters, thanks for sending me that pass, thanks for your parents, thanks for picking me to be your friend.</p><p>\u201cThank you, too.\u201d Then Jeremy hugged him hard and long, pounding him on the back, and when he let him go, Levi saw that his eyes were wet. \u201cYou\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Jeremy said, his voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cRight back at you, bud,\u201d Levi said. \u201cRight back at you.\u201d A long minute passed, and for whatever reason, Levi thought maybe he should crack the door a little, now that he was leaving. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t change, either,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jeremy asked.</p><p>If you came out. The words stayed stuck. Levi shrugged a little. \u201cI just...I\u2019ll always be here for you, man. Whatever happens. And you know...you can tell me anything. Call me. Email. All that good shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jeremy said. They hugged again, and Levi got on the bus.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go back to Manningsport for almost five years.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cTHANK YOU FOR TAKING me out,\u201d Faith said three days after she\u2019d landed in town. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how my grandparents haven\u2019t killed each other yet. When I\u2019m trying to fall asleep at night, I can still hear them in my head. \u2018You want mustard. You always have mustard. How can you make a sandwich without mustard? Take the mustard.\u2019 I could be on fire, and they\u2019d still be fighting over the French\u2019s.\u201d She took a generous sip of her martini, one of the best things about Hugo\u2019s Restaurant. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that moving in with them was a fast road to suicide.\u201d</p><p>Colleen O\u2019Rourke grinned. \u201cOh, you Hollands. Such a cute family.\u201d</p><p>Colleen and she had been friends since second grade, when Faith had had a seizure and Colleen had faked one, jealous of the attention Faith got. Colleen had been much more vigorous, the tale went, and ended up bumping her head on a counter and needing four stitches, which had made her very happy indeed.</p><p>\u201cSo, aside from the grandparents, how is it, being back?\u201d Colleen asked now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Faith said. \u201cMy dad took me out to dinner last night, and it was great. The Red Salamander. Those pizzas are to die for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d marry your father if you\u2019d let me.\u201d Colleen raised an eyebrow. \u201cI mean, if he\u2019s tolerating that horror show, think of how he\u2019d feel about me and all this.\u201d She gestured to her face and torso, which, admittedly, were beautiful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even look at my dad,\u201d Faith warned. \u201cAnd for the love of God, please help me find him somebody. We\u2019re worried that Lorena will take him for a drive and they\u2019ll end up married, and Dad won\u2019t quite notice because it\u2019s harvest time.\u201d She took another sip of her drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cNo one good enough leaps to mind at the moment.\u201d</p><p>That was the problem. Good enough for Dad meant sort of a Mother Teresa/Meryl Streep vibe. Rare, to say the least. She\u2019d spent three hours on eCommitment/SeniorLove last night and came up with only one possible candidate.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s your project?\u201d Colleen asked. \u201cThe thingie? The barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been tramping around our land for the past two days, taking photos, doing land grade studies, water drainage tests. Get that look off your face. It\u2019s fascinating stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is a building for weddings and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But there are plenty of great places to get married or have a party around here, so the barn has to be special. That\u2019s what I\u2019m calling it. The Barn at Blue Heron. Do you love it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! Very classy.\u201d Colleen smiled. \u201cSo you\u2019re back, Faith! You\u2019re here! This is so great. I\u2019ve missed having you around. You\u2019re staying for two months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive or take. I talked to Liza last night and get the impression that Wonderful Mike is living there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him kick you out. I love having a place in Frisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco. Only the tourists call it Frisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected, you snob.\u201d She waved to the server\u2014they\u2019d gotten their drinks at the bar from Jessica Dunn, who\u2019d barely said hello, but this guy was male, and as such, nearly fell over himself running to the table.</p><p>\u201cHi, Colleen,\u201d he said warmly. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while. You look incredible.\u201d He ignored Faith completely and leaned against the table, his ass on Faith\u2019s bread plate. This was the problem with having a beautiful nymph for a friend. Men swarmed around Colleen like mosquitoes around a hemophiliac. \u201cI get off in an hour,\u201d the waiter added.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Colleen said, tossing her dark hair back so he could see her boobs a bit better. \u201cDo I know you? You\u2019re very cute.\u201d</p><p>The waiter made a huffy noise and straightened up. Faith pushed the plate away with the blunt end of her knife. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201d the waiter asked. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did we have a baby together? Are we secretly married? Wait, didn\u2019t I give you a kidney?\u201d Colleen smiled as she spoke, and Faith sensed the waiter softening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a tramp,\u201d he said warmly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hate me because I\u2019m beautiful,\u201d Colleen said, batting her eyelashes. \u201cCan we get another round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also need another bread plate,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>The waiter ignored her. \u201cGreg. My name is Greg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreg.\u201d Colleen said the word like she was tasting it. \u201cCan we get another round, Greg? Time\u2019s a-wastin\u2019. And at my bar, I wouldn\u2019t keep the customer waiting.\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was indeed the place to be, home of the best wine list in town as well as seventeen different microbrews and fantabulous nachos to boot. They\u2019d come to Hugo\u2019s because Colleen wouldn\u2019t be able to talk if she was at her own place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Plus, Faith was sort of easing back into Manningsport. And hiding from Jeremy, let\u2019s be honest, who was a regular at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. Not only was Jeremy the town doctor, he also gave to every charity that came a-knocking, sponsored four Little League teams and owned a vineyard, employing about a dozen people. He was probably the most popular man in town, if not on Planet Earth.</p><p>\u201cAnother round it is,\u201d Greg said, touching the back of Colleen\u2019s hand. \u201cOn the house to make up for the delay.\u201d Because, yes, she was that beautiful, she could stab him in the eye with her fork, and he\u2019d still want to take her home.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a witch or something,\u201d Faith said as the waiter walked away. \u201cI\u2019m filled with admiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have slept with him this summer. Images are coming back to me. A white shag rug, a crisp, dry Riesling, from Blue Heron, of course... Anyway, have you run into any old friends or enemies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJessica Dunn is shooting me the death stare as we speak,\u201d Faith said. \u201cIs she still slutty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I know. Have you seen anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheresa DeFilio. She\u2019s expecting again. Isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nice. And what about anyone else?\u201d Colleen asked, narrowing her pretty eyes. \u201cAnyone male who used to be engaged to you whose name starts with, oh, I don\u2019t know...J?\u201d</p><p>Faith sighed. \u201cI emailed him, okay? Are you proud? We\u2019re getting together next week.\u201d</p> <p>Colleen sighed. \u201cDo you still talk to his parents?\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cYep. We had lunch down in Pacific Grove last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But if someone calls me \u2018poor thing\u2019 one more time, I may go postal and kill everyone around me. Except children and dogs. And old people. And you. And Connor. Fine, I won\u2019t kill anyone. But it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Colleen said happily. \u201cI\u2019m suddenly really popular, too. Even more popular, I should say. People come in and plunk themselves down and say, \u2018Coll, is she...\u2019 tragic pause \u2018...okay?\u2019 And I say, \u2018Sure! Why? Oh, you mean because Dr. Perfect dumped her at the altar? Ancient history, friend! She barely remembers.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Faith said. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting these looks every time I go out. Did you see how Hugo came out to talk to me? First time ever.\u201d She took a slug of her martini. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here all my life, and the owner only just spoke to me today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, hon,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThe gossips will find something else to talk about. Someone\u2019s wife will cheat or someone will embezzle from the library board and they\u2019ll all think about something other than you and Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Greg brought them their drinks and some cute little egg rolls, smiling at Colleen and ignoring Faith, who swiped another bread plate from an empty table.</p><p>\u201cHey, speaking of the library,\u201d Faith said, \u201cJulianne Kammer, remember her? Skinny, brown hair, very nice, threw up in seventh grade during the math test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember. I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s been living on the left coast, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Faith said. \u201cWell, she asked me to do a job while I\u2019m here in town. The little courtyard behind the children\u2019s wing. I\u2019m gonna have a little maze, see. Kids love that stuff. And I said I\u2019d do it for free. Because I\u2019m so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a little drunk, am I right? How is it that a Holland can\u2019t hold her liquor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a throwback to my Puritan ancestors.\u201d Hmm. Yes. She might be slurring a little.</p> <p>\u201cSo is the time right for you to come back permanently? Frisco was never supposed to be your forever home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right, please forgive me. Hold that thought, I have to hit the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d Colleen got up, leaving Faith alone.</p><p>Faith took another sip of her martini, despite her increasingly numb tongue, and glanced around. Hugo\u2019s had been a good choice; it was quieter here, designed more for the tourist industry than a year-round, townie kind of place. The view of the lake was gorgeous, the tablecloths were crisp and white, sprigs of orchids in little vases. A group was just being seated; they\u2019d been at Blue Heron today. Faith had filled in at the gift shop and recognized the pink teddy bear sweatshirt on one woman. Otherwise, Hugo\u2019s held no one she recognized, other than Jessica Dunn, who was a big meanie.</p><p>Faith and Jeremy used to come here. They had a special table, right over there by the window, where they\u2019d talk and hold hands and occasionally kiss. Sometimes Levi would come, too, to see Jessica Dunn (known as Jessica Does back in high school). It was always a little awkward when the four (or three) of them hung out. Jessica had never liked Faith...and neither had Levi, for that matter.</p><p>While Faith had wholeheartedly believed that every girl on earth should have a boyfriend exactly like Jeremy Lyon, an odd charge filled the air when Levi was around, and it only grew when Jessica joined them. Jeremy was much more attractive (Faith always thought of him as an exotic prince, with his swarthy skin and dark, dark eyes), but Levi had something Jeremy didn\u2019t. Heterosexuality, she would learn.</p><p>But back in high school, Levi just made her nervous. He\u2019d look at Jessica with those sleepy green eyes, his straight, dark blond hair always slightly messy, and you just knew those two were doing it\u2014unlike herself and Jeremy, who were much more, uh, virtuous.</p><p>Once, Faith had caught Levi and Jessica making out in Hugo\u2019s coatroom, and it had stopped her in her tracks, the lazy hunger in that kiss, slow and deep and unhurried. Levi had looked like a man years before the rest of the boys\u2014thickly muscled arms and big hands that were the speculation of every female at Manningsport High. Then those hands had slid down Jess\u2019s back, pulling her h*ps close against his own in an unmistakably sexual move, his mouth never leaving Jessica\u2019s as he leaned into her.</p><p>Holy hormones.</p><p>Faith had whirled around and hightailed back to the table and her boyfriend, her perfect, loving, protective Jeremy. Her face had been hot, her hands shaking. Crikey, she\u2019d hoped they hadn\u2019t seen her. That little display had been so...crass. Yes. Crass.</p><p>Back then, she\u2019d thought the reason Jeremy never kissed her like that was because they truly loved each other. It was something more pure and special than simple lust, that...that rutting that Levi and Jessica surely did.</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cI hate that bathroom,\u201d Colleen said, pulling Faith out of the bog of memories. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing, first of all, and those automatic toilets are dangerous, like they could suck down an entire child.\u201d She sat back down. \u201cHey, did you notice I\u2019m wearing a push-up bra, Holland? For you. Connor always says women get more dressed up for each other than for men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m wearing a Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Just for me? No wonder you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But you always wear a push-up bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a point. But I\u2019m wearing glittery eye shadow, see?\u201d Colleen batted her long, black, completely natural and totally unfair lashes for Faith to admire.</p><p>Suddenly, the back of Faith\u2019s neck prickled. She felt it first, that reverberation in her stomach, then heard it.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s voice.</p><p>Oh, God, he had the best voice, low and warm and always with a laugh behind it, as if he found everyone and everything utterly wonderful.</p><p>\u201cThe time has come,\u201d Colleen confirmed.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, no, no. I\u2019m, I\u2019m not ready. I hate this sweater.\u201d Faith swallowed. \u201cColl, what do I do? What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...go say hi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t! I have to lose fifteen pounds! Plus, I\u2019m not ready. I have to...prepare.\u201d</p><p>Colleen laughed. \u201cJust bite the bullet! You look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Really. Not yet.\u201d She risked a glance at him\u2014broad shoulders, that beautiful black hair, and he was laughing now, oh, crap! All he had to do was turn forty-five degrees, and he\u2019d see her.</p><p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d she said, and bolted.</p><p>She made it. No one else was in here, praise the Lord. Her heart was doing a fair impression of Secretariat at the Belmont, and there was a good possibility she was about to puke.</p><p>Faith caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror. She definitely wasn\u2019t ready. First of all, the fifteen pounds. And her hair was dopey today. Also, she\u2019d maybe put on some glittery eye shadow and something sexier than a black wrap sweater that looked like something a Mennonite would wear to a funeral. Honestly, what had she been thinking when she bought it? It wasn\u2019t even low-cut.</p><p>No. She had to prepare, because if she was going to see He Who Left Her at the Altar, she was going to look amazing and have some remarks planned. Not have two martinis inside her, and look at this! A blob of egg roll on her boob, and Colleen had said nothing! Some friend.</p><p>Okay. She\u2019d just call Colleen, ask her to pay the bill and then let her know when Jeremy wasn\u2019t looking, and she\u2019d bolt to freedom.</p><p>Futtocks. She\u2019d left her purse (and phone) at the table.</p><p>Well. She had to pee, anyway. Terror did that to her. Going into the stall, she unwound her sweater\u2014the Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment (try saying that five times fast) required that she practically strip na**d to use the bathroom\u2014and wrestled up her undergarment. The martinis, while relaxing and excellent, didn\u2019t help her in the grace and coordination department, let alone the slutty, high-heeled boots she\u2019d donned for Colleen.</p><p>Men never had to deal with this, Faith thought. Men didn\u2019t hide in bathrooms and wrestle microfiber and pantyhose. Totally not fair. Men had it easy. Did men get bikini waxed and wear uncomfortable underwear? No, they did not. Faith would bet her life that a man had invented thongs. Men sucked.</p><p>As she yanked the Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment back into position, she reached for her sweater\u2014so complicated! She got one arm in, couldn\u2019t find the other one, groped, missed...and all of a sudden, heard the roar of the child-sucking toilet. There was a tug on her arm, and Faith staggered back, watching in horror as her sweater peeled off and disappeared halfway down the toilet, one black arm dangling out like a dead snake.</p><p>Colleen had been right. The toilet was on steroids.</p><p>\u201cWell, this...bites,\u201d she announced, her voice echoing. Her sweater was in the toilet and obviously she wasn\u2019t going to wear it. She picked up the dry sleeve and gave a tentative tug. Whoosh\u2014there was the damn sensor again, and just like that, the sweater was gone.</p><p>And Faith was alone in the bathroom in a red skirt, slutty boots, a black 36-D push-up bra and beige Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment slip that stopped under her boobage, the only reason she could still fit into this outfit.</p><p>She was trapped. Wait, wait...she had a raincoat in Colleen\u2019s car; Coll had driven tonight, and it had looked like rain, but it hadn\u2019t rained, so she\u2019d left it in the car. There. A plan. She\u2019d just call Colleen, ask her to get the raincoat, bring it in, then they could flee like the wind. Also, she should stop drinking martinis.</p><p>She turned for her purse. Dang. Right, it was back at the table.</p><p>Faith chewed on her lip for a second, then glanced down and adjusted her right breast. Okay. Time to summon the cavalry.</p><p>She tiptoed to the door\u2014why tiptoe, who knew?\u2014and peeked out. To see the actual dining room, she was going to have to leave the bathroom, go down the hallway a few steps and take her chances. But she should be able to flag down Colleen, who, after all, might possibly remember that her oldest friend was in distress.</p><p>She opened the door. No one was in sight. One step out. Another step. She crossed her arms over her chest, then over her Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment. Which did she want to hide more, the boobage, or the fat-squishing undergarment? The Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment it was. Another step. She could see three empty tables, but the noise level had escalated. Another tour bus, most likely. One more step and, yes, she could see her purse. Faith leaned forward a little more, ready to hiss at her friend to come save her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But no.</p><p>Colleen wasn\u2019t there. Where the heck\u2014oh, great. She was at the bar, flirting with Greg, the waiter.</p><p>And here came a little old lady with a cane.</p><p>Without thinking, Faith scrambled back to the bathroom, the air cool on her bare shoulders, and leaped into the farthest stall from the door. God, this was so embarrassing! She stood there, waiting for the woman to take care of business. The seconds ticked past. It was getting chilly, too.</p> <p>Finally! The toilet roared, the woman exited the stall, then washed her hands (thoroughly, Faith was pained to note). A paper towel. And another one. And one more. Then came the blessed sound of the door squeaking open and wheezing closed.</p><p>It dawned abruptly that Faith could\u2019ve asked the woman to get Colleen. She dashed out of the stall, causing the toilet to flush again, but the woman was gone...fast little thing, considering the cane and all. Faith tiptoed as fast as she could down the little hall, hoping to catch her. Nope. Speedy Gonzalez, Senior Edition, was nowhere to be seen. And still no Colleen.</p><p>Jeremy, however, was just sitting down at the table nearest the hallway.</p><p>Cursing silently, she whirled and dashed again before he could see her, back to the sanctuary of the bathroom.</p><p>You know what? It was time to go. There was no exit back here, but there was a window in the last stall. Faith could slip out; it couldn\u2019t be too high from the back of the restaurant. She\u2019d jump down, get her damn raincoat out of Colleen\u2019s car, find a pay phone, if the one by the post office still worked, call Colleen and tell her to get her flirtatious ass out of Hugo\u2019s.</p> <p>It was a good plan, Faith thought, as far as this type of sans-clothing nightmare went. She stood carefully on the toilet seat (it flushed yet again, the hungry beast). The window wasn\u2019t huge; she did a quick assessment of her boobage and the width of the window. Fairly close, but she could make it. She\u2019d have to squeeze out, rather than climb. But, hey, why not? When was too much humiliation really too much? Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarments and sweater-eating toilets were still better than angry wives and adorable toddlers calling you a whore, right?</p><p>She stuck her head out the window. Five or six cars, including Colleen\u2019s, and no people. It would be so, so great if her dad just happened to be pulling up at this moment and could save her. But, no, just a dog near the Dumpster. Feral? Savage? Savage and feral? \u201cHey, cutie,\u201d she said, trying to evaluate its ferocity. It wagged. \u201cGood puppy,\u201d she said. The dog wagged again. A yellow Lab. Not feral.</p><p>It was nearly dark, thankfully. Perfect. Time to be Spider-man.</p><p>Faith put the heels of her hands on the window ledge and gave a little jump, using her arms as leverage as she maneuvered out the window. Head clear, shoulders clear, boobs clear, stomach clear. Then her momentum stopped abruptly.</p><p>Ass not clear.</p><p>She wriggled again. Nothing.</p> <p>The dog barked in delight, sensing some fun coming on.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Faith said. \u201cQuiet, sweetie.\u201d She gave a flop, rather than a wriggle, figuring force might win over torque, or vice versa. Ground her h*ps down and pushed up with her arms. Kicked her legs, which had nothing to push against. Twisted and pulled. Twisted and flopped. Heaved. Pushed. Grunted.</p><p>Nada. Nyet. Nuttin.</p><p>Okay, fine. She\u2019d have to go back in and think of something else.</p><p>But apparently \u201cin\u201d was not an option, either. Faith was stuck like a cork in a bottle.</p><p>\u201cOkay, shit,\u201d she said aloud. Her head was a little dizzy from the two martinis or the fact that her blood supply was being choked off by the window, or both.</p><p>Pushing with her arms, she sucked in her stomach, and tried with more gusto. At least the Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarment was slippery. Oh, goody, she got another inch. Glanced back at her butt. Almost there. Of course, if her butt did suddenly clear the window, she\u2019d fall right on her head and break her neck. Woman Who Didn\u2019t Know Fianc\u00e9 Was Gay Falls to Her Death Wearing Microfiber Slim-Nation Undergarment.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d she said a bit more forcefully. The dog barked again, then jumped up, its paws against the outside wall of Hugo\u2019s. \u201cHelp me, Lassie,\u201d Faith muttered. She wriggled some more to no avail.</p> <p>Then the glare of headlights washed over her as a Manningsport police car pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>AS A COP, LEVI COOPER SAW his fair share of odd things. Victor Iskin had all his pets sent to the taxidermist after they died. Sometimes, he\u2019d invite Levi in to visit, and Levi would sit there, surrounded by motionless cats, dogs and a couple of hamsters. Methalia Lewis liked to show him how fat she was getting by hoisting up her shirt and grabbing her stomach in both hands. But Methalia was eighty-two years old and laughed merrily while doing it, then would inevitably offer him some pie. Joey Kilpatrick kept his gallstones, six in all, in a little glass bowl on the kitchen table, and liked to recount just how horrified the surgeon had been at the state of his infected gallbladder.</p><p>But Faith Holland\u2019s head and scantily clad torso hanging out of a window...black bra, too...that was a sight. He turned off the lights and sat there a moment as she wriggled in the fading evening glow.</p><p>Guess he should get out of the car. Then again, that was a pretty great view.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t one to smile much, as he was often told by Emmaline, the administrative assistant he still regretted hiring. But this...yeah. He felt a smirk coming on. Getting out of the car, he walked over to the restaurant window, which was about ten feet off the ground. Good thing Faith wasn\u2019t a little wisp of a thing; she might\u2019ve broken something falling if she hadn\u2019t been wedged in there.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Just taking in the view,\u201d Faith said, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Yep. He was smirking. \u201cNice night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhat happened to your shirt?\u201d</p><p>One of her arms suddenly flew across her gorgeous rack as if she was just aware that he was getting quite a show. \u201cI, um...I had a wardrobe malfunction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The arm blocking his view couldn\u2019t stay there long; she needed it to brace herself or risk flopping. He waited. She glared. A second later, her arm went back again, treating him to the stellar view once more. Very nice, all that plump, creamy bodaciousness encased in a low-cut bra. Not that he particularly liked Faith Holland, but he did like br**sts, and it had been a while since he\u2019d seen such an exemplary pair. \u201cSo, what happened?\u201d</p><p>Her face grew red. \u201cI flushed my sweater down the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happens to me all the time.\u201d This earned another glare. \u201cSo you decided to climb out the window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you are now stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Those analytical powers of yours are just stunning, Levi. No wonder you\u2019re a cop.\u201d</p><p>That comment just bought her a few more seconds in the window. \u201cWell, if there\u2019s nothing you need, I\u2019ll be on my way. You have a nice night, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>He started to get back in the car.</p><p>\u201cLevi! Don\u2019t go! And don\u2019t call me ma\u2019am. I\u2019m still a miss. Help me out here. Aren\u2019t you a public servant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He raised his eyebrows and waited.</p><p>\u201cSo? Give me a hand and stop being such a hemorrhoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould half-dressed people wedged in windows call an officer of the law names, do you think?\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cOfficer Cooper, would you please help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chief Cooper, and, yes.\u201d</p><p>He got back in the cruiser and pulled it up so the bumper almost touched the building, threw the car in Park and got out again. \u201cI really have to wonder how climbing out the window seemed like the best decision,\u201d he said, climbing on the hood of the cruiser. \u201cIs Jeremy in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust help me,\u201d she ground out.</p><p>He\u2019d take that as a yes.</p><p>They were at eye level\u2014well, in Faith\u2019s case, eye and torso level. It looked as if she\u2019d been shot through the wall. She was stuck, all right. Short of smearing her with butter (Don\u2019t go there, he warned himself), there was no way he was going to be able to do this without touching her. Which was always tricky, if you were the chief of police. Sexual harassment and all that.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll just...is it all right, Faith, if I hold on to your arms and pull you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Isn\u2019t it obvious? Were you planning to use the Force instead?\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cI think you should be a little nicer, Holland,\u201d he said, \u201cgiven that I could call the fire department right now. Gerard Chartier lives for this sort of thing. And isn\u2019t your nephew a volunteer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will castrate you if you call the fire department. You\u2019re bad enough. Just help me.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of her upper arms and immediately chastised himself. Her skin was freezing, as the night had gotten cool. \u201cCount of three,\u201d he said, bracing a foot against the building. \u201cOne...two...three.\u201d</p><p>He pulled, and out she came, half falling against him, all soft and white and plump in the gloom. He took a step back as soon as humanly possible, ending contact, and jumped off the hood of the cruiser, then looked back up at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked, tilting his head. She was wearing some kind of weird, beige, shiny tank top or something that ended just below her bra.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slip. Stop looking and don\u2019t you dare say another word.\u201d</p><p>He offered his hand as she climbed off the cruiser\u2014imagine writing up that report. The half-naked woman then fell off my cruiser because I didn\u2019t want to touch her. Her hand was cold, too. \u201cWant my coat?\u201d he asked, shrugging out of it.</p><p>Faith ignored him, going to Colleen O\u2019Rourke\u2019s red MINI Cooper. She tried the door. It was locked; that was good, as there\u2019d been a few car break-ins lately. She sighed heavily, then turned back to him. He held out his jacket. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, pulling it on without looking at him. \u201cCan I use your phone, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He handed it over and watched as she dialed.</p><p>At that moment, Colleen\u2019s face appeared in the bathroom window. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing out here, Faith?\u201d she asked, starting to laugh. \u201cDid you actually climb out the window? Hey, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really needed you five minutes ago,\u201d Faith said. \u201cCan you please get my purse so we can get the hell out of here? Pretty please?\u201d</p><p>Colleen obeyed, and before too long, Faith handed him back his jacket and put on her own raincoat. They were gabbling away, laughing about the incident now. \u201cSee you soon, Chief,\u201d Colleen said with a smile.</p><p>He nodded. Faith waved but didn\u2019t quite meet his eyes.</p><p>Then they drove off, and though his shift was technically over, Levi walked over to the station. May as well finish some paperwork.</p><p>His jacket smelled like Faith Holland\u2019s perfume. Vanilla or something.</p><p>Something you\u2019d eat for dessert.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>WHEN FAITH AND JEREMY BROKE up three weeks before the senior prom, it sent ripples of shock through Manningsport High. Who would be prom king and queen, if not the golden couple? Had Jeremy found someone else? If so, who was the lucky girl?</p><p>When Jeremy glumly informed Levi that he and Faith were \u201ctaking a break,\u201d Levi asked if he wanted to talk about it and was relieved when Jeremy said no.</p><p>It was a strange time. All anyone could talk about was where they\u2019d be in the fall. A couple kids were going to the community college, a couple would be going straight into the workforce, but most were headed away and talked endlessly about the need to buy supplies, clothes, a new computer.</p><p>As the only recruit in their high school class (though Tiffy Ames was going to the Air Force Academy, and George Shea was Navy ROTC), Levi didn\u2019t have the same issues. His father had cemented the impossibility of college, and the Army felt like a good fit. But in addition to the sense of pride he already felt about serving in the military, a melancholy was descending. He tried to spend a night or two watching TV with his mom each week, knowing she was more worried than she\u2019d say. He took Sarah fishing and read Harry Potter to her, hoping in the back of his mind that if something happened, she\u2019d remember him. She was only eight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was ready. He wanted to serve, figured he\u2019d be good at it. He\u2019d passed all his tests, and his recruiter thought he might make a good sniper, based on the psych profile and his innate skill with a gun. Whatever the case, chances were high that Levi would be on the fast track to Afghanistan.</p><p>So things like Faith and Jeremy\u2019s relationship status tended not to matter, aside from the fact that his buddy was glum.</p><p>Ted and Elaine Lyon had hired him for the spring. They made Jeremy do the same thing, though they didn\u2019t pay him; said he was heir to the land, even if he did spit in their eye and decide to become a doctor (this statement was usually followed with a slap on the back or a hug). This week, however, Jeremy and Elaine had gone to California to visit relatives, so Levi was on his own. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind working solo,\u201d Ted said, \u201cthe merlot trellises need checking. You just tie up the vines so the grapes won\u2019t fall off or touch the ground. You\u2019ve done that before, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Jeremy and I did that last week in the Rieslings,\u201d Levi answered. It wasn\u2019t exactly brain surgery.</p> <p>\u201cGreat! Thanks, son.\u201d The lady from the tasting room gave him a bag lunch and a big bottle of water, and Levi headed to the western edge of the vineyard, close to Blue Heron, where the land got pretty steep, not too far from the woods.</p><p>He worked from the top of the hill downward, one row at a time. The sun beat on his back, and he pulled off his T-shirt after fifteen minutes. It was hot for early May, and he was glad he wore shorts. Might hit the lake for a swim later on, no matter how cold the water was.</p><p>He\u2019d been working a good hour and was already damp with sweat when he heard the rumble of a truck. It was John Holland\u2019s red pickup, identifiable anywhere due to its age and general filth...always mud-splattered and crusty. It stopped, and an enormous Golden retriever bounded out, followed by Princess Super-Cute.</p><p>She wore cutoff shorts, a white sleeveless shirt, the tails tied under her br**sts, and a blue bandanna on her head. Levi felt a generic stir of lust. Nothing personal, Holland, he thought. He\u2019d been stealing looks at her chest since he was fourteen.</p><p>The dog ran over to him, tail wagging, and barked once, then collapsed, rolling on his back. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d Levi said, rubbing the beast\u2019s stomach.</p> <p>Faith shaded her eyes and looked at him. \u201cHi,\u201d she called tentatively. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTying up vines. You?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSame thing.\u201d She held up an apron, then tied it on. \u201cMy sister\u2019s cracking the whip.\u201d She paused. \u201cI guess Smiley likes you.\u201d</p><p>Smiley. Leave it to Faith Holland to have a dog named Smiley. Speaking of, the dog apparently had had enough of a scratch, because he leaped up and went romping through the vineyard rows, tail waving.</p><p>Faith, however, came to within two rows of where he was, and he braced himself for questions about Jeremy, or an explanation, or a discussion. Girls, he well knew, liked to talk about their feelings until they had nothing left to say, at which point they\u2019d start repeating themselves.</p><p>Instead, she bent over and started doing exactly what he was. Except she was better at it. The apron held twist ties, and she didn\u2019t have to check each shoot the way he did. She was kind of a pro, actually.</p> <p>And when she bent over, there was that mighty rack on display. He didn\u2019t have a lot of use for Faith Holland, but, man, that was a nice pair.</p><p>She glanced up. Busted. \u201cI thought you were more of the princess type,\u201d he said as explanation. \u201cRun out of townies to do the grunt work?\u201d</p><p>She just laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Holland, you\u2019re a farmer,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a farmer, you work. You don\u2019t just gaze out over the fields and sip wine.\u201d She gave him a knowing look and twisted on another tie, her fingers fast and clever.</p><p>\u201cGuess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you were.\u201d</p><p>She bent over again, and the lust felt much less generic. \u201cSo this is the property line, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. See that stone marker up there? That\u2019s what divides Blue Heron from Lyon\u2019s Den.\u201d She secured three vines while she was talking, reminding him to drag his eyes off her br**sts and get back to work.</p><p>She moved steadily, bending, sometimes kneeling, holding a cluster of the dusky grapes in her hand from time to time, and somehow, out here in the field, everything she did looked unabashedly sexual. She was soft and round and sweaty now, her red hair in pigtails, basically any male\u2019s fantasy of a farm girl.</p> <p>Jeremy\u2019s girlfriend, dude, his conscience chided.</p><p>Except they weren\u2019t together anymore.</p><p>\u201cSo how you doing, Holland?\u201d he asked, surprising himself.</p><p>She glanced over at him, then stood up, taking the bandanna off her head and wiping her face, then retying it. Yep. Everything she did looked like she was on a Penthouse photo shoot. Except for the clothes. If she\u2019d take off the clothes, things would be perfect.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>What did he ask? Oh, right. Jeremy. Maybe he\u2019d finally come out of the closet. Or maybe she\u2019d guessed.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave for basic training?\u201d Putting her hands on the small of her back, she stretched, her br**sts straining against her shirt.</p><p>\u201cUh, July twentieth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>He started to say no and put forth some of the bravado expected. \u201cA little,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been away before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Virginia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirginia Tech. It seems like a great school, but now all I can think of is how far it is from here.\u201d She gave him a funny little smile, half sad, half embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great. Everybody likes you.\u201d Aw. Wasn\u2019t he being super-sweet?</p><p>\u201cNot everybody,\u201d she said, twisting those little ties with amazing speed.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious, Levi,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think I\u2019m spoiled and irritating and ditzy. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Right now, I think you\u2019re edible. But yeah, I think you should be able to tell the difference between a straight guy and a g*y guy. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve always been a snob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one with the big house on the Hill.\u201d He tied up a vine.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make me a snob.\u201d She flipped a braid over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her voice was matter-of-fact. \u201cYou never talked to me till this year, and even then, it\u2019s only because of Jeremy. And even then, only when you have to.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just tied up another vine. \u201cSo everyone has to adore you, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we\u2019ve known each other since third grade. We were both in that special reading club that Mrs. Spritz had, remember? And I invited you to our Halloween party.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. Pumpkin carving and apple bobbing and a haunted hay ride. That\u2019d been a fun night, even if it had been weird, being in the famed Holland house. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t cool enough for you to talk to. And when my mother died, you were the only one in our class not to write me a note.\u201d</p><p>He felt his face flush. \u201cQuite a memory you got there, Holland,\u201d he muttered, tying up a few more branches.</p><p>\u201cWell, you always remember people who hurt your feelings.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the poor little drama queen. \u201cSo you wanted to come to the trailer park and play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne time,\u201d she continued, \u201cI sat next to you at lunch, not to be near you, just because it was the empty seat next to Colleen. And you got up and moved, like you couldn\u2019t stand to sit near me.\u201d She stood up and put her hands on her hips, and the lust stirred again, even as she was listing his sins. \u201cSo.\u201d Her voice was calm with just a little edge to it. \u201cWho\u2019s the real snob here, Levi?\u201d</p><p>Girls. Way too complicated. He missed Jess, who more or less used him for sex. At least she was direct. He bent over and tied up another dangling vine, lifting up the grapes carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re not very smart in the ways of the world, are you, rich girl?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look. \u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He remembered how she and her mother used to come down to West\u2019s Trailer Park once in a while with a bag of clothes for Jessica. Lady Bountiful and her little angel, visiting the poor. Sometime around fifth grade or so, he\u2019d found Jess hiding in the little cave of scrub bushes they used as a fort, waiting for the Hollands to leave. She\u2019d been crying. Even then, he understood. Being poor was one thing; having the people on the Hill decide you were their charity case was another. Levi\u2019s mom may have had to work two jobs, and money was always a worry, but they\u2019d done okay. Scrappy, his mom liked to say.</p><p>But the Dunns had been truly poor. Food stamps and electricity turned off kind of poor. No way they could turn away a bag of nice clothes and coats. Small wonder Jess hated Faith.</p><p>His silence seemed to make Faith mad. She grabbed a vine with gusto, her movements sharp, rather than flowing now. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that you think we\u2019re rich. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re not even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up in a trailer, Faith. Your idea of rich and mine are pretty different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich made it okay for you to hate me all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, for crying out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You just ignored me and made me feel like a lump, and God forbid we should ever be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna be friends? Fine. We\u2019re friends. Let\u2019s play Barbies and go to the movies.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and bent down to tie another vine. \u201cI never understood why Jeremy thinks you walk on water. I think you\u2019re a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see? I want to be friends, and you\u2019re calling me names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean no tea party later on?\u201d</p><p>She glared. He grinned.</p><p>And then she blushed, her cheeks growing pink, color staining her throat and chest. Her eyes fluttered down his bare torso. Then she jerked her gaze back to the vine and fumbled for a tie. Dropped it.</p><p>Well, well, well. Levi\u2019s smile grew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a crappy job,\u201d she said, glancing back at his row. \u201cYou need to use more ties, or the grapes will be too heavy, and you\u2019ll lose the fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right,\u201d he murmured. Actually, his work had gotten spotty only since she\u2019d arrived.</p><p>She came over to his row and demonstrated. \u201cThis one, see, it\u2019s off the ground for now, but when the grapes mature, they\u2019ll get too heavy. See?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She smelled like grapes and vanilla and dirt and sunshine and sweat. The stir of lust became a throb.</p><p>\u201cTie it up higher,\u201d she said, kneeling down to demonstrate. Faith Holland, on her knees in front of him. How could he not picture what he was picturing? \u201cJust go back along what you\u2019ve already done and make sure you got everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. Her shirt brushed his ribs as she stood up and went back to her row.</p><p>Keep your eyes to yourself. And get going. The Lyons are paying you. You can jerk off later.</p><p>The mental advice worked for an hour.</p><p>She was much faster and steadier than he was, he had to give her that. He looked at the sky, which was a perfect, endless blue, and decided it was time to eat.</p><p>\u201cYou want some lunch, rich girl?\u201d he called. She was twenty yards or so ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cI brought my own,\u201d she answered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen do you want to eat with me? Now that we\u2019re BFFs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d He lowered his chin and gave her a patient look, something that had always worked well with girls.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she grumbled.</p> <p>Hey, idiot, his brain chided. She was dating your best friend a few days ago. What are you doing?</p><p>But the facts were blurring fast. First of all, there was the whole Jeremy-shouldn\u2019t-be-dating-a-girl thing. Speaking of Jeremy, he wasn\u2019t even in the Empire State at the moment. Then there was the breakup, or whatever they wanted to call it.</p><p>And let\u2019s not forget the sight of a dewy and dirty Faith Holland in cutoff jeans and a shirt tied under her generous chest, and the fact that she was irritated with him, which Levi had learned generally meant a girl was interested.</p><p>She came over to him, taking out her braids and retying her hair in a ponytail. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice place about five minutes from here. By the falls. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking at her steadily. She had blue eyes. He never really noticed before. Freckles.</p> <p>She swallowed.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Faith Holland was feeling some feelings.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d she said. They walked up to her father\u2019s truck, the dog running ahead. Levi grabbed his shirt from where he\u2019d dropped it and pulled it on.</p><p>John Holland\u2019s truck smelled pleasantly of old coffee and oil, just as dirty inside as the outside, the dashboard and seats covered in dried mud and dust. Smiley jumped, his feathery tail hitting Levi in the face. \u201cSit, pooch,\u201d he said, and the dog obeyed, his furry side pressed against Levi\u2019s arm. Seemed like the Hollands always had a Golden retriever or two. There was always one in their brochures.</p><p>\u201cYou guys breed these monsters?\u201d he asked Faith as she started the truck and put it in gear. The fact that she could drive a made-in-America pickup truck with a standard transmission only increased her hot factor.</p><p>\u201cWe belong to the Golden Retriever Rescue League,\u201d she answered. Smiley licked her face as if thanking her.</p> <p>\u201cJust another act of mercy from the great Holland family,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cJeesh! Stop being such a pain or I\u2019ll push you out of the truck and eat your lunch.\u201d</p><p>The truck jolted and rocked over the grassy, rutted paths that ran between fields, causing Levi to practically crack his head on the roof of the truck (but also treating him to a great view of Faith\u2019s bouncing cle**age). After about five minutes, they stopped at the edge of a field that was being cleared...the Holland family owned a ton of land. Woods were thick on one side.</p><p>Faith grabbed a blanket from behind her seat and a thermal lunch box (Hello Kitty, could\u2019ve called that one). The dog raced off into the woods, and she followed on the little path without waiting for Levi.</p><p>Birds called and fluttered in the branches. From somewhere not too far away came the rush and splash of a stream. Levi tried to imagine looking out and seeing land, acres and acres of field and forest, all the way down to the lake, and knowing it was yours, and had been in your family since America had been a baby. Levi\u2019s mother\u2019s family was from Manningsport, too, but there were people who\u2019d been around, and then there were founding families.</p><p>Over to the left was the ruin of an old stone barn, the rocks covered in lichen. A sapling grew in the middle, the roof long gone.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d Faith called from up ahead.</p><p>Thick mounds of moss blanketed the ground, and the leaves were so green the air seemed tinted with it. They passed a huge grove of birch trees, the white bark glowing, and the edges of hemlocks brushed Levi\u2019s cheek as he walked. He slapped a mosquito, and a chipmunk peeped and ran across the narrow path.</p> <p>The sound of rushing water was louder now. Faith had spread out the blanket on a rock and sat down. Juicy as a ripe peach. An image of her under him, legs around him, practically made him stagger.</p><p>He really had to stop thinking this way.</p><p>They were at the edge of a deep gorge, a waterfall cascading into a round pool about twenty feet below them. He wished he had a camera so he could look at this picture when he was deployed, baking in the sun of Iraq or Afghanistan or wherever the Army would send him. He\u2019d show it around. This is where I\u2019m from. I had lunch with a pretty girl right on this rock.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said, sitting next to Faith.</p><p>\u201cThe pool\u2019s pretty deep,\u201d she said, pointing as she took a sandwich out of her lunch box. \u201cMaybe twenty, thirty feet. Jack says it\u2019s bigger underwater. Like a bell. He used to jump off that rock there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and took a bite of her sandwich. \u201cNo. Too scary for me. Honor never did, either. Said we\u2019d already\u2014well. No reason to risk your life just for the sake of it, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They ate in silence, the dog coming up to beg for a scrap. Birds twittered, the waterfall roared. Beside him, Faith finished her sandwich and seemed content to just watch the water. The mist of the falls had coated her hair in tiny beads, making her look like a slightly p**n ographic woodland fairy.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Levi said, suddenly aware that he\u2019d been staring at Faith for too long, all sorts of hot, red thoughts pulsating through him. \u201cI\u2019m going swimming. Which rock do I jump off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Levi, don\u2019t,\u201d Faith said, jerking to attention. \u201cMy phone\u2019s back in the truck. What if you hit your head or something? A tourist got a concussion a couple years ago. My brother broke his arm when he was fifteen. It\u2019s not safe. Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was kind of nice, her begging for his well-being. Then again, that pool was frickin\u2019 gorgeous. He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to break anything.\u201d He stripped off his shirt, well aware that he was a pretty fine specimen. Pink crept into her cheeks, and she shifted her gaze straight ahead. \u201cYou coming, Holland?\u201d It sounded like a proposition.</p><p>It was.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, all prim and proper. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. I have to get back to work, anyway. So do you, right? And really, jumping is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going into the Army in two months, Faith. Jumping off that rock is probably less dangerous than an IED or suicide bomber.\u201d He winked at her, went to the rock and looked down. The water was green and clear, churning where the falls poured in. \u201cGeronimo,\u201d he said, then pushed off.</p><p>He went in feet first, shooting down, the water swallowing him, cold and silky and utterly beautiful. Opening his eyes, he could see that Faith was right\u2014the pool expanded underwater by about ten feet, the stone walls like a church. He\u2019d always been a pretty good swimmer, was one of the first into the lake each spring. This, though...this was unbelievable, so smooth and deep and secret. He ran his hand over the stone, amazed and a little sorry that he\u2019d never been here before.</p><p>The thought came to him that if he\u2019d been Faith\u2019s friend, he might\u2019ve seen this place years ago.</p><p>Then he kicked to the surface, and looked up to see Faith\u2019s worried face above him as she peered over the edge. \u201cCome on in, Holland,\u201d he called, treading water. \u201cLive a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive is the key word,\u201d she said. The dog\u2019s face appeared next to hers, looking much happier than she did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still alive. Come on. I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t catch me. I\u2019m not a little kid, and it\u2019s a twenty foot drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here. Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><p>Her expression changed. She wanted to, he could see that. \u201cRich girls,\u201d he called up, swimming over to where a thin outcropping of rock stuck out into the pool, like a natural diving board. He grabbed onto it, aware that it would make his very healthy muscles bunch. \u201cSo boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rich,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you are boring if you just sit there and watch when you could be down here, having fun with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing a bathing suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Oh, yeah, he was making progress. Faith in a wet, white shirt, her red hair streaming down her back...even the cold water wasn\u2019t keeping his body from appreciating that image. \u201cCome on, Holland. Do it for me, a young soldier about to leave home to protect your freedom.\u201d He grinned up at her, and after a second, her expression changed from worry to something else.</p><p>\u201cFine. But if I die, you have to tell my father in person, okay? And you have to take care of Smiley, because he\u2019ll miss me. He sleeps on my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise your dog can sleep with me if you die. Now get in here.\u201d</p><p>She went to the edge of the rock, and even from his vantage point, he could see her bare toes clenching. Retied her shirt more firmly, hiked up her shorts. \u201cOkay, Private Cooper. Here I come.\u201d</p><p>Then she jumped, her hair sailing out behind her, eyes screwed shut, fists clenched. She cut into the water about ten feet from him, then popped up almost immediately, her hair in her face, spluttering and coughing.</p><p>Levi swam over to her, and she grabbed onto his shoulders instinctively, clutching him hard, her br**sts pushing against his bare chest. He put his arm around her waist and swam over to the outcropping, which she grabbed with one hand.</p><p>Her other arm stayed around his shoulders, and her legs kicked between his, treading water, her smooth thighs brushing his. She didn\u2019t need to hang on to him, but she did. Her heart thudded against his, fast and hard, and he realized she was scared. From the jump, maybe. And maybe she was scared of him...maybe that, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>This would be it. A moment to take with him, the feeling of her sweet, wet softness, her cheek against his, treading the clear, pure water as the waterfall gushed and the leaves rustled and sighed.</p><p>Faith pulled back a little, her eyelashes starry with water. He could kiss her. He could just lean in an inch or two, and their mouths would be touching, and he\u2019d bet she\u2019d taste so sweet. His hand slid up her ribs, so close to her breast that she sucked in a shaky breath, and lust, hot and heavy, flowed through his blood.</p><p>He kissed her as gently as he knew how, not wanting her to push away, wanting only this, just one kiss. Her lips were soft and cool and wet from the water, and he couldn\u2019t help himself, he licked her bottom lip, she tasted so good. When she opened her mouth, he wanted a lot more, suddenly starving for the taste of her, abruptly rock hard. He pulled her h*ps against him, letting her know, and her fingers dug into his shoulders, her tongue answering his, a soft little sound coming from her throat, and it was so, so good he couldn\u2019t think, he could just drown here, more than happy to have this be his last day on earth.</p><p>Then she broke away, pushing away from him and scrambling up onto the rocks</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I can\u2019t,\u201d she said over the rush of the water.</p><p>It felt empty without her against him. Empty and cold.</p><p>\u201cSee, um, Jeremy and I, I mean, we\u2019re... We\u2019re not really... It\u2019s a break. We\u2019re not officially... So I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t kiss anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said idly. Except he was furious, all of a sudden. Not just with her, either. With stupid Jeremy, who\u2019d probably never kissed her that way before, who had no idea how. With himself, for kissing his best friend\u2019s girl. But, yeah, mostly with her. If she didn\u2019t want to kiss him, maybe, just maybe, she shouldn\u2019t have been hanging on to him like a spider monkey. She\u2019d wanted that kiss, and he\u2019d given it to her, and now she was Polly Purebred again.</p><p>Ah, crap. He\u2019d just kissed Jeremy\u2019s girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cWe should get back,\u201d she said, her voice tight and pinched. She turned her back to squeeze the water out of her shirt. She did the same to her hair. Her hands were shaking, he noted. She turned around, her shirt clinging to her. If she\u2019d been braless, he might\u2019ve had to kill himself. As it was, the cold water (and rejection) were doing wonders for his condition. \u201cLevi, I hope you won\u2019t be...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMad?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cUm...I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tell Jeremy about this. I mean, it would just hurt him. Right? So I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d The plea in her voice was clear\u2014And you won\u2019t either, right?</p> <p>He swam to the rocks and hoisted himself out of the water, watching as her eyes scanned him. That\u2019s it, rich girl. Heterosexual male. Enjoy. He walked over to her and stood very close. \u201cYou know, I always did think you were ditzy and spoiled and irritating,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cBut before today, I never thought you were a tease.\u201d</p><p>With that, he made his way back up to their adorable little picnic area. The dog woofed at his approach and again offered its belly, but this time, Levi ignored him. Instead, he grabbed his shirt and pulled it on, picked up his brown bag and headed back to work for the Lyons, walking through the Holland fields in the bright light and hot sun.</p><p>Faith, he noted, didn\u2019t return.</p><p>That weekend, Jeremy called him, his voice its usual bouncy tone. \u201cHow you doing, bud?\u201d he asked. \u201cWanna hang out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Levi said. Whatever guilt he\u2019d felt about kissing Jeremy\u2019s girlfriend he\u2019d managed to ball up and toss into the dirty laundry area of his conscience. Hell, he told himself, he\u2019d have kissed just about any female under the circumstances. It had just been a bad case of...whatever. \u201cHow was California?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt was great,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cAnd I have some good news. Faith and I are back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprised,\u201d Levi said. Like she was gonna dump the golden boy. The star quarterback. The future doctor. The heir to the Lyons\u2019 vineyard.</p><p>Levi saw Faith at school, of course. Jeremy\u2019s angelic girlfriend, who couldn\u2019t tell the difference between a guy who wanted to bang her silly and a guy who didn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>MOST OF THE CALLS Levi had to respond to were pretty mild, and he liked it that way.</p><p>This call, however, was one of the livelier calls they\u2019d had this week. On Tuesday, he\u2019d sat out with a radar gun after Carol Robinson had complained about the speed on her road at 2:40 when the high school kids got out of school. Yesterday, he talked to the third-grade class about why drugs were wrong. There\u2019d been a call from Laura Boothby, because she couldn\u2019t reach a vase on a high shelf of her flower shop and didn\u2019t want to fall by using her stepstool, which her no-good son had promised to fix and hadn\u2019t, and would Levi please come over and get it for her? (He had. Figured it was better than finding Laura with a broken hip three days from now.) Last night around eleven, there\u2019d been another call from Suzette Minor\u2014third this month\u2014who\u2019d heard suspicious noises and wanted Levi to come check her house (especially her bedroom). He had, though not with the results she wanted. The whole red swishy nightgown thing, the \u201cOfficer, please help me/I\u2019m frightened/My, but you\u2019re strong\u201d didn\u2019t work on him. He\u2019d been hired to protect and serve, and \u201cserve\u201d did not mean \u201cservice.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the calls to the Manningsport Police had more to do with being a good neighbor than any true police work. It didn\u2019t hurt that he was a local and, being a decorated veteran, someone who\u2019d become pretty much universally loved. History had a way of fogging over when you were given a medal or two... Ellis Mitchum seemed to have forgotten the time he\u2019d told Levi that his precious Angela wasn\u2019t going to get knocked up by some trailer trash like Levi. Now, Ellis loved nothing more than buying him a beer and reminiscing about Vietnam. (Angela, for the record, had gone on to get knocked up by a kid from Corning their senior year.)</p><p>Nope, Levi was no longer trailer park trash; when the time had come to hire a cop to help out Chief Griggs, the town council, including old Mr. Holland, just about fell over themselves to accept his application. One year later, the chief retired, and Levi got that job, too. He now presided over Everett Field, his deputy, and Emmaline Neal, the administrative assistant with a penchant for analyzing him. It also meant that Levi earned ten grand more a year, and since his sister was in college, that was welcome.</p><p>But, as chief, he had to go on almost every call, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, Chief, please!\u201d Nancy Knox wept. \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill my baby! Please help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, let me take a look,\u201d he said. He crouched down and looked. No murders yet. Everyone looked very calm. Even a little sleepy. \u201cEverett, go to the other side of the porch in case he makes a run for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, Chief. You bet. Going to the other side of the porch right now, roger.\u201d Everett paused. \u201cUh, is that the south or the north side, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go around the porch, Ev,\u201d Levi said, trying to curb his impatience. \u201cDon\u2019t let him get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief. Going to the other side, won\u2019t let him get away.\u201d Levi heard the click as Everett snapped open his holster.</p> <p>\u201cPut your gun back!\u201d Levi barked. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Everett. You\u2019re gonna hurt someone with that someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my poor baby! Is she still alive?\u201d Mrs. Knox said. \u201cI can\u2019t look! I can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Levi looked back under the porch, where a dog and a chicken were eyeing each other. \u201cShe\u2019s alive, Mrs. Knox. Don\u2019t worry. Come here, pooch. Come on, fella.\u201d</p><p>The dog wagged and grinned but didn\u2019t move. If Levi wasn\u2019t mistaken, that was Faith Holland\u2019s dog, judging by the size of his enormous head and neon-green plaid collar. The Knoxes lived about a mile down the Hill from the Hollands, and they kept chickens that made up about seven percent of Levi\u2019s calls...they were free range, which meant they often wandered onto the road and had once caused a kid to veer off into the ditch. People were always calling to complain.</p><p>The chicken seemed just fine\u2014the dog seemed delighted with the bird, which cocked its head and made a funny, burring noise. The dog wagged and panted, covered in dirt.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Blue,\u201d Levi said. \u201cCome on, buddy.\u201d</p><p>The dog smiled again. He was a great-looking dog, and dumb as a box of hair. Not that the chicken was Stephen Hawking, mind you. It could\u2019ve walked out from under the porch at any time.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Chief. Please save my little baby.\u201d</p><p>Levi sighed. The Knoxes needed to have kids or cats or monkeys or something. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat dog is vicious.\u201d Mrs. Knox wept.</p><p>\u201cWant me to call for backup?\u201d Everett asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ev,\u201d Levi said. \u201cThe dog\u2019s fine.\u201d Levi had to belly-crawl, using his elbows to pull himself along. His drill sergeant at basic had loved making them do this. Four tours in Afghanistan, and Levi had never once had to crawl. But here it was, coming in handy.</p><p>His cell phone rang. All police calls to the station were transferred to his cell if he was out on a call. \u201cChief Cooper,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d his sister said. \u201cI\u2019m home. I couldn\u2019t take it another second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Baby! Is she dead?\u201d Mrs. Knox shrilled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Levi called back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Sarah demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working. Why are you home? School started three weeks ago, Sarah, and you\u2019ve already been back six times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m homesick, okay? I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a pain in your ass, but I hate it there! I need a gap year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not having a gap year. You\u2019re in college, and you\u2019re going to finish. Now, I\u2019m busy, so we\u2019ll talk when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rescuing a chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am totally tweeting that. My brother, the hero.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. Gap year, his ass. She\u2019d go back to college; he\u2019d drive her back tonight...okay, maybe tomorrow morning. And she\u2019d stay in school, she\u2019d do great, and she\u2019d thank him later.</p><p>About five more feet of crawling through the dirt\u2014which appeared to be fertilized by the Knox chickens, so, yes, this really was a chickenshit job at the moment\u2014till he could reach the dog. But apparently, the chicken decided there was nothing to fear, because it plunked itself down right against Blue\u2019s chest. The dog seemed quite pleased about that, resting his chin on the chicken\u2019s back. \u201cThey\u2019re cuddling,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nancy shrieked. \u201cDid you say killing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuddling!\u201d Levi shouted back.</p><p>\u201cChief!\u201d Everett shouted. \u201cAre you in danger? I have drawn my weapon! Do you need assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverett! Put that gun away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief.\u201d</p><p>Levi sighed. More days than not, he imagined that he would die at the hands of Officer Everett Field\u2019s general ineptitude. Alas, Everett was the only child of Marian Field, Manningsport\u2019s mayor, and basically had a job for life. He wasn\u2019t a bad kid, and he had a wicked case of hero worship where Levi was concerned, but he drew his weapon roughly six times a day.</p><p>\u201cBlue, old buddy,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna relieve you of this bird, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Blue wagged again, and Levi took the sleeping chicken in his hands, then reverse-crawled out. He was filthy. His shift was almost over, at least. Not that he stopped working; there was always something else to do, which suited Levi just fine these days.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d he said, handing Mrs. Knox her chicken. \u201cThink about an enclosure, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Chief, thank you so much!\u201d she said, beaming at him. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful! What about that dog, though? He\u2019s evil! He should be locked up!\u201d</p><p>The dog whined from under the porch, probably missing his little buddy. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the owner,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cThat was a great save, Chief,\u201d Everett said, coming over as Levi brushed himself off as best he could. \u201cYou did an amazing job. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Levi stopped himself from rolling his eyes. \u201cThanks, Ev. Listen. You draw that gun again, and I\u2019m taking it away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief.\u201d</p><p>Levi bent down and looked at the dog, who looked quite morose. \u201cWanna go for a ride?\u201d</p><p>The dog flew out from under the porch, then streaked over to the cruiser, dancing eagerly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve said that first,\u201d Everett pointed out. \u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t have had to crawl under there. You got really dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for pointing that out. Why don\u2019t you close up the station tonight, Ev?\u201d</p><p>Everett\u2019s face lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Levi would go back and check it afterward, because Everett always forgot something. Besides, the police station was forty-five seconds from where he lived. Plus, he\u2019d be on the town green, anyway, as there was yet another wine event today. Every weekend, there was something going on, and it was fine. Good for the town, good for job security.</p><p>But for now, a shower. He looked at the dog. It didn\u2019t feel right to bring a huge, filthy animal into Mr. and Mrs. Holland\u2019s house, where he\u2019d heard Faith was staying. Dog-washing. Another thing to add to his job description.</p><p>Since his wife dumped him a year and a half ago, Levi lived in the Opera House apartment building. Sharon and Jim Wiles had both spent and made a fortune on converting the building into the only apartment complex in town. A month after Nina had casually informed him that married life wasn\u2019t for her after all and reenlisted, Levi\u2019s mother had been diagnosed with a fast and furious pancreatic cancer. She\u2019d died six weeks later. Sarah, then almost finished with her junior year in high school, had moved in with him.</p><p>He\u2019d done his big brother shtick, putting his arm around her and letting her bawl, making her grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches, like Mom had done. He missed their mother, too, but he\u2019d been away for eight years. One thing combat had taught him was that in order to handle some of the awful shit they\u2019d dealt with, feelings had to have the cuffs slapped on them, so to speak. He\u2019d shed a few tears at his mom\u2019s bedside, don\u2019t get him wrong, but when real memories crept in\u2014the time she took him to Niagara Falls when he was in fifth grade and she was pregnant with Sarah, so they could have one last day of it being just the two of them...how she sobbed when he came home for good...well, Levi tried to think about something else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d done his best to take care of his sister, to get her into a good school, fill out all those damn forms and buy her what she needed, then ship her off and have her do great and maybe become a doctor or something. She\u2019d be the first person in their family to graduate from college and graduate she would, if it killed him.</p><p>Which it might.</p><p>\u201cYou reek,\u201d Baby Sister said as he came in, Blue on his heels. \u201cAnd whose dog is that? Is it ours? Can we keep him?\u201d She gave Levi a once-over. \u201cSeriously. You should take a shower. A long shower. God, Levi! Nasty!\u201d</p><p>He gave her a cool look (which never worked on her). \u201cThe dog isn\u2019t ours. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m filthy. Why are you here?\u201d</p> <p>She heaved a great sigh. \u201cI just...I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sarah went to a beautiful college at the north end of Seneca Lake; the place had its own movie theater, a huge athletic center, flowers everywhere, nice dorms. Honestly, what could she complain about?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel like I missed out on how things are supposed to work. Everyone has friends already, and it\u2019s like I can\u2019t break in. I skipped dinner yesterday because I didn\u2019t want to go to the dining hall all alone. I feel like a loser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d Levi said, kneeling next to her chair, \u201cyou\u2019re not a loser. Just go sit down next to someone and start talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this advice comes from your personal experience? Because last I looked, you have exactly one friend.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201cYou\u2019re smart, you\u2019re pretty and you\u2019re fun. Except now. Now, you\u2019re not fun. You\u2019re also not supposed to be home. I thought we agreed after last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a shower, dude. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. You can\u2019t make college work if you keep coming home every three days. You have to tough it out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m tired of toughing it out. I toughed it out through Mom dying, I toughed it out senior year and I don\u2019t want to tough anything out anymore. I want to be...indulged.\u201d</p><p>Levi lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be enlisted if you don\u2019t shape up. That college is hardly toughing it out, sis. Your dorm room is three times as big as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, not another story from the trials and tribulations of Army, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Army, Sarah. You don\u2019t call it \u2018army.\u2019 I was in the Army. Try to get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Come on, Levi, don\u2019t be a hard-ass. It\u2019s Thursday. I have one class tomorrow afternoon. I can skip it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. I\u2019ll drive you back tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi! I\u2019m so homesick! Please let me sleep here!\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, then surveyed the cobwebs he\u2019d picked up under the porch. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll bring you back tomorrow morning. Pull up your schedule so I can make sure you\u2019re not lying.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, the winner of this round. \u201cSure. But take a shower or I\u2019m gonna puke.\u201d</p><p>He stood up. \u201cWant to help me wash the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I appreciate the offer.\u201d</p> <p>He moved to ruffle her hair, but she ducked. \u201cLevi. Clean up.\u201d</p><p>He knew his sister loved him. She\u2019d even changed her last name to Cooper when she was sixteen, to make sure everyone knew who she was, she\u2019d said. But he still wanted to kill her sometimes.</p><p>He took the dog into the bathroom\u2014his own bathroom, thank God for that\u2014and turned on the shower. The dog bent his head in deep shame. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t give me that, chicken chaser. Who\u2019s idea was it to go under the porch?\u201d He took out his phone and dialed from memory. \u201cHi, Mrs. Holland, it\u2019s Levi Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear! How are you? Do you know how to get flying squirrels out of the attic? Faith doesn\u2019t want us to set traps, and I don\u2019t want her to watch her grandfather fall to his death, though to be honest, widowhood is looking better and better these days. By the way, that pipe that burst last winter? Do you remember the name of the plumber you recommended? Ever since Virgil Ames moved to Florida, I don\u2019t know what to do! And Florida! Who\u2019d want to live there? All those bugs and lizards and alligators and tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby Prete should be able to fix the pipe, Mrs. H.,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got Faith\u2019s dog with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, he ran off when Ned was watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I bring him up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give him to Faith, dear. She\u2019s down on the green, anyway. Which reminds me, I\u2019ve got to get ready. Lovely talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Levi took off his shirt and threw it in the tub, giving it a good rinse before putting it into the laundry bin. \u201cCome on, dog,\u201d he said to Blue, who\u2019d curled up in a tight ball and was pretending to sleep. \u201cTime to face the music.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>THERE WERE PROBABLY five hundred people crowded onto the green and the streets around it for the Seventeenth Annual Cork &amp; Pork, which sounded disturbingly perverted but was in fact a pig roast and wine tasting. Five hundred people, Faith noted, and it seemed like at least half of them were dying to console her\u2014still\u2014over being jilted on her wedding day.</p><p>\u201cYou were the most beautiful bride,\u201d Mrs. Bancroft was saying. \u201cReally. We were all so shocked. So shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him? Is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him yet, Mrs. Bancroft. But we\u2019re getting together next week.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bancroft stared at her, shaking her head. \u201cYou poor, poor thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops. There\u2019s my brother. Gotta run.\u201d She left Mrs. Bancroft and went over to the Blue Heron tables and looped her arm through Jack\u2019s. \u201cYou needed me desperately, dear brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, pouring a one-ounce taste for a woman whose T-shirt proclaimed her as Texan and Carrying. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re even related. How many sisters do I have, anyway? You seem to be multiplying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bancroft is the eighth person to call me a poor thing and ask how hard it is to see Jeremy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are pretty pathetic,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYour name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are so many people in my way?\u201d asked Mrs. Johnson. The long-time Holland housekeeper managed somehow to convey terror in her beautiful, lilting Jamaican accent. \u201cShoo, children. If you don\u2019t leave soon, there will be body parts everywhere, and I washed and starched and ironed this tablecloth this morning. If you want to live, move, I say.\u201d She straightened out the bottles so they were perfectly aligned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wine tasting, Mrs. J.,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe can\u2019t move.\u201d He turned to the gun-toting Texan. \u201cWhat did you think? Can I pour you something else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have more of the white zin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ros\u00e9,\u201d Jack said. Faith imagined he was trying not to weep over the misnomer of his beloved wine. The lady drained it, smiled and wandered off.</p><p>\u201cJackie,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said, \u201cdid you eat this morning? I brought you a sandwich. I don\u2019t want you eating any of the slop they\u2019re serving here.\u201d This earned her a dirty look from Cathy Kennedy, who was staffing the sausage booth for Trinity Lutheran. Mrs. Johnson returned the look hotly, till Cathy Kennedy broke. Most people did.</p><p>Mrs. J. unwrapped the sandwich and put it in Jack\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, little prince,\u201d Faith said. \u201cEat up. Maybe Mrs. J. will chew the food for you so you don\u2019t have to work so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so disgusting and unladylike, Faith, and here, Jackie. Eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my sandwich?\u201d Pru asked, joining them.</p><p>\u201cDid I not make you griddle cakes this very morning?\u201d Mrs. J. asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I hear Lorena,\u201d Jack said. \u201cPru, uh, come help me with something really important. Faith can handle the tasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back here,\u201d Faith hissed. It was no good. Both siblings bolted, leaving her to staff the tasting table with their housekeeper, who clucked in disapproval. \u201cMrs. J., why can\u2019t you marry Dad and make us all happy?\u201d Faith asked. Though she wasn\u2019t completely sure, Faith thought Mrs. Johnson was widowed. Then again, the woman didn\u2019t spill about her personal life. Ever.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started on your father\u2019s many flaws, the least of which is his recently terrible taste in women.\u201d Mrs. Johnson stared at Lorena, her face swelling with regal disgust. \u201cFive o\u2019clock in the afternoon and she, with a dress that exposes more than half of those tired br**sts. Shameful, shameful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on a replacement,\u201d Faith murmured, unable to tear her eyes off Lorena, who wore a strapless tiger-print sundress several sizes too small. The bodice was smocked, the stitching stretched to the \u201cwe can\u2019t hold on much longer\u201d point. Dad, on the other hand, was in his customary aging Blue Heron shirt, stained Blue Heron cap and stained jeans, yucking it up with Joe Whiting, another winemaker from farther up Keuka. Dad was probably unaware that Lorena (and everyone around them) assumed he was on a date.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better work fast, my dear,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cYour father, he is not the most observant of men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t related to grapes, Dad tended not to notice. So, yes, it was possible that, before he fully realized what was happening, Lorena could move in, change his will and sell off ten acres to a water park developer. But finding the perfect woman, that was a challenge. Dad worshipped the memory of St. Mom.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a taste of the Gew\u00fcrztraminer?\u201d a man asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Faith answered, snapping to attention. \u201cThis one got a 91 from Wine Spectator, and we\u2019re very proud of it. It\u2019s been aged for eighteen months, so it\u2019s just now starting to speak. The nose is lovely, don\u2019t you think? Passionfruit, pepper, a little honeysuckle, just a touch of pencil lead in the body, with a whisper of lychee in the finish.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Johnson snorted, and Faith bit down on a smile. Yeah, yeah, she\u2019d made that all up, not having tasted the wine yet. Faith wasn\u2019t even sure whether or not lychee was an actual fruit. Those descriptions got a little silly sometimes, but it almost seemed the more ridiculous the description, the better the sales. Still, Honor would kill her if she heard. She took wine descriptions very seriously.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d the man said. \u201cPencil lead. I love it!\u201d</p><p>At that moment, her dog bounded over to her. \u201cHi, baby!\u201d she said bending over to ruffle his wet fur. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been? Did Ned take you swimming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother and your dog just took a shower together,\u201d came a voice. \u201cKinda pervy, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Faith looked up. \u201cSarah! I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>Faith had always envied Levi for having a little sister; he\u2019d always been very protective of her, one of his few (only?) redeeming qualities. Sarah had the same green eyes as Levi, though hers weren\u2019t filled with dismissal. Yeah. That was it. Levi could dismiss a person in one glance. He was, in fact, doing it right now.</p><p>\u201cKeep a better eye on your dog, Faith,\u201d he said, deigning to speak to her. \u201cHe was terrorizing the Knoxes\u2019 chickens.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like Blue would terrorize anything. \u201cBranch,\u201d she said. Ass, she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cChief Cooper! You\u2019re a sight for sore eyes,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said, getting a kiss on the cheek from Levi. Weird, seeing him acting with social graces.</p><p>Faith turned back to Sarah. \u201cYou must be in college now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just started at Hobart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Do you like it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate it, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sarah,\u201d Ned said, coming over and slinging an arm around Faith. \u201cFaith, I\u2019m here to take over, because Honor says you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ned.\u201d Sarah blushed. Ned was very cute.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d he asked, and the two started talking about classes and clubs. They looked nice together, Sarah with her blond hair, Ned tall and dark. And while Ned was already out of college, that didn\u2019t really matter. He didn\u2019t have a girlfriend that Faith knew of, and she interrogated him frequently on the subject.</p> <p>Levi was watching the two of them. No smile. He glanced at her, scowled, then resumed his staring. Faith suppressed a sigh. It wasn\u2019t like she was playing matchmaker; she was just standing there. Like a lump, now that she thought of it.</p><p>Dad came over and handed her a bottle of water. \u201cMake sure you drink enough, sweetpea,\u201d he said, his kind blue eyes crinkling. \u201cIt\u2019s hot compared to what you\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>Alas, Lorena appeared at his side. \u201cFinally!\u201d Lorena boomed. \u201cSomething decent to drink around here! Blue Heron has the best wine ever! I haven\u2019t had anything but swill all day long!\u201d She gave Dad an exaggerated wink, and Faith suppressed a cringe. The winemakers in the region were a very tight bunch; there was some quiet competition, of course, and everyone wanted to win a medal or snag a great review. But what was good for one vineyard tended to be good for them all, so Lorena\u2019s type of PR wasn\u2019t scoring any points.</p><p>\u201cHi there, Sarah,\u201d Dad said. \u201cHow are you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks, Mr. Holland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLevi,\u201d Dad said, \u201cyou\u2019ve seen Faith since she got back, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was abruptly aware that Levi was standing very close to her, smelling like soap, his hair damp. What had Sarah said? He\u2019d given Blue a bath?</p><p>He gave her a look that fell around an eight on the Boredom Scale, something she\u2019d first invented sophomore year of high school, when she\u2019d asked if he wanted to sign up to tutor with her in Corning. One was Oh. It\u2019s you. Ten was You\u2019re invisible. And today\u2019s look, the eight, was Really? You\u2019re still here?</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said to her father. \u201cGave her a speeding ticket the other day.\u201d</p><p>Irritating. Then again, he hadn\u2019t mentioned the fact that she\u2019d been wedged in a bathroom window, either. Points for discretion.</p><p>Dad gave her a surprised look. \u201cYou, honey? You\u2019re usually so careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d dropped the speed limit, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you let me pay for that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Goggy appeared from the crowd. \u201cFaith, take a look at what your grandfather is wearing. He knows I hate that shirt. It\u2019s polyester! And it\u2019s from 1972.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA classic,\u201d Pops said, though he was already sweating from the airless fabric.</p><p>\u201cLevi,\u201d Goggy said, laying her hand on his forearm. His tanned, smooth, muscular forearm. Little golden hairs caught the light. Faith cleared her throat and looked at something else. \u201cThe squirrels in our attic. They make noise every night! Faith can hardly sleep.\u201d This earned her another disgusted look from Levi.</p><p>\u201cGoggy, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll go up there with some Havahart traps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, sweetheart,\u201d Goggy said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Faith to fall.\u201d</p> <p>Pru returned to the Blue Heron table, Abby in tow, and cuffed Levi fondly on the shoulder. \u201cHere he is. Viagra for women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please! We\u2019re in public!\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYou said it, Pru!\u201d Lorena answered. \u201cCan I get an amen? Right, Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no, I\u2019m not feeling it,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Sarah, didn\u2019t see you there,\u201d Pru said. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to ogle your brother in front of you. And what can I say? He\u2019s cute. Levi, you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>Abby rolled her eyes. \u201cSarah, want to go find something to do? Get away from these horrifying adults?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cSee you later, big bro.\u201d She smooched Levi on the cheek, who took it manfully. Even smiled.</p><p>It was just a small smile, but it took Faith unawares. Granted, she\u2019d seen him smile over the years. Plenty of steamy looks at Jessica... Honestly, he probably practiced those in the mirror. Otherwise, it was the Boredom Scale for her.</p><p>Except for that one day when he\u2019d shocked the living daylights out of her and kissed her. Chances were, he\u2019d smiled then. And yes, there\u2019d been a steamy look or two. Something else, too. Something...protective.</p><p>Or not. He was looking at her now, the smile gone and that much more familiar bored look...a six...now a seven...getting close to an eight. He crinkled his brow at her as if to say, What, Holland?</p><p>\u201cJohnny!\u201d Lorena boomed. \u201cWhat\u2019s a girl gotta do to get a meal around here? Buy me a sausage, what do you say? I love me some sausage! Right, Faith? Us girls love sausage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she has some nerve, calling herself a girl,\u201d Mrs. Johnson muttered darkly.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like, Lorena?\u201d Dad asked. \u201cFaith? No? Mrs. Johnson, how about you? Can I buy you some of that kettle corn you like? Hmm? I\u2019ll take that silence as a yes.\u201d He winked, then walked away, Lorena and her mammoth br**sts flopping along beside him.</p><p>\u201cThink he even knows she\u2019s interested?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather is too good-hearted,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cThat woman.\u201d</p><p>The next customer at the wine tasting was a familiar face. \u201cHi, Mrs. McPhales!\u201d Faith said, her throat tightening. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you!\u201d Mrs. McPhales had been Faith\u2019s Girl Scout leader one year, one of those die-hard types who actually made scouts earn the badges. Ned, who was on the Manningsport Volunteer Fire Department, said they went up to her house fairly often these days. Apparently she was heading down the sad road toward dementia...today, she was wearing her slippers instead of shoes. Faith came out from behind the table and kissed the old lady. \u201cWhat can I get for you, Mrs. McPhales? Would you like some wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a coffee, I guess,\u201d the old lady said.</p><p>\u201cComing up, dear lady. Cream and sugar?\u201d Mrs. Johnson asked. She really was a peach once you got over her Darth Vader type of omnipotence. Mrs. McPhales nodded, then seemed to recognize Faith.</p><p>\u201cFaith! How are you? Aren\u2019t you and that nice Jeremy getting married soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Faith said. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! That\u2019s right! He\u2019s a confirmed bachelor, from what I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing. Chin up, Faith, dear. You\u2019re very brave.\u201d</p><p>Faith thought she heard a snort. Right. Levi was still here. Brian, Mrs. McPhales\u2019s son, came up and took his mom by the arm, smiling at Faith as he led her away.</p><p>At the moment, there was no one around except Levi. \u201cThanks for washing Blue,\u201d she said, attempting to be friendly. \u201cThat was really nice of you. And unnecessary, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep him leashed.\u201d A five on the scale. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start fining you if he runs loose all the time.\u201d</p><p>Sigh. \u201cIt was one time, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it\u2019s only one.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even looking at her; casting about instead for someone more interesting to talk with.</p><p>Faith felt her jaw clenching. \u201cHeard you got divorced, Chief.\u201d</p><p>His eyes came back to her. An eight. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you married?\u201d Colleen had passed on the details, of course, but why not torture him?</p><p>He waited before answering, his green eyes filled with disdain. \u201cThree months,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cReally! Wow. What a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Holland,\u201d he said. \u201cThree months is a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you wish someone had stopped your wedding.\u201d She smiled sweetly. \u201cSeems only fair, since you\u2019re so good at doing that for others.\u201d</p><p>Levi was crinkling his brow at her again. \u201cWhen do you go back to San Francisco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? No job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very successful, actually. And I\u2019m doing two projects here, one up at Blue Heron, another for the library, so I\u2019ll be around for at least six weeks. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThere\u2019s Julianne Kammer now. I should go and talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to see Jeremy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGosh. Is it really any of your business? Oh, wait, I forgot. You\u2019re Jeremy\u2019s guard dog.\u201d She was going to see Jeremy; it wasn\u2019t her fault he was in Boston for a conference.</p><p>Levi leaned in close, and she could smell his shampoo, feel the warmth from his cheek, and an odd tension coiled in her stomach. \u201cGrow up, Faith,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The man. Was. Suchapainintheass.</p><p>Then she went to talk to Julianne about the library courtyard and tried not to feel Levi\u2019s eyes on her back.</p><p>ON HIS FIRST TOUR, Levi found that war was all it promised to be, at times stupefyingly dull...days on end of doing nothing more interesting or challenging than cleaning your gun. Then you\u2019d be coming back to camp and a kid who\u2019d taken food from you the day before might throw a grenade at your Humvee. Once, a car loaded with explosives detonated just outside camp, killing three soldiers, including one who\u2019d won fifty bucks off Levi the night before.</p><p>But there were good things, too. Levi liked the structure, liked his fellow soldiers, liked the feeling that as screwed up as war always was, maybe they were doing something important. His unit was the 10th Mountain from Fort Drum, and they were the guys who got shit done. Sometimes it was best not to think about what those things were, but he was a soldier, a link in the chain of command, and he did his job. After his tour ended, he signed up for another. Made sergeant, then staff sergeant. Re-upped again and sent the bonus home to his mom.</p><p>Then one day, while on patrol in some horrible little town where people lived in shacks and everyone seemed to stare at them with dead eyes, a bullet sang right past his head, shattering rock. Another crack, and before Levi could even turn around, Scotty Stokes, a private who\u2019d just joined their unit, crumpled to the ground. Levi grabbed him by the back of his vest and dragged him to shallow cover. They were cut off from the rest of the patrol, and the kid was bleeding badly from the leg, maybe an artery. Levi tourniqueted the kid\u2019s leg as best he could. Returned fire, killing one of the gunmen, then hefted the kid over his shoulder and made a run for it, praying that neither of them would be hit.</p><p>They made it. The medic thought Scotty would lose his leg, but some badass ortho with a great pair of hands managed to save it. Scotty would set off metal detectors for the rest of his life, but he\u2019d walk on the legs God gave him. And Levi got a Silver Star, though to him, it seemed more like dumb luck than any real forethought or skill. Lots of training, maybe. His mom and Sarah were proud, though. The Lyons, too, acted as if he\u2019d saved the world. They had Mom and Sarah up for dinner, and all four of them Skyped with him, and that was pretty great.</p><p>From the time Levi had left on that Greyhound until he came back to Manningsport, Jeremy stayed in touch. Sent him emails all the time, Skyped once in a while, always smiling, always able to tell him something funny. Stuff about college, football, dorm life. Those little glimpses were almost hard to picture\u2014Levi had never been to Boston, couldn\u2019t imagine playing in a stadium that huge. When Levi described the desert sand storms, Jeremy sent him really excellent ski goggles and six boxes of Visine. Elaine and Ted sent him candy and organic potato chips, and of course Mom and Sarah sent him stuff constantly. Sarah\u2019s report cards, Mom\u2019s long, worried letters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone emailed pictures, but Jeremy went a step further and had them developed. Levi tacked them up next to his bunk\u2014a picture of Sarah at Christmas, since the Lyons had had them over for dinner; the dense clusters of grapes hanging from the vines in the fall; the hills covered in snow in December, the water of the lake black and deep.</p><p>Home.</p><p>And when a car came screaming up to your outpost or you braced for the IED to blow you into chunks, when bullets streaked through the night air, home was the only thing that kept your shit together. On the days when the temperature hit a hundred and thirty and his gun was so hot he had to wear gloves to hold it, when his water was the same temperature as McDonald\u2019s coffee and his mouth felt like leather from being so dry, those pictures were little pieces of paradise.</p><p>Faith\u2019s name, which had been mentioned fairly often at first, stopped appearing after Jeremy graduated and started med school (he\u2019d turned down the NFL, for crying out loud). There was some mention of one of Jeremy\u2019s fellow medical students, a guy named Steve, and Levi wondered if maybe there was something there. Honestly, though he didn\u2019t give it much thought. If his friend had come out of the closet, Levi would hear about it when Jeremy wanted him to.</p> <p>Finally, five years after he\u2019d first gone to Afghanistan, Levi got a leave long enough to go back. He\u2019d seen his mom and Sarah twice since shipping out, once on a long weekend in New York City, once when he surprised them with a trip to Disney World. But this time, he wanted to go home. He popped in on Sarah at school in one of those tear-soaked CNN moments, endured an impromptu assembly in which the principal told him how proud they were (despite having given him a record number of detentions not so long ago). His mom made his favorite dinner\u2014meat loaf and mashed potatoes, then wept happily all the way through it.</p><p>And finally, Levi called Jeremy; it was October, and Jeremy was home for the weekend from Johns Hopkins. \u201cHey, bud, wanna grab a beer?\u201d he asked, then grinned as his friend cussed him out for not giving him more notice.</p><p>A few hours later, Levi was slightly drunk from all the beers bought for him. Connor O\u2019Rourke had done a round on the house, and everyone had toasted Levi. He\u2019d been hugged by every woman in the place and practically leg-humped by Sheila Varkas (total freak, that one), was repeatedly thanked for his service, had his back pounded and his hand shaken and was told how proud the town was. It was...nice. It was great, actually. The kid from the trailer park turned American hero and all that.</p><p>And then, finally, he and Jeremy got to sit down and talk.</p><p>\u201cSo how are you really, buddy?\u201d Jeremy asked, his eyes as kind as ever.</p> <p>Levi watched a drop of condensation slip down the side of his bottle. \u201cDoing okay,\u201d he answered, not looking up.</p><p>Jeremy was quiet for a minute. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d</p><p>A good night\u2019s sleep. War had definitely taken that away. A brain bleach to get some of the more horrific images out of his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut thanks for all those packages and stuff. Especially the pictures.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy leaned forward. \u201cWell, listen. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, I\u2019m just some dumb-ass med student studying bowel disease.\u201d Levi gave a half smile. \u201cBut if you ever need anything, or want to unload or whatever, I\u2019m here. And I\u2019ll be here the whole time, and when you get back, too. Okay? You\u2019re my best friend. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Levi gave a nod, peeled a shard from the label. Maybe there would be a day when he told Jeremy some of the things he\u2019d seen...and done. It wasn\u2019t today, though. He looked up at Jeremy and nodded again. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy sat back in the booth and smiled, that broad easy grin that Levi remembered from football huddles, when Jeremy would tell them just how they were going to shock and awe their opponents by coming from behind and stealing the win. \u201cSo. Any way you can get a few days off next June?\u201d</p> <p>Levi shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to be my best man. June eighth. Faith and I are getting married.\u201d</p><p>Levi didn\u2019t blink. \u201cHoly crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jeremy grinned sheepishly. \u201cShe said yes. I was a nervous wreck, but she said yes.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. Faith Holland had probably been planning their wedding since the day she\u2019d met Jeremy.</p><p>His buddy was blathering on about who\u2019d be in the bridal party, and Levi suddenly held up his hand. \u201cJeremy,\u201d he said. \u201cJust one second, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>To ask or not to ask. That was the question. Levi glanced around. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was almost empty; two people at the bar, two more at a table. Connor was behind the bar, tallying up receipts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jeremy asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married,\u201d Levi stated for clarification.</p><p>He nodded. Levi didn\u2019t say anything, just looked. Maybe lifted an eyebrow. Jeremy swallowed, then forced a grin. \u201cYeah. So?\u201d He wiped his forehead, suddenly sweaty, and that was clue enough. If he was this nervous, then maybe he was just waiting for someone to bring it up.</p><p>\u201cI guess I was always under the impression that you were...\u201d Levi waited, hoping Jeremy would supply the word.</p><p>\u201cI was what?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Levi took a deep breath and held it. \u201cThat you were g*y, Jeremy,\u201d he said very, very quietly.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s face didn\u2019t change for a long second. Then he took a deep breath. \u201cNo! Uh...I don\u2019t think so. I mean, everyone has...thoughts. But just because...\u201d He looked away. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not g*y.\u201d His voice was hollow.</p><p>Levi didn\u2019t say anything\u2014what do you say, after all? \u201cIt would be okay if you were.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy looked back at him, and something crossed his face. The truth, maybe. Then he shook his head a little. His eyebrows drew together, and he looked at the table. \u201cI love Faith.\u201d</p><p>Right. Jeremy certainly was wrapped around Princess Super-Cute\u2019s little finger. Levi looked at his friend, who\u2019d been so loyal and decent and constant. He exhaled, nodding. \u201cOkay. My bad.\u201d</p><p>Again, that thing flickered through Jeremy\u2019s eyes, but he put on his game face and smiled. \u201cWell, whatever. If you\u2019d be my best man, that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If I can get the time, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent! Faith will be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Probably not. \u201cIs she around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry to say. She and her sisters went to the city to shop for wedding gowns and all that. Girls\u2019 weekend. Anyway, my parents are giving us the house after the wedding; they\u2019re ditching me for San Diego, but it\u2019s all good. Can\u2019t see that Faith would want her in-laws around all the time, you know?\u201d Jeremy kept talking, firmly back in the role of doting fianc\u00e9.</p><p>Levi told himself it wasn\u2019t any of his business. If Jeremy wanted to marry Faith, he could. But, hell, you had to wonder. How Jeremy could marry a woman he didn\u2019t know how to kiss.</p><p>You had to wonder how Faith could not know.</p><p>You said your piece; now shut up, his brain told him. Be a good friend. Be a good best man.</p><p>He almost pulled it off.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>FAITH STOOD AT THE TOP of Rose Ridge and looked down through the woods. Once, this area had been fields, and Faith\u2019s ancestors had grazed cows up here. In the hundred years since, maple and oak trees had taken over, as well as ferns and moss. Today, a cold front had moved through, bringing heavy-bellied clouds over the lake and a chilly wind. Rain couldn\u2019t be far off.</p><p>Down below, she could see Ned driving the grape harvester down in the Tom\u2019s Woods chardonnay vines, could catch the hum of the engine when the breeze stopped. There was a certain smell to late summer; the air was so sweet with the scent of grapes, but there was a hint of melancholy in the air, too, as the leaves prepared to die their beautiful deaths and the earth prepared for winter.</p><p>As she did each time she came home, Faith wondered how she\u2019d ever left. San Francisco seemed like a distant dream life compared to this.</p><p>Blue Heron was to the Hollands what Tara was to Scarlett O\u2019Hara. You were from here, and here defined you more than you knew. History and family were as much a part of the soil as the dirt itself, and every Holland felt the bond right into their bone marrow.</p><p>As the youngest of the four Holland kids, Faith often felt like there wasn\u2019t a place for her in the family business. Jack was the wine-making, chemistry genius, could talk for hours about yeast and sugar fermentation till people begged him to stop. Pru was the farmer, tromping through the fields, strong as a linebacker. Honor...well, everyone knew Honor ran the world. Her sister barely stopped working to breathe; every issue came to her, whether it was restocking the gift shop, going on sales calls with their distributors or doing a charity event. She handled all the marketing and sales for the vineyard and did her job beautifully.</p><p>And then there was Faith, the child who hadn\u2019t had a place waiting for her, the only one who hadn\u2019t focused her education around viniculture. There were only so many people who could run the roost before they started eating their young.</p><p>She\u2019d played up here as a child, sat in the old stone barn and pretended it was her house. Had tea parties with imaginary friends, made fairy houses and lay in the grass, sheltered by the rocks, staring up into the blue sky, wondering how she could tame a hawk or fawn. It was so magical to her then, she could just about hear the soft footfalls of a unicorn or hobbit. Of all the places on their land, the vines and the fields, the woods and the falls, this had been the most special to Faith.</p><p>And now, finally, she could contribute to the family business. It felt good. Just because she was the youngest didn\u2019t mean that this place wasn\u2019t part of her soul.</p><p>Blue nudged her hand and dropped his tennis ball. \u201cAgain?\u201d Faith asked. He didn\u2019t answer, just stared at her, willing her to throw the ball. \u201cYou got it, big guy,\u201d she said, hurling the ball into the woods.</p><p>Faith had spent the morning at the library, taking photos of the courtyard off the children\u2019s wing, measuring, taking notes. It was a sweet little space, and she intended to make it great. Flowering trees (she was already shmoozing the nursery for donations), a winding path, a water installment, because she loved the sound of gushing water (who didn\u2019t?). And then, for the centerpiece, something really special, though she didn\u2019t know just what yet. She had to spend a little time there first and feel the mojo before she decided. One of her clients in San Francisco used to laugh at her for lying down on the ground of any given project, but, hey, he kept hiring her for more jobs, so clearly it worked.</p><p>Just this morning, Faith had probably seen a dozen people she knew: Lorelei from the bakery on the green; her old classmate Theresa DeFilio, and her parade of children, following her like beautiful, dark-haired ducklings. Faith\u2019s old Sunday school teacher, Mrs. Linqvist, who still made Faith feel guilty. The football coach\u2019s wife. Jack\u2019s high school girlfriend. The nurse from Jeremy\u2019s office.</p><p>As for Jeremy himself, she\u2019d be seeing him tomorrow night.</p><p>Faith took another breath, and, as ever, the uniquely sweet smell of the Finger Lakes air\u2014grapes and grass\u2014calmed her. The smell of home.</p><p>Blue was back, but he raced past her, woofing joyfully around his tennis ball.</p><p>\u201cHey, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Pru! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust figured I\u2019d come have a look, see what you were doing up here.\u201d She threw Blue\u2019s tennis ball into the woods. \u201cAbout time Dad green-lighted this. All the other vineyards have been doing weddings for years.\u201d She took off her hat and ran a hand through her salt-and-pepper hair.</p><p>They were quiet a moment, the beauty of the gray day solemn somehow.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Pru? You seem a little down.\u201d</p><p>Her sister sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just tired. Early harvest and all that. Dad\u2019s driving me crazy, as usual.\u201d She glanced over at Faith. \u201cAlso, I feel like Carl and I are living in a p**n o these days. Sex, sex, sex, all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh! How thrilling!\u201d Faith glanced at her sister\u2019s face. \u201cOops. Not thrilling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst it was just hints, you know? Like, did I want a bikini wax, or could we talk dirty. Then...\u201d To Faith\u2019s horror, Prudence\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cShit, Faith. I don\u2019t know. The whole bringing sexy back...you know that song? By that cute boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know it,\u201d Faith said grimly.</p><p>\u201cWho is he again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJustin Timberlake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. \u201cBring Sexy Back\u201d or something. Well, I didn\u2019t know sexy was gone. Now Carl wants me to be all creative. You know what he brought back from Costco last week? Eight cans of whipped cream, Faith. Eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d Faith said. Time to swear off dairy.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s having the opposite effect. Right? Like, the storm of love I used to have has dried to a mist, because all of a sudden, plain old marital brevity isn\u2019t good enough. Oh, and the other day, Abby walked in on us, and she\u2019s not speaking to me at the moment. Last week, Faith, I had a mammogram, you know?\u201d</p><p>Faith looked up sharply. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure! But I was looking forward to it! Like, that was my special alone time, just me and the boob squisher. I didn\u2019t have to talk dirty to Carl or wear Vulcan ears\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014or deal with the kids, Dad wasn\u2019t asking me questions and Honor wasn\u2019t up my butt. The mammogram people were running behind, so I got to sit there in a bathrobe and read a magazine and it was the best time I\u2019ve had in ages! Even when my boob was in the machine, I said to the woman, \u2018No, no, take your time,\u2019 and I meant it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPru!\u201d Faith pulled her sister into a hug, and Blue, panting, joined in the comfort, nosing against the two of them, whining. \u201cOh, honey. Maybe you just need some time away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Faith!\u201d she barked. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. We\u2019ve got harvest, which is seven days a week till it\u2019s done, then we have the ice wine harvest, then it\u2019s the stupid holidays, and really, why did Baby Jesus have to be born in December? Because March is wide open! I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jesus was actually born in\u2014you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. You should get away for a few days. Alone. I\u2019ll drive Abby wherever she needs to go, and make dinner for everyone or whatever you need. Really, Pru.\u201d</p> <p>Her sister straightened up and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her shirt, then scratched Blue behind his ears. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice thought,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can. You\u2019re choosing not to. Don\u2019t be a martyr, Pru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You sound so California. And being a martyr is our family motto.\u201d Her sister wiped her eyes again. \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject. Show me what you have in mind for up here. Come on. Chop, chop. I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Faith led her sister into the woods proper. The path was overgrown, but it was there. A squirrel chastised them from a tree branch overhead, and the smell of rain was thicker now. Blue led the way, his tail waving.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been up here in years,\u201d Prudence said behind her. \u201cAlways too busy, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the barn?\u201d Faith asked, holding a branch back so her sister wouldn\u2019t get whacked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here we are.\u201d</p> <p>They stood in front of what currently didn\u2019t look like much: the rock walls of the old barn, which had been built in the early 1800s and burned when Teddy Roosevelt was President. The roof and interior had been destroyed in the fire, as well as the wooden doors, leaving a wide gap in the wall.</p><p>Faith went inside, Pru on her heels. \u201cHuh,\u201d her sister said.</p><p>Three walls of ragged stone surrounded them. The floor had long been taken over by forest grass and moss, and lichen had coated the rock walls. But the best part was\u2014to Faith\u2019s mind, anyway\u2014that the lake-facing wall had crumbled, opening the space up to the most amazing view. Thanks to the steepness of the hills, they could see the tops of the trees in front of them. Past that were the fields of grapevines, the white buildings of Blue Heron\u2014the New House, the tasting room, the barn where the wine aged in tanks and casks\u2014and then more fields and woods, and finally Keuka, the Crooked Lake itself.</p><p>\u201cSo how would this work for weddings and such?\u201d Pru asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, this would be the space. You could get about seventy-five people in here, give or take. I\u2019d level off the floor but maybe keep it grass. Then we\u2019d build a cantilevered deck, so you could stand out there like you were on the prow of a ship, ten, fifteen, twenty feet off the ground as the floor extended out. Maybe take down a tree or two and open up the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it rains?\u201d Pru asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the magical part,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou can get clear roofing material, and if Dad wanted to get really fancy, we could take the roof on and off, depending on the time of year or forecast. A fireplace over here for some ambience, build a little stone terrace out here for cocktails. Wouldn\u2019t it be beautiful? So you\u2019d be under the stars, dancing on air, all this beauty around you.\u201d She looked at her sister. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrickin\u2019 amazing,\u201d Prudence said. \u201cWow, Faith! You can do all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! I\u2019d make a parking area back there on the ridge, widen the path down here, get the doors replaced. You\u2019d come in and boom\u2014magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParking? Kitchen? Electric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to the building officer about permits, and she doesn\u2019t see a problem. We\u2019d just need to dig a trench, lay down some PVC, run electric up from the road. The old well might still be usable. Over there, see that area? That\u2019s where the milking shed was. The caterers could set up in there.\u201d</p><p>And if it looked anything like what she had in her mind\u2019s eye, it would be incredible, one of her most intricate projects as a landscape architect yet...and, finally, her contribution to the family business. Her little stone playhouse, transformed. \u201cThink Dad\u2019ll like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad would like the Superdome if it made you stay home, Faithie. And I already love it,\u201d Pru said, putting her arm around Faith. \u201cMom would be proud.\u201d</p><p>One of these days, those words wouldn\u2019t kick her quite so hard. One of these days.</p><p>The rain that had been threatening began to fall, pattering gently. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll give you a ride,\u201d Pru said. \u201cMy truck\u2019s at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Halfway between the old barn and the vineyard buildings was the family cemetery. Seven generations of Hollands, from the soldier who\u2019d fought in the Battle of Trenton with George Washington to the most recent burial\u2014Mom.</p><p>Prudence cleared away some wilted flowers from Mom\u2019s marker. Constance Verling Holland, age 49. Beloved daughter, wife and mother. Always a smile in her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou ever come here to talk to Mom?\u201d Pru asked.</p><p>Faith blinked. \u201cOh, sure,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Dad comes all the time, of course.\u201d She straightened up. \u201cHey, thanks for listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. That\u2019s what sisters are for.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, Pru\u2019s phone buzzed. She looked at it and pressed a button. \u201cHi, Levi, what\u2019s up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>At his name, Faith felt her skin prickle. She\u2019d have to get used to it, she guessed. The guy was everywhere.</p><p>\u201cShe did what? Where? Is she okay? Right. Right. Okay, I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d Pru\u2019s face was white.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Faith asked, her heart galloping in fear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Abby. She was jumping into the falls. Drunk. With two boys.\u201d Pru glanced at Faith. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, but Levi\u2019s got the three of them down at the station. Will you drive?\u201d</p><p>Moments later, they were in the tiny police station. There was Abby, teary-eyed and defiant, sitting at Levi\u2019s desk. Thank God, she seemed fine. Levi was there as well, and Everett Field, for whom Faith used to babysit. No sign of the boys in question.</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you okay? Are you an idiot? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do something so stupid!\u201d Prudence barked.</p><p>\u201cReally, Mom? You\u2019re gonna tell me I\u2019m stupid? Who\u2019s got a thing for Dr. Spock, huh? You and Dad, that\u2019s who. That\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Spock, okay?\u201d There was an aborted snort from Emmaline, who\u2019d been a year ahead of Faith in school. \u201cAnd we\u2019re talking about an underage girl getting drunk and doing stupid, dangerous, life-threatening things with boys. I thought you were smarter, Abby!\u201d</p><p>Faith glanced at Levi, who looked quite intimidating, his face in a slight scowl, arms folded across his chest. If he flexed his biceps, that shirt was going to rip, which she probably shouldn\u2019t be noticing right now. Behind him, Everett imitated Levi\u2019s pose. Didn\u2019t have quite the same effect. He smiled at her and gave a little wave, then remembered he was an officer of the law and resumed frowning.</p><p>According to Levi, Abby had been talked into showing Adam Berkeley and Josh Deiner the falls on the Holland property. Josh had brought a six-pack, so he was in the most trouble, as was the package store employee who hadn\u2019t carded him. The kids had each had a couple of beers, then jumped off the rock into the water, swimming and goofing around, when a lost hiker came upon them and correctly guessed that they were underage. Levi had scared the bejesus out of them by showing up.</p><p>\u201cI may puke,\u201d Abby muttered, swallowing. Levi nudged the trash can closer to her with his foot, his expression unchanging.</p><p>\u201cYou know your uncle Jack broke his arm out there,\u201d Pru went on. \u201cAnd what you were going to do with those boys, I have no idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t gonna have sex!\u201d Abby wailed. \u201cIf they\u2019d even tried anything, I would\u2019ve bitten everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk. I can\u2019t believe my little girl is drunk,\u201d Pru said, her voice baffled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a sex addict,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cUnderage drinking is against the law,\u201d Levi said, his voice mild. \u201cWhat you were doing was stupid, Abby. Your mother is right. Two boys, one girl, stupid. And that gorge is dangerous. A hiker broke his neck out there last year, and it took us four hours just to get him out. He\u2019s paralyzed for life.\u201d</p><p>Abby\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cEveryone hates me,\u201d she said, then promptly puked into the garbage can, making Everett gag in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cLevi, can I take her home?\u201d Prudence asked, and Faith\u2019s heart gave a tug. Poor Pru looked years older.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Levi said. \u201cI\u2019ll come by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby,\u201d Pru said, holding Abby\u2019s hair away from her face. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home. We\u2019ll deal with this when you\u2019re sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re so perfect,\u201d Abby sobbed. \u201cAuntie, didn\u2019t you ever do anything stupid when you were my age?\u201d</p><p>Why yes, honey, as a matter of fact. Faith cleared her throat and didn\u2019t look at Levi. Her face felt hot. \u201cWell, sure. But there\u2019s stupid, and then there\u2019s life-threatening. Let\u2019s go home and clean you up, and you can enjoy your very first hangover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I gonna be arrested or something?\u201d Abby asked, looking at Levi.</p><p>\u201cGo home and sleep it off, Abby,\u201d he said. \u201cAll three of you kids will have to do some community service. But don\u2019t you ever do something like this again, you got it? Josh Deiner is not someone you want to hang out with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she muttered, tears dripping down her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you home. Your father\u2019s going to have a fit, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This brought on more sloppy crying. Faith sighed and grabbed Abby\u2019s backpack.</p><p>\u201cIt was so great seeing you,\u201d Everett whispered, beaming. \u201cWant to have a drink sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, sure, to catch up, but not romantically, okay? Because I babysat you.\u201d Faith smiled firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I used to think about you when I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Everett.\u201d Levi\u2019s voice was calm.</p><p>\u201cRight, right! Sorry, sir!\u201d Ev looked at Faith again. \u201cYou look great.\u201d He blushed, and she couldn\u2019t help a smile.</p><p>\u201cFaith.\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s voice made her jump.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive her a talk. She obviously worships you.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in a long time, it seemed like Levi was looking at her with something other than contempt. And you know...a man in uniform...with those big, brawny arms... Her knees felt abruptly weak. \u201cOkay. Thank you, Levi.\u201d</p><p>And she forgot, at least for a little while, that Levi was the one who ruined her wedding and outed the man she loved.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>NATURE HAD PULLED OUT all the stops the morning of Faith and Jeremy\u2019s wedding. The sun shone over the lake, burnishing it a deep, aching blue, and it seemed that every flower and tree was at its most beautiful as the limo drove from the Hill down to the village square. Faith wore a Cinderella dress, the tight, beaded bodice catching the light and throwing rainbows through the car, the tulle skirt so puffy that it almost obscured Abby, who was chattering with excitement. Prudence looked strange and beautiful out of work clothes, her eyes crinkling in a smile. Both her sisters wore pink, Faith\u2019s favorite color, and Colleen, as maid of honor, had a dress slightly deeper in shade. Faith hadn\u2019t wanted to choose between her sisters, so Colleen had gotten the nod.</p><p>\u201cYou girls,\u201d John Holland said, his eyes damp. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Faith realized she was clenching her bouquet. She wasn\u2019t nervous. Well, a little. But not about marrying Jeremy, of course not. No, it was probably just stage fright. There\u2019d be three hundred people at the church, after all. So yes, it was probably just that. Once she saw Jeremy, those nerves would disappear.</p><p>He\u2019d called her last night to tell her Levi had been delayed in Atlanta and would have to meet them at the church, not to worry, he\u2019d be there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Faith had said. The truth was, she wouldn\u2019t have minded if Levi got stuck and missed the entire wedding; she hadn\u2019t seen him since high school, and she wasn\u2019t really looking forward to that bored, condescending air he always had around her. Then again, surely all that childish stuff was done. She was about to become his best friend\u2019s wife, after all. Besides, no negative thoughts would be allowed on the night before her wedding. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great to see him,\u201d she added. Points for positive attitude.</p><p>Jeremy hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>\u201cHoney? You still there?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you that being your husband is everything I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u201d Jeremy said, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jeremy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what she should be thinking of on this beautiful June morning. Not the tremor in her stomach. Maybe she was just missing her mom, because what girl didn\u2019t want her mother on her wedding day, to exclaim and shed a few tears...and, if the case called for it, to reassure.</p> <p>From a place dark and deep inside her, something roared.</p><p>Nope. No. Uh-uh. It was just stage fright. She was, by far, the luckiest woman in the world. Being your husband is everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. Come on! Those were words she could take to the bank! Nothing could be wrong when a man said words like that. This was marital gold.</p><p>The limo pulled up in front of Trinity Lutheran, the stone church where the Hollands had gone for generations, and the tourists who were wandering on the green stopped to look as the wedding party got out. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful!\u201d one woman called. The photographer snapped her picture as she bent to kiss Abby\u2019s cheek, a picture that would go on to win a prize in a national photography contest later that year.</p><p>Then, holding on to her father\u2019s arm, Colleen fluffing her dress, Faith went into the church to marry the man she\u2019d loved since the first day she\u2019d met him, when, like the hero in a movie, he\u2019d carried her unconscious form in his strong arms. Okay, that sounded creepy, but it hadn\u2019t been. It had been wonderful, or so she was told.</p><p>There he was, standing on the altar, so handsome in his tux, tall and manly. He was smiling at someone, maybe one of his patients, because half the town had flocked to him, never mind that he was barely done with his residency. Levi had made it, she noted; he looked older in his dress uniform. He was shorter than Jeremy, his hair sticking up a little in front. His face was somber; he must\u2019ve been tired from all his traveling. Faith couldn\u2019t help thinking it\u2019d be nice if he could fake a smile. It was her wedding day, after all, and the man looked as if he was at a funeral.</p><p>Pachelbel\u2019s Canon in D began, and Pru started down the aisle. Honor turned, and, so uncharacteristically, hugged Faith. \u201cLove you,\u201d she whispered, then started down herself, followed by Colleen and then Abby.</p><p>Pachelbel stopped, then, and the wedding march began.</p><p>Faith\u2019s heart rate tripled. She tried to keep her eyes on Jeremy, felt her face stretching in a smile, but damned if she didn\u2019t feel...wrong.</p><p>Just nervous, her brain lied.</p><p>It seemed like the entire town was there, looking at her: Dr. Buckthal, her neurologist, and his wife. Theresa DeFilio, one of the truly nice girls from high school, a baby on her shoulder, handsome husband at her side. Jessica Dunn, yawning. Laura Boothby who\u2019d done such an amazing job with the flowers. Ted and Elaine, smiling brightly. Connor O\u2019Rourke. Mrs. Johnson and Jack in the front row. So many people. Way too many.</p><p>When Reverend White asked who gave this woman in marriage, Dad answered, \u201cHer mother and I,\u201d and the congregation sighed with the bittersweet beauty of his words. Daddy kissed her cheek, tears in his eyes, and shook Jeremy\u2019s hand, leaning in to give him a one-armed hug. \u201cTake care of my baby,\u201d he said, then went to his seat.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s hands were clammy. \u201cYou look so beautiful,\u201d he whispered, his lips pulling back in something like a smile. His gaze bounced from her to somewhere over her head.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t nervous. He was terrified.</p><p>A floating feeling enveloped Faith, almost like the auras that preceded her seizures, but different, too. Faith could hear her own breathing, rather than the words of the minister, the readings\u2014one by Jack, one by Jeremy\u2019s cousin Anne. The wedding seemed to slow into endlessness. It hadn\u2019t seemed so long at the rehearsal. Honestly, it was the longest wedding in history! Why hadn\u2019t they gotten to the vows yet? She couldn\u2019t look at Jeremy and focused on the readers instead, on Reverend White, on her bouquet.</p><p>Maybe it was the epilepsy. Faith tried to wrestle her faulty brain into order, to press each detail into her memory. Enjoy the day, that\u2019s what everyone told her, but, hell, it seemed like she might be on the verge of that dark, epileptic hole. She\u2019d been religious about taking her meds. Hadn\u2019t had a seizure in three years. Please, not that, not now.</p><p>The seizure didn\u2019t come, but the sense of doom pressed in on her like hot lead.</p><p>Now the minister was talking about marriage and the seriousness of two people pledging their lives together. Faith couldn\u2019t concentrate. She just wanted to say her vows and be Jeremy\u2019s wife. She wanted to promise to love him all the days of her life, because she would. He was the One. Just a few more minutes, and it would be official, and please, get this over with, was this a normal way to be feeling, couldn\u2019t they just fast forward to the part where people were throwing birdseed?</p><p>Reverend White finally stopped blathering. He looked out over the congregation, and Faith looked, too, all those smiling faces, her dad looking so proud, her grandparents beaming. Almost there. Almost there. She looked back at Jeremy. His face was oily with sweat, his hands damp and hot, clenching hers.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin the vows,\u201d the reverend said, \u201cdoes anyone know of a reason these two should not be wed? If so, speak now, or forever hold your peace.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was now beating so hard she could feel the separate chambers rolling and squeezing.</p><p>No one said anything.</p><p>The reverend smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. In that case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy.\u201d The voice was so low, it might not have actually been spoken. But, no, Jeremy flinched.</p><p>It was Levi. \u201cJeremy. Come on.\u201d</p><p>What? Why was he talking? He looked so damn solemn in that uniform. So...authoritative. Why did he have to come? Why couldn\u2019t his plane have been late?</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s breathing was jagged. The sheen of sweat grew, droplets beading on his forehead. He licked his lips and swallowed, then opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d Jeremy said, squeezing her hands so hard he was crushing them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She forced herself to smile. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Pain ripped through his eyes, eyes that had only ever before smiled at her. \u201cHoney, I...I have to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>A murmur went up from the congregation, and from the corner of her eye, Faith could see her father\u2019s mouth opening in shock, Elaine\u2014Elaine, who loved Faith like a daughter\u2014gripping Ted\u2019s arm.</p><p>Faith\u2019s legs were shaking, her dress quivering with the movement. \u201cJeremy, let\u2019s just finish this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Reverend White asked, his bushy eyebrows coming together.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Faith answered, her voice cracking. Oh, Lord, she was going to faint. \u201cThere\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy swallowed again, his eyes filled with tears. \u201cFaith,\u201d he said again, and her knees did buckle then.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Levi said, taking Faith by the arm. \u201cDownstairs, you two.\u201d He towed her off the altar, the train of her dress tugging with its weight. Jeremy followed.</p><p>There was a staircase right by the altar. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Pru asked, and then the voices of the guests rumbled and echoed in the church. Down the stairs they went, Levi\u2019s hand inescapable. He was a bully. He was ruining everything.</p><p>\u201cJeremy,\u201d she squeaked, looking back. Her fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>Levi pushed through the door at the bottom of the stairs. The church basement was dim and smelled like chalk. Four or five metal folding chairs sat huddled together. Bible Study or AA or something. Levi let go of her arm and then guided Jeremy a few paces away, leaving her standing alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d It was her father, thank God, and Colleen and her sisters and Jack, and Jeremy\u2019s parents, too. Her father came to her side and put his arm around her, and she sagged against his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining their wedding, Levi!\u201d</p><p>Yes! He was supposed to be the best man, not the ruiner of weddings. How dare he? You know, she had always wished Jeremy had had a different friend. She\u2019d never liked Levi Cooper. He was too...secretive. And confident. And he\u2019d never liked her, especially after that one stupid kiss.</p><p>\u201cHang on a sec,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>He and Jeremy were talking, Jeremy\u2019s voice panicky, Levi\u2019s lower, calmer. Then Jeremy nodded; Levi gave his shoulder a squeeze, nodded, then turned to the group.</p><p>\u201cJeremy and Faith need a little time alone,\u201d he said. His eyes stopped\u2014not on Faith, but on Mr. and Mrs. Lyon.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Elaine said, her voice very, very soft. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d Dad said. \u201cDo you want us to stay?\u201d</p><p>She looked at Jeremy, who loved her. Who\u2019d called her last night to say everything he ever wanted was to be her husband. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s fine, Daddy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right on the other side of that door,\u201d he said. \u201cCall if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Everyone left, slowly, uncertainly, glancing back at Faith. She sank into a metal chair, Jeremy sitting across from her. And Levi, damn him, walked a few feet away and stood with his hands behind his back, staring at the floor, looking like a stone wall.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have to stay?\u201d Faith whispered.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019d like him to,\u201d Jeremy whispered back. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>She looked into his eyes, which were so dark they were almost black, and which had always seemed so happy\u2014with her, with life. Smiling seemed to be his natural expression, and everyone commented on it, that big, ready grin of his.</p><p>No smiling now.</p><p>She sensed the world was about to end.</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he said, his voice soft and broken, \u201cI want you to know that I do love you, so much.\u201d He took a breath and looked at the floor. \u201cBut I can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, her voice squeaking. \u201cAre you sick? I don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d stay with you, that\u2019s the whole point, in sickness and in\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He looked back up, his gaze slamming into hers. \u201cI\u2019m g*y.\u201d</p><p>The two words seemed to float around her for a few seconds, meaningless, before they hooked into her brain. She sucked in a quick breath and jerked back, and started to speak. It took a few tries; her mouth was making odd little noises, her lips trying and failing to form words. Finally, she stopped, gave her head a quick shake, and tried again.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re not g*y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He looked...old.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry! You don\u2019t! Because you\u2019re not. You aren\u2019t. You can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, looking at the floor, folding his hands together loosely, his beautiful doctor hands. There should\u2019ve been a wedding ring on the fourth finger of his left hand by now. There would\u2019ve been if Levi had kept his mouth shut.</p> <p>Jeremy took a deep breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t...acknowledge it, and I really thought I could... I mean, for a long time, I honestly didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t. I just thought those feelings would go away, and with you, it was like proof that I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! Shut it, Jeremy. My God.\u201d Okay, she was hyperventilating a little. \u201cYou are not g*y.\u201d She took a steadying breath. \u201cYou have the worst taste in clothes I\u2019ve ever seen in a man. I had to teach you how to dress. Remember those mom jeans you thought looked good on you? They were horrible! You have no sense of style whatsoever. If it weren\u2019t for me and Banana Republic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Plus, you\u2019re a terrible dancer! I mean, we had to take six lessons before you figured out the box step, Jeremy! And\u2014and\u2014and you played football! You were really good at it, too. You played football, Jeremy! You were the quarterback!\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on her knees, on her beautiful dress, on all that poufy fabric, and his happy, beautiful face was so old and tragic now, oh, God. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cAnd I thought, when I met you, that I\u2019d sort of click into place. I really did love you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do love me! Don\u2019t put that in the past tense!\u201d she cried, her voice shrill. \u201cYou said you wanted to be my husband! You said so on the phone last night, Jeremy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>Faith whirled around. \u201cShut up, Levi!\u201d she barked. \u201cIf you have to be here, at least shut up!\u201d He looked back down at the floor and obeyed.</p> <p>Faith took a breath, then another, and looked into Jeremy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know you love me,\u201d she went on more steadily. \u201cI know that more than I know anything. How can you be saying all this?\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cDid Levi make a pass at you or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! God, no,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cLevi has nothing to do with this. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve ever been with, Faith. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Then you\u2019re not g*y. You\u2019re just not. We\u2019ve been sleeping together since sophomore year of college!\u201d</p><p>A horrible thought occurred to her. That maybe dating a guy who said he loved you but waited two years to get into your pants...oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cFaith, when we\u2019re...together,\u201d Jeremy said, very, very quietly, \u201cI have to...um...\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the door opened and Jeremy\u2019s great-aunt Peg came in. \u201cI just have to use the ladies\u2019 room,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t listen to a word. Faith, darling, you look so beautiful. And, Levi, is it? Oh, I love a man in uniform! Thank you for your service, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Levi said. \u201cThanks for your support.\u201d</p><p>Good God. This was just bizarre enough to be a nightmare. You know what? It might be. She prayed it was. The great-aunt in the loo, Jeremy being g*y...come on! It had to be a dream. Please, God. Let me wake up in my bed and have this be a dream, and Jeremy and I will still get married. I can tell him about this dream, and we\u2019ll laugh and laugh about it. Please.</p><p>The details, though. The smell of chalk, the cold chairs. The gleam on Levi\u2019s shoes, his crew cut.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s bowed head.</p><p>Finally, Great-Aunt Peg emerged. \u201cSee you upstairs!\u201d she said, waving merrily.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d Faith said. Her voice was sharper now, harder. \u201cWhen we\u2019re together, you have to what, Jeremy?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI have to think of...other things. Even though I think you\u2019re beautiful and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d she said. \u201cI think I deserve to know what things you had to picture!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith, this probably isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Levi began.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Levi! What things, Jeremy?\u201d</p><p>He looked wretched. Utterly miserable. \u201cI have to picture Justin Timberlake.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Okay, that was a showstopper. The case for Jeremy\u2019s heterosexuality took a serious hit with that one. \u201cJustin Timberlake?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Rock Your Body.\u2019 The video.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was open, she realized. She closed it. The JT song echoed in her head, taunting. Those damn white hoodies everyone wore.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Thoughts bounced and zinged through her head, not quite registering. Her makeup must be ruined from crying. The dress was itchy. They wouldn\u2019t have their first dance together. They weren\u2019t getting married.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really g*y?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He looked up and nodded, his eyes were full of tears, too, and it was idiotic, but she wanted to comfort him. \u201cI thought that I...that I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted a wife\u2014you\u2014I wanted kids, I wanted a life like my parents have, but...I...yes. I am.\u201d</p><p>He covered his eyes with one hand and bowed his head.</p><p>From the first time she\u2019d laid eyes on him, Faith had known he was special and gentle and wonderful. From that first second on, she\u2019d loved him. He had never, ever let her down, never found her lacking, never spoke to her in anger or looked at her in contempt.</p><p>Jeremy Lyon was, above all things, a good, good man.</p><p>Without quite intending to, she reached out and stroked his smooth black hair, cut short for this day.</p><p>He looked up, his misery so obvious that it wrenched her heart, the heart he was breaking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, Faith.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close, so his head was touching hers, and they sat there another moment or two\u2014or an hour, the uneven sound of Jeremy\u2019s breathing as he cried, the soft pat of tears as they fell from Faith\u2019s eyes to her dress. The reality of the future pressed down on Faith, the weight almost bearable at first. Her beautiful wedding wasn\u2019t going to happen. No honeymoon in Napa, lounging around in bed with this beautiful man. Oh, God, the weight was pressing on her chest harder now. No black-haired children running through the fields of Blue Heron...no life with Jeremy, the only one who\u2019d ever seen in her something that was special and rare and precious.</p><p>Jeremy had been proof that she was forgiven. But now there was nothing. There\u2019d be nothing now.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should call off the wedding, huh?\u201d she said, and he gave a half laugh, half sob, then stood up and pulled her against him, pressing her face against his hard, muscled shoulder, and she hugged him as hard as she could, her throat aching with the sobs she wouldn\u2019t let out, because it would break Jeremy to hear that, and she loved him too much to do that. He was the love of her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave town,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cI\u2014I can move. I won\u2019t stay here, Faith. I won\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>But he was the town doctor. Elaine and Ted had loaned him the money to buy Dr. Wilkinson\u2019s practice. She\u2019d helped him redecorate the waiting rooms, bought him the iconic Norman Rockwell prints, filled out the online forms so he\u2019d have up-to-date magazines. Six months in business, and he was already thinking about hiring another nurse, because that\u2019s how popular he was.</p><p>Already her head was shaking. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not going anywhere. Don\u2019t do anything. Just...you know what? Let\u2019s not do anything yet, okay?\u201d Her breath was starting to hitch. \u201cLet\u2019s...we\u2019ll just...talk later.\u201d Panic lapped at her feet, her knees, threatening to pull her under. She was going to lose it if she had to stay here another second. \u201cThis is all going to be fine, but I\u2014I think I should get going,\u201d she managed, looking at his chest. She risked one more glance at his face, and, oh, God, it really did feel like her heart was being ripped apart.</p><p>\u201cFaith, I wish things were different,\u201d Jeremy whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go now,\u201d she said. She took a breath and bit her lip hard, and her voice came out in a whisper. \u201cBye.\u201d There was a world of heartbreak in that one small word.</p><p>Into the bright sunshine that was an affront now, then into the dark cave of the limo. Some kind blankness was settling around her, thank you, God, and then Daddy was there, holding her against him, and her sisters, and Mrs. Johnson, who gripped her hand and said nothing. Jack was taking care of the guests, someone said, and Jeremy was talking to his parents.</p><p>She still had her bouquet.</p><p>No one said anything as they drove home. Blue, the half-grown Golden retriever she\u2019d adopted from the rescue league a few months ago (because she was going to be married and therefore could have her own dog), greeted her joyfully, jumping up on her dress, and who cared now? Up the stairs\u2014the photographer had taken her picture here just about an hour ago, back in the olden days.</p><p>Her bridesmaids\u2014former bridesmaids\u2014were close on her tail.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Honor said once they were in Faith\u2019s room. \u201cLet me help you get undressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014I think I\u2019d like to be alone,\u201d Faith said. Wow. Her voice sounded so strange.</p><p>The three of them swapped a glance. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna kill yourself or anything, right?\u201d Pru asked.</p><p>\u201cGood God, no. Just...just give me a little while.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, they obeyed, closing the door quietly behind them. Faith sank onto her bed, the tulle skirt puffing around her like dandelion fluff. There was her big red suitcase, all packed for the honeymoon, the tickets to San Francisco peeking out of the side pocket.</p><p>Hello Kitty ticked away the minutes from the bureau. She could hear the rumble of her father\u2019s voice through the open window as he talked to someone. Mrs. Johnson was banging around in the kitchen\u2014distress cooking, they called it when she was upset. From down the hall came the sound of Abby\u2019s sobs\u2014poor kid. Jeremy wouldn\u2019t be her uncle, though she\u2019d been calling him that for months now.

Her mascara was smudged under her reddened eyes, and her lipstick was gone. Face utterly white. But her hair had come out really great.</p><p>You know what else? She\u2019d dieted for two months to get to this weight, even though Jeremy assured her he loved her just the way she was. Jeremy, who was g*y. Gay men liked curvy women. There you go. Shoulda known.</p><p>This morning, Faith had been the luckiest girl in New York State, if not the universe. Everyone thought that, especially her. Now, at 12:44, she was the woman who didn\u2019t know her fianc\u00e9 was g*y.</p><p>How could she not have known? They slept together. A lot! Okay, well, maybe not a lot, not as much as she would\u2019ve liked or as much as her friends seemed to sleep with their boyfriends, but they\u2019d been in college, hello? In separate states! And then in grad school, also in separate states! And then, this past year...well, still not so much.</p> <p>Justin Timberlake.</p><p>Holy futtocks.</p><p>All this time, she thought they were happy. All this time, Jeremy, her wonderful, sweet, thoughtful Jeremy, had carried this secret alone.</p><p>Well. Levi knew. She guessed he\u2019d told Levi.</p><p>She stood up and started to take off her wedding dress. It was impossible. All those damn little covered buttons and loops...Jeremy was supposed to have unbuttoned them, slowly, lovingly, and you know, yeah, she\u2019d thought that once they were married and getting pregnant would be a joy and not an oops, their sex life would take off. It had always been fine. It\u2019d been fine! But marriage, she\u2019d just known, would only improve it.</p> <p>Here she\u2019d been lying na**d with Jeremy Lyon, totally in love, believing him when he said she was beautiful and perfect, when he\u2019d been thinking of Justin Timberlake dancing around in a hoodie. And while that was an entirely appealing image, the man she loved shouldn\u2019t have been cramming it into his head to block out her. You know what? Justin Timberlake wasn\u2019t even that good. Totally average. How dare he occupy Jeremy\u2019s mind during sex?</p><p>Faith\u2019s phone buzzed. Goggy, said the screen, featuring a photo of her scowling grandmother. Faith let it go to voice mail. A minute later, the phone chirped with a text. She looked. Pick up the damn phone. A second later, Goggy\u2019s face scowled at her again.</p><p>It\u2019d be easier to talk to her grandmother than dodge the calls. Goggy was a slab of granite when she wanted to be. \u201cHi,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cGo on your honeymoon,\u201d Goggy said firmly. \u201cGet out of here for a while.\u201d</p><p>Faith was silent. At the moment, she couldn\u2019t imagine standing up, let alone getting on an airplane and flying across the country.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Faith,\u201d Goggy said, her voice more gentle. \u201cSpend a little time away from home, see the world.\u201d</p> <p>The words were horribly familiar, cutting right into the middle of Faith\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cYou have the tickets, right? Use them. Go to San Francisco, honey, and just be away from all of this.\u201d</p><p>If that wasn\u2019t a rope, Faith didn\u2019t know what was. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d Goggy sounded triumphant, but she was the type who never quite managed to hit forty mph on the highway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You stay here. I\u2019ll get someone else. And, Goggy...\u201d Faith\u2019s voice broke. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tonight, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Goggy was right. She couldn\u2019t stay here. Jeremy couldn\u2019t leave, and she couldn\u2019t stay. Jeremy was her next-door neighbor, albeit a mile down the road. She\u2019d see him everywhere.</p><p>And at this moment, that thought was unbearable.</p> <p>Add to that, Manningsport had 715 people in it. Everyone now knew that Faith Holland was too stupid to realize her fianc\u00e9 was g*y. Nope, I didn\u2019t suspect, they\u2019d say. Not the way that kid threw the ball...but I didn\u2019t sleep with him, either! Heh heh heh!</p><p>Her zombielike state shattered abruptly. She grabbed her suitcase and yanked open the door, flew down the stairs, her dress rustling against the family photos, knocking them askew.</p><p>Justin Timberlake. She hated Justin Timberlake.</p><p>Just as she got to the bottom, a quiet knock came at the front door. She jerked it open, out of breath.</p><p>Ah. The other man she hated. Levi Cooper, Wedding Destroyer. \u201cYou,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He was still in his dress uniform, his chest full of ribbons and medals. Mr. Hero. \u201cJeremy sent me to check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to the airport,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>His eyebrows rose, crinkling his forehead a little. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what I say, Levi,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019re probably not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush. Just take me there.\u201d</p><p>Her father came up on the porch. \u201cFaith, sweetpea, I was just coming to check on you. How are you, honey? This is such a shock, I don\u2019t know what to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m going to San Francisco. Okay? I\u2019ll call you when I land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a second, sweetie, slow down,\u201d he said, glancing at Levi. Why? Why glance at the guy who ruined her wedding and kept Jeremy\u2019s secret, huh? \u201cI think you should stay here, baby, with your family. This is a tough, tough day, but we\u2019ll get you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to San Francisco. I have tickets,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cFaith\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I\u2014I have to get out of here, Dad,\u201d she stammered, the hyperventilating starting up again. \u201cI\u2019ll just go to San Fran. Remember Liza? My friend from college? She lives there, so I won\u2019t be alone. I\u2019ll call her. She\u2019s really fun. Okay? Call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Faith, this doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I need to get out of here. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Settle down. Just...if you want to go, give me a minute, and I\u2019ll pack some things and go with you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going alone. Right now. I have to get out of here or I\u2019m going to lose my shit, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Her father looked startled. That\u2019s right, Daddy, she thought irrationally. Don\u2019t mess with me right now.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll drive you. Don\u2019t be silly, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019ll take me. Won\u2019t you?\u201d She narrowed her eyes at Levi, wishing looks really could kill.</p><p>Levi cleared his throat. \u201cIs that all right, Mr. Holland?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask him,\u201d Faith snapped. \u201cI\u2019m giving you an order, soldier. Get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cFaith, it\u2019s not his fault,\u201d her father said. She turned her eyes on him, and he actually held his hands up in defense. \u201cSweetie, I really think you need to take a few days at least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I land.\u201d She kissed her father\u2019s cheek, and the horrible weight crushed down again. \u201cI love you, Daddy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about all this. I\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d The tears threatened again. No, no. Not now. Bottle and cork. She could fall apart later.</p><p>Then she tromped down the porch, stepping on the hem of her dress and tearing it. So what? She should burn the damn thing, right along with her own white hoodie (which had been a gift from Jeremy, ack!).</p><p>There was Levi\u2019s car, a cheap rental with Michigan plates. She got in, stuffed the stupid dress down and gave Blue a few pats on the head as he tried to climb in with her. She wished she could take him. Hang on. She could take him. Dr. Buckthal had told her that some dogs could sense an oncoming seizure, and she\u2019d had Blue registered as a service dog, more because she wanted to be able to take him with her wherever she went than because she thought she might need him. But he was registered all the same.</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d she said and went inside the house. Her sisters were there, Coll and Mrs. J., too, murmuring, asking, talking, but it was all white noise. She rummaged in the file drawer where she kept Blue\u2019s records, and voila. Grabbed the paper, turned to the rest of them. Everyone was talking, offering advice, pats, trying to hug her, but they were like birds, fluttering around her head, and she waved them off.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, her voice wobbling. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go to California for a few days. Maybe take that honeymoon solo, I don\u2019t know. But I love you all, and I\u2019m so sorry about this...fiasco. I\u2019ll call you, but right now, I have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me drive you, Faithie,\u201d her brother said, his voice so kind that her eyes swam again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Pru offered.</p><p>\u201cNope. All set. Thanks, though.\u201d She grabbed Blue\u2019s leash, figured he could eat hamburgers until she bought him dog food, then went back out to the car, where Levi was waiting. Blue leaped in the back, smiling and wagging, and thank God the dog couldn\u2019t speak, because honestly, if someone else said something kind or nice to her, she was going to lose it.</p><p>Levi Cooper would not be nice to her. She could take that to the bank.</p><p>The rat bastard got in, started the car and gave her father a wave. She waved, too, her head fizzy with adrenaline.</p><p>She\u2019d fly to San Francisco, stay at the Mark, where she and Jeremy had been booked for four nights, their wedding gift from his parents. Liza could come, and they\u2019d drink the honeymoon champagne, and, hell, maybe they\u2019d take that Napa wine country tour, too.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at Levi, and he didn\u2019t talk. Too bad he hadn\u2019t been stricken mute on the altar.</p><p>She stared out the window, cushioned in a bitter fog. Occasionally, people would see that she was wearing a big white dress or that Levi was in his dress blues, and they\u2019d beep their horns and wave. Her face felt carved out of stone.</p><p>After an eternity or so, they got to the swooping Buffalo-Niagara Airport, so oddly beautiful, and went in. People congratulated them. She didn\u2019t answer. For the first time since her mother died, she didn\u2019t try to be nice to anyone. Just showed her ID and her ticket and passed through the gate, getting some odd looks from the screeners. Guess they hadn\u2019t seen a jilted bride yet. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 turned out to be g*y,\u201d she said to one. Blue woofed and wagged his tail.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He did, though,\u201d she said, jerking her chin at Levi. Then she put on her ridiculously pretty shoes, grabbed her carry-on\u2014damn, it was heavy\u2014and went to the waiting area at her gate, which was only about ten yards away, and sat down. Looked at the clock. Seven hours till her flight. Maybe she\u2019d have a seizure to pass the time. Stress brought them on sometimes. It\u2019d be better than sitting here, having to think about Jeremy. Just the thought of his name caused a sob to heave in her chest. Blue flopped down on the floor, wagging his tail as a toddler passed him.</p><p>Levi was talking to someone. You\u2019re not a ticket-holder, ass**le, she thought. So, there. But, no. He was telling the screener all sorts of things, scraps of his words floating to her\u2014wedding fell through, her friend, don\u2019t want her waiting alone.</p><p>Her friend. What a crock that was. But Mr. Hero got through; who could turn down a guy in uniform, home on leave from the war on terror? He came toward her now, his eyes resigned, mouth in a straight line.</p><p>Before he got to her, Faith wrapped Blue\u2019s leash around the chair leg and got up and went to the ladies\u2019 room, dragging her suitcase with her. The handicapped stall was the only one big enough with this ridiculous dress. She reached back and yanked at the buttons, yanked harder, tearing a few loops, then wriggled free, hopping, banging her shoulder against the wall. Out of the white merry widow and stockings, out of the beautiful white shoes that peeped so endearingly from under her skirt. She\u2019d packed all sorts of cute underwear, adorable bra and panty sets, silky short nighties. Pretty little outfits for daytime, lovely dresses for those romantic dinners she and Jeremy wouldn\u2019t be having. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She changed into some yoga pants, a tank top and sneakers\u2014she\u2019d been planning to exercise on her honeymoon to keep the extra pounds off, not be one of those wives who immediately began letting herself go the second the wedding was over. Oh, no. Not her.</p><p>Then she wadded up her dress and banged out of the stall. Paused, debating whether or not to stuff it into the trash. What does one do with a wedding dress when one has been jilted? Yes, Martha Stewart or Miss Manners or Amy Dixon, what does one do? One certainly doesn\u2019t want to preserve it for one\u2019s daughter, not when one won\u2019t be having a daughter any time soon, since one\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is g*y.</p><p>She remembered calling Jeremy after she\u2019d bought the dress. Daddy had taken all of them to Corning, to a beautiful bridal shop, and the very first dress she\u2019d tried on had brought tears to his eyes. She\u2019d called Jeremy to tell him mission accomplished, and he\u2019d said, his voice warm and loving, that he knew she\u2019d be the most beautiful bride ever, because she had the most beautiful heart. (Gah! How could she have thought he was straight?) Then she\u2019d talked to his mom, to tell her all the details, and Elaine had been so touched that she\u2019d cried.</p><p>Oh, lordy. There were those strange choking noises again.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t throw the dress away. She couldn\u2019t. Instead, she walked out of the bathroom, the dress under her arm, dragging the suitcase behind her. Levi was watching the door, talking on the phone, to Jeremy, no doubt. Because those two had no secrets. He hung up as she approached.</p><p>\u201cDo something with this,\u201d she said to Levi, shoving her dress against his chest and continuing on to a row of hard plastic chairs where her dog waited.</p><p>In six hours and forty-three minutes, she\u2019d be out of New York.</p><p>Levi sat next to her, stowing her dress under his chair. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. How long have you known?\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him.</p> <p>Levi didn\u2019t answer for a minute or two. Finally, she kicked his foot and glared at him. He looked bored. How dare he look bored? The bastard!</p><p>\u201cI guess I always knew.\u201d Blue rolled onto his back, letting them know he was available for tummy-scratching any time.</p><p>\u201cReally. You knew from the minute you met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she demanded, looking at his face. \u201cDid he try to kiss you, something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you just knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never said anything?\u201d</p><p>Levi shrugged. \u201cI asked him about it once. He said he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, what about me, Levi? Did you ever think to say something to me? Huh?\u201d</p><p>He deigned to look at her, his green eyes expressionless. \u201cPeople believe what they want to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what?\u201d she said, her voice rising. \u201cYou should\u2019ve tried. I love Jeremy! I love him! I\u2019m so in love with him, it kills me! Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d Blue barked, backing her up. Blue loved Jeremy, too. Great. Another victim in the war.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Levi said. \u201cMaybe you could quiet it down a little, though, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Am I embarrassing you? Am I making a scene? Don\u2019t you know what it feels like to have your heart ripped open? Do you have any idea? My whole life is gone! You took that away! You just had to say something, didn\u2019t you? You had to open your mouth!\u201d</p><p>Then she was crying, so hard she was choking, and she jammed her hands into her hair and bent over, the sounds coming out of her alien and horrifying. How would she get over Jeremy? What kind of a life was she going to have without him? Already she missed him so much it was as if someone had shoved a hot poker through her heart. Blue nudged against her, and she buried her head against her dog\u2019s neck.</p><p>She felt Levi\u2019s arm around her shoulders and shrugged him off. Like she\u2019d allow him to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she managed to say, the words strangled on her sobs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, win some, lose some,\u201d he muttered, folding his arms and sighing.</p><p>\u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Jeremy I\u2019d stay.\u201d</p><p>And, of course, Jeremy wouldn\u2019t want her here alone. Because even now, he was trying to take care of her. Even now, Jeremy still loved her. And was g*y.</p><p>The crying was endless, as if she was being punched in the chest with each breath, tears pouring out of her eyes, which Blue licked away, whining. People probably thought she was mentally unstable; she sure as hell felt that way. Her rational thoughts were just distant pings; it seemed like she was being sucked under by waves of grief and shock, barely able to breathe.</p><p>Levi got up\u2014probably to ask someone for a tranquilizer\u2014and returned with a roll of paper towels. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any tissues,\u201d he said, taking his seat once more. Blue had given up and was sleeping, his head on her foot. She grabbed the roll and blew her nose, then took a few more and mopped at her face. The tears kept falling.</p><p>And now Levi was looking at her with those eyes of his that always seemed to be so bored with her. \u201cLook, Faith, I know this is hard for you. But would you rather be married to a g*y man?\u201d he asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cYes! In the case of Jeremy, yes! You didn\u2019t do me any favors, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I wasn\u2019t thinking of you,\u201d he said, glancing out the window.</p><p>\u201cNo. You were being the world\u2019s best friend, outing Jeremy on the altar during our wedding. Well done, Levi. Really. Maybe you\u2019ll get another medal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he said, \u201clet me ask you a question. What were you thinking during the wedding? Because your face was as white as your dress, and Jeremy was sweating blood. It was a disaster waiting to happen. And if it did, he never would\u2019ve left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would\u2019ve made it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You both would\u2019ve been trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can shut up now.\u201d Her jaw ached from clenching.</p><p>\u201cSomeday, you\u2019ll be glad you didn\u2019t marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about kicking you in the nuts, Levi. Shut. Up.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he did. Her eyes stung from tears, and more tears kept flowing. The paper towel she\u2019d used to wipe her face was smeared with makeup.</p><p>Soon, she\u2019d be away. She\u2019d be away from horrible Levi, away from the town where everyone was talking about her, away from Jeremy and his beautiful eyes and happy face.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure when she fell asleep, was only aware that her eyes were burning, her head heavy. At some point, she slid down in the chair, and there was something under her cheek. A hand on her shoulder.</p><p>She woke groggily. Someone was shaking her gently. \u201cTime to go, Faith,\u201d a voice said.</p><p>Levi. Right. Her head was in his lap. She sat up, wincing. Felt as if she\u2019d been beaten with a golf club. Blue was on his feet, tail wagging. \u201cI took him out about an hour ago,\u201d Levi added.</p><p>\u201cPassengers in first class may begin boarding,\u201d the airline person was saying. \u201cThis is American Airlines flight 1523, direct to San Francisco. First-class passengers, please begin boarding.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. She stood up, adjusted her shirt and ran a hand over her head. She\u2019d forgotten to take her hair down; it was still in the complicated and beautiful twist from this morning.</p><p>Levi stood as well, and she managed to look as far as his chin. \u201cTell him I\u2019m doing all right, okay?\u201d she said, then tightened her grip on the dog\u2019s leash.</p><p>\u201cLie, you mean?\u201d he said, with a small flash of a grin.</p><p>She didn\u2019t return it. \u201cYeah.\u201d She took the handle of her suitcase and started over to the gate.</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him.</p><p>His brows were drawn, his face serious. \u201cI\u2019m sorry things didn\u2019t work out the way you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Said the man who ruined her wedding. \u201cTake care of yourself, Levi,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cDon\u2019t get hurt over there.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she and her dog boarded the plane.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>FAITH STOPPED OUTSIDE of Hugo\u2019s and did a quick pass of her hair, licked her dry lips and tried to ignore the stomach cramps that had been knifing through her since she woke up at four this morning.</p><p>There he was. She could see him through the restaurant\u2019s glass door, standing by the ma\u00eetre d\u2019s desk, waiting for her. His hair was shiny as a crow\u2019s wing, like his mom\u2019s, his back to her, as he was talking to someone. Oh, crap, it was Jessica Dunn. Great. No one made her feel less attractive than Jessica, who probably had never even heard of Microfiber Slim-Nation undergarments.</p><p>Faith had dressed for the occasion, oh, yes. One does not meet one\u2019s g*y ex-fianc\u00e9 without looking fantastic. Her cutest San Francisco dress, a bright yellow confection with good seaming and tulle flowers bunched along the hem. In SF, it had seemed like sunshine itself; now, seeing Jessica dressed in black skinny jeans and a black V-neck sweater, Faith felt like a giant kindergartener. Well. At least she had on slutty shoes.</p><p>Now or never, Faith, her brain instructed, sounding like Mrs. Linqvest, who\u2019d often whipped out stories of Eve\u2019s pain in childbirth to better terrorize the kids. Faith opened the door, the handle cold in her damp palm.</p><p>Jeremy turned around, and his eyes went soft. \u201cHey,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cHi there, stranger,\u201d she said, her voice sounding false. Then she hugged him, and oh, crikey, he felt so good. Three and a half years apart, and she remembered everything about him, how they fit together, her cheek against his shoulder, the hard, smooth muscles of his back, the soft brush of his hair against her cheek, the smell of Old Spice (again...how could he be g*y and wear Old Spice? Or had that been a clue?).</p><p>She\u2019d loved him so much. The best man she knew...and the man who\u2019d lied to her for years. Who\u2019d allowed her to think they\u2019d have everything.</p><p>Faith pulled back and gave him a smile, which shook a little at the corners. Jeremy\u2019s eyes were wet, too.</p><p>\u201cYou got even more beautiful,\u201d he said a little unsteadily.</p><p>The words caused the lump in her throat to swell. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d But he had, a little. There was a sadness around his eyes, and a few very appealing crow\u2019s-feet had sprung up, making him even more handsome.</p><p>\u201cHi, Faith,\u201d Jessica said, a tinge of impatience in her voice, like she\u2019d had enough of the reunion.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jess. Nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>Jess cocked an eyebrow. Really, she and Levi had been the perfect couple. Maybe they could go into business. Condescending Looks, LLC. \u201cCome on, I have your old table for you.\u201d She led them through Hugo\u2019s to the table by the window. Jeremy held her chair, just like old times. Jess handed them menus like she was giving out Oscars, then asked if they knew what they wanted to drink.</p><p>\u201cHow about a bottle of the Fulkerson dry Riesling?\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cGot any left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy smiled at Faith. \u201cThey beat us out of the platinum last year. Don\u2019t tell my parents I ordered it. They\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>A twinge of nervous irritation zipped through her. The man had left her on the altar; now he wanted to joke about wine like they were old chums. Out on the lake, boat lights winked and bobbed. The hum of the restaurant patrons made the silence between them a little less awkward.</p><p>Her lessons on dressing well seemed to have stuck with Jeremy; he looked like a model for Ralph Lauren now, a red V-neck sweater over a cream-colored button down, dark washed jeans. His hair was a little shorter than it used to be, and it suited him.</p><p>\u201cSo Levi told me he\u2019s seen you a couple times,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Good old Levi,\u201d Faith said, managing to keep the snark out of her voice. \u201cYou two are still close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Jeremy put the napkin in his lap, then took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been really nervous about seeing you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI woke up at four this morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So they\u2019d been awake at the same time. Funny, that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d she said, surreptitiously wiping her damp hands on her napkin.</p><p>Jeremy pressed his lips together. \u201cI guess I was a little worried about how you\u2019d feel. If you\u2019d slap my face or throw your drink at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dr. Lyon!\u201d called a plump woman with pinkish hair. \u201cMy knee is so much better! It should be, with all the fluid you drained out of it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, good, Dolores. Glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred cc\u2019s! I think I hold a record!\u201d the woman said gleefully.</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d He glanced at Faith. \u201cSorry. Where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink-throwing and slaps,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for the ideas.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy gave a crooked smile and rubbed his chin. \u201cCan we get that out of the way? Do you hate me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Jeremy. Of course not. I told you that, right after the wedding. A few times. More than a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was in the early days. I thought maybe as time went on, you\u2019d get...I don\u2019t know. Angry. You never wanted to see me when you were back in town, so...\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cI needed to get over you,\u201d she said as quietly as she could. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I hated you. It was because I loved you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled again, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc!\u201d someone called. \u201cOh, lord, you\u2019re with Faith! Hi, Faith, honey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Faith said. Clearly, meeting in public had been a bad idea. \u201cI have no idea who that is,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cJoan Pepitone,\u201d Jeremy murmured. \u201cBig Frankie\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two getting back together?\u201d Frankie\u2019s mother asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mrs. Pepitone,\u201d he said. \u201cJust having dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two kids alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Faith said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go!\u201d Jessica announced, sticking the bottle in Jeremy\u2019s face so he could see the label.</p><p>Jeremy nodded, and Jess began uncorking the bottle.</p><p>There were times when Faith really hated all the rituals that went along with wine. Jeremy picked up the cork; it wasn\u2019t crumbly. Jessica poured him an ounce; he swirled and smelled it, then nodded. Jess poured Faith a glass, then Jeremy, then started reciting the specials.</p> <p>\u201cJess, if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re ready, okay?\u201d Jeremy said, smiling up at her.</p><p>\u201cSure, pal,\u201d she said. \u201cTake all the time you want.\u201d She gave Faith a look that wasn\u2019t nearly as warm as the one she\u2019d just leveled at Jeremy and finally left. Couldn\u2019t have been more than a size four, just in case she wasn\u2019t already a pain in the butt.</p><p>Faith straightened out her cutlery, then took a sip of wine, smiling awkwardly at Jeremy. He smiled back. All smiles, all the time.</p><p>\u201cJeremy,\u201d she said quietly, looking down at her plate, \u201cI think the hardest part of everything was that you let it go so far.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute, idly swirling the wine in his glass, staring at it like it was the Rosetta stone. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined a life that didn\u2019t have me as a straight guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved you. How could I be g*y if that was true?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI should\u2019ve talked to you. I just\u2014and I recognize the irony here\u2014I didn\u2019t want to hurt you. When I did let myself acknowledge that we didn\u2019t have a normal relationship\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy which I assume you\u2019re talking about Justin Timberlake?\u201d she interjected. She now hated all JT songs on principle.</p><p>He had the grace to look ashamed. \u201cRight. At those moments, I thought...\u201d He sighed. \u201cI thought, well, you seemed happy enough. It wouldn\u2019t matter if we just kept going on the way we had been.\u201d</p><p>Faith let that sink in. \u201cSo because I was too dumb to notice anything was wrong, it was okay to pretend to be straight.\u201d A burst of white-hot anger flared in her heart.</p><p>Jeremy\u2019s face changed. \u201cNo! Not like that, Faith. Just...if you were happy, then I was. Because I did love you. I still do. I hope you believe me.\u201d</p><p>The flare extinguished.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said.</p><p>They sat for a few minutes. Funny, how she\u2019d never felt uncomfortable with Jeremy before. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWas it hard?\u201d she asked. \u201cDealing with everyone\u2019s surprise?\u201d she asked. They\u2019d talked about it in those first few weeks, but he\u2019d always shrugged it off, more concerned with her, both of them trying to assure the other they were fine.</p><p>\u201cIt was hard being without you,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time something good happened, you were the one I wanted to tell. And every time something bad happened...well, a couple times, I was already calling you before I remembered we weren\u2019t together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said, her voice wobbling. Dang it. She dug in her purse for a tissue, but Jeremy was already handing her a handkerchief. \u201cThis is very sentimental, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked in a shaky voice, and they both laughed a little. She wiped her eyes and tried not to look at him.</p><p>The murmur and hum of the diners around them filled the silence.</p><p>Faith\u2019s heart sat heavy in her chest. Like road kill, like a dead, stiff porcupine. Okay, that was a really pathetic image. Even now, the dead porcupine was resurrecting and giving her a reproachful look\u2014I was just sleeping, dummy\u2014but yeah, kind of. For eight unwavering years, she\u2019d adored Jeremy Lyon. For the past three, the argument could be made (and made well) that he\u2019d still been the most important man in her life.</p><p>It was really time for that to change. She\u2019d kept a few secrets of her own, even from him. And maybe those were just as important as his had been.</p><p>\u201cI realize how wrong it was for me to lie to you, Faith,\u201d Jeremy said, staring at the table. \u201cI used you so I could be the person I wanted to be, not the person I was, if that makes any sense. I\u2019m more sorry about that than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might\u2019ve done some of that, too,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cBut you never lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Then again, maybe so.</p><p>He looked at her, his eyes solemn. \u201cI have this fantasy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat you forgive me. That we become really close again. All the feelings I had for you, Faith...I wasn\u2019t faking that. I was crazy about you.\u201d His voice broke a little. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell. She couldn\u2019t just leave him there, hanging. Faith reached over to grip his strong, smooth hands, bittersweet memories sliding through her like a river. His face as he saw her dressed for the prom, the way he always leaned forward a little when she was talking, as if he was afraid he\u2019d miss a single word. The way he brought flowers to the airport when she came home from college, hugging her so hard he\u2019d lift her right off the ground, the inevitable \u201caw\u201d of a few onlookers.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can be friends, Jeremy,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Maybe this was what she needed to get on with her life. For three and a half years, she hadn\u2019t been able to find a meaningful relationship. Maybe being here, being around Jeremy, was the final piece of the puzzle.</p><p>\u201cYou guys ready to order?\u201d Jessica was back, and clearly no more conversation would be tolerated till their dinners had been chosen.</p><p>They ordered and ate, talking about ordinary things\u2014Ted and Elaine spent most of the year in San Diego. Lyon\u2019s Den was run by a manager and had been featured in the Times. Jeremy\u2019s practice was bustling; he saw patients who were newborns, patients in their nineties, and, clearly, he was doing what he was meant to do. She brought him up-to-date on the Holland news, her plans for the barn and library.</p><p>The time had come to ask the awkward question. Faith realized her toes were curled in her slutty, painful shoes. \u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d Faith asked, and Jeremy\u2019s face took on that hint of sadness again.</p><p>\u201cNo. I, uh...no. I had a, um, a friend in the city about a year ago, but not anymore. The long-distance thing was too hard.\u201d He looked out the window. \u201cI\u2019m so busy, I don\u2019t see how I\u2019d find someone. Dating websites, maybe. I don\u2019t know. I keep thinking someone will just show up one day. Maybe. Or maybe I\u2019m destined to be single, which would be okay, too. I don\u2019t mean to sound pathetic. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do sound pathetic,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou sound like Bob Cratchit after Tiny Tim dies. \u2018I am a happy man.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHow about you, Faith? Anyone special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dated here and there,\u201d she said. Still haven\u2019t slept with a straight guy, though that is definitely something I\u2019d like to cross off my bucket list.</p><p>\u201cBut nothing...serious?\u201d Jeremy asked, and she could tell he was hoping she\u2019d say yes.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cA good man is hard to find.\u201d She hesitated, then told him about her last date, Clint and his kid calling her whore, and by the time she was done, they were both laughing so hard they were crying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to be with you again,\u201d Jeremy said, wiping his eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight back at you,\u201d she said, and her heart gave a twist. She did love Jeremy, and she always would. They could be friends. Real friends, honest this time around. Because men like Jeremy...they just didn\u2019t make them like that anymore.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Faith startled a little. Crap, it was Levi, like an irritable grammar school nun about to whack their hands with a ruler. He still wore his uniform, gun and all. He gave her a five on the Boredom Scale, his eyes glancing over her and dismissing her in a nanosecond.</p><p>\u201cLevi! Have a seat, buddy,\u201d Jeremy said, letting go of her hand. \u201cFaith and I were just catching up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d He paused. \u201cFaith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi.\u201d She mimicked his solemn tone, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>Jeremy beamed. \u201cSit down. You want something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, join us, Levi,\u201d Faith said, narrowing her eyes just a little. He wouldn\u2019t sit down. He disliked her too much.</p><p>He sat. Next to Jeremy of course, the better to level that God, you\u2019re so uninteresting look at her, now a seven. Faith smiled at him, making sure to wrinkle her nose like a Disney princess. His look shot up to a nine and a half. Already, his fingers were drumming on the table, ever itchy where she was concerned. Good. Let him itch. Let him have an infestation of fleas, perhaps, or a festering, scabby rash.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother baked some brownies for you, Levi,\u201d she said sweetly, tipping her head and tucking some hair behind her ear. \u201cSince you were so helpful with the flying squirrels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives to serve,\u201d Jeremy said, grinning. Levi gave Jeremy a wry look, which slid right off his face when he returned his gaze to Faith.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s a huge fan, Levi. If you ever wanted a girlfriend, I\u2019m convinced she\u2019d leave my grandfather for you.\u201d Another sunny smile, which failed to illicit any reaction at all, though Jeremy laughed.</p><p>Jessica came over. \u201cHey, Levi, how you doing?\u201d she asked, messing up the chief of police\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m not gonna stay,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>Thank God for small favors, Faith thought. \u201cSo are you two...together again?\u201d she asked, glancing up at Jessica.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no,\u201d Jess snorted. \u201cWe broke up in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were always on and off\u2014\u201d Faith began.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, people change,\u201d Jessica said, a smile not quite masking the sharpness in her voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was always just physical, anyway,\u201d Levi said, giving Jess a wink, a slight smile pulling his mouth up in one corner. \u201cRight, Jess?\u201d</p><p>Hello. Captain Testosterone still had it, Faith had to admit. That look was equivalent to half an hour of dedicated foreplay\u2014green eyes all sleepy and knowing, that faint smile promising all sorts of thorough attention. Not that she was...it wasn\u2019t like she...what was the question again?</p><p>\u201cFaith? You want dessert?\u201d Jessica demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh! Um, no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she said brightly, hoping no one noticed her burning cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cGotta go,\u201d Levi said, standing up. He punched Jeremy\u2019s shoulder, leaned in to kiss Jessica on the cheek, then glanced at Faith. Good Lord, he wouldn\u2019t kiss her, would he? Should she offer her cheek, just in case? But Jessica was standing in the way, and if he wanted to kiss her, he\u2019d have to\u2014</p><p>Yeah, never mind. He was leaving. \u201cBye, Levi!\u201d she called merrily. \u201cAlways so great running into you!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss Jessica\u2019s eye roll as she padded away. Well, who cared? Levi and Jessica were two people she\u2019d never managed to win over.</p><p>\u201cWhere were we?\u201d Jeremy asked, and she turned her attention back to him.</p><p>WHEN SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT, Goggy and Pops were still awake, alas.</p> <p>\u201cYour grandfather won\u2019t go to bed,\u201d Goggy announced, crossing her arms over her ample bosom. She looked like an angry pink pigeon, wrapped tightly in the fleece robe Faith had given her for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother won\u2019t, either,\u201d Pops said from the den. \u201cHow was your date, sweetheart?\u201d He came into the kitchen and bent to kiss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYes, how was it?\u201d Goggy asked, squeezing her hand, not to be outdone in the affection department.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date,\u201d Faith said, spying the plate of brownies Goggy had made earlier. She took one, not because she was hungry, but because Goggy had made them for Levi. \u201cBut it was good to see Jeremy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are for Chief Cooper,\u201d Goggy said, a hint of reproof in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI know, but they looked so beautiful, I couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Faith said.</p> <p>\u201cLet me get you some milk, sweetie.\u201d Mollified, Goggy leaped to the cupboard for a glass. Pops tried to sneak a brownie, too, but Goggy slapped his hand. \u201cThose are for Levi! Not for you!\u201d she said. \u201cFaith, sweetheart, do you want another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Pops, it\u2019s nine-thirty,\u201d Faith said. \u201cWhy are you up?\u201d Her grandfather, being a farmer, did tend to go to bed around eight each night. \u201cYou feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d Goggy said. \u201cIt\u2019s that woman, that German, on Project Runway. He\u2019s making a fool of himself, watching a show for a German woman who\u2019s a third his age!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I\u2019m allowed to look. I\u2019m not dead yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad, isn\u2019t it? When are you going to do me a favor and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, listen, you two,\u201d Faith said loudly. They quieted. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you don\u2019t need me around here, checking on you. I\u2019m going to find a place of my own until...well.\u201d Until I go back, she was about to say.</p><p>But she\u2019d never planned to stay in California forever. No one was getting any younger. Abby\u2019d be off at college in two years; Goggy and Pops were old, if still filled with piss and vinegar.</p><p>\u201cWho said we didn\u2019t need you? Of course we need you!\u201d Goggy said firmly. \u201cYou should stay with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman, Elizabeth,\u201d Pops said. \u201cShe can do what she wants. And aren\u2019t you the one who sent her all the way to California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? She needed to get away! Her heart was broken, you doddering old man. I didn\u2019t mean she should stay away forever. Did I tell her to do that? No! This is her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe she wants to spread her wings a little without you nosing into her business,\u201d Pops said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Faith said. \u201cNo more fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t fighting,\u201d Goggy said. \u201cWe were discussing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s watch Project Runway, okay? But I am moving out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A single girl on her own? Someone could break in and slit your throat as you\u2019re sleeping,\u201d her grandmother said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the thought, Goggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should get married. Oh! You know who\u2019s single? Levi!\u201d Goggy made a clucking sound of triumph. \u201cThat wife of his left him! I bet he\u2019s lonely. You could marry him! Is he Lutheran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he\u2019s not my type,\u201d Faith said easily. \u201cCome on. I hear Heidi Klum.\u201d</p><p>She herded her grandparents into the den and sat between them on the couch.</p><p>Marry Levi. Right.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T SEE WHY YOU GIRLS needed me to drive you,\u201d Faith\u2019s father said as they pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cBecause we need you to protect us from disgusting men, Mr. H.,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThough if you\u2019d marry me, I wouldn\u2019t be reduced to Singles Shooting Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dad. We\u2019ll both feel better if you\u2019re here. And Coll, no more proposing to my father, okay?\u201d</p><p>The plan was to get Dad out in the world of senior citizen singletons and show him that there were women who weren\u2019t quite as, er, carnivorous as Lorena. Two days ago, Honor had caught the woman in Dad\u2019s bedroom, going through Mom\u2019s collection of antique perfume bottles. When Honor confronted her, Lorena said she\u2019d gotten lost on her way back from the bathroom, which didn\u2019t explain why she was making a list. This had resulted in a phone call from Honor, saying that if Faith wasn\u2019t up for the job, she\u2019d do it herself.</p><p>But Faith was trying. She wanted nothing more than for Dad to find a nice woman, though it was still shocking that after nineteen and a half years, someone like Lorena had wormed past his shield. Tonight, she\u2019d opted for the more personal route, completely unable to imagine her beloved dad with StillHotGranny or NotDeadYet, the most recent listings on eCommitment/SeniorLove.</p><p>And so, Singles Shooting Night (Ages 21 to 101! the ad had merrily announced) here in Corning, which got Dad out of town and might make him a little more relaxed...he\u2019d always tended to blush and mutter around interested women (except Lorena\u2014again, probably because he was so clueless). And sure, Faith had it in the back of her mind that maybe, just maybe, she\u2019d meet a sweet and wonderful man. One who looked like Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe. Or Ryan Gosling. She\u2019d take either. Or both. Why not? A girl could dream.</p><p>As for the whole weapons aspect of the evening, well. There wasn\u2019t much in terms of singles events around here, if you didn\u2019t count setting a fire to a hay bale so the Manningsport Volunteer Fire Department would come out, which Suzette Minor had done last week. According to Ned, Suzette had then been asked out by Gerard Chartier, so maybe there was something to be said for arson. But Singles Shooting Night had a certain metaphoric truth, Faith thought. You\u2019d aim, fire and hit or miss. We met over a Glock, and she nailed the target right in the face, and I just knew.</p><p>\u201cGame faces on, people,\u201d Colleen said as they got out of the car. Dad grumbled but followed her inside, removing his cap and running a hand through his silver hair.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t forget you have to talk if a lady approaches you,\u201d Faith said. \u201cBe nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve brought Lorena,\u201d Dad said. \u201cI think she\u2019s interested in getting married again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she is, Mr. Holland,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cShe\u2019s got her eye on you, don\u2019t you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d he said, smiling fondly.</p><p>\u201cDoes she put out?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cColl! Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 We...ah, we don\u2019t...well, she\u2019s fun and all, but...uh, here you go, girls.\u201d He held the door to Zippy\u2019s Gun &amp; Hunting and then went inside. Plenty of people crowded into the shop, Faith thought. Lots of white hair.</p><p>\u201cHello there,\u201d a man said to Colleen\u2019s boobage, which was on excellent display, as ever. He was around seventy, and Colleen smiled slyly. She\u2019d often voiced the opinion that she had the makings of an excellent kept woman or trophy wife.</p><p>Faith had to give the organizers credit: at least there\u2019d be something to do in addition to the usual chatter/interrogations that went on at singles events. Kill each other, for example. She tried not to sigh as Coll wandered off.</p><p>Her parents had grown up together, childhood friends, dating since tenth grade, when Dad had caught Mom\u2019s shoe at a church dance\u2014the boys had lined up on one side of the room, the girls on the other, and the girls had been told by the reverend to throw one shoe, then find the boy who caught it and dance with him. Mom had admitted to hurling her Ked at John Holland \u201clike Don Larsen throwing to Yogi.\u201d</p><p>Then again, maybe they weren\u2019t the best example.</p><p>Colleen returned. \u201cI already have three phone numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cSo old school. Two of those guys don\u2019t even have a Facebook page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re tapping into the artificial hip crowd, Coll, what do you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see anyone for you?\u201d Colleen asked, peering around. A man wearing overalls\u2014but no shirt\u2014leered at them, but Coll just laughed and said, \u201cIn your dreams, pal. Eesh. Avert the eyes, Faith. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s wearing underwear.\u201d</p><p>By and large, the attendees were female and over fifty. She and Colleen definitely stood out. There were...let\u2019s see...seven men, not counting Dad. Speaking of, her father approached. \u201cSweetie, what should I do?\u201d he asked. \u201cTwo women have already asked for my phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great!\u201d Faith said, patting his arm. \u201cVery flattering. Maybe you should meet one of them for coffee. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not really interested in dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, Lorena is circling you like a great white. I think she thinks you\u2019re dating.\u201d</p><p>Dad gave her a confused look. \u201cNo. She\u2019s just fun. A nice person. Very vivacious.\u201d</p><p>Faith paused. \u201cDad, we\u2019re pretty sure she\u2019s after your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no money. I have four children instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was cataloguing Mom\u2019s perfume bottles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, those things. Your mommy sure did love them. I thought they were dust collectors, myself, but...\u201d His blue eyes softened at the memory, and Faith\u2019s heart tightened. She had to find him someone else. He deserved it.</p><p>A woman edged closer. Nicely dressed, age-appropriate. Faith gave her a tiny nod and turned back to her father.</p><p>\u201cDad, if you think Lorena\u2019s fun, maybe you\u2019ll like talking to other women who don\u2019t discuss thongs with your teenage granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she do that?\u201d Dad asked, suitably shocked.</p><p>\u201cAsk Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive someone else a shot, Mr. H.,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cSee what you got. Oh, that guy is giving me the eye. Back in a flash.\u201d Colleen dashed off to another septuagenarian, this one with a walker, and tossed her shiny hair.</p><p>\u201cHello there! I\u2019m Beatrice,\u201d said the woman who\u2019d been eyeing dear old Dad. Attractive, lively, smiling. A contender, in other words. She spoke to Faith, rather than John. \u201cAren\u2019t you beautiful! I love red hair.\u201d</p><p>Nicely played, Faith admitted. Go straight for the child. \u201cI\u2019m Faith, and this is my dad, John. He\u2019s a widower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d Beatrice cooed, her eyes sparkling with delight. \u201cI\u2019m divorced, three kids, four grands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dad didn\u2019t answer, so Faith gave him a hearty nudge to the ribs. \u201cOh, uh, I\u2019m...uh hello. John. John Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Faith muttered.</p><p>\u201cI have several children myself,\u201d he said. He was sweating already. Faith stepped discreetly away, pretending not to see Dad\u2019s pleading look.</p><p>Colleen intercepted her near the refreshments table. \u201cThe guy was impotent. I mean, come on. I\u2019m willing to overlook certain things, but that? No. Says his heart condition prevents Viagra, so thus ends our courtship. Oh! Faith, check that out. If the flip side is half as good as what we\u2019re seeing, I think we\u2019ve found your soul mate. That, my friend, is a great ass. Do you concur?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI concur most heartily.\u201d</p><p>The man was not old, nor did he have a walker. Score two points. Jeans (yes, she checked out his ass first, what else was a girl to do when presented with that side of a man?), a green T-shirt, the sleeves tight around his gorgeously muscled arms. Broad, solid shoulders. Short dark blond hair.</p><p>An icicle sliced through the warm curls of lust that were starting in her girl parts. He turned toward them. Yep.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s Levi!\u201d Colleen exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here? Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s cruising these pathetic singles things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to point it out, but we\u2019re cruising these pathetic\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019ve seen up close how that man has to fight off the hordes of hungry females in our town.\u201d</p><p>Faith glanced at her. Colleen was unabashedly, er...open about liking sex. \u201cYou and Levi ever...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. He\u2019s too young for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our age, Coll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, Faith. No, I like them broken in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds filthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrained. I like them trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s worse.\u201d Faith grinned.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stop. Hey, Levi, come on over, bud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t, Colleen, you know he never... Hi, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>Colleen put a hand on his arm. \u201cLevi, we\u2019re looking to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d Faith groaned.</p><p>Her friend ignored her. \u201cCan you hook us up with the hottest men here? I like them fifty, fifty-five plus. Don\u2019t mind a little beer belly. Missing limb is okay, as long as it was lost heroically. I don\u2019t want some dumb ass who cut off his own hand chopping wood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Levi said. \u201cBeen through the population of Manningsport, Coll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be catty. Seen anyone who might be Faith\u2019s soul mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here to keep my dad company,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhich is not to say we weren\u2019t just checking out your ass,\u201d Colleen added.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Levi?\u201d Faith asked, feeling the heat prickling not just her cheeks, but her throat and chest, too. \u201cLooking for Mrs. Cooper the Second?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a long, unblinking stare. A nine on the scale, sort of a So this is what hell is like look. \u201cI\u2019m the instructor,\u201d he said.</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cHey, Levi,\u201d her father said, having extracted himself from Beatrice of the voracious eyes. \u201cHow you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks. The girls say you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it,\u201d John suggested.</p><p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d Levi said. \u201cI need to get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure, do your thing, hottie.\u201d Colleen smacked him on the shoulder, then mugged for Faith as he walked away. \u201cI would ride him like a Brahma bull if he were twenty years older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen, you\u2019re a hoot,\u201d Dad said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cIf I said that, you\u2019d drop dead of a heart attack,\u201d Faith pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Dad said. At least he seemed more relaxed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, people,\u201d Levi called. \u201cWelcome to...\u201d He glanced at his clipboard, then sighed. \u201cTarget Practice for Singles.\u201d His eyes stopped on her, and even from five yards away, she could feel his disdain. \u201cI\u2019m Levi Cooper, your shooting instructor for tonight. Who here is familiar with guns?\u201d</p><p>LEVI HAD SUSPECTED THIS GIG was a bad idea. Once in a while, he taught gun safety classes here, so when Ed, the owner, had called him, he said sure. It paid four hundred dollars, and with Sarah\u2019s textbooks costing as much as a pony, four hundred bucks wasn\u2019t bad for two hours\u2019 work.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected to see the Hollands here, that was for sure. Or Colleen. She, at least, was fun. Faith, though...she had some bug up her ass. For some reason, she was telling every woman there that he was single, too. \u201cOh, Levi\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he overheard her say to a woman who looked much like his drill sergeant. \u201cSo sensitive. Also, a war hero. I know. We went to school together. Sure, he loves older women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartner up, folks,\u201d Levi called. \u201cFaith, old buddy, why don\u2019t you come over here?\u201d It was only fair, really, that she get the guy in the overalls who\u2019d opted not to wear a shirt tonight.</p><p>\u201cGosh, you\u2019re pretty,\u201d the guy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you should wear a shirt,\u201d she said easily. \u201cReally. Okay? Next time, wear clothes.\u201d She smiled at the guy, who got the idiotic look of a man in love. Or a drunk. Slack jaw, blurred vision.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fired a gun before, Faith, haven\u2019t you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI have. Hand her over, Levi. I\u2019m feeling a little trigger happy tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can shoot, too?\u201d Shirtless said. \u201cThe perfect woman.\u201d</p><p>Levi almost smiled as he walked up and down the line, instructing the amateurs on how to hold the gun, what kind of kickback to expect. Colleen had some old dude eating out of her hand, and the man certainly wasn\u2019t complaining. One woman didn\u2019t want to wear ear protection because it would mess up her hair. Honestly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a thing about guns,\u201d said one lady, grabbing his arm, the better to squish her boobs against him. \u201cCan you help me with my stance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Like this.\u201d He demonstrated the proper firing stance\u2014legs slightly spread, arms out, elbows bent, both hands wrapped around the gun. \u201cKeep your thumbs together, your trigger finger here. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stand behind me, and put your arms around me to make sure I\u2019m doing it right?\u201d She gave a wriggle of anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cPlease? Pretty please? I\u2019m Donna, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am. We have rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman said you\u2019re ex-military,\u201d she murmured huskily, jerking her chin down the line at Faith. \u201cI won\u2019t lie. I find that very hot.\u201d She trailed a finger along the bottom of the crossed swords of his 10th Mountain Division tattoo, making his skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cI have to move on.\u201d He glanced at her partner, who was doing a finger stick to check his blood sugar. \u201cGood luck, sir.\u201d</p><p>The sound of gunfire still made him flinch a little. Another good reason to be here. Desensitization.</p><p>After the target practice, the participants were supposed to sit down and talk in eight-minute segments, then move on. Like anyone would need eight minutes to tell. Nina, his ex-wife, had been a helicopter pilot who\u2019d picked up his patrol during a messy skirmish, and ten seconds into their conversation, he\u2019d already known they\u2019d be sleeping together. Three days later, he\u2019d been thinking marriage, kids, a little house back home.</p><p>Then again, Nina had dumped him thirteen weeks into the marriage.</p><p>Whatever. Target practice was almost over. In an hour, Levi could lock up and go home, and hopefully sleep better than he had last night, although gunfire wasn\u2019t the best sound to have echoing in your head before bedtime. Maybe he\u2019d bake some cookies for Sarah.</p><p>He stopped to check on a couple who actually seemed to be having fun, gave the guy a tip on aim and moved on. John Holland was in the next lane. He wasn\u2019t shooting, though. He was being hunted, practically pinned against the wall.</p><p>\u201cFeel them,\u201d said the woman who\u2019d claimed him as partner. \u201cThey\u2019re just like the real thing. I said to myself, \u2018Carla, do you want to have droopy old boobs for the rest of your life?\u2019 This was my sixtieth birthday present to me. Implants, double D, peanut oil. Go ahead. Take a squeeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, John,\u201d Levi said. \u201cCould you give me a hand with something?\u201d</p><p>The man leaped at the chance. \u201cThank you, son,\u201d John breathed. \u201cGod, I miss my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up yet.\u201d He glanced at his chart. \u201cOkay, yeah, this lady seemed nice.\u201d They approached another woman who was firing with great efficiency. \u201cI\u2019d be g*y for Ellen,\u201d she was telling the man she was with. \u201cShe has a great ass.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s face turned a shade whiter.</p><p>\u201cMoving on,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cThis was my daughter\u2019s idea, and I just don\u2019t... I think I\u2019m going home. Do you see Faith and Colleen?\u201d</p><p>Levi glanced down the line, where Faith was leaning against the wall in the last stall, Shirtless pouring on the charm. She saw Levi and gave him a subtle finger. \u201cKnow what?\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like she\u2019s having a great time. Colleen, too. How about if I drive them back?\u201d</p><p>John nodded. \u201cThat\u2019d be great, Levi. Thank you.\u201d With that, he hurtled for the door.</p><p>A little while later, the guns, ear and eye protectors stowed, the now-unarmed single people sat in the shop area of the gun range. The walls were lined with rifles, locked glass cases housing ammo and pistols. Metal chairs had been brought in, and the single people sat facing each other in a long line. It looked like visiting hours at a prison, minus the phones.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my dad?\u201d Faith asked him as he walked past.</p><p>\u201cHe left,\u201d Levi answered, not pausing. He heard her squawk and turned around. \u201cI\u2019m driving you and Colleen home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could,\u201d Shirtless Joe offered.</p><p>Levi leaned against the wall and checked his phone. Four texts from Sarah. I have 0 friends. Can u come get me?</p><p>Feel sick was the second.</p><p>Stop being an ass, u can\u2019t make me stay here was the third, and the fourth was simply I hate u.</p><p>Sighing, he stepped into the hallway to call her back. Got her voice mail. Honestly, why had he bought her a phone if she just used it for texting?</p><p>\u201cSarah, stop being such a drama queen, okay? You can come home on Columbus Day. You need to make some actual human friends.\u201d He paused, picturing her at a party with a bong and a bag full of Ecstasy. \u201cOr just study more. Keep up those grades. All right? I have to go.\u201d He paused. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Ten seconds later, his phone buzzed. Still hate u. And ur 1 2 talk. Get a life &amp; stop obsessing about me. U need 2 get laid.</p><p>Inappropriate, he texted back. Oh, and by the way, he\u2019d love to stop obsessing about Sarah, but she texted or called at least ten times a day. Would it be wrong to strangle her? Probably.</p><p>Levi rubbed his eyes. The truth was, both of them needed to get a life. These past two years, with Nina leaving and Mom\u2019s cancer...it\u2019d been rough. And he and Sarah were closer because of it. But when your family shrinks to two, it got to be a little hard sometimes, the only shoulder for Sarah to cry on.</p><p>The door opened\u2014Colleen. \u201cHey, Chief. Come on in here. Let me practice on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds so dirty, O\u2019Rourke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my dreams, definitely,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOoh, wanna talk dirty? Bet I could win.\u201d She raised her eyebrows and grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou would,\u201d he acknowledged. He liked Colleen, one of the few who\u2019d never treated him differently after he\u2019d come back. Her brother, too, and Jeremy. And Faith, now that he thought of it, though Faith had an edge to her he didn\u2019t remember. It was better than Princess Super-Cute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colleen towed him back in the room and gestured to one of the empty metal chairs.</p><p>\u201cJust sit there and look pretty,\u201d Colleen said, taking a seat. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we don\u2019t know each other. We\u2019re supposed to ask three questions each. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCheeseburgers made at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, good answer!\u201d she said, clapping. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>It was such a girl question. Did he even have a favorite color? Blue? Red? \u201cGreen,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSuper. And last one, what\u2019s your favorite position?\u201d She gave him a leer, and Levi just smiled. \u201cWell, points for trying,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI was gonna write it in the bathroom stall at the bar. When are you gonna start dating again, Levi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree questions was all you got.\u201d</p> <p>Someone\u2019s watch or phone beeped, and all the women got up and shifted. Colleen blew him a kiss. He nodded back. The next woman was the one who\u2019d stroked his tattoo. Her questions were, Do you believe in love at first sight, have you ever spanked a woman and what\u2019s your favorite color. His answers were no, no and red.</p><p>\u201cOkay, ask me anything,\u201d she said.</p><p>Levi sighed. \u201cUm, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonna. I already told you that.\u201d She gave him a huge smile and squeezed her arms together, making her leathery cle**age swell. \u201cWant to come back to my place and work on that spanking?\u201d</p><p>For crying out loud. \u201cI think it\u2019s still my turn for questions. Uh, what\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPink! I\u2019m actually wearing pink underwear. Want to see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill my turn. What are your views on the Mideast peace talks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone should totally get along, don\u2019t you? Want to go out sometime?\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, the timer sounded again. \u201cNice meeting you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Faith sat down in front of him. The night just kept getting better. \u201cOh, my gosh,\u201d she said to the departing lady. \u201cI think he likes you! He was just checking out your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, Faith,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d the woman said. She slapped her own butt and winked at him.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you made a friend,\u201d Faith told him. \u201cThat\u2019s so you, Levi. Such a friendly person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have three questions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do, actually. Not that I want to date you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>That got her. Pink rose in her cheeks (and neck...and chest, there was the mighty rack again, showcased in a red V-neck, and really, there was nothing like a redhead in red). She unfolded a piece of paper. \u201cHave you ever been in prison?\u201d</p><p>Okay, well, at least it wasn\u2019t his favorite color. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you fathered any children, and are you involved in their lives if so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many women have you slept with?\u201d She gave him a knowing look. \u201cIf you can count that high, that is.\u201d</p><p>The number wasn\u2019t as high as his reputation, apparently. \u201cPass. Next question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you provide me with your social security number so I can run a background check on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to believe you\u2019re still single.\u201d He lifted an eyebrow at her, and she folded up her list, making a huffing noise.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t crinkle your forehead at me, Levi Cooper. Questions like this cut through the garbage. Who cares if you like moonlit walks or love old movies or if you\u2019re married or g*y or live in your mother\u2019s basement?\u201d</p><p>She had a point. \u201cI hate old movies,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. They\u2019re so schmaltzy. Give me a horror flick any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like horror movies, I don\u2019t live in my mother\u2019s basement, I\u2019m not married and I\u2019m not g*y,\u201d he said.</p><p>And all of a sudden, an electric current seemed to hum between them. She seemed to feel it, too, because her cheeks flushed, and her eyes seemed to soften. You need to get laid, his brain reminded him.</p><p>Shit. Not with Faith Holland and all her baggage. No matter how much his body was starting to growl.</p><p>\u201cExnooze me,\u201d came a baby voice, and Levi jumped as something nudged his ear. It was Donna, and holy hell, she had a puppet on her hand. A pig, waving at him. \u201cDo you wike animoos? I wuv dem!\u201d Her voice changed back to normal. \u201cI do puppet shows at children\u2019s parties. I love kids, don\u2019t you? I\u2019d like to have a few.\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled at him, the timer sounded, and both women went on to someone else.</p><p>SO FAITH HADN\u2019T FOUND her future husband. She hadn\u2019t really expected to, but she\u2019d gotten three phone numbers for Dad and would begin screening tomorrow. The night wasn\u2019t a total bust.</p><p>Levi drove in manly silence all the way home; she asked him to take Route 54 instead of Lancaster Road, but he hadn\u2019t asked why; just grunted and done as she requested.</p><p>You know, for a second there, she could\u2019ve sworn that something had passed between them. Maybe. Whatever it was, imagined or not, it had vaporized almost instantly.</p><p>\u201cThis was such a good idea,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cSugar daddy, here I come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel bad that my father left,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cI just feel bad that you won\u2019t let me marry him,\u201d Coll returned. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I make a great stepmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be dead in a week,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cLevi, did you find anyone? That lady with the tattoos, she was kinda hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the puppeteer,\u201d Faith couldn\u2019t help adding. \u201cVery kinky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just there as the instructor,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you should find a nice girl,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the lookout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed dramatically. \u201cFaith, his heart was broken when his evil wife left him. We have to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe seems to want to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d he said, glancing in the rearview.</p><p>Pretty eyes. Levi Cooper definitely had pretty eyes.</p><p>She kind of hoped Levi would drop Colleen off first. Why, she didn\u2019t know, but the thought of being alone in the car with Levi Cooper made her knees tingle.</p><p>But, no. Geographically, the Old House came first, and sure enough, Levi pulled into the driveway. She said goodbye to Colleen, thanked him for the ride, then stood, watching them back out, oddly jealous that Colleen would have three more minutes in the car with Chief McYummy.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cFAITH, SINCE YOU\u2019RE NEW, why don\u2019t you get us started off, honey?\u201d said Cathy Kennedy, the leader of Women\u2019s Bible Study.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was my turn,\u201d said Carol Robinson, one of the power walkers Faith had almost hit on her way into town a few days ago. Honestly, the six of them walked abreast, like they wanted to end up in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cWell, Faith is new, so let her have a turn.\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled. Cathy was definitely a contender for Dad\u2019s girlfriend. Last night, Lorena of the Leopard Print had been at dinner again, and Faith had been summoned by an urgent call from Honor, who\u2019d had a wine tasting over at The Red Salamander. Sure enough, Lorena had innocently been rifling through the desk in the den while Dad read the paper, oblivious. When Faith had asked if she could help her find something, Lorena had said she lost an earring last time she\u2019d been there. \u201cThat woman is going to rob your father blind,\u201d Mrs. Johnson had growled when Faith had gone into the kitchen, banging a pot to reinforce her point.</p><p>So, yeah. Where better to find a nice woman than Bible Study? Only one of the three candidates from Singles Shooting Night had held up; one didn\u2019t like children, and the other seemed to have a gambling problem. Number Three was still under investigation, but she lived kind of far away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at, let\u2019s see, now, Exodus, chapter four, verse twenty-five. Go ahead, Faith,\u201d Mrs. Kennedy said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mrs. Kennedy,\u201d Faith said, looking at her Bible. \u201cUm...okay, here we are. \u2018Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son\u2014oh, crikey, are you kidding me?\u2014and cast it at his feet, and said, \u2018Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.\u2019 Am I in the right chapter?\u201d Horrified, she glanced around at the other women.</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d Cathy said. \u201cShall we discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the baby crying?\u201d Carol asked. \u201cYou slice off his little foreskin with a rock and throw it on the ground, I want to know what the baby\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight not have been a baby,\u201d Lena Smits observed. \u201cSometimes those boys were fifteen, sixteen years old when this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Mrs. Corners said. \u201cMy grandson won\u2019t even let his mother hug him. I doubt he\u2019d let anyone circumcise him with a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, too,\u201d Faith said, suppressing a dry heave. Surely, God would see how selfless she was being\u2014senior citizen matchmaking and Bible Study rolled into one\u2014and reward her with not only a pleasant stepmother, but also a nice husband and several cute babies. Any time now, Big Guy, she thought.</p><p>And speaking of marriage...the last time Faith had been in Trinity Lutheran\u2019s basement, she\u2019d been wearing a wedding dress.</p><p>Well. No point in crying over spilled champagne. She wasn\u2019t here to relive her aborted wedding day. She was here to pick up women.</p><p>Cathy Kennedy, sure. She\u2019d been widowed a long time. Janet Borjeson was also single, though Honor had made disapproving noises when Faith had mentioned her. But still. She noted their names in the margin of the Book of Exodus.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, sweetheart?\u201d Goggy asked.</p><p>Faith jumped. \u201cUm, about the circumcision?\u201d And really. Was there something wrong with Let the little children come to me?</p><p>Goggy frowned. \u201cNo, honey. Barb\u2019s thinking about a breast reduction. She\u2019s had back pain for years.\u201d Barb nodded in agreement.</p><p>First foreskins, now boobs. \u201cGo for it. I hear you\u2019ll be really perky afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Barb said. \u201cThanks, Faith. You\u2019re a doll, you know that?\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou know, my grandson is single, honey. Shall I give him your number?\u201d</p><p>Faith suppressed a shudder. Barb\u2019s grandson had escorted her in, a living clich\u00e9 for serial killer\u2014shuffling feet, thinning hair and the creepy, unblinking gaze of Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cOh, that\u2019s sweet of you, but, no. I, uh...no, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still heartbroken over Jeremy Lyon,\u201d Carol Robinson announced.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Faith answered. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you get over him?\u201d Cathy said. \u201cAll that and a doctor, too. Did you know he actually had me laughing during my annual you-know-what?\u201d</p><p>The topic switched to Jeremy\u2019s gentle hands, and then to the new sneakers Carol had bought at seventy percent off during her trip to the outlets.</p><p>After an hour or so, which seemed to be spent discussing ungrateful grandchildren and knee replacements, and not Moses in the desert, Bible Study finally broke up. \u201cThis must bring back terrible memories for you,\u201d Carol said. \u201cThis was the exact spot where Jeremy broke up with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, Mrs. Robinson. Thanks for bringing it up.\u201d She kept her eye on Cathy, hoping to casually mention Dad.</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing! It must\u2019ve been horrible! Did you really have no idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Big surprise, right? How about that Zipporah, huh? Interesting woman.\u201d</p><p>Carol would not be deterred. \u201cI understand you not wanting to date Bobby McIntosh, but you are looking for a husband, aren\u2019t you? Your grandmother said you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no. Not really. Well...sort of, but, no.\u201d Faith shot her grandmother a look, but Goggy was busy discussing the delicacy of Norine Pletts\u2019s lemon bars and making the argument that pastries that good could only be from Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery while Norine simply smiled in enigmatic silence. And dang it! Cathy Kennedy had just walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, my son\u2019s brother-in-law is single. You want his number? Want me to have him call you? He has a glandular problem, so he sweats a lot, but he\u2019s very nice. So I\u2019ll tell him to call you. Good! Okay, bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Mrs. Rob\u2014\u201d But Carol was gone, power-walking efficiently away.</p><p>Faith approached Goggy, who was still drilling Norine about her baking techniques. \u201cWell, if you didn\u2019t use baking powder, Norine, then how are they so flaky? Answer me that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFamily recipe,\u201d Norine said, smiling at Faith.</p><p>\u201cGoggy? I\u2019m gonna start unloading the car, okay? See you when you\u2019re done here. But take your time.\u201d</p><p>Goggy\u2019s face took on a tragic expression as she turned to her fellow Lutherans. \u201cOh. That\u2019s right. She\u2019s leaving me, you know. She\u2019s...moving out. She could\u2019ve stayed with us, but, no, these young people, they all need their space.\u201d She sighed mournfully, invoking a Greek chorus of disapproving murmurs.</p><p>\u201cBye, ladies! Thank you for letting me sit in.\u201d The disapproval turned to hugs and pats and admonitions to watch herself crossing the street and to lock her doors at night so her throat wouldn\u2019t be slit.</p><p>She made her way out of the church basement and blinked in the bright sun.</p> <p>It was one of those perfect, late-September afternoons, clear and cool, the air tart with the smell of changing leaves and pumpkin soup from the little lunch place down the square. A line of preschoolers, all holding onto (or tied to) a rope, made their way across the street. It was a Wednesday, and while a few folks wandered up and down the street, peering into the windows of Presque Antiques and Unique Boutique, it was mostly quiet.</p><p>Two days ago, Faith had asked Honor if she knew of any apartments that might be available. Five seconds later, Honor had Sharon Wiles on the phone. Not only was there an apartment available, it was the model, the only one in the building still not rented and furnished, when would Faith like to move in? Faith had to hand it to her; Honor knew everything and everyone in this town.</p><p>In the back of the car were two suitcases, a few boxes of miscellaneous kitchen stuff Goggy insisted she couldn\u2019t live without, and Blue, sitting up, disgusting tennis ball in his mouth, head tilted as if trying to use mind control so she\u2019d throw him the ball.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie pooch!\u201d Faith said. \u201cDo you love your ball? Is it so slimy and delicious? It is?\u201d Blue chuffed agreeably, wagging his tail. Sharon Wiles hadn\u2019t been crazy about the idea of Blue, but she couldn\u2019t deny that he was beautiful, well behaved and, yes, technically a therapy dog. Hey. It got him into restaurants.</p><p>Faith heaved a box out of the back and made her way over to the Opera House, the dog on her heels. Her new domicile was very conveniently located just off the square and directly across from Lorelei\u2019s Sunrise Bakery. Also, there was a new chocolatier that Faith very much wanted to support. But first, she\u2019d settle in, put a set of new sheets on the bed, make some coffee, unpack her clothes. Goggy would be coming over, too; she wanted to make sure the new apartment was clean enough.</p><p>For a second, Faith pictured her mom helping her move. In Faith\u2019s mind, Connie Holland had aged beautifully, wore jeans and a T-shirt and Converse sneakers. They\u2019d laugh and rearrange the furniture, something Mom had loved to do. Then they\u2019d get some cookies from Lorelei\u2019s and just talk. Maybe about Jeremy. Faith had wondered a thousand times if Mom would\u2019ve been able to tell.</p> <p>And all that might\u2019ve been possible, Faith reminded herself, if it hadn\u2019t been for her own self.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Blue,\u201d Faith said, opening the door. Up the wide staircase to the third floor, her dog following, ball in mouth. Her apartment was 3A, which overlooked Lorelei\u2019s. Thank you, Jesus, she\u2019d wake up to the smell of bread. She shifted the box and fumbled in her pocket for the keys.</p><p>The door to 3C opened, and there stood Levi Cooper in uniform. His forehead crinkled in a frown. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Blue leaped over to Chief Grouchy and dropped the ball. When Levi didn\u2019t understand, the dog picked the ball up again and dropped it. Repeated, not caring that Levi was staring at Faith like a python eyeing a mouse. Whatever little bonding nanosecond they\u2019d had at the shooting range was obviously a figment of her imagination.</p><p>\u201cLevi. What a lovely surprise. Are we neighbors?\u201d Faith kept her tone bright and chirpy, but a blush was prickling its way up her chest. Granted, housing options were limited\u2014the Opera House was the only apartment building in town, but come on.</p><p>\u201cAre you moving in?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell that? It\u2019s astonishing. How did you know? Here, hold this.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer, just shoved the box at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re psychic. Thrilling, really. You should stop scowling. You\u2019ll need Botox before you know it.\u201d</p><p>Blue was still dropping and redropping the ball, trying to clue in the dopey human. Faith had the door open now and reclaimed the box. \u201cSee you around, neighbor.\u201d</p><p>She went into the cute little apartment, set the box down and then looked out the peephole. He was gone.</p><p>So Levi Cooper lived in 3C. That was okay. Free country and all that. They\u2019d probably never see each other. Which was fine. Okay, yes, they\u2019d see each other sometimes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that.</p><p>Blue was sniffing the corners. The dog had a point. This was their new place, at least for a while; Sharon had let her do a month-to-month rental, since some income was better than no income.</p><p>And the apartment was lovely. The floors were the original, narrow birch planks, soulfully scuffed from a hundred and fifty years of use, now polished to a high gloss. The actual theater part of the opera house was on the fifth floor; Faith imagined the third floor had been a workspace for set-making or costume storage or the like. From the front windows, not only could she inhale the glorious smells coming from the bakery, but she also had a glimpse of Keuka and a very nice view of the green.</p><p>The kitchen had granite countertops and an island, as well as a built-in wine rack. There was a tiny study where she could set up her computer and stalk potential mates for both her father and herself. And work, of course. In addition to the barn and the library courtyard, she\u2019d had a request for a design from another vineyard across the lake, and two private homes.</p><p>The door opened and in came Goggy, holding a tiny box, and Levi, holding two much larger ones. \u201cLook who I found!\u201d Goggy crowed. \u201cLevi Cooper, our chief of police!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is, Goggy,\u201d Faith said. \u201cThanks, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, setting the boxes on the table. \u201cAnything else I can do, ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve been wonderful!\u201d Goggy said. \u201cHasn\u2019t he been wonderful, Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good day, then,\u201d he said, smiling at Goggy. Not her, of course. Then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this with me,\u201d Faith said, giving the old lady a hug.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I love being needed,\u201d her grandmother responded, her soft, wrinkled cheeks flushing a lovely shade of pink. \u201cThank you for asking me. I never had a girl, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d Faith\u2019s smile widened; Goggy often dropped well-known facts as if she was revealing them for the first time. \u201cSo you and Pops will be okay without me?\u201d</p><p>Goggy turned the hot water on and began filling the sink. She didn\u2019t believe in dishwashers. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was nice, having someone break up our routine.\u201d</p><p>Guilt cartwheeled merrily through Faith\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019ll stop in every day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to do that. I understand,\u201d Goggy said. She opened the first box and started setting glasses in the hot, soapy water. \u201cI envy you. I wouldn\u2019t mind having a nice new place like this and living by myself, either. Starting over.\u201d</p><p>Faith looked at her, surprised. Not something you\u2019d expect from an eighty-four-year-old woman. Or maybe it was exactly what you\u2019d expect.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like, being married for so long?\u201d Faith asked, opening another box.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goggy said. \u201cSometimes I feel like your grandfather has no idea who I am. I\u2019m sure he thinks he learned everything there was to know in the first week we were married, and there\u2019s been nothing new since. But there is! Sometimes I want to tell him about a book I\u2019ve read or something someone said in church, and he barely listens.\u201d</p><p>Faith made a sympathetic noise. \u201cYou got married when you were so young,\u201d she said. Her grands had known each other only a month before they got married. Back when you did stuff like that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d Goggy said.</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve fallen in love right away.\u201d</p><p>Goggy snorted. \u201cHardly, sweetheart. He had land, we had a little money, he\u2019d just come back from the service, and our families approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>Goggy\u2019s face hardened. \u201cWhat\u2019s love, anyway?\u201d She scrubbed a glass so hard Faith feared for its future.</p><p>\u201cWant to sit down, Goggy?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cLet\u2019s have some coffee and talk.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother looked at her, her eyes soft. \u201cThat\u2019d be nice, honey. No one thinks I have much to say these days. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Faith made the coffee, grateful for the Keurig and its speed. She set Goggy\u2019s cup down in front of her and sat down next to her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cI was engaged to a boy who died in the war,\u201d Goggy said, and Faith choked, she was so surprised. Goggy patted her idly on the back. \u201cHis name was Peter. Peter Horton.\u201d</p><p>Peter, Goggy said, was the boy from down the street, the milkman\u2019s son. His mother was British, which made him seem very glamorous. They\u2019d had an understanding\u2014Peter would go off to war, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what people did back then, Faith, no matter if you were rich or poor. Even Hollywood actors went to war.\u201d Upon his return, they\u2019d marry.</p><p>He died in France, and Goggy hadn\u2019t much cared much after that. John Holland, why not? She did want to have children. And there weren\u2019t so many options for women back then.</p><p>\u201cBut I still think of him, Faith,\u201d Goggy said now, her voice quiet and gentle. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019ll be doing laundry or going up the stairs, and I wonder if he\u2019d even recognize me. I wonder if we\u2019d have been happy. I think we would have. He\u2019d bring me flowers he\u2019d picked in a field, and write me poems, and sneak looks at me in church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds wonderful,\u201d Faith said, wiping her eyes on a napkin. Her chest ached, knowing Goggy had once been so sweetly courted, so in love.</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d Goggy was quiet for a minute. \u201cYour grandfather, he never tried very hard. I was a done deal.\u201d Goggy glanced at Faith and reached over to squeeze her hand. \u201cSo I understand how you must feel about Jeremy, in some ways. The love of your life won\u2019t be the man you end up with, and you\u2019ll always compare the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope not,\u201d Faith said. \u201cBut, Goggy, I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s such a sad story. Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants to hear an old lady\u2019s stories.\u201d Goggy sighed and then rose to her feet with surprising vigor. \u201cLet\u2019s get cleaning. This place looks well enough on the surface, but those cabinets could be hiding a world of germs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FAITH WOKE UP AT THREE in the morning with an idea.</p><p>The first event at the Barn at Blue Heron would be an anniversary party for her grandparents. She could have the place done in time, or at least mostly, and she\u2019d organize a big party for them, and maybe Goggy and Pops would remember some good times. Some love. Surely you couldn\u2019t be married for six and a half decades and not love your spouse.</p><p>Poor Goggy. How hard it must\u2019ve been, moving on from that idyllic love to something so utilitarian with Pops, wondering what life would\u2019ve been like if Peter had come home from the war. Dad, too, faced with so many days without Mom, his life so different from the one he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>She wished she could call Jeremy, hear his kind voice. Maybe her grandmother was right...she\u2019d never find someone to love who measured up to her first love. Just like Goggy. Just like Dad.</p> <p>Crap. She seemed to be crying a little.</p><p>Blue gave a soft snort, then wagged his tail in his sleep. The moonlight was sweetly unfamiliar, cutting into her room in slices of cool white. From the kitchen came the sound of the refrigerator cycling on. Otherwise, it was quiet.</p><p>She may as well get up, check the production schedule for the barn. She padded barefoot to her office, Blue following dutifully, his ball in his mouth, then flopped down at her feet as she sat at her desk, as if they\u2019d lived here for years instead of hours. Faith rubbed her foot through his thick fur, earning a croon of appreciation from the beastie.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t be too lonely with a dog. That was for sure. Faith turned on her computer, then noticed something.</p><p>The apartment smelled like chocolate.</p> <p>Now, that was nice. And a little odd. Maybe the bakery was opening already? As the computer warmed up, Faith went to the front windows to check. Nope, Lorelei\u2019s windows were dark.</p><p>She went to the door and opened it a crack. The hall was dark, but there was a band of light coming from under the door of 3C, and the smell of chocolate was stronger here. Blue poked his head out, too, and licked his chops.</p><p>Levi was baking.</p><p>Baking at 3:17 in the morning.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>TWO WEEKS LATER, all Levi wanted was to get into his apartment without Faith\u2019s big dog leg-humping him in the hall, pour himself a beer and watch the Yankees win. It had been a very long couple of days; he was trying to train Everett, but the kid had a mind like a sieve. Nevertheless, Levi was letting him be in charge tonight, no matter how unsettling the thought was.</p> <p>\u201cYou call me if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re not sure about, okay?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd you keep that gun holstered. If I hear you took it out without my direct consent, you\u2019re fired. I don\u2019t care who your mother is.\u201d</p><p>Everett beamed. \u201cRoger, Chief. Don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d He put his feet up on the desk, missed and fell out of his chair.</p><p>Levi suppressed a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll check in later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a control freak, did anyone ever tell you that?\u201d Emmaline said as she pulled on her raincoat. On her desk was a book entitled Taking Control of Your Life: How to Change a Dead-End Job into the Career of Your Dreams.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a new job, Em?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLooking to get yours.\u201d She gave him one of her classic looks, half amused, half irritated.</p><p>Levi held the door for her, then bent his head against the foul weather. Even though it was only October, it had gotten cold all of a sudden, and the earlier rain had turned to sleet. The sidewalk was already slick. Lucky for him, his commute was roughly fifty yards. He walked with Emmaline, who lived right across the way in a pretty little bungalow next to the library. There was some work going on there\u2014right. Faith Holland was doing something to the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cThanks for walking me home. Now go. Get away. Leave me. Shoo,\u201d Emmaline said as she unlocked the door. \u201cAnd don\u2019t obsess over Everett. He needs experience, and if you keep hovering over him like a worried mother, he\u2019ll never learn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you thought of running for president?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have, but I don\u2019t photograph well. Try to have a good night, Chief.\u201d</p><p>A night alone. It should be something he looked forward to. Sarah had shown up Tuesday night, claiming to be sick. Homesick, yes, but physically sick, no. Plus, she\u2019d hitchhiked. With a cop for a brother! Said her car hadn\u2019t started, so she\u2019d gotten a ride with the Hostess deliveryman. This had required Levi to lecture her on the dangers of that and the idiocy of saying she didn\u2019t want to go to college. \u201cWhat are you gonna do if you stay here?\u201d he\u2019d asked sharply as he\u2019d driven her home the next morning. \u201cWait tables? Be a bartender up at one of the vineyards? Don\u2019t you want more, Sarah?\u201d She\u2019d answered by staring out the window, tears leaking out of her eyes, making him feel like an utter shit. She hadn\u2019t even said goodbye when he\u2019d pulled up in front of her dorm.</p><p>Then there\u2019d been a wreck on Route 54...no fatality, but for the grace of God\u2014Josh Deiner, the same kid who\u2019d gotten Abby Vanderbeek drunk. The wreck had resulted in the kid losing his license, which brought on a huge hissy fit\u2014he was a rich kid, not used to the rules applying to him.</p><p>And then there was Faith Holland, living across the hall from him. It was...distracting. He\u2019d only seen her a few times, but each time, it seemed harder to shake off.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chief! Nasty night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lorelei called as she locked the front door of the bakery.</p><p>\u201cIt is. You be careful on the roads, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d She beamed, then dug her car keys out of her giant purple purse. He waited till she got in her car, then watched as she drove up the street. She fishtailed slightly as she turned, but she only lived about a mile out of the village, not up the Hill, where conditions would be worse.</p><p>He opened the door to the Opera House. If there was an accident tonight, he\u2019d definitely have to go out; Ev wasn\u2019t up for handling that yet. That being said, Levi hadn\u2019t had more than two nights off in a row since he was hired.</p><p>Maybe Nina\u2019s leaving wasn\u2019t such a mystery, after all.</p><p>He pushed the thought from his mind. His wife hadn\u2019t left because he\u2019d worked too much; she\u2019d left him because she was an adrenaline-junkie chopper pilot.</p><p>Levi opened the ornate brass mailbox\u2014bills, a movie from Netflix\u2014then headed upstairs. Faith\u2019s door was open, and he hesitated, almost hoping she\u2019d come out and...hell, do what, he didn\u2019t know. It just seemed like a long night in front of him all of a sudden.</p><p>Something pressed against his leg. Blue, the big dope. \u201cGo home, pal,\u201d he told him.</p><p>He went into his apartment, only to have the dog head-butt the door, probably hoping for some special time with his leg. Levi changed into a flannel shirt and jeans, putting his uniform in the hamper. Life in the military had made him become a little obsessive about neatness, something his mom and Sarah had found quite funny, as he\u2019d been the typical teenage slob before. Not anymore. The apartment was neat as a pin, especially now that Sarah was away. He always cleaned her room after she left, since God knew she wouldn\u2019t make a bed on her own.</p><p>He called Lorelei; she\u2019d made it home just fine, but, yes, it was slick out, and he was an angel for checking on her.</p><p>Levi hung up, then opened the fridge, took out a bottle of Newton\u2019s Pale Ale and surveyed his dinner options. Lots of leftovers; cooking for one wasn\u2019t easy. Plus, there was a vat of sauce and meatballs; he\u2019d made it for Sarah on Tuesday, since that was her favorite. Just because he didn\u2019t want her to drop out of college didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t love his little sis.</p><p>There was the thud against the door. Blue again. Beautiful dog, but dumb as a fern. The dog was whining now. Another thud.</p><p>Levi opened the door and stared down at the dog. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Blue looked up and whined.</p><p>\u201cHolland, your dog\u2019s out,\u201d Levi said. Her door was still wide open.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d He went into her apartment. \u201cHolland, you here? Oh, shit.\u201d</p><p>Faith was standing at the kitchen counter, plucking at her sweater. She looked confused.</p><p>If memory served, she was about to have a seizure.</p><p>\u201cFaith? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn. The dog barked once, and Faith crumpled. Levi yanked her toward him so her head wouldn\u2019t hit the counter and eased her onto the floor. She was already jerking, poor kid, muscles stiff, jaw clenched. He turned her on her side in case she threw up. Her eyes were open and vacant, and out of reflex, Levi looked at his watch. 18:34:17. Time the seizure in case it lasted more than five minutes, that was protocol. He wasn\u2019t an EMT for nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d seen Faith have a seizure four or five times in school. Somehow, it was scarier now that he was the adult in charge. Her fingers were splayed and rigid, her back arching with the force of the spasms.</p><p>Blue paced back and forth, panting and whining. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, buddy,\u201d Levi said, his hand on Faith\u2019s shoulder as her arms and legs spasmed. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>18:34:42. Still seizing. What else should he say? Speak reassuringly to the victim, the nurse used to say, and the whole class knew who the victim was. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, Faith,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>18:35:08. \u201cDoing great, Holland. Don\u2019t worry. Your dog is here.\u201d Well, that was dumb. \u201cMe, too. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>It was oddly quiet, the seizure, just the sound of her shoes rubbing against the floor, the sleet pattering against the window, the sound of her hard breathing. \u201cHang in there, Faith.\u201d</p><p>Shit. It couldn\u2019t be fun, having your body and brain rebel against you like this. Her muscles were tight and clenched under his hand, her right arm out in front of her face as if shielding herself from a blow. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart. Almost done.\u201d Not that he knew anything.</p><p>18:35:42. Maybe he should call her dad. As a member of the volunteer fire department, Levi knew there wasn\u2019t anything a call to 911 would do; they\u2019d give her oxygen, which did more to make them feel better than because she needed it. No, she was breathing fine, if hard. No blueness to her face or lips. Dr. Buckthal had done an in-service for Emergency Services last year\u2014Marcus Shrade had a TBI from a car accident, and had grand mals a few times a year. The doc said a seizure would end when it ended. Hopefully soon. Helluva way to get a workout.</p><p>Okay, she was stopping. 18:36:04. Her arms and legs stilled, and he could feel the tension start to seep out of her, see her practically sink into the floor as the misfirings in her brain stopped and allowed her muscles to relax. Blue lay down next to her and put his head on her leg.</p><p>\u201cFaith? You okay?\u201d He smoothed some hair off her face. She wasn\u2019t shaking anymore, but she was still out of it. Postictal, that was the word, staring straight ahead. The dog\u2019s tail started thumping. \u201cYou\u2019re in your apartment, Holland. You had a seizure, but you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d She blinked and swallowed but didn\u2019t answer. He fished his phone out of his pocket and found the Hollands\u2019 number on it. \u201cHey, John, it\u2019s Levi Cooper. Listen, sir, Faith just had a seizure. Lasted about ninety seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the whole thing?\u201d John asked, his voice sharp with concern.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Anything in particular I should do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she awake now?\u201d</p><p>Levi saw that he was stroking Faith\u2019s hair, the red strands impossibly silky. \u201cFaith? How you doing?\u201d She swallowed and looked up at him. \u201cYour dad\u2019s on the phone. You want to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cMy dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She\u2019s coming around, sir.\u201d He held the phone to Faith\u2019s ear, and she reached up, her arm wobbling a little.</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy,\u201d she said. \u201cUm...I...I don\u2019t know.\u201d She closed her eyes and frowned. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I think Levi...I don\u2019t know. Okay. Here he is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Levi took the phone back. \u201cAnything I should do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming right down,\u201d her father said.</p><p>\u201cThe roads are pretty icy.\u201d He paused. \u201cI can stay with her, or take her to the hospital, if you think she should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go anywhere,\u201d Faith muttered. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s tired,\u201d Levi added.</p><p>John sighed into the phone. \u201cHow bad are the roads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad enough to stay put. What does she need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nap. Someone to keep an eye on her. That usually does the trick. Damn, she hasn\u2019t had one of these in a long time.\u201d</p><p>Faith seemed to be sleeping. \u201cI can stay with her for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI live right across the hall.\u201d</p> <p>Her father hesitated. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, sir.\u201d</p><p>John sighed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019d appreciate that. If you could call me when she wakes up, that\u2019d be great. Generally, she sleeps for a little while, seems a little groggy, but otherwise, she\u2019s fine. She probably missed a few doses of her medication. But if she seizes again, call me right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. I\u2019ll check in later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, son. You\u2019re a good kid.\u201d</p><p>Levi put his phone on the counter. \u201cFaith? You awake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she said without opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna pick you up, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to lose fifteen pounds first.\u201d</p><p>He felt the start of a smile. \u201cI can manage.\u201d He slid his arms under her and lifted her up. Okay, she wasn\u2019t a wisp of a thing, she had a point. She sure smelled good, though, sweet and warm. Her head settled against his shoulder, her hair brushing his chin.</p><p>The dog trotted into another room, tail waving, and Levi followed. Set her down on the unmade bed and took off her shoes. \u201cThanks, Levi,\u201d she murmured, her voice distant.</p><p>He pulled the covers over her. Blue jumped up and put his head on her hip. Faith reached out to pet him without opening her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be out here if you need me,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her eyes were closed, lashes a dark smudge against her cheeks.</p><p>Levi reached out to smooth her hair again, but he stopped himself. She was awake now. Sort of.</p> <p>He went into her living room; her apartment was more or less the same as his, minus one bedroom. Unlike his, though, hers looked...homey, which was strange, because she was just back for a little while, so far as he knew. Nevertheless, one wall had been painted fire-engine red, and there was a red-and-purple throw on the couch. A bookcase held a couple dozen books, some photos and keepsakes. A women\u2019s magazine was open on the coffee table, as well as a giant red mug with a sunflower painted on it. Her kitchen counter held a vase of yellow flowers. The wine rack was filled, he noted. As it would be, if your family owned a vineyard.</p><p>A gust of wind sent sleet crackling against the window, making him jump a little. It always surprised him, how innocent a gun could sound, like firecrackers. Or sleet.</p><p>Time to be useful. He picked up her cup and went to the kitchen. The dishwasher was full of clean dishes. Taking care to be quiet, he unloaded it, figuring out where things went, then wiped down her counters. Folded the blanket on her couch. Turned on the TV, found the YES Network, saw that the Yanks\u2019 game had been canceled due to rain. Clicked around for a little while, then turned the TV off. Pulled out his phone and called Everett.</p><p>\u201cHow are things going, Ev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Chief! Um, we had one call asking for help on how to put the battery into a smoke detector\u2014that was Methalia Lewis, and lucky for me, I have the same kind, so I was able to walk her through it just fine, Chief.\u201d</p><p>The pride in Everett\u2019s voice was obvious. \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chief!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else comes up, just give me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief Cooper. Over and out.\u201d</p><p>Seemed like the good people of Manningsport had exhibited some excellent common sense thus far and stayed off the roads tonight.</p><p>He looked in at Faith, who was sleeping with her arm around the dog. She might be hungry when she woke up. Going back to the kitchen, he checked her fridge. A bottle of white wine, an open Pepperidge Farm chocolate cake box, a roll of Pillsbury Dough cinnamon rolls, and a jar of artichokes. Cooking wasn\u2019t her thing, apparently. He went back to his apartment, grabbed the container of meatballs and sauce, as well as a box of linguine, and took it back to Faith\u2019s. She\u2019d been asleep for about an hour now.</p><p>What to do. Levi drifted over to the bookcase. There was a sock monkey with pink button eyes and a pink bow. A little red vase, a tiny metal chicken. He couldn\u2019t, for the life of him, imagine collecting such clutter. A Derek Jeter bobblehead. Here was a framed photo of her family at Pru and Carl\u2019s wedding. Looked like Faith had been the flower girl\u2014she was maybe nine or ten in the picture, holding a bouquet of flowers. Pru looked the same, except for some gray hair, and Carl did, too, though he\u2019d thickened over the years. Mrs. Holland had been a knockout, same red hair as Faith, smiling at the bride, her arm around her husband. Jack looked sheepish, Honor pretty. A Golden retriever sat obediently next to Faith.</p><p>He put the photo down and went onto the next one. Faith and a friend in front of the Golden Gate Bridge on a foggy day, both of them laughing. Another showed Faith in work boots and jeans and a flannel shirt, standing in front of a fountain.</p><p>And here was a photo of her and Jeremy. The two of them at the beach, arms around each other. Interesting that she kept that on display.</p><p>He put the photo down and saw her next keepsake\u2014a glass bowl of white beach stones. There, on top, was a little chunk of rose quartz, no bigger than a nickel and shaped roughly like a heart. He frowned, then picked it up and held it to the light.</p><p>\u201cSomeone gave me that after my mom died. Left it in my locker at school.\u201d</p><p>Faith had changed into some pajama pants (red with Dalmatian puppies all over them) and a Blue Heron sweatshirt.</p><p>Blue bounded over to him and tried to mount his leg. \u201cBlue, get off,\u201d Faith commanded, and the dog obeyed.</p><p>Levi put the rock down. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and tilted her head. \u201cI\u2019m okay. A little groggy. So I had a seizure, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks reddened. \u201cSorry you had to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be glad, Holland. You could\u2019ve hit your head on the counter if it weren\u2019t for me.\u201d He folded his arms and raised his eyebrows expectantly.</p><p>She gave a little smile. \u201cWow. A hero yet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, your dog came to get me. Kept head-butting the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Faith knelt down and opened her arms, and the dog bounced over to lick her face. \u201cBlue! You\u2019re such a good boy! Good dog!\u201d She kissed him on the head and looked up at Levi, grinning. \u201cTechnically, he\u2019s a therapy dog, but he\u2019s never been put to the test. I guess he\u2019s got more going on than I thought. Yes, you do, Mr. Blue! You\u2019re brilliant!\u201d</p><p>She looked so...happy. Bright as a new penny, his mom used to say, and the saying seemed to fit. Levi cleared his throat and looked away. \u201cSo all this stuff... Are you staying?\u201d he asked, gesturing at her bookcase.</p><p>\u201cMy roomie sent me a box of stuff. It may be a sign that her honey\u2019s moving in for good. And some of that is from my dad\u2019s house. The books and stuff.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t answered the question. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I brought dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA multitalented babysitter.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>A distant warning bell clanged somewhere in his brain. Faith\u2019s hair was tangled, makeup smudged under her eyes. The baggy sweatshirt wasn\u2019t doing her any favors\u2014gave her the same shape as a side of beef, and somehow she radiated sex all the same.</p><p>\u201cCall your father,\u201d he ordered, going back into the kitchen to start the water for pasta.</p><p>It was impossible not to overhear. \u201cHi, Daddy, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, and he wondered if girls ever outgrew the need to call their fathers Daddy instead of plain old Dad.</p><p>For about a week, Nina had thought she might be pregnant, though they hadn\u2019t planned on it, and Levi was surprised at how happy the idea had made him. Pictured a daughter right away. But it had been a false alarm, and when Levi had suggested maybe they should toss the birth control and give it a try for real, she\u2019d clammed up. Informed him of her re-enlistment two weeks later.</p><p>\u201cI feel great, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Faith was saying. \u201cI know, I know. I forgot to get it refilled, but it was a day or two at most...I know, Dad, I\u2019m really sorry. No, don\u2019t come down, it\u2019s nasty out there. Good thing the grapes are in, huh? Yeah, he\u2019s here. Sure. Love you, too.\u201d She padded into the kitchen and handed the phone to Levi. \u201cHe wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi, I was wondering if you could possibly keep an eye on her tonight,\u201d John said, the worry in his voice from earlier still present. \u201cShe skipped her medication for a couple of days, and if she has another seizure, she shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>Levi hesitated. The warning bell clanged again. \u201cSure. No problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to ask you this, but you\u2019re right, the roads are a sheet of ice. I tried to get down the driveway and slid right off onto the lawn.\u201d</p><p>In a truck with bald tires that had last been serviced in the \u201990s, most likely. \u201cDon\u2019t come out, sir. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>John sighed. \u201cI owe you one. Kids. They age you. Okay, Levi. Thanks again.\u201d</p><p>Levi hung up. \u201cLooks like my babysitting gig just got extended. We\u2019re having a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her face went bright red. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay, Levi. Really. I\u2019m fine. I missed my meds for two days, but I\u2019m back on them, I\u2019ll be fine. See? They\u2019re right here.\u201d She opened a cabinet and shook a prescription bottle at him. \u201cYou can go home. I\u2019ve never had two seizures on the same day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>She gave a huffy sigh. \u201cFine, bossy. Want some wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to cake or cinnamon rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChief Cooper! Have you been snooping in my fridge?\u201d She grinned again. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I\u2019d do the same at your place. What people have in their refrigerators says a lot about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I bet yours is immaculate. The four food groups, leftovers put in matching Tupperware.\u201d</p><p>He stirred the meatballs and sauce. \u201cYou\u2019re correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? It matches your anal-retentive personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does yours say about you? You\u2019ve got a half-eaten cake in there, wine, rolls from a can and an unopened jar of artichokes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt says I go out a lot, make the occasional bad choice, enjoy life and live spontaneously. Do you want wine or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Come on, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>They sat at her kitchen table, Blue shooting them hopeful glances, his head on his paws. \u201cThanks for this, Levi,\u201d Faith said, glancing at him with another blush.</p><p>\u201cNothing better to do on a night like this.\u201d The words came out wrong. Her face flushed a deeper shade.</p><p>She took a bite of her food. \u201cDid it freak you out? Jack filmed me once, so I know what I look like.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a second, saw a little flash of worry in her eyes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me. Looks like it might be...uncomfortable, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Or if it is, I don\u2019t remember. They\u2019re...blank spots.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So she wouldn\u2019t remember that he\u2019d called her \u201csweetheart.\u201d That was probably a good thing.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything more, other than to compliment him on the meatballs. The sleet and wind kept up, and while it had made him a little jumpy before, it now felt...safe.</p><p>When he and Faith had been in sixth grade, they\u2019d had this really crappy science teacher. Mr. Ormand, was it? The guy hated kids. Every day, he\u2019d single out a student and just eviscerate the kid, mocking him or her for getting an answer wrong or missing a step in the lab. Didn\u2019t matter if you were getting a D or an A; if a kid was smart, he\u2019d mock that, too. \u201cI guess we know everything, don\u2019t we, Miss Ames? You must be a genius! Class, we have a genius among us! Isn\u2019t it thrilling?\u201d</p><p>Then one day, Faith had raised her hand and asked about studying for an upcoming science test, and Mr. Ormand had said something like, \u201cPerhaps you could read the textbook, Miss Holland? Perhaps that might help?\u201d his voice dripping with customary sarcasm. And much to the shock of everyone, Faith had snapped back in the exact same tone, \u201cOr perhaps you could actually teach, Mr. Ormand? Instead of sitting there complaining about how dumb we are?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019d been a collective gasp, and Faith was ordered to the principal\u2019s office. But as she\u2019d left the room, Levi had muttered, \u201cNice job, Holland,\u201d and winked. She\u2019d looked at him, and he\u2019d have thought she\u2019d be scared, getting in trouble for the first time that he could recall. But instead, she\u2019d grinned, and for that second, he\u2019d thought maybe Faith had a little bit of bad in her. Maybe she wasn\u2019t quite the Goody Two-Shoes she always seemed. Also, she already had boobs. Just another thing to appreciate.</p><p>Not long after, Faith\u2019s mother had died in a horrific accident. The guidance counselor had come in and told them not to ask questions, but Faith\u2019s father had wanted to make sure everyone knew she\u2019d been in the car, had had a seizure and mercifully didn\u2019t remember anything.</p><p>When their homeroom teacher had instructed them to write her a note, Levi couldn\u2019t. What did you say to a kid who woke up trapped in a car with the broken, lifeless body of her mom? \u201cSorry?\u201d Everything had sounded pathetically small. The teacher had glared at him, so he\u2019d scrawled a few lines on a piece of paper, surreptitiously stuffed the note into his pocket and passed in a blank page instead.</p><p>When Faith had come back to school after a few weeks, she was a ghost of the cute girl who\u2019d sassed their mean teacher. She\u2019d been popular before, but her mother\u2019s death shot that into the red zone. Everyone had flocked around her, fighting to be the one to sit next to her, to give her their Twinkies or have her come over to their house after school and pick her first to be on their team in gym class.</p><p>Levi had done none of those things. Hadn\u2019t gone to her mom\u2019s wake, hadn\u2019t picked her for his team, hadn\u2019t said he was sorry. For some reason, he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d just...ignored her. He\u2019d been an adolescent boy, not an age group famed for emotional insight.</p> <p>But one day when he\u2019d been fishing in the stream behind the trailer park, he\u2019d spied something gleaming on the shore. He\u2019d brought it to school the next day, and then, after he\u2019d wrangled a detention from Mr. Ormand for not passing in homework, when the halls were empty and Levi was the only one around, he\u2019d taken the little treasure from his pocket, wrapped it in a scrap of rough brown paper towel and shoved the rose quartz rock through the air vent in Faith\u2019s locker.</p><p>A rock she\u2019d kept for almost twenty years.</p><p>There was an odd pressure in his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou want to watch TV?\u201d he asked, clearing her plate.</p><p>\u201cSure. Maybe a movie? Netflix came today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA zombie movie. Supposed to be very gory.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t all be romantic comedies.\u201d</p><p>If Levi wasn\u2019t mistaken, Netflix had just sent a very gory zombie movie to his mailbox today. \u201cSounds good,\u201d he said, tidying the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a great housekeeper,\u201d she commented, settling onto the couch with her blanket.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to babysitter and chef, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She smiled at him again as he sat in the blue chair, feeling a little awkward, at least at first. But Faith was a movie talker, it turned out, and didn\u2019t need him to carry on an entire conversation. \u201cThat girl only looks dead. Ten bucks she bites the cute cop. And there you go. Ten bucks, Levi. Oh, come on now. He\u2019s hiding under the bed? Has he never seen a horror flick? They always find you there.\u201d</p><p>And as the sleet pattered against the windows, eventually changing to rain, and as the zombies killed everyone in great sprays of blood and fire, Levi couldn\u2019t help thinking this was one of the best nights he\u2019d had in a long time.</p> <p>WHEN FAITH WOKE UP in the morning, Blue was not the only one in the room with her.</p><p>Levi Cooper, police chief and babysitter extraordinaire, was sitting in the chair next to her bed. He\u2019d taken Dad at his word; though she\u2019d argued and yes, whined a little, he\u2019d dragged the chair in here nonetheless and kept watch, ever the good soldier.</p><p>A tired soldier, too. He was asleep, his head tipped back against the chair, arms folded. And what arms they were. Her girl parts purred as she stared. The lower half of a tattoo showed where the thick muscle curved\u201410th Mountain Division. His dark blond hair was rumpled, sticking up in front a little bit.</p><p>Oh, man. Levi Cooper was really, really...hot. She\u2019d managed to put that out of her head for quite a long time now. For more than a decade, she hadn\u2019t allowed even one thought about his hotness, and really, how had she avoided it? The Man. Was. Delicious.</p><p>Even in sleep, his face held a slight scowl. But his eyelashes were straight and long and unexpectedly sweet, and his mouth was...yeah, okay, that was a nice mouth, full and sulky, and really, she should not be thinking these thoughts. He\u2019d seen her in full blown seizure mode\u2014oh, hemorrhoid\u2014and he\u2019d been nice enough to do her a favor (or do her father a favor, if you wanted to be technical). So fixating on his hotness...that was a one-way ticket. Because she knew what she looked like during a seizure (thank you, older brother): like one of the zombies from last night, stiff and jerking, possibly drooling for that extra dose of sex appeal, eyes wide and scared, snorty little pig noises thrown in for flair.</p><p>Faith looked at Blue, who was eyeing her from his half of the bed. \u201cStay,\u201d she whispered, then slipped out from under the sheets. She went into her bathroom and started at her reflection, flinching a little. Hair matted, crustiness in one eye, mascara smudged, a crease running down one cheek courtesy of her pillowcase. She pulled her hair into a ponytail and washed her face mercilessly, then brushed her teeth. There. At least she was clean now. Oh, the sweatshirt. Nice touch. And let\u2019s not forget the doggie pajamas. One could practically hear the bass of p**n o music pulsing.</p><p>Well. It was Levi, after all. He wouldn\u2019t be thinking p**n o, not with her.</p><p>It was funny; she hadn\u2019t had a witnessed seizure for a long time. Two times, she\u2019d had them in Jeremy\u2019s presence, that first time when he\u2019d carried her to the nurse, and another time, when he\u2019d been visiting her in college. He\u2019d always treated her like a spun-sugar fairy princess, almost like her epilepsy made her more attractive (which she hadn\u2019t really minded, to be honest).</p><p>But Levi...it didn\u2019t seem to sway Levi one way or the other. He could\u2019ve made her feel like an idiot last night, and he was gifted in that department, after all. But for some reason, last night had been oddly...fun.</p><p>\u201cRight, Faith,\u201d she muttered to her reflection. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have seizures more often, huh? The entr\u00e9e to a good time\u2014epilepsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay in there?\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of Levi\u2019s voice. \u201cYes! I\u2019m fine. Thank you! Out in a sec.\u201d Pulling her hair out of the ponytail, she fluffed it, then rolled her eyes at herself. Kind of a lost cause at the moment.</p><p>She opened the door to find him standing there. \u201cDo you always eavesdrop on women in the bathroom?\u201d she asked, inching into the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling all right?\u201d he repeated, glancing at his watch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks again, Levi. I\u2019ll tell my dad what a good boy you were.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her, but maybe there was a gleam of amusement there. No smile, of course. This was Levi Cooper, after all. \u201cSee you around,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you again. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, just stared at her impassively.</p><p>Then he closed the small distance between them and kissed her.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have believed it if there wasn\u2019t proof, but nope, no, he was definitely kissing her, his lips firm and, oh, wow, really good at what they were doing, and his big, bulging manly arms slid around her, pulling her against his solid, warm frame. One hand cupped the back of her head, his fingers sliding into her hair, and Faith\u2019s mouth opened in a bit of shock, and holy moly, he was frenching her, tasting her, and she melted against him in a purely primal\u2014oh, yes, primal\u2014reaction. Her arms slid around his lean waist, hands sliding up the smooth, hard muscles of his back, his skin hot under the thin cotton of his T-shirt, his mouth moving against hers.</p><p>Then the kiss was over, and she was panting in shaky gasps, as if she\u2019d run all the way up to the barn. Her eyes needed a second to focus, and her legs wobbled.</p><p>Levi did not look similarly affected. He blinked. Twice. \u201cI didn\u2019t see me doing that,\u201d he said, frowning down at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, you know...you could do it again,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, making it stand up even more.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was a bad idea. That was a mistake. I definitely shouldn\u2019t have done that. Sorry, Holland.\u201d</p><p>She just stared at him for a minute. Nope, he was serious. Dead serious, from his expression.</p><p>Men. Just...men! Was there ever going to be a normal man in her life? Huh?</p><p>\u201cOut you go,\u201d she said, shoving his hard chest. \u201cBye! Thank you for everything, you jerk. And you know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Get out.\u201d She hustled him to the door, opened it and waved. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Levi stepped into the hallway, and Blue bounded out as well, then attached himself to the horrible man\u2019s leg. As goes the slutty owner, so goes the slutty dog. \u201cBlue, get back here!\u201d she ordered. Her dog obeyed, and she took one more look at Levi\u2019s expressionless face. \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d</p><p>Then she slammed the door. Opened it and slammed it again, just in case he missed the point.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>THE GOOD NEWS WAS, the barn was going beautifully.</p><p>The arborist had come in and removed five trees, which opened up the view just enough. She\u2019d hired Crooked Lake Landscaping and a very cute Irish stonemason (married, sigh) to work on the parking area, a wall along the path and the retaining wall. Samuel Hastings, a Mennonite carpenter, and his son would build the deck that would extend out over the hill. The electric had been run, and things were clicking along.</p><p>Faith was doing a lot of the work herself. That wasn\u2019t usually the case; as the designer, most of her work was done at a computer, figuring out things like water runoff rates and soil retention. But this was Holland land, and the barn was her baby. Faith wanted to filter the dirt and help build the rock walls, dig holes and loosen root balls, and hear the sound of hammers ringing out over the hill.</p><p>She\u2019d been working a lot. At the library, studiously not looking across the green to the police station. At the other vineyard. Up here at the barn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As for Levi\u2014he\u2019d nodded at her three days ago as their paths crossed at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. She\u2019d glared; he\u2019d said nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo you must see Levi a lot,\u201d Jeremy said, practically reading her mind.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she answered, shoveling some gravel from a wheelbarrow to line the path that led to the barn\u2019s entrance. Jeremy had come up on his lunch hour, bearing a glorious Cubano sandwich from Lorelei\u2019s. Things were still a little awkward since their reunion, but, hell. He was such a good guy. And he brought food, so...</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cI thought you lived across the hall from each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do.\u201d Her tone must\u2019ve hinted at Panty Twist Supreme, because he didn\u2019t pursue the subject further.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be amazing,\u201d he said, gesturing with his own sandwich. \u201cI\u2019ve already told Georgia to start referring people here. We get a lot of requests for weddings, but you know. A tent is nothing compared to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, ba\u2014buddy.\u201d She\u2019d been about to say babe. Old habits.</p><p>He picked up the tennis ball and fired it into the woods, putting his quarterback arm to use. Blue bounded after the ball joyfully. Faith wondered if her pet remembered Jeremy, who could throw farther than anyone.</p><p>\u201cOne of my patients asked about you yesterday,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHe wants to surprise his wife with a water garden, and I told him that\u2019d be a piece of cake for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, hefting another shovelful of gravel and tamping it into the path. \u201cI hope he calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about staying here permanently?\u201d Jeremy asked. \u201cI imagine you\u2019d have clients by the dozen.\u201d He offered her some potato chips, and she took a few.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a month now, and it\u2019s hard to think about going back to California. I see my dad and the grands almost every day, have dinner with Pru and the kids once or twice a week. Colleen and I hang out all the time... I wonder how I lived without everyone for three years.\u201d</p><p>You included, she didn\u2019t add. But Jeremy\u2019s friendship, this new phase of it...that was becoming important, too.</p><p>\u201cBut I do have a very nice life back in San Francisco,\u201d she added. \u201cCan\u2019t just forget that. I pitched a job in August, and it\u2019s supposed to move forward soon. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy fired the ball into the woods again for the never-tired Blue. \u201cYou\u2019re different now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really...solid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPick another word, quick.\u201d She smiled as she spread another shovelful of gravel onto the path.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He grinned. \u201cConfident in who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter, better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind? You seem a little distracted.\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s on my mind, Jeremy. I may want to kill him. That, or handcuff him to the radiator, rip off his clothes with my teeth and have my way with the man. \u201cOh, just work stuff,\u201d she lied.</p><p>The memory of that kiss had been replayed roughly a thousand and eight times in Faith\u2019s brain, usually around three in the morning. Twice in the week that had passed, the smell of chocolate had crept into her apartment, and it was maddening. So close and yet so far, across the hall and baking. Way too adorable an image to pursue. Almost as adorable as the sight of him sitting by her bed, asleep, all rumpled hair and long eyelashes and beautiful arms.</p><p>This was her problem: falling for emotionally unavailable men. For one night, Levi had been nice to her, one lousy (well, okay, one excellent) kiss, and yes, her panties were in a snarl.</p><p>She dug into the gravel with more strength than was necessary. Call it a workout.</p> <p>\u201cI heard you and Colleen went to a singles thing,\u201d Jeremy said. He hesitated. \u201cAre you...interested? In dating somebody here, I mean. Or maybe you\u2019re seeing someone already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nope. I\u2019m not. Not even a little.\u201d Okay, she didn\u2019t have to be so emphatic. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, throwing the ball for Blue once more, \u201cmaybe this is just me trying to soothe my conscience, but...think you\u2019d like to be fixed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d she said instantly.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jeremy asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. How well do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that well. He\u2019s my accountant.\u201d Jeremy paused. \u201cHe\u2019s very good-looking. And honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSold! Give me his number, I\u2019ll call him right now.\u201d</p><p>Blinking a little, Jeremy passed over his phone.</p><p>Five minutes later, Faith had a date for that very night. Maybe this guy wouldn\u2019t be g*y, married or view kissing her as a huge mistake.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t that be a nice change.</p><p>SHE AND BLUE STOPPED at the Old House, regretting it the second she walked into her grandparents\u2019 back hall. \u201cIt\u2019s coo-pon,\u201d Goggy was saying, her voice laced with steel.</p><p>\u201cI like cue-pon,\u201d Pops said defiantly. Oh, lordy. Perhaps Faith could sneak out, undetected. She glanced down at Blue, whose doggy brow wrinkled at the sound of the bickering grands.</p><p>\u201cWe never said it like that before,\u201d Goggy said. \u201cWhy are you changing it now? You sound ridiculous. It\u2019s so pretentious.\u201d Faith turned to leave, stealthy as a ninja.</p><p>\u201cCue-pon,\u201d Pops said. \u201cFaithie-bear, is that you? Come on in, honey!\u201d</p><p>Busted. \u201cHi, guys! Oh, cookies! Can I have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Goggy said. \u201cTake three. Sweetheart, how do you say coupon? Hmm? It\u2019s coo-pon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it said both ways,\u201d Faith said, opting to play Switzerland in this horribly important discussion. Moving out had definitely been the right choice. She took a bite of the cookie. Oh, yeah. Snickerdoodles. Three might not be enough.</p><p>\u201cSee, I\u2019m French Canadian,\u201d Pops said. \u201cWe say cue-pon up North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents came over from Utrecht! You had a great-uncle who lived in Quebec for a year. That doesn\u2019t make you French Canadian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCue-pon.\u201d Pops grinned, winking at Faith. The man was adorably evil. \u201cHow\u2019s the barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be rather gorgeous, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is, with you doing it.\u201d Goggy pushed the plate of cookies toward her. Her grandparents had flown out to see the dedication of the Douglas Street Park and been simultaneously stunned and smug at her work (as well as concerned about her throat being slit in the big city).</p><p>The phone rang, and Goggy hurtled to answer it. \u201cOh, Betty, hi,\u201d she said, taking the phone into the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo, Pops,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI was hoping to talk to you about your anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnniversary of what?\u201d he said, pouring some of the sauvignon blanc that had won the vineyard a silver medal last year.</p><p>\u201cYour wedding anniversary. It\u2019ll be sixty-five years next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd still I walk this earth, shackled to your grandmother by the chains of marriage.\u201d He winked and poured her a glass, as well. Cookies and wine...looked like those fifteen pounds wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, but you love her, of course,\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cLove, shmove,\u201d he answered. \u201cLove is for you young people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be married for sixty-five years and not love your wife?\u201d She smiled, hoping to encourage him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Pops said, giving a cookie to her dog, who swallowed it instantly. \u201cI\u2019m cursed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a horrible old man, that\u2019s what you are,\u201d she said, fixing his collar. \u201cAdmit it, Pops. You love Goggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love this wine, that\u2019s what I love. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>She took a sip. \u201cLemon, honeysuckle, a smidgeon of burnt marshmallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I thought your anniversary would be a great way to dedicate the barn. A Holland family event, and such a milestone. I know Goggy would love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to throw us an anniversary party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! The leaves will still be beautiful, we could invite all your friends and colleagues, and it\u2019d be a great way to have everyone see the new venue. The Barn at Blue Heron, the nice old Holland clan. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should get a Purple Heart and a week\u2019s vacation, alone, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the story of Goggy\u2019s tragic first love, Faith sighed. \u201cPops, I think it would mean a lot to Goggy. A long marriage is something to be proud of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr terrified of,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and Goggy deserves a special night. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t generally like that sort of fuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of fuss?\u201d Goggy asked, coming back into the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Pops grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m starving. It\u2019s ten after five already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was telling Pops,\u201d Faith said firmly, \u201cthat I thought it\u2019d be nice to throw you two an anniversary party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he think?\u201d Goggy said after a beat, as if her husband wasn\u2019t seated a foot away.</p><p>\u201cWho needs a party?\u201d Pops snorted. \u201cToo much money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Goggy said instantly. \u201cWhat a nice idea, sweetheart! Aren\u2019t you wonderful to think of it.\u201d She gave Pops a dirty look, then smiled at Faith. \u201cWant to stay for supper? You look too thin.\u201d</p><p>Oh, grandmothers! \u201cNo, Goggy, but thanks. I have to go, actually. I have a date.\u201d</p><p>This caused some coos of delight from Goggy, who felt she was owed more great-grandchildren, and fast, as well as some grumbles of warning from Pops about the evil natures of men.</p><p>Faith kissed them both, then headed for home. She was meeting Ryan Hill at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, which would allow Colleen to check out the guy, as well as allow Faith to get the nachos grande. Two birds, one stone, a possible husband.</p><p>But first, Faith thought as she came into the Village, a macchiato from Lorelei\u2019s. She tied Blue to the lamppost and went into the bakery, where she was immediately presented with the solid back of Manningsport\u2019s chief of police, who was just placing his order. \u201cMedium coffee, please, Lorelei. Cream, no sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Chief,\u201d Lorelei said with her customary smile.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want cream?\u201d Faith asked, a trifle loudly. Chief Asspain turned and gave her a four on the Boredom Scale\u2014What\u2019s your name again? Didn\u2019t stop her knees from giving a traitorous wobble. \u201cBecause you might think you want cream, but then you taste the coffee, and you decide you don\u2019t really like it, after all. Cream might be a bad idea. Or a big mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be,\u201d he said, giving her an odd look.</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re so decisive today, Levi! But are you sure? Because if you end up not liking the coffee, its feelings might be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you babbling about?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIndecision. Poor impulse control. Waffling.\u201d</p><p>The four grew to a six: I can\u2019t believe I still have to talk to you. Lorelei handed him his coffee. \u201cThere you go, Chief! Oh, hi, Faith, I didn\u2019t see you there! How are you? What would you like today?\u201d</p><p>Screw the coffee. Granted, she might go into sugar shock, but some fortification was called for. \u201cI\u2019ll have a chocolate croissant and a small hot chocolate, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a slab of chocolate cake with that?\u201d Levi suggested. \u201cMaybe a candy bar on the side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there criminals who need to be brought to justice somewhere, Levi? Hmm?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was still staring, his forehead slightly crinkled. \u201cIs this about the other day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat other day?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthat...moment...was a mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen love to hear that. No, really. It\u2019s so flattering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to flatter you. I\u2019m just telling you the truth. It was a blunder, and I regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up. I might swoon.\u201d</p><p>Lorelei was done and rang her up. Faith handed her a five. \u201cThanks, Lorelei,\u201d she said, taking her goodies. \u201cChief Cooper. Have a lovely day.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother answering, but his irritation was palpable.</p><p>It was deeply satisfying.</p> <p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>TWO HOURS LATER, Faith walked into the warm Friday night roar that was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s and went straight to Colleen, keeper of all information. \u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Coll said, \u201cthird booth in the back, adorable, nice manners, hint of a Southern drawl.\u201d Her friend grinned and pulled a beer for Wayne Knox. Looked like the volunteer fire department was having a \u201cmeeting.\u201d Gerard, Neddy-bear, Jessica Does and Kelly Matthews were all grouped on one side of the bar, howling with laughter.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Faith asked her.</p><p>Colleen leaned over the bar and gave Faith\u2019s shirt a tug to show more flesh. \u201cThere. Work the assets, girlfriend. Am I right, boys?\u201d</p><p>The males of the fire department agreed heartily. \u201cCan\u2019t go wrong with boobs,\u201d Everett Field said.</p><p>\u201cI babysat you,\u201d Faith returned.</p> <p>\u201cI remember. I think about it all the time.\u201d He received a hearty slap on the back from Gerard Chartier, his comrade-in-ogling.</p><p>\u201cGet going,\u201d Coll said. \u201cJeremy\u2019s already over there, chatting him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He and Levi usually come in on Fridays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir weekly date?\u201d Faith couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><p>\u201cI must say, Levi is looking \u00fcber-hot these days,\u201d Coll said. \u201cThose arms! Honestly, he comes in wearing a T-shirt and I actually have an orgasm. Here\u2019s your white wine spritzer, Mrs. Boothby.\u201d She ignored the disapproving glare from the florist. \u201cYour dad is also here,\u201d Colleen added, \u201cspeaking of men who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops! There\u2019s the line, don\u2019t cross it.\u201d Faith went to the far side of the bar where her father was talking to\u2014oh, hemorrhoid, to Levi. \u201cHi, Dad. You look nice.\u201d He did\u2014he was showered, for one, and wore a rugby-style shirt rather than his usual tattered flannel.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetpea,\u201d Dad said, giving her a one-armed hug.</p> <p>\u201cFaith,\u201d said the police chief.</p><p>\u201cLevi.\u201d Amazing how he could irritate her just by saying her name.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a date, I hear,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully it won\u2019t be a mistake. Or a bad idea. Or a blunder.\u201d</p><p>Levi sighed and stared into the middle distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be,\u201d her father said. \u201cWell, you go have a good time, honey. I\u2019ll be here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d She dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cAre you here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Lorena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She tried not to flinch. So far, she\u2019d screened and dismissed the women of eCommitment/SeniorLove, and her efforts to engage Cathy Kennedy in conversation about her sainted father had fallen with a thud. \u201cOkay, well...there are other fish in the lake, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish who don\u2019t wear cheetah-print bras with see-through shirts and ask what your bank balance is,\u201d she said, referencing Sunday\u2019s dinner conversation, which had caused Mrs. Johnson to growl audibly.</p><p>Dad still looked clueless. \u201cNever mind, Dad. Just don\u2019t get married without checking with me first.\u201d</p><p>Her father laughed. \u201cListen to her, Levi. Half the time I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>Ooh. \u201cWell. My date awaits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cYes, honey, have fun!\u201d Dad said. \u201cI\u2019m ready for more grandchildren. Just keep that in mind.\u201d He pinched her chin. \u201cLevi, don\u2019t I have the prettiest daughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d he answered, his glance flicking over Faith, pausing for just a microsecond on her boobage. \u201cGot your list?\u201d he added.</p><p>Faith didn\u2019t deign to answer (but, yes, it was in her purse). She took a calming breath and went to the third booth. There was Jeremy, looking utterly beautiful, talking to Ryan, she assumed.</p><p>\u201cFaith!\u201d Jeremy jumped up, kissed her cheek, his smile as warm and bright as if it had been years since they\u2019d seen each other and not hours. \u201cYou look beautiful, as always. Let me introduce Ryan Hill, my accountant.\u201d</p><p>Ryan was adorable. Go, Jeremy! Dimples, honey-colored hair, blue eyes. He stood up and shook her hand, smiling. \u201cGreat to meet you, Faith.\u201d And he had a drawl! Colleen was right! Oh, sigh!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHave a nice time!\u201d He grinned happily and wandered off toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cSuper guy,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Faith agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo you two were engaged, he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Faith admitted, glad to have it out of the way. \u201cWe met in high school, before he, um...came out.\u201d</p><p>The waitress, one of the many O\u2019Rourke cousins, came over, bringing Faith a glass of Blue Heron\u2019s dry Riesling, courtesy of Colleen, who waved from behind the bar. Ryan asked what was good here, and Faith recommended the nachos grande, which she hadn\u2019t had since Tuesday and was hence suffering serious withdrawal. \u201cSounds great,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIf you like them, I\u2019m sure I will, too.\u201d Oh! Southern charm!</p><p>They exchanged pleasantries until the food arrived\u2014jobs, college, where they grew up\u2014and not a red flag to be found. In fact, Faith was feeling the tingle, oh, yeah. Ryan\u2019s cuteness, combined with Jeremy\u2019s recommendation, had her feeling truly hopeful for the first time since Clint Bundt, the Lying Liar of Lie-Land. No, Ryan was definitely her best prospect since g*y Rafael (who\u2019d just texted her a picture of the hors d\u2019oeuvres choices they were considering for their wedding, wanting her opinion).</p><p>Definitely better than Levi, who was an ass-pain.</p><p>Nope. Not another thought of Levi would be entertained tonight, no way.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Levi looked at her from across the bar, those sleepy green eyes causing certain parts of her anatomy to tighten in a hot, slow clench.</p><p>Damn. Colleen was right. Levi Cooper was sex on a stick. Sex against the wall, on the floor, on the table, on...other naughty surfaces...dirty, sweaty, delicious sex...not that Faith had any firsthand experience with that. But she could imagine it, quite graphically, in fact. Especially while staring at the man in question.</p><p>Oopsy. Her mouth was slightly open, and she was possibly a little flushed. She forced herself to look at her date, who smiled politely.</p><p>Right. Concentrate on the perfectly nice man who actually seems to like you, Faith. \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase. I\u2019m the youngest of four, two sisters, one brother. My dad is sitting at the bar over there, so don\u2019t get fresh. I love my job, my grandparents, Ben and Jerry, and my dog, who is, I should tell you up front, the greatest canine the world has ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet him,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cKeep on going, Miss Faith.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, in my free time, I like to eat out, I do Pilates\u2014\u201d well, she intended to do Pilates, one of these days \u201c\u2014and I love violent, scary movies and romantic comedies. I\u2019d like to be in a serious, committed relationship with a man who\u2019s not married, not a deadbeat dad, has a job and isn\u2019t g*y. With me so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Ryan said with another fantastic dimpled smile. \u201cI\u2019m halfway in love with you already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet outta town, you big liar,\u201d Faith said. Yay, Jeremy! She grinned, just happening to catch a glimpse of Levi. He was watching. That\u2019s right! Suck it up, Chief, she thought, finishing her wine. \u201cYour turn, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, there. Jeremy tells me you have a list,\u201d Ryan said. He tore off a hunk of nachos and held it up to her mouth. Huh. Feeding her already? Was that icky, or adorable?</p><p>Adorable, Faith, adorable. Still, a bit awkward, since the sour cream was a little drippy. But still. A good sign (she hoped).</p><p>\u201cI do have a list,\u201d Faith said, wiping her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of...Machiavellian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun.\u201d Ryan gave her a steamy look.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Give it to me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...yeah, okay, I can do that.\u201d She paused. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She opened her purse and took out the well-worn list. \u201cThis is just the big stuff, you know, to make sure I shouldn\u2019t run screaming from the bar.\u201d</p><p>Another dimpled smile. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, Miss Faith.\u201d</p><p>He was so cute. \u201cOkay, so...have you ever been in prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! You have an A so far. Next question: Have you fathered any children, and do you pay child support, if so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kids. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Another excellent answer. Not yet, implying that he wanted them in the future. He was an A+ now.</p><p>\u201cOkay, last major question, and then we can get into things like moonlit walks and old movies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love old movies. And moonlit walks.\u201d</p><p>Well, you couldn\u2019t have everything. \u201cHow many women have you slept with?\u201d</p><p>Ryan had to think about that one. \u201cUh...ten?\u201d</p><p>Ten? Ten! That seemed like a lot. Then again, if you figured he was thirty-two years old (thank you, Google), and say he\u2019d first had sex around age seventeen (because with those dimples, he wasn\u2019t getting out of high school a virgin), that was fifteen years of single heterosexual male having sex. So\u2014Faith did some quick math in her head\u2014that was 0.667 women per year. Which sounded very weird but maybe wasn\u2019t that many? Even if it sounded like a lot of people?</p><p>\u201cI had a pretty serious girlfriend right out of college,\u201d he said in his adorable drawl. \u201cFigured we\u2019d get married, you know? But she left me, broke my heart.\u201d He gave her a puppy dog look. \u201cSince then, I just haven\u2019t been able to find the right person.\u201d</p><p>Okay, okay, that was tolerable. Sort of. But still. Ten.</p><p>\u201cNo diseases, by the way,\u201d he added.</p><p>Granted, she\u2019d need medical confirmation. Should she ask for his doctor\u2019s name now, or wait? Maybe waiting would be good.</p><p>She glanced over at Levi, who was no longer looking at her. Fine. Let him ignore her. \u201cThanks for answering my questions, Ryan. You\u2019re very tolerant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome. Hey. You wanna get our first kiss over with?\u201d He smiled. \u201cI find it makes things more relaxed, without us having to worry about how that\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...okay.\u201d Another glance at Levi. You know what? Yes. Let him see her kissing someone else. She leaned over the table, moving the nachos first (wouldn\u2019t do to have guacamole on the boobage) and gave Ryan a quick kiss on the lips, then quickly sat back down.</p><p>Was there a tingle? Too fast to tell. A quick glance at Levi, who was lifting his beer glass. Damn it. His arm made her tingle.</p><p>\u201cThat was very nice,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cA little sting from the jalapenos, but I kinda liked it. Sweet, with a little bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Faith said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His expression became rather wolfish. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t actually know, but...it\u2019s sort of me, maybe.\u201d Flustered, she took a bite of nachos. Hannah O\u2019Rourke (or possibly Monica) brought her another glass of wine, bless her.</p><p>\u201cSo I have a list of my own,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cYou do? That\u2019s great!\u201d Kindred spirits. Made her feel less freakish.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She sat back and smiled. \u201cFire away.\u201d She took a bite of the nachos.</p><p>Ryan grinned. \u201cDo you like being spanked?\u201d</p><p>She sucked a bit of jalapeno into her lung and wheezed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d She coughed (and coughed, and coughed), then took a sip of her wine. \u201cUm...I can\u2019t really say. I\u2019ve never been...spanked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a spanking virgin?\u201d He licked his lips.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014 You know, I think that book everyone was reading last year? That may have given the wrong impression. You know, about women wanting to have violence perpetrated against them. So. That\u2019s off the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about handcuffs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain...uh...not a lot of experience. And not seeking any.\u201d Crap. Was there a way to keep this date from going down the toilet faster than her black wraparound sweater? Her brain groped around for a solution and came up empty.</p><p>\u201cDo you like being submissive? Would you have a problem calling me Master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and yes. That\u2019s really not my thing, Ryan. Maybe we can shift course here, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d The puppy dog look returned. \u201cI answered your questions. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p> <p>Faith took a slow breath. It\u2019d be so nice to just walk away now. She could. However, she really didn\u2019t feel like seeing the look on Levi\u2019s face if she did. \u201cFine. Go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Ryan clapped like a little kid. \u201cWould you like it if I locked you in my boudoir for twelve hours and only left you a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo men have boudoirs? Because that\u2019s a very girly term to me. And no. I\u2019d get very hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I suppose I could slide some slices of baloney under the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaloney? I\u2019d need more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe some American cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI would require a gourmet pizza with shrimp, mustard and pesto from The Red Salamander, a bottle of chardonnay, and at least one pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Peanut Brittle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I wouldn\u2019t let you lock me anywhere. I\u2019d kick you in the nuts if you tried that, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Awesome!\u201d Ryan beamed. For the love of all that was holy... \u201cWhat if I came in dressed as Zorro with absolutely nothing on under my cape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look nothing like Antonio Banderas. I would have to reject you. I imagine I\u2019d laugh.\u201d Jeremy was going to have to pay for this, oh, yes indeedy. And speaking of the town\u2019s beloved doctor, where was he? \u201cHannah? Can we have the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. Levi was looking at her, a slight smirk on his face. And even if Ryan was a pervert with a terrible imagination, at least he was into her. \u201cNever mind,\u201d she told the girl. She turned her gaze back to Ryan of the Debauched Dimples. \u201cNext question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Okay, say you were my cleaning woman, and you were on your hands and knees in my kitchen and I came in. What would you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Why is this floor so filthy? Can\u2019t you learn to lean over the table?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would say, \u2018Take off the uniform, Cinder-Slut, and put your skills to other uses.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Faith folded her hands. \u201cI would say, \u2018No, sir, I will not! I require that you hie unto the market and buy me the Clorox Cleanup I asked you to get last week.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ryan looked a little confused. \u201cUh...then I\u2019d say, \u2018Do as I say, serving wench!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that won\u2019t work,\u201d Faith said, \u201cSee, I\u2019m the cleaning lady, not the serving wench. Now I lost my character\u2019s motivation. Scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing this right, Faith,\u201d he said, a sulky note in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a fairly unimaginative perv,\u201d she returned. \u201cThe maid is the best you can come up with? Yawn.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s phone buzzed. \u201cI have to answer this,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d she said. Someone plunked into the seat next to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Pru!\u201d Faith said. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Got a quick question for you. Am I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one bit.\u201d Ryan was muttering into the phone, his hand cupped around it so she wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, here\u2019s the thing. Carl\u2019s sexting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I... Wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck this out. What color panties r u wearing? Do I tell the truth? Because I think it\u2019s the ones with the squirrels riding their little sleds. Or should I make something up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, you know, do what you think is best,\u201d Faith said. More wine would be called for very soon.</p><p>\u201cTell him you got on a red thong, and you want him to take it off with his teeth,\u201d Ryan offered, pausing in his phone conversation. \u201cOr even better, tell him you\u2019re not wearing any panties at all. And that you\u2019d like to play serving wench and master when you get home.\u201d</p><p>Prudence stared at him. \u201cThis is your date?\u201d she asked Faith.</p><p>\u201cSorry to say, yes, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cMy mama has a wax ball in her ear. Faith, what do you say? Wanna hook up? The ear will only take a minute, and it\u2019s easier with two people, since she needs to be restrained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a pass,\u201d Faith said. \u201cGood luck.\u201d Ryan threw a few bills down on the table and left, grumbling about the lies of erotic fiction.</p><p>Pru was texting. \u201cBeing sexy is exhausting,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a thong,\u201d she narrated. \u201cCome and get it, big boy. You know what I miss, Faith? My periods. At least then, I\u2019d have a few days off. And when a woman yearns for her periods, that\u2019s a sign that the end of days is coming.\u201d Her phone chirped, and she paused to read. \u201cAh, shit. Look at this.\u201d</p><p>She shoved her phone across the table so Faith could read. am deeply disturbed. be more careful with the send button, for the love of god. will accept gifts to undo the psychological damage just inflicted. xox your son, Ned</p><p>\u201cI think I might divorce Carl if this keeps up,\u201d Pru said. \u201cOkay. Gotta go screw my husband. Sorry your date was an ass. Talk tomorrow.\u201d Her sister kissed her on the cheek and left.</p><p>Faith slid out of the booth. Jeremy was gone, apparently, but Levi was still at the bar, and Dad, as well as Jack now, too. And speaking of Dad, he seemed to be having a good time...and with a woman! Oh, with two! How thrilling! Cathy Kennedy, chooser of odd Bible verses but otherwise quite nice, and another woman Faith didn\u2019t know. Levi said something, allowing a faint hint of a smile cross his face. Faith\u2019s girl parts gave a sudden, hard tug.</p><p>\u201cSweetpea! Over here!\u201d Dad called, and wasn\u2019t he in the most jocular mood tonight! At least one of them was having luck with the opposite gender. She went to her dad, who slipped an arm around her, and smiled broadly at her potential stepmother.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you remember Mrs. Kennedy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, Dad. Nice to see you again, Mrs. Kennedy. I had a great time at Bible Study the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Cathy, sweetie. This is my wife, Louise.\u201d</p><p>Hemorrhoid! Why were all the good ones g*y? \u201cVery nice to meet you, Louise,\u201d Faith said, trying not to sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Bible Study?\u201d Jack muttered.</p><p>\u201cWith Goggy,\u201d she muttered back.</p><p>\u201cTrying to get the house in the will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve earned it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that the most interesting verse?\u201d Mrs. Kennedy said. \u201cBoys, we were discussing the history of blood rituals in the Old Testament. Circumcision, human sacrifice, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes me a believer,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cThis verse was about circumcision with a flint stone,\u201d Faith added, giving her big brother a look. \u201cYou wonder why some traditions die out. I mean, flint was good enough back then...why fix it if it ain\u2019t broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how was the crop this year, John?\u201d Mrs. Kennedy asked, and Dad started on his favorite subject.</p><p>\u201cHow was your date, sis?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d she answered, as Levi was in hearing range. \u201cVery charming guy.\u201d But Levi wasn\u2019t looking at her; instead, he stood up and opened his arms as his sister approached. Sarah Cooper dropped her backpack and went right to her brother, hugging him tight.</p><p>\u201cThank God I\u2019m home,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI thought my brain would explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom an entire week at college?\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cListen, G.I. Joe. You have no idea how hard it is.\u201d She rested her head on his shoulder, and Levi kissed her hair, and the gesture was so unexpectedly sweet and natural that Faith found herself...softening. Levi might be a pain in the ass, but his sister loved him. Jack, on the other hand, had only done things like film her seizures and hide in her closet with a knife when she was nine.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you giving me a hug in public,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou\u2019re so irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m your favorite sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you used to live three thousand miles away,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s a toss-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even if you wanted to hug me, I\u2019d never let you, because you smell funny and don\u2019t know how to eat in public and\u2014oof!\u201d</p><p>Jack had grabbed her in a bear hug, lifting her off her feet. \u201cGod, you\u2019re heavy,\u201d he grunted. \u201cLay off those Girl Scout cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and put me down,\u201d she said, smacking him on the head.</p><p>Dad was watching with a smile in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so much like your mom,\u201d he said.</p><p>The words, intended as a compliment, made Faith\u2019s smile slip.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jack answered. \u201cI get that a lot.\u201d Then he noticed Colleen smiling at him, and his grin disappeared.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Jack,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cI only bite on request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m heading home,\u201d Dad said. \u201cJack, you ready?\u201d Her father tousled Faith\u2019s hair. \u201c\u2019Night, sweetie. Oh, hi, there, Sarah, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Holland,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fine, how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going, too,\u201d Faith said, her heart sinking a little. Another crappy date. Ah, well. At least she hadn\u2019t wasted too much time running a background check. She\u2019d go home, cuddle with Blue, call Jeremy and give him the report, then discuss how he\u2019d make this up to her. \u201cHave a good night, everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Faith,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cUm...do have a second? I was wondering if I could talk to you. About San Francisco?\u201d</p><p>Faith glanced at Levi who was on the phone, then back at Sarah. \u201cSure, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour nephew? Ned?\u201d Her cheeks blossomed with color. \u201cHe was telling me you\u2019d been out there a few years. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>A crush, how sweet! \u201cI love it out there. It\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Levi shoved his phone back in his pocket. \u201cSarah, I have to go on a call. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cAnother chicken under the porch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a possum in the Hedbergs\u2019 basement. Their dog went crazy, which scared the cat out the window, so now they\u2019re afraid a coyote will eat the cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there animal control in this town?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but the guy\u2019s old, and it\u2019s past ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass. Meet you at home.\u201d She turned back to Faith. \u201cSo, did you like living away? I just can\u2019t imagine living anywhere but here. I mean, I remember how you were, um...left at the altar. Maybe you went because you... Oh, jeesh. Sorry if I\u2019m bringing up bad memories or whatever.\u201d Sarah grimaced.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. Common knowledge.\u201d Alas.</p><p>\u201cFaith, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d Levi said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for an answer, just took her by the arm and towed her away. The simple touch made her entire arm buzz with heat. Levi\u2019s green flannel shirt made his eyes look darker, and crikey, he had big, manly hands. So...alpha. Colleen said big hands meant\u2014</p><p>These lustful thoughts will send you straight to hell, her conscience chided in the sharp voice of Mrs. Linqvest.</p><p>\u201cSo, listen,\u201d Levi said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir, Chief Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah\u2019s got some serious homesickness going on. Trying to drop out of college and move back here. I\u2019d really like her to get an education. So if you two are talking about living away, I\u2019d appreciate it if you encouraged that. I don\u2019t want her to end up here because she never gave anything else a chance.\u201d He ran a big hand through his hair, and Faith\u2019s inner slut gave a moan. She remembered that hair, the soft, silky\u2014I\u2019m serious, said Mrs. Linqvest. Knock it off. He shoved his hands in his pockets, the fabric of his shirt straining against those thick, masculine arms.</p><p>Faith cleared her throat. \u201cNo, I get it. Everyone should live away from home, at least for a while.\u201d</p><p>His eyes came back to hers. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>His eyelashes were awfully nice, long and straight and blond.</p><p>\u201cYou go get that possum,\u201d Faith said. It sounded vaguely sexual, for some reason. Yes, Levi. Get that possum. Don\u2019t stop getting it. Get it good. Mrs. Linqvest got out the ruler. \u201cI\u2019ll hang out with your sister. We can walk home together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The words caused a warm, liquid rush through her knees. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, her voice a little husky.</p><p>Then he turned and left, raising his hand as someone called a good-night to him.</p><p>BY THE TIME LEVI GOT BACK from the call (the possum having been flushed out through the hole in the stone foundation, the hole temporarily patched with the help of young Andrew, and the cat found safe and sound, much to the sobbing relief of the Hedberg girls), O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was mostly empty. \u201cDid my sister go home?\u201d he asked Colleen, who was wiping down the bar.</p><p>\u201cFaith said they were going out on the beach,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t know if they\u2019re still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Levi went out the back door, past the parking lot where he\u2019d pulled Faith from the window. That seemed like a long time ago. He wouldn\u2019t mind seeing her in that black bra again, that was for sure. Or out of it.</p><p>Shit. He shouldn\u2019t be having those thoughts again. Faith was...well, she wasn\u2019t his type. Too\u2014too much, that was all. Too delicious edible complicated. He should not have kissed her that morning. That had been really, really stupid. Hadn\u2019t planned it, that\u2019s for sure, but one kiss, and he\u2019d felt an almost violent rush of lust slam into him, heavy and thick and immediate. Her mouth was so soft\u2014all of her was so soft, like a bed you could sink into\u2014and the smell of her, as inviting as cake warm from the oven, and when she\u2019d made that little sound, he\u2019d nearly lost it. Pulled back because if he\u2019d kissed her another second, he\u2019d have done her against the wall.</p> <p>And that kind of thing, that got a little...out of control.</p><p>Faith was, first and foremost, Jeremy\u2019s ex. Whatever the circumstances, Jeremy was her first love, and Levi didn\u2019t like the thought of being runner-up to his best friend. And secondly, there was that overwhelming sense of being lost in the moment, being oblivious. He didn\u2019t like that. He\u2019d felt that twelve years ago when he\u2019d kissed her, a kiss that had erased common sense and loyalty and whatever else that mattered.</p><p>And thirdly...she wasn\u2019t even here permanently. John Holland had told him he was hoping Faith would stay in Manningsport. But the truth was, she had a whole life back in California. Once before, he\u2019d fallen in love with a woman who\u2019d left him. He shouldn\u2019t charge head-on into doing it again.</p><p>Not that he was in love with Faith Holland.</p><p>The town beach was actually a little park\u2014grass and some flowering trees, a few benches, a boat launch, a dock and a tiny sand beach at the edge of the lake. Stars dotted the sky, but no moon was out, and it took Levi\u2019s eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness after the pinkish glow of the streetlights. There were Sarah and Faith, sitting on a bench, their shoulders touching, looking out over the dark water. Their backs were to him, so they didn\u2019t see him approach across the grass.</p><p>He stopped at the sound of Sarah\u2019s laugh. Hadn\u2019t heard that for a while.</p><p>\u201cNo, but seriously, I know how you feel,\u201d Faith said. \u201cMy mom died when I was young, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheesh. That sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no time for goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Sarah chewed that over. \u201cI guess at least I had that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth ways are tough. There\u2019s no getting around it. It\u2019s so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still think about your mom?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Faith said. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>Levi did, too. Every day, some thought of his mom would cross his mind\u2014her energy, her total lack of self-pity. Even when she was doped up on morphine, she\u2019d make him and Sarah laugh.</p><p>There was an unusual tightness in his throat.</p><p>\u201cThere are days when I\u2019m so sad, I don\u2019t think I can even get out of bed,\u201d Sarah said now, her voice small. \u201cAll I want is my mom, and I have to go to classes and listen to all that stuff, and it just seems so shallow and meaningless, when I\u2019d trade in everything for just another regular day with her.\u201d His sister\u2019s voice broke, and Faith put an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey,\u201d she said. Nothing else, just that. She stroked Sarah\u2019s hair in an unconscious way, idly, her head tipped against Sarah\u2019s. Just petted her hair and let his sister cry.</p><p>\u201cI know I should get over it,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Faith said, \u201cyou don\u2019t really get over it. You just learn to carry it better. And the only way to do that is to do the regular things. Get out of bed. Go to classes. Try to be normal, and pretty soon all that grief you carry...it gets easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Levi says,\u201d Sarah said after a minute.</p><p>\u201cI guess he\u2019s not always a dope, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d agree with you there.\u201d There was a smile in Faith\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI just...I feel her more when I\u2019m here,\u201d his sister said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to be at school.\u201d</p><p>A pain stabbed Levi\u2019s chest. Why didn\u2019t his sister tell him that? Why did she whine about hard classes and her lack of friends if that wasn\u2019t the real issue?</p><p>He thought he might know the answer.</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever talk to her?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Faith answered. She was lying, Levi thought.</p><p>\u201cDoes she ever answer? Like, do you ever think her spirit\u2019s with you or something?\u201d</p><p>Faith was quiet for a few seconds. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Another lie, telling Sarah what she wanted to hear. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Levi just looks at me funny when I say that, but I feel her around sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s a guy. They\u2019re pretty thick.\u201d There was another smile in Faith\u2019s voice, and Levi felt the corner of his mouth tug.</p><p>\u201cTotal cement,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cLead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Sarah straightened up and blew her nose. \u201cWere you homesick when you first left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I missed this place so much it actually hurt. I had a stomachache for weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Sarah, if you stayed here and passed up on the chance to live away and be your own person, rather than Levi\u2019s little sister...wouldn\u2019t you always wonder what you missed?\u201d</p><p>Good girl, Faith.</p><p>\u201cI guess. I mean, theoretically, I do want to go to college and stuff. Live away, at least for a while. But it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey.\u201d Faith was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou know the saying. Everything worthwhile in life is hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Levi quotes it on a daily basis.\u201d Sarah stretched her arms over her head. \u201cI should get home.\u201d She turned, and, seeing him there, gave a little shriek. \u201cJeez! Levi! You shouldn\u2019t just stand there like a serial killer! Say something next time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got here, so settle down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou two ready to call it a night?\u201d</p><p>Faith stood up and brushed off her skirt. \u201cChief. How was the possum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeisty,\u201d he said. Her white shirt glowed in the darkness. \u201cWalk you home, girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your favorite thing to do in San Fran?\u201d Sarah asked, trotting backward so she could see Faith as they walked up Lake Street, and Faith talked about the weather, the flowers, the food, the views. She made it sound like the best place on earth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go there for a semester,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cMy school has swap programs with a bunch of colleges.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great city,\u201d Faith said. \u201cDefinitely look into it. If I\u2019m still there, we could get together.\u201d</p><p>They walked past the now-quiet green, the shops dark. \u201cLook up there,\u201d Faith said, and sure enough, a light was on in her apartment, silhouetting her dog as he stood with his paws on the windowsill. \u201cHi, Blue! Be there in a minute,\u201d she called.</p><p>Levi held the door, and Faith\u2019s hair brushed his chin as she went in, enveloping him in that smell. He followed her up the stairs. Great legs.</p><p>\u201cThanks for hanging out,\u201d Sarah said as Levi unlocked their door.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, it was really nice,\u201d Faith answered.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I was a total drag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t. Are you kidding?\u201d She smiled and opened her own door, and her dog bounded out, dancing with joy.</p><p>\u201cHi, poochie!\u201d Sarah said, bending to pet him. The dog licked her chin and whined. \u201cAw, what a sweetie you are!\u201d She scratched his ears, then straightened. \u201cGood night!\u201d With that she went inside.</p><p>Levi didn\u2019t follow. He waited till the door closed instead, just looked at Faith, who\u2019d reached inside her door and gotten Blue\u2019s leash. She bent over and clipped it on, giving him a glimpse of the mighty rack, then straightened up.</p><p>\u201cYes, Levi?\u201d she said, sighing.</p><p>Then damn if he wasn\u2019t kissing her again, but there he was, his mouth on hers, a surprised little squeak coming from her throat. His hands cupped her face, and part of his brain barked out something about how stupid he was. The rest of him, however, was all for it. Her lips were soft and pliant, and, yeah, she was kissing him back.</p><p>Then she gave him a hard shove, and he stepped back, feeling blurry and slow.</p><p>\u201cSo what is this, Levi? You\u2019re just going to blindside me with a kiss every once in a while?\u201d she whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blue jumped against her like this was the best idea he\u2019d ever heard, his tail whacking against the wall. She gave the dog an idle pat, but she looked mad. He couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn confusing,\u201d she hissed. \u201cReally. I mean, I get the impression that you can\u2019t stand me, then after my seizure, you were incredibly nice and helpful, then you kiss me, then you ignore m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell, he was kissing her again. If nothing else, it did shut her up. And he liked her mouth doing something other than yapping at him. Soft and sweet and hot. He drew her against him, and she didn\u2019t resist. Instead, her hands slid into his hair, and she kissed him back, that sweet little noise coming from her once more. Then she let go.</p> <p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. He obeyed. Her eyes were wide and blue, and she looked a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cThanks for talking to my sister,\u201d he murmured, forcing himself to step back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said after a beat, licking her lips. God, he wished she wouldn\u2019t do that. Just made him want to instead. She swallowed. \u201cI, um...I have to walk my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She walked down the hall, stopping to glance back at him. And because he didn\u2019t know what to say, he just looked at her, that soft, pretty package, her silly strappy shoes and now-messed-up hair and happy dog.</p> <p>Then she went down the stairs, and he leaned against the wall, wondering exactly what the hell he was doing.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>\u201cARE YOU SURE YOU don\u2019t want an entire case?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cWine makes such a great present, the holidays are coming up, and your friends will know you were thinking of them while you were on your trip.\u201d She smiled and leaned on the counter of Blue Heron\u2019s beautiful tasting bar.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t resist a pretty girl,\u201d said the man. \u201cSure. Why not? Make it three cases. Best Riesling I\u2019ve tasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell my dad you said that,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make his entire week. And how about the cab you liked? The one you said had blackberry undertones and a hint of tobacco? You have a great palate, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Great idea. I\u2019ll save that just for me, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like a man who treats himself right,\u201d Faith said with a wink, handing the order to Mario, who\u2019d run the cases out to the guy\u2019s car.</p><p>Years of practice had shown Faith that flirting worked wonders when at the tasting bar. Honor used to lecture her about it, but no one had had a better record than Faith until Ned had come of age. At the moment, he was with a gaggle of fiftysomething women, clad in sturdy sneakers and matching, eye-bleeding pink sweatshirts that proclaimed them as \u201cPhi Beta Bitches.\u201d</p><p>She took the guy\u2019s tasting glass to the sink. \u201cI just sold four cases to one man,\u201d she murmured as she passed her nephew. \u201cSuck it up, sonny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Ned said, \u201cmy aunt here doesn\u2019t think I can sell as much wine as she can. Help me prove her wrong. I\u2019m throwing myself on your mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhore,\u201d she whispered, patting his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI learned from the best,\u201d he returned.</p><p>It was fun to be back in the tasting room, especially with Ned. This was Honor\u2019s domain\u2014she worked out of a big office in the back, running the sales, media and distribution, and running them well. But whenever Honor was around, Faith felt slightly out of place. This morning, though, Honor had called, saying that Chipper Reeves had sprained his ankle, and could Faith please pour for the afternoon. And even though it meant pausing in her work on the barn, she didn\u2019t want to say no. Honor so rarely asked her for help.</p><p>\u201cThank you, beautiful ladies!\u201d Ned called as the Bitches left. \u201cEight cases, by the way,\u201d he added to Faith. He took a cloth and started wiping down the counters, taking advantage of the break in traffic.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but my per capita ratio is still much higher. Guess you\u2019re not quite as cute as you think, Neddie dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a mirror, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of cute,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cNice transition, Auntie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Speaking of cute, you and Sarah Cooper? Is there cause for concern? Do I need to lecture you on safe sex, or just point out that her big brother is a decorated war veteran who can hit a moving target from five thousand yards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a line from a movie. But you don\u2019t want him mad at you, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi\u2019s skill with a gun was definitely a consideration at first,\u201d Ned said sagely, stroking his chin. \u201cBut Sarah\u2019s cute little ass soon rendered me incapable of rational thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not just say that. I\u2019ll have to kill you now. It pains me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and she\u2019s pregnant with triplets. Congratulate me.\u201d</p><p>Faith stared at him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Ned said. \u201cThe truth is, we text a little sometimes and play Words with Friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does sound more like you,\u201d Faith admitted. \u201cAre you part of the reason she wants to come home so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so. She crushing on me, and who can blame her?\u201d He ducked as Faith swatted him. \u201cI do like her, don\u2019t get me wrong, but she\u2019s a little young yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Just when I think I should drown you in a bucket, you come up with something really sensible.\u201d Faith paused. \u201cJust don\u2019t let the crush get too out of hand, okay? They can really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this great wisdom come from the shards of your own broken heart, Auntie, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Get the bucket.\u201d She turned as a couple came into the tasting room. \u201cHi, there! Welcome to Blue Heron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith? Can I see you a minute?\u201d Honor stood in the hall that led to the offices.</p><p>\u201cI got this,\u201d Ned said. \u201cWhat can I pour for you guys this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Faith followed her sister past the conference room and offices that were kept (and seldom used) by Dad, Jack and Pru.</p><p>Honor sat behind her beautiful, frighteningly organized desk, a gorgeous piece of walnut and oak made by the same carpenters Faith had hired to do the deck for the barn.</p><p>\u201cHow are things?\u201d her sister asked briskly.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Uh, how are things with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine. Have you found Dad a suitable woman yet?\u201d</p><p>Faith snorted. \u201cThat sounds...well, never mind. Um, not quite. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m casually introducing him to a gardener today, and I have a date set up with someone from eCommitment next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We don\u2019t want someone like Lorena taking Dad for everything he has.\u201d</p><p>Faith felt the odd impulse to stand up for the woman. \u201cYou know, Honor, maybe it\u2019s one of those opposites-attract situations. He seems to really like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just asked him for a loan of ten grand, Faith. For a boob job in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMexico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows a guy.\u201d Honor raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe Dad can decide for himself. It\u2019s his money.\u201d</p><p>Honor sighed. \u201cDo you know how much it takes to run this place, Faith? Let me put it this way. Two bad weather years in a row, and we\u2019d be in the red.\u201d</p><p>Faith chewed on her lip. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll try a little harder?\u201d Honor suggested, tapping a key on her sleek Mac.</p><p>Faith wasn\u2019t sure what else she could try, short of eBay. \u201cI\u2014 Yeah. I\u2019ll try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t see you till the party,\u201d Honor said, typing in a staccato burst. \u201cI have to be in the city for a couple days.\u201d There was but one city if a person was from the Empire State. Or Jersey, for that matter. Or Connecticut.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI mean, nice that you\u2019re getting away for a couple days.\u201d</p><p>Honor made a noncommittal noise.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it? Those business trips?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>Her sister stopped typing and looked up. \u201cYeah. I do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to...well.\u201d She shook her head, and Faith felt the sharp knife of regret she so often felt around her sister.</p><p>\u201cNice to what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her sister shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBe your own person?\u201d</p><p>Honor looked up, surprised. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled. \u201cNot just a Holland of the Holland family, where everyone already knows everything about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Honor stared at her for a second, then smiled, and Faith felt such a rush of love, she almost hugged her sister. Instead, she just smiled back, feeling her throat tighten a little.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d Honor asked.</p><p>Wow. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Honor hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve... Well, I\u2019ve been seeing someone. It\u2019s getting serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Faith barked, then covered her mouth with both hands at her sister\u2019s grimace. \u201cHonor!\u201d she whispered. \u201cWow! I didn\u2019t know that! Who is he? What\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...he\u2019s that guy. The one we mere mortals only get to admire from afar.\u201d</p><p>Good heavens. Honor was actually blushing. \u201cExcept you got close up?\u201d Faith suggested.</p><p>Her sister bit her lip and smiled. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s...the one?\u201d</p><p>Another dreamy smile was her answer.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to introduce him to the family?\u201d</p><p>Honor nodded. She looked so pretty, dumbstruck with love. \u201cHe\u2019s coming to the anniversary party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So it is serious, if you\u2019re gonna...unleash the Kraken and all that.\u201d Sure, she loved her family, but en masse, they could be a little terrifying.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Faith grinned. \u201cThis is great, Honor. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t say anything yet, okay? To Dad or Jack or anyone. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019m telling for now.\u201d</p><p>Faith paused. Honor, confiding in her. \u201cI won\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Faithie.\u201d</p><p>It had been a long time since Honor had called her that.</p><p>Her sister seemed to snap out of her fog. \u201cI need to get back to work. I\u2019ll see you when I get home. If you need any help with the party, let me know.\u201d She paused. \u201cI went up to the barn the other day, and it\u2019s really beautiful, Faith.\u201d</p><p>And now a compliment! Whoever this guy was, Faith would have to thank him. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, her voice a little husky. \u201cWell. Have a good trip. Call me if you want. You know. Just to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have a second, I will.\u201d Honor smiled and began typing again.</p><p>Faith left the office and went back down the hall to the tasting room, which was now empty. She saw Ned through the window, putting a case of wine into the couple\u2019s car. Good. A quiet moment.</p><p>That was\u2014by far\u2014the most intimate and friendly conversation she\u2019d had with Honor in nineteen years. Maybe, now that Honor had more in her life than the vineyard and Dad\u2019s care and feeding, they\u2019d be close. Maybe...just maybe...Honor would finally forgive her for Mom.</p><p>Honor never could talk about the accident. Dad had held Faith at the hospital, rocking her, telling her she wasn\u2019t to blame, she couldn\u2019t help having a seizure. Jack had been horribly gentle and kind, saying at least Faith hadn\u2019t died, too, and Pru, who\u2019d been in her twenties at the time, did her best to fill the maternal role for Faith. Everyone seemed to recognize the terrible cost of being alone in the car with her dead mother; Faith had had nightmares for a year, had even wet the bed a time or two, hadn\u2019t talked much for months. She didn\u2019t have to do homework for the rest of the school year. Everyone was kind...except Honor, whose eyes held a message that Faith could read all too well. You killed our mother. And the thing was, it was true, though Honor didn\u2019t know to what extent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Honor was a good daughter. A martyr, sure, but completely solid with their dad. Faith may have been Daddy\u2019s little girl, but Honor had been Mom\u2019s favorite, always more mature, more adult than the rest of them, despite being third out of four. She and Mom had had a special bond, and after Mom died, it seemed like Honor couldn\u2019t bear to be in the same room with Faith.</p><p>But maybe this was a turning point. Maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014Faith could get her sister to like her again.</p><p>When her tasting room duties were finished, Faith spied her father, who was sampling the homemade wine Gerard Chartier had brought him for his opinion. \u201cNot bad,\u201d John said. \u201cNice with a rare steak.\u201d Blue circled, dropping his ratty tennis ball suggestively. Dad picked it up and tossed it without pausing in his discussion of the different kinds of yeast Gerard could use. Dear old Dad. With his baseball cap, aging flannel shirt and purple-stained hands, he wasn\u2019t the most dapper of men, but he was certainly the best.</p><p>\u201cI see my little princess over there,\u201d Dad said finally.</p> <p>\u201cHi, little princess,\u201d Gerard called with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHi, Gerard,\u201d she said. \u201cSave any lives lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can carry you down a ladder if you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Dad, got a sec? I wanted to show you the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, baby. See you, Gerard.\u201d Her father picked up Blue\u2019s hideous ball and held it high. \u201cWho loves his ball? Do you love your ball?\u201d he said, causing Blue to freeze with elation at the word. Dad threw the disgusting thing past the storage barn, and Blue streaked off, caught it midbounce and returned immediately.</p> <p>\u201cHe could play for the Yankees,\u201d Dad observed.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hit to save his life,\u201d Faith said. \u201cSo, uh, did Levi tell you about how good Blue was when I had my seizure?\u201d she asked. Sure, it was a blatant attempt to bring up his name, but no one else was as unsuspecting as dear old Dad when it came to being pumped for information. She hadn\u2019t seen Levi since he\u2019d kissed her the other night. Hadn\u2019t heard him out in the hall, either. Had stopped short of pressing a glass against his door, but only just.</p><p>\u201cHe did. Said Blue came to get him. Who\u2019s a good boy? Huh? Do you love Faithie? Do you love her? You do?\u201d</p><p>There was something about Blue that made everyone a cheerful idiot, Faith observed as her father put the ball in his own mouth. \u201cDad. So gross.\u201d</p><p>He took the ball out and threw it up the hill. \u201cSo I finally get to see this place,\u201d he said, putting his arm around her as they walked.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been sneaking peeks, have you?\u201d The final week was when a project really took shape, and Faith had wanted to surprise her father.</p> <p>\u201cNo, sweetpea. I have three daughters. I\u2019m excellent at following orders.\u201d</p><p>They hiked up the hill, past the golden-leafed vines, up to the cemetery. Dad took off his hat and put his hand on the granite of his wife\u2019s headstone. \u201cHey, Connie,\u201d he said, his voice so full of love that Faith felt tears prick her eyes. \u201cWe all miss you so much, honey.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Faith. \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said obediently. I\u2019m so sorry. It was her customary thought, lodged like iron in her heart. She waited as her father brushed a couple of leaves from the grave, his face in its familiar sad and handsome lines. Please help me find him someone, Faith prayed. Would Mom want that, though? Faith thought she would, but then again, she was no expert on what her mother had wanted.</p><p>Dad stood, and they continued up the hill, talking about the grapes that would be left on the vine for the ice wines, and his prediction that it\u2019d hit seventeen degrees before Thanksgiving. \u201cGonna be a cold winter,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou smelly old farmers have a way of predicting those things,\u201d she said, earning a grin. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re here. You ready to be dazzled?\u201d</p><p>Dad had been up two weeks ago to check the progress; the stonemasons had been working on the rows of rock walls in the parking area, and Samuel had been putting up the railings around the decking. But since then, the path and the beds had been completed, and today, Jane Gooding, an organic farmer from Dundee, was bringing in the plants. Faith wanted to take one more look before the holes were dug, maybe rearrange a few things, before committing to the final layout.</p><p>And, yes, Jane Gooding had been vetted as a potential date for Dad. She was in her mid-fifties, loved the outdoors, understood plants, had a master\u2019s in botany as well as her master gardener certificate. She was long divorced, had dated here and there, had one grown daughter and was quite outgoing and attractive.</p><p>A home run, in other words.</p> <p>Jane was unloading plants from the back of her truck. She stopped and waved as Faith approached. \u201cHello there!\u201d she called, smiling. Attractive wrinkles creased her face, and she shoved a bit of curly blond hair behind her ear, leaving a streak of dirt. Totally Dad\u2019s type. Bet she didn\u2019t own an animal-print thong.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jane,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Dad was staring open-mouthed at the barn. \u201cSweetheart! This is amazing! It happened so fast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI aim to please,\u201d she said, her father\u2019s pride warming her. \u201cJane, this is my father, John Holland. Dad, Jane Gooding, who owns Dundee Organic Gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d Dad said, shaking her hand. \u201cYou have a nice operation over there. I\u2019ve driven past but never stopped in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t have that!\u201d Jane said. \u201cDrop in next time you\u2019re around. I\u2019ll give you the tour.\u201d She smiled at him, then turned to Faith. \u201cIt\u2019s all here. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Dad, do you have time to help us out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sweetpea. I just can\u2019t get over this! Nice work, honey.\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s goal in the barn had been to make it look completely unlandscaped and artlessly natural. The beds around the building were bordered with deceptively sturdy, uneven rock walls. A rusty old wagon wheel, a relic from the barn, leaned against the base of a two-hundred-year-old maple tree, and six old milking containers lined the rock foundation. Seven different varieties of moss and ferns, all indigenous, sat in pots, waiting to be put in the soil. A thousand daffodil bulbs would be scattered in clusters along the foundation, which would make it flippin\u2019 gorgeous next spring, and a fairly mature sweet wisteria was already planted by the sliding wooden door, which Samuel had rebuilt beautifully. Faith had painted it periwinkle blue yesterday.</p><p>Her little playhouse of old was glorious. She\u2019d saved the barn from becoming just a pile of rocks, created this beautiful place where so many happy memories would be made. Still, a lump came into her throat at the memories of sitting on the moss, pretending to pour tea in acorn caps, trying to tame a chipmunk, leaving a ring of daisies as a gift for the fairies. Such happy times.</p><p>Well. Dad and Jane seemed to be getting on like a house on fire, Faith noted. Gardening. So much better than a singles event.</p><p>She got to work. Faith always felt like she was a midwife when she planted something, coaxing the plant out of its container, loosening the roots, gently placing it into the carefully dug hole, then filling in the gaps with soil. The dirt on her hands, the rich, dark smell of damp earth, and now, the satisfaction of seeing her design come to actual life... There was nothing like it. The sun beat on her hair, and sweat dampened her T-shirt despite the cool air, the sound of shovels and birdsong making the afternoon utterly perfect.</p><p>Three hours later, they were done.</p><p>\u201cThat went fast,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Faith said, rolling her eyes at Jane, who smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s because you missed us prepping the soil last week. That\u2019s the hard part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty, honey. Your grandparents will be amazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait till you see it at night, Dad. The lighting is the best part, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I should go,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSo nice meeting you, John! I\u2019ll see you at the party, I imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure will. Nice to meet you, too,\u201d he said, blushing a little, but he shook her hand and waved when she started up her truck. \u201cSo, she\u2019s coming?\u201d he asked Faith.</p><p>\u201cSure. You always invite the people who worked on a project, Daddy. It\u2019s classy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so we\u2019re classy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Which means I get to pick out your clothes for Saturday.\u201d</p><p>The party had the potential to be fantastic, Faith thought as she tidied up a few things. Goggy and Pops would soften toward each other, remembering old feelings, perhaps. Dad would have an almost-date with a very nice woman. Honor would whisper conspiratorially about her new love. Maybe she could get Jack to dance with Colleen, though the odds were low on that. But since she\u2019d clearly backed a winner with Jane, maybe her next project would be her brother.</p><p>And maybe Levi would dance with her. Her knees wobbled at the image, the memory of his hard muscles, his heat pressed against her. Probably not, but it sure was a nice thought.</p><p>She snapped out of her fog and put the shovel in the shed. Whatever the case, the anniversary party would be a special night. A magical night.</p><p>ON SATURDAY EVENING, Faith was resisting\u2014barely\u2014the urge to strangle her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d he asked, dangling the suspicious food in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and eat it,\u201d commanded her grandmother. \u201cIt\u2019s party food. Don\u2019t be such a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Make that strangle both grandparents.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the pain in the ass,\u201d Pops retorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a pain in my ass for sixty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fighting, kids,\u201d Ned said. \u201cThis is your party. Don\u2019t make us sign you into the home just yet. Pops, it\u2019s a shrimp. It\u2019s wrapped in prosciutto, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s prosciutto?\u201d Pops asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like extra-fatty bacon,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so the night was not exactly magical. Not yet, anyway. She could still pull it off...if she drugged Goggy and Pops.</p><p>The Holland family had come up to the barn for a special dinner before the big party, since only hors d\u2019oeuvres would be served at the event, and God forbid her grands missed a solid meal. Or Prudence. Or Dad. Or Jack. Honor was here; her mystery man was not, and when Faith had asked about it, sotto voce, Honor gave her an icy look as an answer. Mrs. Johnson was also irritated with Faith, since Faith hadn\u2019t asked her to prepare the dinner but to be a guest instead, which had somehow insulted her.</p><p>\u201cYou look really handsome tonight, Pops,\u201d she said, smoothing some of the more fascinating eyebrow hairs away from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart. Maybe I\u2019ll get a dance with my special girl, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m the special girl in question, the answer is yes. But don\u2019t forget,\u201d she added, whispering, \u201cyou and Goggy have a dance first.\u201d</p><p>Pops grimaced.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cAnd you have your speech, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s right here.\u201d He tapped his jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello,\u201d came a voice. It was Jane, the gardener, dressed in a long, shapeless, greenish-brown cotton dress. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty starts at seven,\u201d Pru said, her voice even louder than usual.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Faith said. \u201cCome and join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back later,\u201d Jane said. \u201cThis is so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. We\u2019d love to have you.\u201d She introduced Jane to the family, earning suspicious looks from Goggy, who didn\u2019t see anything wrong with her son staying a widower for a few more decades, as well as from Abby, who was sulking because she\u2019d been made to change into something \u201cless whorish,\u201d according to Pru. Carl was also missing, though Faith had wised up and not asked why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery nice to see you again,\u201d Dad said with an adorably shy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, John,\u201d Jane said, tilting her head to smile back. Jane and John. So cute.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down,\u201d Dad said, holding out a chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked around. \u201cUm, is this...all?\u201d Jane asked, surveying the shrimp and pasta dish Faith had ordered from the caterers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a vegan. A rawist, actually.\u201d</p> <p>Life without cheeseburgers? So sad. \u201cRight. Um, I\u2019ll find you something.\u201d The caterers should have a veggie platter somewhere.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is a rawist, my dear?\u201d Pops said, turning on the charm (the better to irritate Goggy).</p><p>\u201cI only eat raw food,\u201d Jane answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mrs. Johnson asked. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s by choice. For health reasons,\u201d Jane said as Faith intercepted the vegetable tray from one of the servers. \u201cThanks, Faith. This\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d She took an impressive handful of baby carrots and began shoving them into her mouth like popcorn, crunching madly. And another handful. And some celery. Her mouth worked faster than a wood chipper, Faith thought.</p> <p>\u201cYou eat raw meat? That can\u2019t be good for you,\u201d Goggy pronounced.</p><p>Jane paused in her crop decimation. \u201cI don\u2019t eat meat. Raw vegetables and fruits only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about bread?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Gluten is poison for me.\u201d She picked up another handful of carrots and started chainsawing through them, little flecks of orange flying from her lips. \u201cYou should try it. I have literally no mucus issues anymore. And I\u2019m never constipated.\u201d</p><p>Dad had that hide me look on his face, and Ned was choking with laughter. Jane did have very strong-looking teeth, Faith noted. The veggie platter was supposed to serve twenty, but at the rate Jane was going, she\u2019d polish that off, then start on the table, which was hopefully gluten-free.</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d Pru said, draining her wine, \u201cwhere\u2019s Colleen and the hard stuff? You did say we were having an open bar, right?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, where were Connor and Colleen? Faith checked her phone. No messages. She sent a quick text, asking if they needed help. It was getting to be crunch time. She excused herself and started putting the centerpieces on the tables, which had been covered with pale blue tablecloths.</p><p>Prudence approached, a shrimp in each hand. \u201cThe place looks beautiful,\u201d she said. She was wearing dress pants and work boots, as well as a low-cut white sweater. An impressive purple hickey stood out on her throat.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Faith said. \u201cSo things are good with Carl?\u201d</p><p>Pru shrugged. \u201cYes and no. I kicked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did it the other night, right? Good old married sex, nothing fancy. Finally, right? Then he says he wants to film us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So he\u2019s staying at his mother\u2019s. Figured it\u2019ll shake him up a little.\u201d</p> <p>Faith nodded as if she understood. \u201cUm...you have a big hickey, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Damn it. Should\u2019ve looked in the mirror, I guess. Anyway, nice job here!\u201d She poured herself another glass of wine and drank it like it was water.</p><p>The DJ asked where he should set up, and Faith directed him to one corner. Then, after two more questions from the caterer had been answered, Faith adjusted the light under the maple tree, fixed the door, which was sticking, and found Pops\u2019s lower denture plate in a gooey nut cookie. She worked the teeth free as Goggy had a fit that Pops was eating nuts when his gastroenterologist specifically said not to. As Jane was eating half her body weight in roughage, Faith asked Mrs. Johnson if she might have any more vegetables, earning a glare from the housekeeper and some dark mutterings about people having evolved enough to cook their food. Faith took that as a yes, ran down to the New House, raided the fridge, cut up red peppers, carrots and broccoli, then cleaned the kitchen at lightning speed, because Mrs. Johnson hated anyone to leave a mess in her workspace. Then she power-walked back up the Hill, in heels, managing not to drop a single pepper slice.</p><p>Magical. Yeah, right. She was sweating, how magical was that? And the guests were just starting to trickle in.</p><p>Honor appeared at Faith\u2019s side. \u201cLorena\u2019s here,\u201d she growled. \u201cI thought you took care of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite her. I guess Dad did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck out that dress, Faith.\u201d</p><p>Lorena was currently kissing Pops on the cheek, bending over the old man, who clearly didn\u2019t mind. And the thing was, Lorena\u2019s dress...the woman had to weigh somewhere around two hundred pounds and was sixty years old if she was a day but, for some reason that went against nature and God\u2019s law, had chosen to wear a skin-tight rubbery black dress. No back. White granny panties, though, clearly visible.</p><p>Faith\u2019s breath left her in a rush. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014I...gotta give her points for, um, confidence. Maybe Dad should pay for that boob job. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Honor was not amused. \u201cYou said you could find him someone, Faith. That other woman, the gardener, is talking about how often she poops, and here\u2019s Lorena, dressed like Lady Gaga. Can\u2019t you do better?\u201d Before Faith could answer, Honor walked away.</p><p>With a sigh, Faith went over to say hello to Lorena. \u201cHello, sweetie!\u201d Lorena boomed. \u201cAnd just who do we have here?\u201d She was glaring at Jane, who sat next to Dad.</p><p>Jane paused in her chewing. \u201cI\u2019m a friend,\u201d she said, looking Lorena up and down.</p><p>\u201cA friend? A friend of who?\u201d Lorena asked, her expression lowering.</p><p>\u201cA friend of whom? Is that what you mean?\u201d Jane smiled tightly and took another celery stick.</p><p>\u201cCat fight,\u201d Ned murmured as he walked past Faith, phone in his hand.</p><p>Next time Faith felt the urge to throw a party, she\u2019d ask Pru to duct tape her into a chair.</p><p>And things hadn\u2019t even started.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>LEVI PULLED ON HIS suit jacket, the one usually saved for weddings or funerals. The whole town had been invited to old Mr. and Mrs. Holland\u2019s anniversary party, the police chief included. He hadn\u2019t seen Faith much since the night he\u2019d kissed her. Last weekend had been Columbus Day, and what with Sarah home and all the tourists, the biplane show out on the lake, the wine tasting on the green, the wooden boat parade, he hadn\u2019t had a free minute. Not that he knew what he\u2019d do with it, to be honest.</p><p>On Monday night, he\u2019d driven Sarah back to school, stopping at Target to get her some stuff to make her dorm room more homey, pillows and girly stuff like that. Then he\u2019d taken Sarah and her roommate out to dinner. Seemed like they were getting along just fine, those two girls.</p><p>As he\u2019d said goodbye to his sister, he\u2019d tried to find something to say about their mom, something similar to what Faith had said, but nothing sounded right, so he\u2019d just given her fifty bucks and told her to study hard. Drove back to Manningsport and tried to chop away at the mountain of paperwork on his desk at the station, even if it was ten o\u2019clock at night.</p><p>Thought about Faith.</p><p>Yeah, she was...delicious. He was a guy, he was straight, she was luscious and lived across the hall from him. Also, she smelled good. And though he\u2019d once viewed her as an irritating puppy of a person, she was...more.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he wanted to date her. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to date anyone right now. His divorce wasn\u2019t even two years old.</p><p>He should really stop thinking about her.</p><p>Levi drove up the Hill and turned into Blue Heron\u2019s driveway, where a line of cars was heading up the long dirt road that bordered one of the fields. There was a tasteful new sign with the gold and blue vineyard logo on it: The Barn at Blue Heron, 0.4 miles. As ever, it amazed him how much land the Hollands owned.</p><p>At the top of the ridge, a field served as a parking lot. Rock walls divided it up, the walls looking as if they\u2019d been there forever, though Levi was pretty sure they were new.</p><p>\u201cLevi, hey!\u201d Jeremy approached from the field. Living next door, he must\u2019ve walked over.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jer. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, my friend. How are you?\u201d</p><p>Levi had heard from Emmaline that Faith and Jeremy had been at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s the other night, laughing it up. The news had caused a ping of jealousy to echo through him. Which was stupid, of course. The two of them had a history. Everyone knew that.</p><p>Didn\u2019t stop that pinging, though.</p><p>People were streaming toward a path flanked by two maple trees, which were lit from the bottom by small spotlights, casting the yellow leaves in a warm, golden light. The path was wide, a stone wall running along one side, little copper lamps lighting the way. A wood thrush called, and farther away, an owl hooted. Somewhere in the distance was the sound of rushing water.</p><p>Suddenly, Levi recognized where they were. He\u2019d been here before. Twelve years ago, he and Faith had eaten lunch about a hundred yards from here, over by the waterfall.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been out here?\u201d Jeremy asked like a fricking psychic or something. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice place to swim.\u201d</p><p>Ah. So Jeremy had been here, too. Well, sure. He was the one who dated Faith. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe,\u201d he said. Then they rounded a slight curve in the path, and both men stopped.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jeremy breathed.</p><p>The structure in front of them was both modern and old\u2014the old stone barn, topped with a clear-paneled roof, glowing from the soft lights inside. All around, trees had been lit from below\u2014white birch and silver maple, beech and hickory. There were flower beds, but it wasn\u2019t fussy or precise; it was kind of...magical. Like something out of a fairy tale.</p><p>\u201cLevi, Jeremy! So glad you could come!\u201d John Holland greeted them at the big barn door, which was lit with copper lanterns. Two women flanked him; one in what appeared to be a brown paper bag; the other in, ouch, best not to look. Right. Lorena Creech, who\u2019d been sniffing around Faith\u2019s father in recent weeks. \u201cCome on in, see what our Faith has done. Phyllis! How are you! The walk wasn\u2019t too bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Jeremy said as they went through the barn doors.</p><p>Inside was quite possibly even prettier. Lamps made from Blue Heron wine bottles had been fastened to the stone with iron brackets. More wine bottles, the necks cut off, sat on the tables, filled with what looked like wildflowers. People milled about, pointing and exclaiming.</p><p>The far wall of the barn was missing, and a two-level deck cantilevered out over the hill. There were more tables out there, and people admired the view, which stretched out past the lighted trees, over the fields and all the way to the lake.</p><p>\u201cLevi! I clocked a speeder going past my house at sixty-two miles an hour,\u201d barked Mrs. Nebbins, who owned her own radar gun and phoned him about three times a week. \u201cWhen are you going to set up a speed trap on my road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out there yesterday,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to give more tickets. Or maybe put out some spikes. That\u2019d slow people down, let me tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhyllis, you just get more beautiful, if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Jeremy murmured, kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jeremy, you liar!\u201d she said. \u201cHave you seen Faith? Is it hard? Is she still in love with you? She probably is, poor thing. Listen, my knee is out of whack, and those exercises you gave me didn\u2019t work, so I stopped doing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How long did you do them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just insulting,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, complain away, I\u2019ve got all night. But I want to see that deck.\u201d He escorted the crotchety old lady away, grinning over his shoulder at Levi. Too bad the guy was g*y. He was so good with women.</p><p>Levi got a glass of seltzer water and wandered around. The barn smelled of freshly cut wood, grass and food. Lorelei from the bakery was putting some flowers on top of a chocolate cake; she waved and smiled. Colleen manned the bar, which was made from stone and topped with a huge slab of wood. Suzette Minor, she of the mysterious noises and slutty nightgowns, gave him the eye from over the rim of her wineglass. Where was Gerard? Last he heard, they were seeing each other. Levi nodded, turned and bumped into Faith. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, grabbing her arms to steady her. Her skin was cool and smooth.</p><p>She blushed, the color rising from the neckline of her red (have mercy) dress, up her throat and into her face. \u201cLevi,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Her hair was up tonight, and long gold earrings swung from her ears. As she looked at him, she bit her lower lip, and the action sent a jolt of electricity straight to his groin.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He realized he was still holding on to her and let go. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The air seemed to thicken and pulse between them. There was that smell of warm cake, and, not for the first time, Levi had a sudden image of doing Faith against the wall.</p><p>\u201cFaith! Your grandfather just spilled his drink on me,\u201d Mrs. Holland said, breaking the moment. \u201cAnd have you seen that Lorena? The outfit! Doesn\u2019t she have a mirror? Oh, hello, Levi, sweetheart. Faith, do you have something to blot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 Yep. Sure, Goggy.\u201d She led the old lady away. If she looked over her shoulder, Levi thought, the wall would be a definite possibility.</p><p>She looked, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.</p> <p>Then her father went over to her, and Faith nodded, said something. She finished with her grandmother, kissed her on the cheek, then found a waiter and pointed him in someone\u2019s direction. Poured a glass of wine and handed it to Mrs. Robinson, laughed at something she said.</p><p>And even though she was clearly doing a thousand things at once, taking care of a half-dozen people in the space of a minute, she looked back at him once more. Then, after a second, she smiled.</p><p>This time the jolt hit him in the chest. Faith Holland, smiling at him, not too far away from the spot he\u2019d kissed her for the first time, all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a natural at this, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Jeremy said approvingly, having made his way back from the deck. \u201cAnd this design! Gorgeous. She\u2019s already had seven bookings for weddings here next summer, Honor told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Levi, hi, Jeremy!\u201d Abby Vanderbeek bopped over, as well as Helena Meering. Helena had just gotten her license and had already received a ticket and a stern lecture from the chief of police, which had only made her giggle. \u201cWant to eat with us?\u201d Abby asked.</p><p>Helena smiled and stroked her own hair in that weird way girls did. \u201cI see you didn\u2019t bring a date, Chief Cooper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInappropriate, Helena,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just look lonely, that\u2019s all,\u201d Helena said. \u201cBesides, boys our age? So boring and immature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your date, ladies,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you g*y?\u201d Helena asked.</p><p>Abby took Jeremy\u2019s arm. \u201cGays make the best dates, Helena. Everyone knows that.\u201d</p><p>Faith, he noticed, ended up sitting with Jeremy and her niece, as well as a couple other members of the Holland family. Levi chose a seat at a table with the very nice Hedberg family. Andrew, who was about nine, was unfortunately fascinated with Levi\u2019s military past and grilled him mercilessly.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever kill anyone?\u201d the kid asked.</p><p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d his mom chided.</p> <p>\u201cI only shot at bad guys,\u201d Levi said, his standard answer. \u201cYou should come by the station, Andrew. I\u2019ll let you sit in the back of the cruiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d the kid said. \u201cAwesome!\u201d</p><p>Levi excused himself and went to get another glass of seltzer from the bar. Then someone whistled, and everyone turned their attention to the front of the room, where Faith stood, microphone in hand, looking pretty damn delicious.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming, everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad is too shy to say anything\u2014\u201d this was met with a ripple of laughter \u201c\u2014so he asked me to do the honors. I\u2019ll start by saying how happy we all are that you could make it tonight to celebrate my grandparents\u2019 sixty-fifth anniversary.\u201d There was a round of applause.</p><p>\u201cGod bless \u2019em!\u201d boomed Lorena of the unfortunately backless dress. \u201cHope they\u2019re still getting it on! Go, seniors! Whoo-hoo!\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019d have to make sure she wasn\u2019t driving.</p><p>Faith gave a pained smile. \u201cUh, okay, Lorena. Anyway, we also wanted to have you see the Barn at Blue Heron, which is available for any type of special occasion. This was the milking barn back in the 1800s, and it burned down in 1912, when my great-grandmother sent my great-grandfather here to sleep after they had a fight. I guess Great-Grandpa knocked over a candle, and that was that. He barely made it out, the story goes, and you can bet he never made my great-grandmother mad again.\u201d There was a warm laugh from the audience.</p><p>Levi glanced at Jeremy, who was sitting a few tables away. He was smiling, his eyes glued to Faith, looking like a man in love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really grateful my dad gave me the chance to make this space into something new, and there\u2019s no better way to christen it than with my grandparents\u2019 milestone. So thanks, everyone, and without further ado, my grandfather would like to say a few words to his beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>The guests gave an Aw, then clapped as old Mr. Holland went over to Faith. \u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI guess not many people can say they\u2019ve been married sixty-five years. But I have been.\u201d He paused, looking out at the guests with a smile. \u201cWhere did I go wrong?\u201d</p><p>There was a round of laughter.</p><p>\u201cPeople say to me, John, I don\u2019t know how you do it. And I tell them just look at my wife. She\u2019s got the face of a saint! A Saint Bernard, that is!\u201d</p><p>Levi glanced over at Mrs. Holland, whose expression was thunderous (and actually, yes, did resemble the jowly dog).</p><p>Faith darted out and whispered something to her grandfather, but he just shook his head, and took a few steps away from her. \u201cFaithie here wants me to dance with my wife,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how can I? She\u2019s got two left feet, and I\u2019ve got a ball and chain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dance with you, sweetie!\u201d Lorena called. That rubbery dress...good God. She went up to old Mr. Holland. \u201cPut on some music!\u201d she ordered. The DJ complied, and the opening chords of \u201cSexyBack\u201d came booming over the speakers.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking!\u201d said Mr. Holland, and, to Levi\u2019s horror (and the horror of every living creature, he imagined), Lorena began gyrating her flat, aging ass against Faith\u2019s grandfather, who put up his fists in classic white-guy style and bobbed in time to the Justin Timberlake song, which Levi had always liked. Until now.</p><p>Faith darted out again, her face pained. \u201cStop the music, please? Lorena, take your seat, okay? Please? Could you just...go over there? Thanks.\u201d She grabbed the mic out of her grandfather\u2019s hand. \u201cOkay, thank you, Pops. Go sit down.\u201d She pushed her hair back and tried to smile. \u201cUm, well, there\u2019s a lot to be said for having a sense of humor, right? Dad? Would you like to say something?\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo? You sure? Okay. Um...Goggy? How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know a divorce attorney?\u201d she said, her voice good and loud.</p><p>Faith winced. \u201cOkay. Right.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou know what? I stayed with my grandparents for a couple of weeks recently, and here\u2019s the thing. They might not be the most, um...romantic couple in the world, but they do take care of each other.\u201d She paused, looking at her grandparents. \u201cPops might not bring Goggy flowers, but he puts her cup out every night, the tea bag right in it, one teaspoon of sugar, so that in the morning, all she has to do is add water.\u201d</p><p>Levi used to set up the coffee for Nina. Same idea, he guessed.</p><p>\u201cAnd, um, my grandmother,\u201d Faith continued, \u201cshe cooks dinner every night. Makes Pops watch his cholesterol and stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNights like tonight, I wonder why,\u201d Mrs. H. said, getting a laugh of her own.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe my grandparents aren\u2019t the poster children for love. But they\u2019ve farmed this land all their lives, never sold off a piece, even when times were hard, even when the whole crop was lost in a hailstorm or the year when it rained so much the grapes rotted on the vine.\u201d She turned to her father. \u201cThey raised my dad and helped him with us kids after my mom died.\u201d She paused. \u201cMaybe love isn\u2019t just a bouquet of roses once in a while. Maybe it\u2019s just sticking it out, when it\u2019s hard, when you\u2019re mad, when you\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>The place had gone quiet. \u201cGoggy, Pops, I picked a special song for you two. \u2018And I Love You So\u2019 by Perry Como, your favorite, Goggy.\u201d Faith raised her glass. \u201cSo, folks, um...to my grandparents. Happy anniversary, Goggy and Pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d murmured the guests.</p><p>The DJ started the song. Mr. and Mrs. Holland stayed put. \u201cThis is when you dance, Pops. Goggy.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Suddenly, Lorena Creech lurched to her feet, knocking her chair over. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d she screeched, pointing to the woman in the paper-bag dress. \u201cYou\u2019re not his date! I\u2019m his date!\u201d</p><p>Yep. Definitely getting her keys.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Faith said. \u201cWe are certainly entertaining tonight. Uh, enjoy the music, everyone.\u201d She gestured to the DJ, who cranked up the volume, then put the mic down and walked out of the barn.</p><p>Poor kid, to have done all this work and have the night ruined by badly behaved adults. Nevertheless, a few couples were going out onto the dance floor.</p><p>Levi went over to the Holland table. \u201cWhat do you mean, we\u2019re not dating?\u201d Lorena was saying to Faith\u2019s dad. \u201cOf course we\u2019re dating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the misunderstanding,\u201d John said, wincing. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should be,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cYour children have been telling you what this woman was up to for weeks, but do you listen? No. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got better taste than you,\u201d murmured the paper-bag woman, which made Lorena swell.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a ride home, Mrs. Creech?\u201d Levi asked, trying not to look directly at her. \u201cI don\u2019t want you driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a cab, Mr. Uptight. And don\u2019t worry. I never drink and drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never drink at all,\u201d said the other woman, her voice prim.</p><p>\u201cNo, I bet you don\u2019t!\u201d Lorena said. \u201cToo busy talking about your mucus production! That\u2019s it. I\u2019m leaving. John Holland, you\u2019ve broken my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry,\u201d John said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. \u201cUm, also, Jane, I\u2019m not dating anyone. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d the bag lady said, tossing her napkin on the table. \u201cWhy was I invited, then? I\u2019m leaving, too. What a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you got fed, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cNot that it was enjoyable, watching you lay waste to three pounds of raw vegetables, mind you. And, John, you are an idiot when it comes to women. Shameful.\u201d</p><p>The two women left, and the clueless DJ started the Perry Como song for the second time. Levi bent down to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Holland. \u201cListen, you two,\u201d he said. \u201cFaith worked really hard on this party. Why don\u2019t you dance together and show her you appreciate it?\u201d He gave them his sternest police chief stare.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d want to dance with him?\u201d Mrs. Holland snipped.</p><p>\u201cMy arthritis is killing me,\u201d said her husband.</p><p>\u201cBetter move around a little, then,\u201d Levi said. \u201cFor Faith, if not for anything else. She adores you two.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s get it over with,\u201d Mrs. Holland said. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Faith did all this for us, you ingrate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not ungrateful. I love what she\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d Levi said. \u201cGet up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. My suffering continues.\u201d Mr. Holland sighed. He stood up and extended his hand. Mrs. Holland took it.</p><p>The song started for the third time, and as the old Hollands assumed the position, Levi was almost sure they were smiling.</p> <p>Faith was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>FAITH HAD FOUND A PLACE under the deck where she was fairly sure she wouldn\u2019t be found. The grass was cool and damp, but who cared? Better to hide here and get grass-stained than go back to the party. If she was found, she might stick a fork in someone\u2019s eye.</p><p>She took a long pull from the bottle of wine she\u2019d appropriated.</p><p>Though she knew it was pointless, Faith let herself imagine what tonight would\u2019ve been like if her mom were here. That she\u2019d have tilted her head against Dad\u2019s shoulder and whispered something to make him laugh. There\u2019d be no need for Lorenas or vegan zealots, and, somehow, Mom would work her firm magic on Goggy and Pops, would help Honor relax, laugh with Pru, dance with Jack, and maybe, just maybe, have some words for Faith, too.</p><p>The grief slipped around her like a heavy cape, enveloping her. She didn\u2019t deserve to miss her mother, but, dear God, she did.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Faith jumped. \u201cHi, Levi,\u201d she said, surreptitiously wiping her eyes. Her achy heart sped up.</p><p>\u201cDrinking alone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Tonight, I think it\u2019s more than justified.\u201d</p><p>Levi sat down next to her. \u201cSo this has been...\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cTerrifying?\u201d she suggested, taking another pull. \u201cBecause really, what other word works here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMemorable.\u201d There might\u2019ve been a smile in his voice, but it was too dark to tell.</p><p>\u201cMemorable. Your word is better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you crying just now?\u201d he asked, his voice quiet.</p><p>For some reason, his question made her throat tighten again. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything to that. Didn\u2019t say anything at all, and it was kind of nice, just having him there at her side. She felt chilly all of a sudden. Wondered what he\u2019d do if she leaned her bare shoulder against his.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dancing, you know,\u201d he said after a minute.</p><p>She shot him a look. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Good.\u201d She looked back at her hands. The waterproof mascara was not tearproof.</p><p>From up above came the shrill and adorable voice of young Michael Jackson. Footsteps thudded more or less in time to the music, indicating that people were dancing.</p><p>\u201cThis place is beautiful, Faith,\u201d Levi said, and all of a sudden, Faith\u2019s toes curled in her shoes, because...well, because he\u2019d come to find her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, turning her head to look at him in the faint light. Damn. Levi Cooper in a suit. She couldn\u2019t say she\u2019d ever seen him in one before, aside from his dress uniform. His hands were clasped loosely in front of him and he was looking at her. \u201cAre you having a nice time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>The words caused a tightening low in her belly. \u201cYou look very handsome, Levi.\u201d</p><p>He did. Those sleepy eyes definitely held a slight smile now. At least, that\u2019s what it seemed like. He leaned so that his shoulder bumped hers, and the small gesture made her entire body feel warm. \u201cAnd you look very pretty, Faith,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a long moment, then reached over and touched the silky hairs at the back of her neck, studiously, a slight frown coming to his face, as if he\u2019d never touched that spot on a woman before. Faith swallowed as her entire side broke out in goose bumps, her muscles turning liquid. He stared at the spot he was touching, his lashes catching a bit of the light from outside. The Boredom Scale didn\u2019t exist now.</p><p>His mouth was so close. She could just lean in and kiss him, feel that perfect pressure, that thrilling moment when the kiss would deepen and she\u2019d feel his tongue slide against hers.</p><p>Yes, if she worked up the nerve, Faith could kiss Levi Cooper, the boy she\u2019d known most of her life, the boy who\u2019d never liked her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t move, hypnotized by that gentle touch on her neck. He could do that all night, and she\u2019d sit here and not want anything more.</p><p>Except she did.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Levi said. He stood up and took her hand, pulling her to her feet, and led her out from under the deck to the barn\u2019s entrance. \u201cTake a look at that.\u201d He stood behind her, not touching her, but close enough for her to feel his warmth.</p><p>Her grandparents were dancing; Michael Jackson had finished, and the Rolling Stones were singing \u201cBeast of Burden.\u201d Dad was dancing with Honor, Colleen with old Mr. Iskin, Pru with Ned, Abby with Helena, both girls laughing.</p><p>And Goggy and Pops were dancing, too. Dancing, and smiling as they talked.</p><p>Faith felt a smile come to her own face. She\u2019d done it. It looked...wonderful. Magical, even.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna get out of here?\u201d Levi asked, and his breath was soft against her neck.</p><p>The party would last maybe another hour. The caterers would take care of cleanup; everyone had already been paid; she\u2019d be up here tomorrow, anyway. Her job was done, in other words.</p><p>And Levi Cooper was asking her to go somewhere with him, and there was a promising look in his eyes...she suddenly, desperately wanted do something about that.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>THE WHOLE SEDUCTION thing...easier said than done.</p><p>They\u2019d been home for eighteen minutes, and the only one seeing any action thus far was Blue, who\u2019d attached himself to Levi\u2019s leg the second they came through the door. Luckily, she\u2019d asked Eleanor Raines from downstairs to walk the beastie; Ellie fell over herself to worship him on a number of occasions, so Blue was all set for the night. Good thing the dog was here, because conversation wasn\u2019t exactly flying.</p><p>Levi was sitting on her couch, having successfully ended the humping session (well, Blue\u2019s humping session) and was now scratching the dog\u2019s ears as her pet stared at him worshipfully, tennis ball in mouth. Faith herself was leaning against the counter, drinking a glass of ice water.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d been wrong about Levi\u2019s intentions. Was it possible, she wondered, that Levi had no idea she wanted him to, ah, do her? If he did, how come he was just sitting there? How exactly did people proceed? Should she just announce it? God, she was nervous! Heart zipping away, hands shaking slightly, stomach in knots. Where was that warm melting sensation from before? Hmm?</p><p>What to do, what to do. She and Jeremy had had dozens of conversations on the topic before doing the deed, but obviously, theirs wasn\u2019t the typical male/female dynamic.</p><p>The facts were that Levi had kissed her. Twice. Three times, if she counted back a decade or so. And there was the neck stroking. Also, his sister had called nine minutes ago, and he\u2019d let it go to voice mail.</p><p>Okay. Faith was gonna go for it. Sort of. In a way.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this party started, shall we?\u201d someone said, and oh, hemorrhoid, it was her very own mouth that had formed those ridiculous words.</p><p>Levi gave her a long look. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Levi,\u201d she said, her face hot. \u201cYou want to get it on or what? Oh, God, I sound like such a slut. You know what? You can go. No hard feelings. America\u2019s Next Top Model is having a marathon, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Blue barked, wagging happily. It was his favorite show.</p><p>Levi got up. Faith\u2019s heart rate tripled. Oh, yes, yes indeed, he was coming over. To her, or to the door? Oh, lordy, to her. There was a very faint, possibly imagined, smile playing around his mouth, and his eyes had that sleepy, incredibly hot look. He took the glass out of her hand and set it on the counter. Just the brush of his fingers against hers made her knees tingle and weaken. She inhaled the smell of his soap\u2014Ivory, maybe? Who knew? He smelled good. Focus, Faith, focus. A heterosexual male is standing in front of you. Do something about that.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She appeared to be frozen. Well, there was some dried cuticle that could use picking. How about that? That\u2019d be fun. Easier than this. She really didn\u2019t know what she was doing, man-wise. Maybe America\u2019s Next Top Model would be the best option, after all.</p><p>Levi put his hands on the counter, trapping her without touching. He was maybe an inch away from her, all bristling testosterone and heat. Faith swallowed, the noise gunshot loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Then he closed the tiny space between them, his body a hard, warm shock, and his mouth found hers.</p><p>And it would\u2019ve been great, except, you know, sex was looming.</p><p>She tried pursing her lips, and crap, that didn\u2019t feel right. What was she supposed to do, exactly?</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Levi said, and she realized he\u2019d stopped kissing her, and she was standing, clenched as tightly as new rope.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, licking her lips. Unclench, unclench. She loosened her fists. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m trying. Go ahead. Kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. Please kiss me.\u201d Great. Now she was begging.</p><p>His eyes were half closed now, those beautiful green eyes, and he leaned in, his hard, muscled arms pulling her against him. Then his lips were against hers, more insistent this time, and Faith tried to kiss him back, but she couldn\u2019t quite breathe.</p><p>He sighed and pulled back again. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem here, Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem,\u201d she snapped. \u201cMaybe you have the problem. Maybe you\u2019re not as great a kisser as you think. Or maybe I\u2019m worried you\u2019ll hate yourself in the morning. I mean, you\u2019ve kissed me twice now with absolutely no follow-up, so maybe you\u2019re the one with the problem. Jeez.\u201d</p><p>He stared. Blue flopped on the floor, belly up. The clock ticked. Futtocks, this was awkward!</p><p>\u201cHow many men have you slept with?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>Busted. \u201cUh, counting you?\u201d she said, feeling her chest practically burst into flame with a blush.</p><p>His forehead crinkled with that incredulous look she\u2019d seen so many times in their high school years. \u201cWe haven\u2019t slept together, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know that. You have a point. Can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly. America\u2019s Next Top Model was looking better and better.</p><p>\u201cSo not counting me, how many?\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded as if considering the question, glancing at something safer than Levi\u2019s face. The fridge, or the bowl of green apples that had looked so pretty in the market but had tasted so sour in reality. Should really throw those out. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said. \u201cUm...one.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to curl in on itself in embarrassment.</p><p>He didn\u2019t blink. Even his eyelashes seemed disdainful.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only slept with Jeremy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are correct, sir.\u201d Her face was hot enough to fry an egg. Not that she had anything to be embarrassed about. Chastity was a good thing. Being fastidious about one\u2019s choices in life\u2014an excellent quality.</p><p>This night was not going as planned.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, perhaps more sharply than she meant. \u201cSince Jeremy, I just never met anyone who... I mean, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t\u2014 There were a couple guys who...\u201d She took a breath and forced herself to look at Levi directly, who was waiting, that look still on his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sleep with someone just for the sake of it,\u201d she finished.</p><p>Words that would make a man run. Especially someone like Levi, who seemed like the type to absolutely sleep with someone just for the sake of it.</p><p>The truth of the matter was, Faith had wanted to be in love first. For eight of the past eleven years, she\u2019d only ever imagined sleeping with one man, after all. Sex was far too intimate to do with someone she didn\u2019t love. Gay or not, Jeremy had loved her and, God knew, she\u2019d loved him back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t in love with Levi. And Levi certainly wasn\u2019t in love with her.</p><p>This was ridiculous. Of all the men she might pick, Levi was not a likely candidate for husband/father of her adorable children. A) he barely liked her. And B)...well, who knew what B was. Hot or not (well, he was definitely hot), he was probably not the guy to\u2014</p><p>He reached up and cupped her cheek with one hand and studied her, his expression unreadable\u2014eyebrows drawn, the slight, omnipresent frown on his face. Faith swallowed, her throat dry.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sleep with me, Faith?\u201d</p> <p>The question took her by surprise. His voice was low and gentle, and Faith felt a tug low in her belly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she whispered. He smiled the slightest bit, then ran his thumb over her lower lip, and she drew in a shaky breath. Then he pulled out the clip that held her hair up, causing it to tumble down in a sweep. Slowly, almost carefully, Levi bent his head and kissed her neck, his arms going around her, and, oh, mercy, his mouth was warm and gentle, and a rush of molten gold seemed to flow through her limbs, heavy and electric. Her bones seemed to soften, and her head tipped back, her breath suddenly ragged.</p><p>Her hands didn\u2019t know what to do. Levi took one in his and kissed her palm, then flattened her hand against his chest so she could feel the slow, hard thud of his heartbeat. And this time, when his mouth touched hers again...this time it was right. His hands moved through her hair, then down her back, pulling her against him, and, oh, he was as solid as granite, utterly dangerous and absolutely safe. Her mouth opened in a sigh, and he took advantage, tasting her, and the hot golden feeling was stronger now, pulsing hard. Her hands slid against his ribs, feeling the play of muscle against skin, and his kiss became deeper, more insistent, hotter. Faith\u2019s knees loosened dangerously, a little moan escaping her throat.</p><p>Then Levi pulled back, and it took Faith a minute to open her eyes. Her breathing was ragged. So was his. His eyes...bedroom eyes. That was the term.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to sleep with me?\u201d she said, her voice breathy.</p><p>He smoothed some hair away from her face. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip. \u201cOkay, then. Take me to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking against the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God!\u201d she blurted. The golden heat surged hot, hard and heavy. \u201cOkay, fine, whatever you think. You\u2019re the expert here.\u201d</p><p>His smile was slow, and it made the throbbing hotter, stronger. Then he bent and picked her up so that her legs wrapped around him of their own accord, and Levi Cooper did what he said he was going to do.</p><p>THEY DID END UP IN BED, and bed was good, Levi thought. The wall had gone well until Faith\u2019s dog kept dropping his ratty old tennis ball at their feet, and she started to laugh. Besides, given that Faith had never been with a straight guy, he wanted to give her the whole experience, as it were. She was worth exploring, her body lush and soft, all pink and cream, and she made the most gratifying little noises, and had done a fair bit of exploring herself, her hands sliding over him, her mouth soft and sweet.</p><p>And when they were done, and her eyes were wide and her cheeks flushed and her skin damp with sweat, he rolled on his back and pulled her against him, a fierce sense of...something...swelled in his chest.</p> <p>Even she was quiet. \u201cSo, was this, um...pretty typical?\u201d she asked eventually.</p><p>No. \u201cPretty much,\u201d he answered, his fingers playing in her hair. Now why\u2019d you say that, dumb ass? his brain scolded.</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t want too much too soon. That was all. He was being careful, and careful was smart.</p><p>The dog decided it was bedtime, too, and jumped up, draping himself over their feet. \u201cDo you mind him?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She propped herself up on her elbow and looked at him. \u201cDo you need to go?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cKicking me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just...I didn\u2019t know if you wanted to spend the night. If you do, I have to take off my mascara and hide my, uh, undergarment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen your undergarment. I\u2019ve also seen combat armor that looks more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your pillow talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t crinkle your forehead at me, Levi. I\u2019m new to the game here.\u201d</p><p>He felt a smile threaten. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good for a rookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d Here came the blush. He turned and pressed a kiss on her shoulder. Her blush deepened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty and soft and you smell like cake. How\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled a little. \u201cCake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Edible.\u201d</p><p>That flustered her. She pressed her lips together and looked away, still a little spooked around him. \u201cSo, are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered to his and away again. \u201cOkay. If you want to.\u201d</p><p>He could\u2019ve claimed ten things, nine of them true, that would\u2019ve gotten him home. He was on call. He had paperwork. Emails to answer. A grant to finish. He could take a cruise through Manningsport, just to let the good citizens know he was out there. He probably should\u2019ve used any one of those because there was sex, and then there was spending the night, and this was way too early to spend the night.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now be quiet and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him another second, unconvinced, and he felt a pang of remorse. He picked up a strand of her hair and gave it a gentle tug, then pulled her head back down to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLevi?\u201d</p><p>Women. Always with the talking. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Did you have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a lot of noise. That\u2019s generally a good sign.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head to look at him, her coppery hair falling half over her face. \u201cWell, well, well. Look at that. Levi Cooper, smiling.\u201d</p><p>And sure enough, it seemed he was.</p><p>Then she kissed him, hesitantly, sweetly, then less hesitantly, and nobody went to sleep for a long while.</p><p>Except the dog.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>LEVI COOPER HAD washboard abs.</p><p>Not that Faith was ogling or anything. Okay, she was totally ogling. So was Blue, for that matter, still hoping Levi would throw the ball ten or five hundred times.</p><p>But Levi was asleep, so ogling was allowed. Plus, how could a woman drag her eyes off that perfect, beautiful body? His arms were ridiculously male, heavy and thick with muscle, his chest solid and broad. And those abs...rippled and hypnotic and magically perfect.</p><p>Yes. Levi Cooper was a sparkly unicorn of wonder.</p><p>Granted, Jeremy had been gorgeous. Movie star, NFL chiseled handsome, and, yes, Faith had loved looking at him, too. Then again, he hadn\u2019t known what to do with her.</p><p>And Levi most definitely had. Hand to God, yes.</p><p>Sex with a straight guy\u2014definitely the way to go. Especially this straight guy, because, much to her surprise, he hadn\u2019t just been hot and, er, competent, he\u2019d been...sweet. There was really no other word for it. And Levi Cooper with ruddy cheeks and sweaty hair and beautiful arms, asking her if she liked what he was doing...crikey! She was getting turned on just thinking about it.</p><p>Time to go. Blue needed a walk before she jumped Levi again. She pulled on some clothes, then slipped out of the bedroom with Blue. Realized she was grinning. Kinda felt like skipping.</p><p>She set up the coffeepot and turned it on, then grabbed Blue\u2019s leash, causing her dog to freeze in wonder before springing for the door. \u201cYes! We are taking a walk! I know! It\u2019s so exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she whispered (because she had a beautiful man sleeping in her bed, had she mentioned that?). She opened the door and Blue bounded out, whimpering in excitement.</p><p>Sarah Cooper was standing in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where my brother is?\u201d Sarah blurted, her face creased with worry.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, yes, I do. He\u2019s, uh...he\u2019s in there.\u201d Faith nodded back at her place.</p><p>\u201cI called him last night, but he didn\u2019t pick up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShoot. I\u2014 He\u2019s...sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s expression changed from worried to astonished. \u201cHoly heck,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you guys do it? Are you sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...maybe your brother should answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are! You\u2019re doing my brother. OMG, where\u2019s my phone? I have to tweet this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Sarah,\u201d came Levi\u2019s voice. The man himself came out of her apartment, his dress shirt untucked. \u201cIf you tweet this, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m completely supportive. Faith is much nicer than G.I. Jane. I approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper,\u201d Levi said. Faith smiled at Sarah, grateful. Always good to have family on your side.</p><p>Levi tucked in his shirt. Too bad. He looked better naked. \u201cWhat are you doing home, anyway?\u201d he asked his sister.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cLevi! This was the weekend you allowed me to come back, remember? The weekend I wasn\u2019t forbidden to come.\u201d</p><p>Levi took a short breath, held it, and then said, \u201cRight. So get inside and stop bothering Faith. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothering her,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cWe\u2019re bonding. In case I\u2019m gonna be an aunt sometime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah. Go. Inside. Now.\u201d There was a fascinating knot in his jaw. His sister obeyed, pulling a face at Faith as the door closed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at her,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said. Jamming his hands in his pockets and ignoring Blue\u2019s whimpers of adoration, Levi finally looked at her. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, his voice just a soft scrape.</p><p>A two-letter word, and she was a mushy puddle. \u201cHi,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped to her mouth. \u201cAlso fine. But I have to go.\u201d He looked as somber as somber got.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As we live not too far from each other.\u201d She bit down on a smile.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Only then did he seem to realize she was joking, which he acknowledged with a raised eyebrow. Then he grabbed her, eliciting a squeak, and gave her a hard, fierce kiss, and before she could even respond, let her go. \u201cSee you around, neighbor.\u201d</p><p>With that, he was gone.</p><p>\u201cYOU HOT BITCH,\u201d Colleen breathed the next evening, her eyes full of admiration. \u201cYou slept with Levi Cooper? Get outta town! Tell me everything. How many times did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, whoa. Easy, girl.\u201d Faith sat back in her seat at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, which had just opened. She hadn\u2019t seen Levi since The Night, though she\u2019d smelled chocolate again at three this morning. Today, though, his car wasn\u2019t at the station or in back of the Opera House, so she assumed he\u2019d driven his sister back to school. Not that she was stalking, though, yes, she had just followed Sarah Cooper on Twitter.</p><p>\u201cI want every detail,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cYou owe it to me. My friend got it on! I\u2019m so happy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! But could you just lower your voice a teensy bit? That\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s here, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother might come in any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t count. Right, Connor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Connor appeared from the kitchen. \u201cHi, Faith. Glad you\u2019re getting some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Con. And thank you, Colleen, for not telling me your brother was lurking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color dress should I pick out for the wedding?\u201d Colleen asked. \u201cYou definitely owe me another gig as maid of honor, since Jeremy ripped me off the first time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know what? He\u2019s the\u2014\u201d Faith looked around (the early crowd was trickling in) and lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s only the second man I\u2019ve slept with. So let\u2019s just slow things down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s the second,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cThat\u2019s my fault. I regret buying you adult toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh! Come on! I don\u2019t want your brother to know all this stuff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d her friend said, taking a long pull of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve gotten laid long before now. Three years is too long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to agree there, Faithie,\u201d Connor called.</p><p>\u201cYou two. What a team.\u201d Ah, well. It was just Coll and Con, the two-for-one special.</p><p>\u201cSo how was it?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only telling you if you keep your voice down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Colleen whispered. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>Faith smiled. \u201cIt was...\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! This is great! Con, it was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay.\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed happily. \u201cSo, are you engaged, are you dating, or was this a one-time bang-a-palooza, never to be repeated, are you friends with bennies...what?\u201d</p><p>Faith paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re definitely not engaged.\u201d</p><p>Colleen gave her a knowing look. \u201cYou\u2019re in love, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are. I know you. You wouldn\u2019t have had sex with him if you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. He\u2019s... I mean, he\u2019s... It could happen, I suppose.\u201d Her face was getting hot again. \u201cLook, here\u2019s my dad. Please don\u2019t hit on him or tell him I\u2019m getting a little some-some or give him anything with jalapenos, because he\u2019s got acid reflux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack is here, too. Hooray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe merciful, Coll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re kind of early, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Connor asked, looking out from the kitchen door. \u201cI don\u2019t usually see Jack before seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m screening a date for my dad. Dad will eavesdrop, then give me the thumbs-up or down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Hollands are so cute.\u201d</p> <p>The afternoon after the party, while Levi had been busy with his sister, Honor, Pru and Faith had had an intervention with Dad. Honor had served as Head Inquisitor, Mrs. Johnson banging pots and slamming drawers in the kitchen to underscore the theme of disapproval. Dad had admitted that he\u2019d enjoyed Lorena\u2019s \u201cwacky ways,\u201d as well as the distraction of having someone new to talk to but hadn\u2019t believed she was as attached as his children had warned. He had no intention of seeing the vegan gardener again and said he\u2019d try to be open to dating someone. Maybe. Possibly. And, yes, he\u2019d do what they told him from now on.</p><p>Faith was immensely relieved.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said, \u201cbrother mine, don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you skulking off from the party the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t hear you left with Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drove me home,\u201d Faith said, feeling her face practically burst into flame.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you kids are calling it these days?\u201d He gave her a cuff. \u201cSpare me the details, okay? Pru is bad enough. Pru is horrifying, come to think of it.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, Faith was seated in a booth, the same one where the accountant had tried to talk dirty to her. Accountants. Were they all pervy? At any rate, Dad was in the next booth, already sweaty, pretending to talk to Jack, who was reading the paper.</p><p>Because internet dating was the most effective way to find someone, Faith had given it another shot (avoiding StillHotGranny). She reposted a profile for her dad, admitting immediately that she was his daughter, acting as first-round screener. Tonight, she was meeting a woman named Maxine Rogers, who\u2019d answered all questions appropriately.</p><p>Faith was just digging into the plate of nachos grande and a glass of beautiful Riesling, which had the nicest tangerine notes and went perfectly with dinner, when Maxine approached.</p><p>\u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! Maxine, right?\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled broadly. \u201cYes. How are you, dear?\u201d</p><p>She was very tall, which hadn\u2019t come across in the photos. Her hair was black (had to be dyed, but it was a nice job, too, very shiny, unlike Lorena\u2019s Sharpie look), and her makeup was expertly applied, especially her red lipstick, which was bold and rather dashing. Maxine had put in some effort, in other words, and it worked. She was nicely dressed, especially notable since she had to be nearly six feet tall. Faith noted that her dad had turned his head the slightest bit to check her out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to finally meet you,\u201d Maxine said. Her voice was pleasantly low-pitched.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou\u2019re so nice in your emails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, you\u2019re an angel to say so.\u201d She settled back against the booth. \u201cI think it\u2019s very kind what you\u2019re doing, helping your father find love again. Just so sweet.\u201d</p><p>It really was, Faith thought. \u201cWould you like some nachos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you! Aren\u2019t these gorgeous,\u201d Maxine said, taking a healthy chunk. Good. Faith hated being the only female who really ate.</p><p>Colleen approached the booth. \u201cCan I get you\u2014 Oh! Hi. Uh, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t...see you come in. Can I get you something to drink?\u201d she asked Maxine.</p><p>\u201cFaith, what are you drinking, honey?\u201d Maxine said, and Faith already liked her immensely.</p><p>\u201cColl, what am I having?\u201d she asked. \u201cMaxine, Colleen is my oldest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Maxine said, offering her hand to Colleen.</p><p>\u201cYou, too. Um, Faith is drinking...the uh, the Bully 2011 Riesling, right, Faith?\u201d Coll gave her a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s delicious,\u201d Faith said. \u201cTangerine overtones, a little straw flavor, very smooth finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d Maxine said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring it right over.\u201d With that, Colleen was off.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t have children, is that right?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, sadly I never did. But I have four nieces and six nephews, and I adore them all, as well as their kids. I like to think of myself as an Auntie Mame type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so nice. I have a niece and nephew myself. And you\u2019re a bookkeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I love numbers, love making sense of things. I always have.\u201d</p><p>Faith sat back and listened as Maxine told her about life in rural Ohio and how she\u2019d come to the Finger Lakes on vacation, then decided to move to Penn Yan after she\u2019d had a windfall. \u201cIt was one of those things, Faith,\u201d she said. \u201cI was doing fine, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I must\u2019ve had some kind of angel on my shoulder, because really, who wins a hundred thousand dollars with a scratch-off? I asked myself, what do I want to do for the rest of my life? And this place above all others was the one that spoke to me.\u201d</p><p>Colleen brought over the wine. \u201cFaith, can I see you a second?\u201d Colleen asked. From the kitchen came a crash and a yell. \u201cShoot,\u201d she said, and dashed off.</p><p>Maxine was passing every test. Manners, funny, open, warm, told a good story. She was financially secure, had an active social life, loved fishing, tennis and cooking. Faith\u2019s hopes rose. At the very least, she could see Dad dating this nice lady occasionally. For one indulgent moment, as Maxine was telling her about her trip to Montana last summer, Faith pictured her in the New House for Sunday dinner, laughing her husky laugh, charming everyone. Even Mrs. J.</p><p>Maybe Levi would be there, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear what you just said.\u201d What the heck. She already felt like she and Maxine were old friends. \u201cI just started seeing someone myself,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m a little distracted.\u201d</p><p>Maxine\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI wondered why a pretty girl like you was still single,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very new,\u201d Faith whispered, feeling the heat rise into her cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s very...\u201d Her voice trailed off. Hot. Intense. Great in bed. Delicious.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Maxine said, smiling in a wonderfully conspiratorial way. \u201cOne of those. I get it.\u201d</p><p>Faith felt like giggling. Two glasses of wine, only nachos since noon. \u201cAnyway, back to you, Maxine. What do you like to cook?\u201d</p><p>Her phone vibrated, her cue to go to the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Excuse me for one second,\u201d she said, sliding out of the booth.</p><p>Jack met her at the entrance of the restrooms. \u201cDad says it\u2019s a go. He likes what he\u2019s heard so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Faith said, elation rising up like a geyser. Finally, she could look at Dad and see a happy man, rather than a lonely widower doing his best.</p><p>\u201cThis is so weird, Faith. I feel like we\u2019re pimping out our father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not! Don\u2019t you see, Jack? Dad could get married again. He could stop missing Mom and be happy.\u201d</p><p>Her brother gave her an odd look. \u201cI think he\u2019ll always miss Mom, even if he did remarry, and he\u2019s not unhappy, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re next, so be nice to me or I\u2019m throwing you to Colleen, and the hyenas will pick over your bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, love is in the air, huh? Since Levi, ah, drove you home?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help a smile, remembering the other night.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Jack said. \u201cSorry I asked.\u201d He walked back to his table.</p><p>Faith took a minute to use the bathroom. Her cheeks were flushed. She looked a little...dreamy. Maybe Levi would come over tonight and shag her silly, since Sarah\u2019s Twitter feed said he\u2019d dropped her off and all.</p><p>The stall door opened, and Jessica Does came out.</p><p>\u201cOh. Hey,\u201d Faith said, abruptly turning on the water. Didn\u2019t want Jessica to think she just came in to gaze at her reflection.</p><p>And, oh, crap. Jessica was Levi\u2019s old girlfriend. Would that come into play?</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Jessica washed her hands, too.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>With that, Jessica reached past Faith and grabbed some paper towels from the dispenser, her movements so sharp that Faith actually ducked. \u201cJesus, Holland,\u201d Jess said, rolling her eyes. \u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna slap you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I didn\u2019t. I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Jess was gone, ever the princess of manners. Didn\u2019t matter. Dad\u2019s potential wife was out there.</p><p>Faith\u2019s phone buzzed. It was a text from Colleen, for God\u2019s sake. Faith had nothing against phones and texting, but really. Colleen was in the same building. She opted not to read it but speak to her friend instead. Maxine, a live human, was waiting for her, after all. Faith opened the door and went out, only to see her father standing there.</p><p>\u201cI really like her,\u201d Dad said. \u201cShe seems really nice. Tall, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Great clothes.\u201d</p><p>Dad smiled. \u201cI noticed that, too. Your mom was quite snazzy, too. Like you.\u201d</p><p>This time, the guilt punch wasn\u2019t quite so strong. \u201cThanks, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Her dad folded her into a hug. \u201cI appreciate this, sweetpea. I really do. You\u2019re awfully good to your dear old dad. So maybe I\u2019ll swing by the booth, pretend I just dropped in, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Maxine was delicately nibbling on a nacho when Faith got back.</p><p>Huh. Nail polish, definitely a professional mani, but there was something... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere you are! Hello again.\u201d Maxine smiled.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again. Colleen, being a pain in the butt. Still, two in one minute, it must be important.</p><p>She clicked the \u201cview\u201d button. The message consisted of one word. She-male.</p><p>Huh?</p> <p>Oh.</p><p>Oh, no. No, no. Faith glanced at Maxine.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>\u201cFaith, honey!\u201d Oh, futtocks. It was Dad. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you all week,\u201d he said, winking to make sure she knew he was lying like a four-term senator. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she said in a faint voice.</p> <p>\u201cOh! How nice to meet you!\u201d Maxine said. \u201cI\u2019m Maxine. You have an absolutely wonderful daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more,\u201d Dad said, sliding next to Faith. \u201cAnd two more like her, I\u2019m happy to say.\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s brain was white with commotion. She thought back frantically to the eCommitment profile she\u2019d filled out for Dad...she had clicked on man seeking woman, right?</p><p>\u201cHi, everyone.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap, it was Honor. So not good.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart!\u201d Dad said.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d Maxine said.</p><p>Honor looked at her, then did a double take. \u201cOh. Um...hi. Sorry. I\u2019m Honor. I...I didn\u2019t realize...um, I didn\u2019t mean to, uh, interrupt.\u201d She gave Faith a look that was simply incredulous.</p><p>\u201cSo, Maxine,\u201d Dad said. \u201cI had no idea Faith was meeting you tonight. What a happy coincidence. I just happened to drop in, and now you can meet two of my daughters! How nice!\u201d</p><p>So the old fox had decided to go for it, laying it on quite thick. \u201cDad,\u201d Faith said, \u201cUm, Honor has to speak with you, right, Honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s kind of important, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, we live in the same house,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can talk later. Sit down. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice to meet you, Honor.\u201d Maxine beamed. Nice smile. Faith sighed. \u201cYou know, John, I think it\u2019s lovely that your daughters are so involved in helping you find someone,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, girls. Your concern is so touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Honor said. \u201cI... Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy son is here, too, somewhere,\u201d Dad said. \u201cOh, there he is, at the bar. The big good-looking one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes after his father,\u201d Maxine said.</p><p>\u201cJack! Come over here,\u201d Dad called. \u201cMaxine, I hope you don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a small town, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is our little hangout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Manningsport,\u201d Maxine said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here before, actually. Prettiest town in New York, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, it is,\u201d Dad said, nodding approvingly. He looked at Faith and gave her a little wink, as clueless as she\u2019d been.</p><p>Jack approached. \u201cHey, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cHi, I\u2019m the son.\u201d He stuck out his hand to Maxine, who shook it. Jack\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s some grip,\u201d he said, glancing in horror at Faith.</p><p>\u201cI have one more daughter who\u2019s not here,\u201d Dad said, beaming. \u201cBut you\u2019ve met seventy-five percent of my offspring. And since they\u2019re the most important things in my life, I guess it\u2019s good to get that covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beautiful family,\u201d Maxine said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I have to go. Too bad I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be popping in, John! I have a dinner date with the lovely old gentleman who lives next door to me, and he barely gets out, so I\u2019d feel terrible if I was late. But I hope we can see each other again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be great,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no, that\u2019s...that\u2019s great,\u201d Faith said. \u201cUm, it was so nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jack and Honor murmured in agreement, their faces a bit pained.</p><p>Maxine got out of the booth and grabbed Faith\u2019s hands. \u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d and, yeah, husky wasn\u2019t quite the right word to describe that voice.</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d Faith said. She kissed Maxine\u2019s cheek, getting a bit of stubble.</p><p>\u201cJohn, wonderful meeting you. Have a lovely weekend.\u201d She tilted her head and waved, then off she went. Faith sat back down.</p><p>\u201cI really liked her,\u201d Dad said. \u201cGood job, Faithie. She\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI, uh...Maxine is not going to be your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Honor shook her head and sighed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Faith began, hoping to break this gently. \u201cDid you notice anything about Maxine? Anything at all?\u201d</p><p>Her father frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Dad. Run with it,\u201d Jack said, taking a long pull of his beer.</p><p>\u201cUm...very warm and well spoken. Pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty is not really the word here,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t handsome do better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I guess so,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>Honor sighed, and turned to look at their father. \u201cDad, Maxine is a man.\u201d</p><p>Dad blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a man, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but she is,\u201d Honor said, taking a nacho covered in cheese.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Honor\u2019s right,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d His shoulders started shaking in a silent laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dad said. \u201cUh...oh. I see.\u201d Then he bit his lip and started laughing, too.</p><p>Honor rolled her eyes. \u201cColleen, can I get a very strong martini?\u201d she called. \u201cBone dry, three olives.\u201d She looked at Faith. \u201cI\u2019ll give you this, Faith. She was better than Lorena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you kids don\u2019t want a stepfather, is that correct?\u201d Dad said, wiping his eyes with a cocktail napkin, and though Faith laughed along with them, that familiar feeling of guilt twisted in her stomach.</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t made things right.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>\u201cI THINK IT\u2019S FANTASTIC that you guys are together. Really. You\u2019re perfect for each other.\u201d Jeremy beamed at them like a proud parent.</p><p>Faith made a noncommittal noise, looked in her wine and tried not to cringe. Levi, she imagined, was doing something similar, though of course he was too stoic and manly to cringe, but inside, he\u2019d be cringing, too.</p><p>They were at Jeremy\u2019s for dinner\u2014a celebratory dinner, he\u2019d said, because the two people he loved best in the world were shtupping each other. He seemed to be the only one celebrating, however, and it was quite possible he was a little too happy, which was rather grating.</p><p>Jeremy had figured it out during what had become their weekly lunch at Hugo\u2019s. Levi had come in for something or another, wearing a gun and looking incredibly smokin\u2019 alpha protector, and she\u2019d fought the urge to wrap herself around him like a python. \u201cGotta go,\u201d he\u2019d said, and Faith had muttered goodbye, and the second Levi was out of earshot, Jeremy\u2019s eyes had widened. \u201cYou two are doing it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he\u2019d whispered gleefully.</p><p>Yes. They were. But it was a little early to be thinking thoughts like perfect or even together. Levi was hard to figure out. On the one hand, he\u2019d come to her apartment door six out of the eight nights since they\u2019d first slept together. And the sex was great. She honestly hadn\u2019t known sex like that really existed outside of Ryan Gosling movies. Skyscraping, mind-blowing, tunnel-of-light great. Before and during sex, and immediately afterward, it felt as if they had something going on, something\u2014she barely even dared to think the word\u2014special.</p><p>Otherwise, not so much. She\u2019d dropped by to see him the other day at the station; he\u2019d asked, \u201cWhat can I do for you, Faith?\u201d with a completely straight face, like she wanted to discuss her parking tickets (which she really should pay...sleeping with the police chief hadn\u2019t prevented him from ticketing her car in the forty-five seconds she\u2019d been double-parked in front of Lorelei\u2019s).</p><p>Then last night during nooky, he\u2019d put a hand over her mouth, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake the neighbors,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she\u2019d whispered.</p><p>Hmm. Now that she thought of it, that had been their longest conversation. Levi had been working constantly\u2014there\u2019d been a small crime spree in east Manningsport. He\u2019d gone up to Geneva to have dinner with Sarah (and hadn\u2019t asked her to come...which was fine, but still, she really liked Sarah, and if she and Levi were in something, it\u2019d be nice to see his sister more. Right?).</p><p>So tonight was their first \u201cdate,\u201d not that it had been either of their ideas. It was the brainchild of Jeremy\u2014Jeremy, who was dressed in black jeans, a blue striped shirt, untucked, and yellow river man\u2019s sweater with four buttons unopened at the neck. Good old Banana Republic.</p><p>Levi, on the other hand, wore faded jeans with a tear in the knee, work boots and a flannel shirt, and despite her growing irritation with the man, it was getting hard not to rip open that shirt and take a bite.</p><p>But so far, Levi had barely said two words to her. Make that one. He\u2019d said hey when he came in the door, half an hour after he was supposed to be there.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve thought of this years ago,\u201d Jeremy now said. \u201cFaith and Levi. Levi and Faith.\u201d Again with the beaming.</p><p>\u201cWell, years ago, we were together, Jeremy,\u201d Faith said, a trifle testily. Levi said nothing. She resisted the urge to elbow him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cRight, right! But you two have, you know...chemistry.\u201d</p><p>Faith rolled her eyes. At the moment, the only chemistry she was feeling was acidic. She glanced at Levi, who gave her a six on the Boredom Scale. Nice. Then again, she may have been misreading his glances. Then again on top of that, she was, thus far, nothing more than a booty call.</p><p>\u201cWhoops. Let me check the potatoes,\u201d Jeremy said now. He got up, all male grace, and went into the kitchen.</p><p>And still Levi said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAm I just a booty call to you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No,\u201d he answered tersely.</p><p>Wow. Two whole words. \u201cYou haven\u2019t taken me out yet,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working.\u201d</p><p>Ooh. Three words now. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The Boredom Scale jumped to a nine. \u201cFaith, four houses have been broken into in the past ten days. I\u2019m the police chief. I like my job. I have to do my job in order to keep it. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that word,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Faith gave him a pointed look. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, Levi. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bug is up your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, he\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>Levi sighed, that typical male women are such pains sigh. This time she did elbow him in the ribs. \u201cJesus,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just Jeremy. But close,\u201d Faith shot back.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me everything,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHow did you guys get together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s purely sexual,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Jeremy laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cIsn\u2019t she, Levi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Adorable.\u201d At that moment, his cell rang. \u201cChief Cooper,\u201d he answered, his face losing that bored affect as he listened. \u201cOkay. Yep. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d He stood up. \u201cSorry, guys, I have to go. An attempted break-in at the Hedbergs\u2019 house. They think their dog scared off whoever was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Faith said, taking another sip of her wine.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatevs, honeybun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Levi looked at Faith another minute. \u201cBye,\u201d he said, then leaned in and kissed her, and just like that, her heart softened.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Then he left, and she and Jeremy were alone in the beautiful living room of the Lyon house, a fire crackling in the huge stone fireplace, wine and cheese on the coffee table.</p><p>She already missed Levi. Even if he was just her life-size sex toy.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cYou and Levi. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>She tucked her feet under her and took another sip of the wine (an oaky chardonnay with an overstated buttery texture, to be honest). \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe air crackles between you two. It does. It crackles.\u201d</p><p>Faith snorted. \u201cCrackles with irritation, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you like him, right?\u201d</p> <p>Faith had to think about that one. \u201cI like him sometimes. And, once in a great while, I think he likes me. I mean, I know he likes me in some ways\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does. Of course he does. You\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Faith put her wine down. \u201cCan you stop with the compliments, Jeremy? It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cOkay, yeah, I\u2019m a little...\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019d really like to see you happily settled with someone. And I love Levi like a brother. So I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m a little overly invested here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, that easy, generous, ready smile that won over patients in a heartbeat. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I think I\u2019m owed some snapping.\u201d He paused. \u201cI still feel bad that I couldn\u2019t give you what you wanted, Faith.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cWater under the bridge.\u201d</p><p>Being here in his beautiful house, where she\u2019d been hundreds of times, the fire, the wine, the elegant furniture and many family photos...she\u2019d been so close to living this life. To having Jeremy, the heir to this vineyard, the town doctor, the guy who was everything she\u2019d ever imagined having in a man.</p><p>The man who loved her with all his heart but had to picture Justin Timberlake to do the deed.</p><p>It occurred to Faith that she\u2019d never thanked Levi for stopping her wedding.</p><p>She took a sip of her wine, which was improving with oxidation. \u201cCan I ask you something about Levi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I mean, nothing that would betray our brotherly bond and all that.\u201d Another smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat was his wife like?\u201d Faith asked. She\u2019d been dying to hear about her, but as she and Levi hadn\u2019t done more than some X-rated acts, she hadn\u2019t had the chance.</p><p>\u201cNina, Nina, Nina,\u201d Jeremy said, swirling his wine around. \u201cNina Rodriguez. She was unbelievably pretty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey! A little loyalty, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it back,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was so ugly. In an unbelievably pretty way.\u201d He grinned. \u201cShe looked like J-Lo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she was also the one who broke his heart.\u201d</p><p>Crap. She\u2019d been kind of hoping for a marriage of convenience situation with an upcoming and heartfelt declaration from Levi that only now did he understand the true meaning of love, yadda yadda. Too many romance novels or something. \u201cThey were only together for a little while, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they knew each other in Afghanistan. She was\u2014is\u2014a helicopter pilot. Total kick-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d More wine was definitely called for. She took the bottle from the ice bucket and poured herself a second glass. \u201cWas she nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the word I\u2019d use. She was hot. Sorry, she was,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cAnd she was funny. Great smile, seemed very smart. But nice? Not sure about that.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunate that she had to ask Jeremy about these things instead of the man himself. Jeremy, however, would talk. \u201cDid they live together first or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Levi had to go to some Army thing in Fort Drum, and he came back with her, asked me to come to the Town Hall and there she was. They got married right then and there, with just his mom and sister and me.\u201d Jeremy smiled at the memory. \u201cHe was totally smitten. Couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. He was so...smug, you know? Like, yeah, look at me, married to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a cramp, Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWell, obviously it didn\u2019t work out. Nina was fun, she was gorgeous, but she was edgy, too. It was tough, because it was one of those situations where you could see that his heart was going to be crushed. No one was really surprised it didn\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Jeremy paused. \u201cHe adored her, she couldn\u2019t wait to leave. Just not meant for small-town life, I guess. Or marriage. And Levi, meanwhile, had practically named their kids.\u201d</p><p>Faith knew that feeling. She and Jeremy actually had named their kids. \u201cAnd that was a year ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than that. Maybe a year and a half? Yeah, because it was June and we had the biplane show on the lake. He walked around like someone had hit him in the head with a baseball bat.\u201d</p><p>Faith sighed. \u201cWell, this sucks, Jeremy, because from the sound of it, she\u2019s the love of his life, and I\u2019m a booty call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you guys been together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight days.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy laughed. \u201cI\u2019d give it a little time, sweetheart.\u201d He stood up and picked up her wineglass. \u201cLet\u2019s eat. I have some beautiful steaks and twice-baked potatoes and coleslaw, all your favorites, not to mention grape pie from Lorelei\u2019s. We can watch a movie if Levi\u2019s late. I have The Devil Wears Prada. I watched it last night, too, and I swear it gets better every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I ever thought you were straight.\u201d She took his hand and let him pull her off the couch, then followed him into the kitchen.</p><p>THE HEDBERGS HAD COME home to find the back door open and called Levi, rather than go inside in case the burglar was still there. Smart. He made the family wait as he took a walk-through. No intruder. It looked like Katie\u2019s room had been tossed, but she said it was as she\u2019d left it. Andrew gazed at him with wide-eyed adoration, firing off questions about bad guys, guns, robbers and whether or not Abraham could be trained to attack.</p><p>After that, Levi walked around the house, looking for signs of a break-in\u2014screens knocked out, footprints in flower beds, damage to any of the doors. Christine, the oldest of the three kids, admitted it was possible she hadn\u2019t closed the back door when she\u2019d left that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cSorry to have bothered you for nothing, Chief,\u201d Mr. Hedberg said.</p><p>\u201cNo bother. You did the right thing by calling,\u201d he said, scratching Abraham\u2019s ears. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, and especially with the other burglaries, you shouldn\u2019t hesitate. It\u2019s good you have a dog, though,\u201d he added. \u201cVery effective deterrent, aren\u2019t you, boy?\u201d Abraham had wagged to show that yes, he was an excellent watchdog.</p><p>\u201cWe should give Abraham a steak,\u201d Andrew suggested. \u201cRight, Chief Cooper? Can I be a cop when I grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cOr a soldier! So I could kill the bad guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully all the bad guys will be gone when you grow up,\u201d Levi said, feeling the familiar awkwardness. Then he shook hands, told the family to have a good night and took a cruise through the neighborhood. Pru and Carl lived up the street, so he pulled into their driveway and knocked on the door. Abby answered.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, her face lighting up. \u201cWanna come in? Hang out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Abby, I can\u2019t. Are your parents home?\u201d</p><p>Her face darkened. \u201cThey\u2019re \u2018taking a nap,\u2019 okay?\u201d she said, making quote marks with her fingers. \u201cLike I\u2019m four and believe that. My father\u2019s living at my grandmother\u2019s house, but he comes over for conjugal visits. The noises, Levi. No matter how loud I turn up the TV, I swear I can still hear them. I cannot wait to go to college.\u201d</p><p>He suppressed a grin. \u201cWell, the Hedbergs thought someone might\u2019ve tried to break in, but there was no sign of anything missing. Even so, make sure the doors are locked, and you call me if you hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I know everything already. Katie just texted me. And secondly, I\u2019m not exactly the type to go investigating things that go bump in the night. I\u2019ve seen all the horror movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He gave her his best cop look. \u201cAnd how are you? You keeping on the straight and narrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Mmm-hmm.\u201d She was texting as she spoke. Irritating.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you do, Abby. One act of stupidity can have long-lasting implications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I\u2019ll totally think about that. Thanks. You\u2019ve changed my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a twit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m posting that you said that on my Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Abby. You don\u2019t want to get pregnant or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, I just remembered something! I\u2019m not your sister! I have plenty of adults to lecture me, okay? Don\u2019t be one of them. Just give me one of those hot looks instead, how about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d She held up her phone and clicked. Great. He\u2019d be on her Facebook page in seconds.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t his sister. She might end up as his niece, however.</p><p>Oh, shit. Where had that thought come from?</p><p>He backed out of the Vanderbeek\u2019s driveway. Thing was, yeah. He wasn\u2019t the tomcat type. It\u2019d be nice to get married, have a couple kids.</p><p>But this time, he had to pick wisely. Nina had said she loved him (though looking back, she said it in the same tone that she used in saying she loved pizza). Said she was ready to settle down. Liked the idea of small-town life. She figured she\u2019d get her master\u2019s in education, become a teacher. Yes to kids.</p><p>That had lasted three months.</p><p>He picked up his phone and called Sarah. \u201cHey. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Studying. How are you?\u201d There was an eagerness in her voice that bespoke loneliness. He could hear music in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. You alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Chem test tomorrow. My slutty roommate\u2019s with her boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a slut, Levi. So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking on you.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, her voice small.</p><p>\u201cI need advice,\u201d he said, surprising himself.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her tone was much happier all of a sudden. \u201cWhy? Did Faith dump your sorry ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Levi said, a smile threatening. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering if I want to be...I don\u2019t know. Runner-up.\u201d He winced, not sure he should be telling his sister this.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be runner-up? Oh, the Jeremy thing! Right! I got it.\u201d There was a rustle. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still hung up on him?\u201d</p><p>Levi hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, dummy! Just ask her. Then kiss the stuffing out of her, and she\u2019ll definitely pick you. Straight trumps g*y every time.\u201d</p><p>Levi laughed. \u201cGot it. How are you? Doing okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed so hard it practically ruffled his hair. \u201cAm I allowed to say no?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re still adjusting, that\u2019s all. You\u2019ll love college before long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot whatever, Sarah. You have to give it some effort, though.\u201d He tried to think of what Faith would say. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be homesick. But don\u2019t let that take away all the good things.\u201d There. That sounded pretty good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever, Sigmund. I have to study.\u201d Her voice was deflated.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll do great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Barely a grunt now.</p><p>He hung up, bemused. College was supposed to help with her grief, not make it worse. He didn\u2019t like knowing she was lonely.</p> <p>A sign told him he\u2019d driven out of Manningsport, across the little stretch of Osskill and into the town of Bryer. Looked like his subconscious had taken him for a little ride. A left at the intersection, two miles down, a right. This was the fourth time he\u2019d been here. Funny how familiar the drive was.</p><p>Nice neighborhood, built in the late sixties. Ranches and Capes, big yards, smallish houses, all very wholesome. Great place for trick-or-treating, unlike the trailer park, where things could be a little dicey. When he was seven, Jessica\u2019s dad had offered him a can of Pabst. From then on, Levi\u2019s mom had driven him and Jess into the Village on Halloween. That had ended when they were nine. They\u2019d each just happily accepted a regular-sized Mr. Goodbar (his favorite) and were leaving the porch of the giant old Vic when a voice came from the window. \u201cWho was it?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>The woman\u2014Mrs. Thomas\u2014answered, her voice sharp, \u201cIt was a couple of those trailer park kids. I wish their parents wouldn\u2019t drive them here. They take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Levi\u2019s face had grown hot, and Jess...Jess had looked as if someone had just punched her in the stomach. Without thinking, he\u2019d thrown his candy bar in the bushes, then hers. Taken her pillowcase and dumped it all right there, then did the same with his, even though the McCormicks had been really nice, complimenting him on the zombie makeup and telling him he\u2019d almost given them a heart attack, he was so scary. They\u2019d told Jess she looked beautiful.</p><p>Mrs. Thomas had broken her hip last spring, falling as she got out of the shower, and Levi had knelt on the floor next to her, the first person on the scene. He\u2019d covered her up with a bathrobe so the firefighters wouldn\u2019t see her naked, and she\u2019d cried as he did it, telling him he was so kind. He told her not to worry, wondering if she realized that the kind cop had once been one of those trailer park urchins who used up the treats meant for better kids.</p> <p>Levi slowed the cruiser, then pulled over. There was the house, a dark blue ranch with rhododendrons and a big maple tree, complete with swing. Lights were on in the living room, shining through the big window. A child\u2019s bike lay next to the mailbox, half on the street.</p><p>There was his father\u2019s wife, coming into the living room, handing someone a glass. His father, most likely. Their TV was on. Levi had never met the woman his father had married...only a glimpse of her twice before. She had fluffy blond hair and was on the skinny side.</p><p>There were no lights on in the bedrooms, which indicated the boys were asleep. Strange to think he had two half brothers. He\u2019d never met them, didn\u2019t know their names. He\u2019d seen them the first time he\u2019d come down the street, playing in the driveway with their Matchbox cars. They were young. That was about all he could see. He hadn\u2019t parked that time, just kept going, careful not to look too hard.</p><p>Levi\u2019s watch beeped. Ten o\u2019clock. He could be with Faith right now, and all of a sudden, the desire to see her closed in on his chest like a vise.</p><p>But before he left, he got out of the car, walked over to the bike and moved it so it wouldn\u2019t get run over.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, he was back at Jeremy\u2019s enormous house. \u201cSorry that took so long,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHey. Faith\u2019s asleep,\u201d Jeremy said, pointing.</p><p>Sure enough, she was, her head on the couch pillows, a soft-looking blanket over her.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d he asked, fighting a small pang of jealousy. A movie played softly on TV, something with that famous actress, the one who won all the Oscars.</p><p>\u201cJust tired,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHow was the call? Don\u2019t worry, she sleeps like the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Well, he knew that he could kiss her goodbye in the mornings and not have her so much as stir. Then again, he\u2019d managed to wake her a time or two in the middle of the night, and done his best to make her sleep-deprived.</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Of course you do. You want some food? We saved your steak.\u201d</p><p>We. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d He sat down in the chair, looking at Faith.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you guys serious?\u201d Jeremy asked softly.</p> <p>Levi took a breath and held it for a second. \u201cWe\u2019ve slept together a couple times, Jeremy.\u201d Six nights of the past eight, spent in the little apartment that looked as if she\u2019d lived there for years.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not really the type for a casual relationship, you know,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>\u201cListen, single g*y guy, I can take it from here, okay?\u201d He raised an eyebrow at his friend, who smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I understand. But maybe I could give you a little advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d The questioning look stayed on his friend\u2019s face. \u201cFine,\u201d Levi said. \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy adjusted the blanket around Faith\u2019s feet. \u201cLittle things mean a lot to her. Tell her she looks pretty or notice if she\u2019s wearing a new dress. Talk to her. Bring her flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t be sarcastic. She\u2019s fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think she\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Levi said, his words tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. I know her very well.\u201d Jeremy smiled, and for a nanosecond, Levi felt like punching him.</p><p>\u201cWell, if the advice portion of the evening is done, I think I\u2019ll take the delicate flower home,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cSure. I didn\u2019t mean to be a dick or anything. I just want you guys to work.\u201d</p><p>And that was the thing. Jeremy was a damn prince.</p><p>\u201cGot it. You wanna wake Sleeping Beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d Jeremy said in a loud voice, shaking her feet. \u201cFaith, honey, time to wake up. Come on, now. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Nothing from Faith, who appeared to be in a deep coma. \u201cFaith. Come on.\u201d Jeremy was practically shouting at her now.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a bucket of ice water?\u201d Levi suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I heard that. Don\u2019t throw anything at me,\u201d Faith muttered. \u201cI\u2019m here. What day is it?\u201d She struggled into a sitting position, frowning. Then she saw him, and her face softened. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>That urgent feeling of wanting he\u2019d had at his father\u2019s house, the need to be with her\u2014not necessarily to sleep with her, though that would be nice\u2014but just to touch her, have her close...that feeling was back. \u201cReady to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She leaned over and kissed Jeremy on the cheek. \u201cThanks for dinner. Sorry I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. It was like old times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cLevi, let me pack up your food.\u201d</p><p>When they got back to the Opera House, Levi followed her into her place. \u201cHi, handsome!\u201d she said to her leaping dog. \u201cWho\u2019s a good boy? Hmm? Give me two minutes, and we\u2019ll take a you-know-what.\u201d She went to the kitchen and got a glass of water, then scootched up onto the island counter, swinging her feet. \u201cI take it you\u2019re staying over?\u201d she said, pink staining her cheeks. She didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>Levi didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he walked over to her and wrapped his arms around her and just lay his head against her chest. Felt some of the tension drain from his muscles as he breathed in her warm, sweet smell.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Levi?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long tonight?\u201d</p><p>He imagined telling her about his father\u2019s other kids, the happy little family he wasn\u2019t part of. Maybe throw in some of the jealousy thing with Jeremy. Didn\u2019t really see the point, all that talk about problems and issues and whatnot.</p><p>And, to be honest, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted her to know. Her, or anyone. \u201cIt just took a while, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. He could stay here all day, against Faith\u2019s gorgeous rack, listening to her breathe. Kinda perfect.</p><p>Except for one thing. \u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog\u2019s trying to impregnate my leg.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound rich and warm. \u201cYou\u2019ll make beautiful puppies together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take him for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd come back here and fool around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d He looked into those dusk-blue eyes. \u201cYou want to go out with me tomorrow? On a date?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was a sight to see.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>THE MANNINGSPORT PUBLIC LIBRARY was closed on Saturday afternoons, but Faith had the code. Levi probably did, too, but he stood back and let her punch it in.</p><p>There was something magical about being in a library when no one else was around, she thought as they went through the darkened rooms to the children\u2019s section. That, and Levi\u2019s strong, calloused hand holding hers as the rain pattered on the roof. Holding hands for the first time. Funny, the sweet shock of such a small gesture.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all done, then?\u201d Levi said as she opened the back door to the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cAll done. The dedication is Wednesday night.\u201d She paused. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said.</p><p>His answer, while noncommittal, made her cheeks prickle with a blush just the same. \u201cWell, here it is. Take a look around.\u201d</p><p>The courtyard had been a bit of a challenge, since the space was so small. Previously, it\u2019d had a cement bench and an anemic flower bed of red geraniums (cemetery flowers, Faith always thought), as well as a germ-laden birdbath. Few people had ever used the space.</p><p>Now, watching Levi take in her work, Faith felt a warm swell of pride. In each corner was a Japanese maple tree, chosen for their manageable size and gorgeous foliage. Next week, Julianne had said, the kindergarten reading group would be making wind chimes to hang in the branches, and Topper Mack had already made four birdhouses, miniatures of the library.</p><p>In between each tree sat four mahogany and chestnut benches, made by Samuel Hastings. Faith had kept the carpenter busy this fall. Each bench had been donated by a founding family of Manningsport\u2014the Hollands, of course, the Mannings, the Meerings and the van Huesens. The southern wall had no window and, since it got the sun all day, had made the courtyard stifling; this was the wall where Faith had designed a sleek waterfall that ran in a smooth, fluid sheet, the sound soft and soothing.</p><p>In the bulk of the space, Faith had created a circular path lined with low boxwoods and paved with old brick, which led to the object that, in Faith\u2019s opinion, made the courtyard great: a life-size, bronze statue of Dr. Seuss, reading a copy of The Lorax as the furry little creature looked on.</p><p>Levi stood there now. \u201cDr. Seuss, huh?\u201d he said. His hair had darkened in the light rain. \u201cWhy him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s the greatest children\u2019s author in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my opinion, anyway. The library board seemed to agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday to You was my favorite,\u201d Levi said, brushing a fallen leaf off Dr. Seuss\u2019s foot. \u201cI used to read that after\u2014I read that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what?\u201d Faith asked, pulling her jacket closer.</p><p>He glanced over. \u201cAfter my father left,\u201d he said after a pause, looking back at the statue.</p><p>Right. She\u2019d always known Levi\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t in the picture, but he\u2019d never mentioned it before. Her heart tugged, picturing Levi as a little boy, reading the joyfully exuberant book to counteract the misery he must\u2019ve felt. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThis is really nice, Faith,\u201d he said after a minute. \u201cThe kids\u2019ll love it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looked like the subject of his father was off-limits. \u201cThanks.\u201d She paused. \u201cThe idea was to take a space that no one really saw and make it beautiful. Get people to appreciate what nature has to offer, get them away from their phones and computers and take a breath and listen to the birds and the water and just...be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what all your projects are supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess so. Yes.\u201d Now that she\u2019d said it out loud, it sounded a little dorky. Dorktastic, maybe. Hopefully.</p><p>Levi was looking at her steadily. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to go to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, coming back to reclaim her hand. \u201cA picnic. I checked with Honor, and she said the Barn at Blue Heron was free.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they were hiking up the hill. Levi held a good-sized brown bag with \u201cLorelei\u2019s\u201d stamped on one side, as well as a blanket. The late October rain had petered off to a drizzle, and it was incredibly romantic, a Saturday afternoon picnic on a chilly autumn day.</p><p>Despite the fact that she\u2019d worked on the barn for six solid weeks, the sight of it was still a small shock. The plants had withered from the cold\u2014it\u2019d been thirty degrees last night\u2014but it was still beautiful. Leaves had gathered on the roof in one corner; she\u2019d have to come up with a ladder and take care of that.</p><p>Levi spread out the blanket on the floor of the barn, then got to work, grabbing kindling from the little alcove next to the fireplace. Once the fire was blazing, he sat down. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStarving. Feed me, Chief.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, just a little, and Faith\u2019s heart gave a sweetly painful tug. Levi Cooper didn\u2019t smile enough. She\u2019d like to change that.</p><p>The wind gusted around them, sending puffs of smoke from the fireplace once in a while. They sat on the blanket and ate Lorelei\u2019s beautiful sandwiches, roast beef and horseradish mayonnaise with sharp cheddar cheese on a hard roll, egg salad with dill on a thick rye. A bag of potato chips, two bottles of iced tea. And, for dessert, chocolate cookies, thick and dark and chewy. Faith closed her eyes as she chewed. \u201cThese are proof of a loving God,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLorelei should be canonized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t make them,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>Faith opened her eyes. \u201cReally? Oh! Are these the source of that heavenly smell at three o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking, for the life of her, a little shy.</p> <p>\u201cGood job, big man,\u201d she said. \u201cI should tell Barb at the newspaper. \u2018Chief Cooper\u2019s Baking Secrets\u2019 or \u2018War Hero Secretly a Midnight Baker.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d There was that almost-smile again.</p><p>\u201cWhy? The townspeople would love it. Don\u2019t hide your light under a bushel, Chief Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, woman. Close your eyes and eat another. You\u2019re fun to watch.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, trying not to think of her thighs and the effect these cookies would have. It was worth it. When she opened her eyes, Levi was looking at her, his face solemn, two lines running between his brows. His eyes looked gray today, same color as the sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you a tease that day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The memory knifed into her heart. That day, when he\u2019d given her the kiss that had so stunned her, not far from this very place. She swallowed the cookie in a lump. \u201cThat was a long time ago, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it, a little. Thought about it a few times over the years.\u201d He looked at the fire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my finest moment. I\u2019d just kissed my best friend\u2019s girlfriend, and I wanted someone to blame. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered. The fire popped and hissed. Shoot. Now or never. \u201cLevi, is this a relationship, or are we just fooling around?\u201d</p><p>Because if it wasn\u2019t a relationship, she\u2019d better lasso her heart and bring it back to the stable, since it was obvious that thing was galloping away.</p><p>He looked at her with some difficulty, it seemed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Are you staying in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I have to take care of some things first. I want to stay, though.\u201d More than ever now.</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re...friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want us to be? Friends?\u201d He wadded up the paper bag and tossed it into the fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be your friend my whole life,\u201d she said, her throat abruptly tight.</p><p>He looked at her sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. His face was in its familiar solemn lines, forehead slightly crinkled with a question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You were... I don\u2019t know.\u201d And she didn\u2019t. He\u2019d been one of the cool kids, of course, but there was something more to him. Something different. \u201cThere was one time, when I had a seizure. Maybe third grade? Yeah, because Mrs. G. was our teacher.\u201d Levi nodded. \u201cAnd what I remember when I came out of it was you, telling people to back off and stop staring.\u201d She looked at him, and his face was gentle now. \u201cDo you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I do, obviously. But other than that, and especially when I was with Jeremy, you never seemed to like me.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the string edges of the blanket. Quite fascinating. Faith braided three of them together, then found her hand covered by Levi\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI like you now, Faith.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see him smiling, just a little. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels like we\u2019re more than friends, though.\u201d</p><p>There was the rush of golden heat, fast and heavy. She nodded.</p><p>He pulled her against him, and the nice clean smell of him, soap and smoke, made her chest ache. There was a little bit of dried leaf on his flannel shirt, and she brushed it off, her heart feeling fragile and new in her chest.</p><p>Then she kissed him. His mouth was firm and smooth and so, so good at what it was doing, and that golden heat filled her, making her warm and slow and lazy with its sweetness.</p><p>And heck, there was a fire and a blanket and a beautiful man, and now rain pattered on the clear roof of the barn, and if there was a better place to make love, Faith didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p>A good while later, the patter had turned into a steady rush, blowing the last of the leaves onto the roof. Blue lay on his back in front of the fire, dreaming of being a ball boy at the U.S. Open, his paws twitching. Faith was against Levi\u2019s side, her head on his shoulder, warm and sleepy from the heat of the fire and her man\u2019s warmth.</p><p>Yep. Her man. That worked.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Levi\u2019s voice was just a rumble in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to have a seizure? You don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She tucked a bit of hair behind her ear. The question was familiar. \u201cAt first, I have what they call the aura. I get worried, like something really bad\u2019s about to happen. Doomsday bad. I can feel my body doing things\u2014I know I pull at my shirt, and I feel almost panicky, and then I just...check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just...empty.\u201d She ran her hand over his smooth skin, feeling the muscles underneath. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny is how people act afterward. Or during, I guess, but I only see them afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they act?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt depends on the person. You were pretty good. Kind of perfect, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d There was that lovely smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Especially from the over-eighty crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. How do other people act?\u201d</p><p>She thought a minute. \u201cWell, when we were little, Jack would stay away from me, like I was about to burst into flames. Except, of course, for the time he filmed me for a Boy Scout badge or something. My mother almost killed him. Pru was pretty good. Honor...it\u2019s funny, Honor would cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor cries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow about your parents?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Dad would look like I\u2019d died and come back. He\u2019d be totally spent and relieved. I think it was harder on him than on me. And my mom would be...well.\u201d Faith stopped. The rain was harder now.</p><p>\u201cMom would be what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be mad.\u201d It felt sacrilegious, saying something negative about her dead mother.</p><p>Levi rolled over to look at her. The frown lines and crinkled forehead were back. \u201cYour mother couldn\u2019t have been mad at you because you had a seizure, Faith,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not. Mad that I had epilepsy, mad at the universe maybe. But it used to seem like she was mad at me.\u201d She gave a small shrug. \u201cBut no, she probably wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine being mad at your kid because she had a seizure?\u201d</p><p>The image of a little girl with sleepy green eyes came to her, so clear that she sucked in a breath, then cleared her throat. \u201cNo. Anyway. Let\u2019s change the subject.\u201d She paused. \u201cMy turn for a question. How\u2019d you do in Afghanistan?\u201d</p><p>His eyes changed, as if a door had closed. A second ago, they\u2019d been gentle and kind...now, there was nothing in them. \u201cI did fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t talk about the war, then.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a second. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how to answer when people ask that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many tours did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in Afghanistan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cWere you ever scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you met your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else. Faith waited. Waited a little more. \u201cYou can tell me about it, you know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wanted. What you had to do over there, how you feel about it, or your wife, your mom, your father...whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and started dressing. \u201cThere\u2019s really not much to tell.\u201d</p><p>Looked like the intimacy portion of the afternoon had ended. \u201cWell, if the mood ever strikes to go into a bit more detail, I\u2019m just saying you can, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d His movements were sharp and hard.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s coming through loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not everyone sits around feeling the feelings, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a jab at me?\u201d</p><p>He stopped buttoning his shirt. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have bad dreams?\u201d she asked, unable to stop. \u201cIs that why you bake in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a long minute, his smile gone. \u201cYes,\u201d he said eventually.</p><p>She waited for more. Nothing came. She waited some more. \u201cYou could wake me up, too,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sleeping over, that is.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her solemnly. \u201cI don\u2019t have those dreams when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>The words went straight to her heart\u2014a gift, even if he didn\u2019t seem to realize it.</p><p>His phone rang. Dang it all\u2014just when they were getting somewhere. He groped for the evil little device, and honestly, wasn\u2019t Everett ever on? \u201cChief Cooper. Hey. Sure, what\u2019s up? Yeah, okay, I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Faith suppressed a sigh. She shouldn\u2019t complain; the guy was the police chief. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cAlice McPhales thinks there\u2019s a man in her woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mrs. McPhales, her Girl Scout leader. Seemed like her Alzheimer\u2019s was worsening; Faith had gone over the week before to cut back her plants for winter. The sweet old lady had made her tea but had forgotten the tea bag, so Faith, not wanting to upset her, had just drunk the hot water. \u201cWant me to come with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Levi glanced up at the clear ceiling. \u201cNo, it\u2019s really pouring. I\u2019ll just tramp around in the woods and reassure her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d The word home had never sounded nicer.</p><p>Tiling her chin up, he looked at her steadily. \u201cI had a really nice time with you today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk you back to your dad\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get this all cleaned up. Put out the fire and all that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her quickly, and again more slowly, then left her alone with the sound of the rain and the smell of wet leaves and wood smoke.</p><p>WHEN LEVI LEFT THE STATION after filling out a report or six, it was dark. The rain had blown off across the lake, leaving behind a clear, moonless sky. Lights were on in Faith\u2019s apartment, he noted as he crossed the green. He stopped, looking up. It was a skill he was getting pretty good at, this spying\u2014first his father\u2019s house, now her funky little apartment. From where he was, he could see part of the red wall, a bit of the bookcase where she displayed all those family photos.</p> <p>And the rose quartz heart he\u2019d given her.</p><p>He should probably cop to that.</p><p>There she was, the phone tucked under her ear as she walked, a carton of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s in one hand\u2014she had six of them in her freezer last time he checked, and not one green vegetable\u2014a spoon in the other. She was laughing, and Levi felt a blade of lust knife through him. He loved when Faith laughed. She had such a girl-next-door face, but when she laughed, she looked\u2014and sounded\u2014like a sex kitten, and the husky sound of her voice seemed to have an electric effect on his groin.</p><p>His phone rang, and he jumped, then answered it. \u201cChief Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Cooper here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hon, how you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Got an A minus on my chemistry test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you so. Good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the cookies. I\u2019m getting fat. Fatter, I should say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing?\u201d There was that lonely note in her voice again. \u201cYou at the station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m staring up at Faith\u2019s windows, watching her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalker-ish of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a police officer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt being pathetic, you mean? Because that sounds totally pathetic. You about to burst into verse? \u2018What light through yonder window breaks\u2019 and all that crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad. You\u2019re still coming up for dinner this week, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When did I say I\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi!\u201d his sister barked. \u201cYou said you\u2019d come for dinner! Since you banned me from coming home before Thanksgiving, which is still weeks away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t come this week. I have a budget meeting tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuesday I\u2019m on call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner with Faith\u2019s family.\u201d Shit. He shouldn\u2019t have admitted that.</p><p>\u201cHow cozy,\u201d Sarah said, her voice thick with tears. \u201cThursday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn call again, honey. Come on. I didn\u2019t say this week. I said sometime before Thanksgiving, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Don\u2019t come up. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll make new friends and be happy and you don\u2019t have to worry about me at all. Okay? Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, don\u2019t be so\u2014\u201d Great. She\u2019d hung up. He called her back, but it went right to voice mail. Texted her. Please stop being an ass. He waited. She didn\u2019t write back. He waited another minute or two.</p><p>With a sigh, he texted again. How about friday?</p><p>Seconds later, his phone chimed. fridays great. xoxox</p><p>Tucking his phone into his pocket, he crossed the rest of the green. Into the Opera House, up the stairs and straight to Faith\u2019s apartment. Knocked, causing Blue to bark wildly.</p><p>A second later, Faith answered the door, still on the phone. Her hair was in a ponytail, and the Dalmatian pj\u2019s were topped with a skimpy little tank top that barely contained the mighty rack. She looked, in other words, like the start of a particularly good p**n o.</p><p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Manningsport\u2019s hottest cop,\u201d she said into the phone, stepping aside so he could come in. \u201cNo, not in uniform, alas. Flannel. Has a sort of lumberjack appeal, though. No, I totally agree. Dresses like a straight guy. Well, then again, so did you.\u201d She laughed merrily. \u201cHi,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cIt\u2019s Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing the one-word answer thing,\u201d she said into the phone. \u201cNo, he\u2019s scowling. It works.\u201d She held the phone out to him. \u201cJeremy wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Levi didn\u2019t want to talk, not to Jeremy, not to her. He took the phone, clicked it off and tossed it onto the chair, then wrapped his arms around Faith, slid his hands down her generous ass, pushed her against the wall and kissed her smooth, beautiful neck, then licked the same spot.</p><p>Blue began trying to get in on the action, so, without releasing her, Levi turned, grabbed a pillow from the couch and tossed it on the floor. Blue took the hint. Then Levi slid his hands up her front, feeling her ni**les harden under his palms. \u201cYou like this shirt?\u201d he muttered, his lips just below her ear.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she whispered, her voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He grabbed the neckline with two hands and ripped it open, and without further ado, she wrapped herself around him and gave as good as she got.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>LEVI HADN\u2019T EXPECTED to see Jeremy when he and Faith went for dinner at her father\u2019s house.</p><p>He was already a little itchy with the whole family thing. He\u2019d had dinner with the Hollands a time or two over the years, but he never could shake that feeling he\u2019d had as a kid\u2014the big house on the Hill, off-limits except when the doors were opened to the great unwashed. The sight of Jeremy there, acting like a son-in-law, made it worse.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said tightly as Jeremy greeted him with a clap on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, buddy,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cGlass of wine?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer, just sauntered away.</p><p>\u201cOops. Mrs. Johnson is flagging me down,\u201d Faith said, slipping off herself. The housekeeper gave him a death stare, then melted back into the kitchen.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Levi liked the Holland family quite a lot. But now that he was Faith\u2019s...whatever...it was a lot more awkward. Jack gave him a pained glance, then returned his gaze to his beer; Ned and Abby were bickering over by a window seat.</p><p>Jeremy returned and handed Levi a glass of wine, seeming as comfortable here as he was at his own place down the road. The fact that he\u2019d left Faith at the altar seemed to have been forgiven. Levi mentally chastised himself; the elder Lyons lived in California, and the Hollands were as close to family as Jeremy had around here.</p><p>\u201cHi, Levi,\u201d Honor said, emerging from the kitchen. Her voice was neither more nor less friendly than always.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard you\u2019re banging my sister,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUh...I\u2019ll let her respond to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s ready to kill you. Beware.\u201d Honor went over to her dad and handed him a glass of wine. John glanced at Levi and gave him a steely nod.</p><p>Right. Well, to the kitchen it was, then.</p><p>\u201cI fail to see how this is sexy,\u201d Prudence was saying. \u201cI look like a plucked chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you would do such a thing, I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said, opening the freezer and handing Pru a bag of peas. \u201cYou girls today are a terrible mystery.\u201d</p><p>Pru put the bag on her crotch. For the love of... \u201cHey, Levi!\u201d she said amiably. \u201cGot a bikini wax today. I do not recommend it. The pain was unbelievable! I swear the woman was enjoying it, all that ripping and tearing. Shoot, these are cold! I might be getting frostbite.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d think that four tours would\u2019ve steeled him for such a mental image. They didn\u2019t. \u201cHi,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Johnson, say hello to Levi,\u201d Faith said, coming over to his side.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Chief Cooper,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. \u201cWhat are you doing in my kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here for dinner.\u201d Faith slid her arm around his waist, her warm, sweet smell coming to him. \u201cHe\u2019s my honey.\u201d</p><p>Her honey, was it? Sounded kind of...nice.</p><p>\u201cWhich does not answer the question of why he\u2019s standing right in front of the salt potatoes when they\u2019re nearly ready. Shoo, Chief! Get out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the peas, Mrs. J.,\u201d Pru said. \u201cWant them back in the freezer or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow them away, child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Pru said, walking like a cowboy after a hard day in the saddle. \u201cWaste not, want not, I always thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Goggy and Pops are here!\u201d Faith said, abandoning Levi yet again.</p><p>The housekeeper gave him another glare. \u201cWell? Go. What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>An eternity later, the Holland family, Jeremy and Levi were jammed around the dining room table. Old Mr. and Mrs. Holland, John, Pru, Ned and Abby, Honor and Jack. And Faith, flanked by Jeremy and himself.</p><p>\u201cFaith, we never see you anymore,\u201d Mrs. Holland said.</p><p>\u201cI was over yesterday,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou young people. Always so busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? She should be busy. Before she knows it, she\u2019ll end up trapped for sixty-five years,\u201d Mr. Holland said.</p><p>\u201cDad, knock it off,\u201d John said patiently. \u201cJack, pass the bread, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Ned, stop it!\u201d Abby barked. \u201cMom! He\u2019s kicking me under the table!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed, for crying out loud, you\u2019re a legal adult,\u201d Pru snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t make me get up to hit you. I\u2019m totally chafed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege, college, college,\u201d Abby chanted, putting her fingers in her ears. He smiled at her, only to have her glare back at him. He\u2019d just given her the sentence for her foray into underage drinking: twelve hours of community service.</p><p>His head was starting to ache from the din of approximately six separate conversations in which everyone spoke at once and no one listened. He glanced at his watch, wondering how long they\u2019d have to stay.</p><p>\u201cLevi, just what are your intentions toward my daughter?\u201d John asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Faith sighed. \u201cCome on. We talked about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d John stared expectantly. \u201cI think I have the right to know what your plans are. Faith is my daughter. My princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Faith, where is that crown, by the way?\u201d Jack asked, taking more potatoes.</p><p>Pru snorted. \u201cHonor, did Dad ever call you his princess? I\u2019m pretty sure I was never called princess by anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe only Faith holds that title,\u201d Honor said.</p><p>\u201cGirls, don\u2019t be ridiculous. You\u2019re all three my princesses. Levi? Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to date her, sir,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever that means these days,\u201d John grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt means sex,\u201d Abby added, getting an elbow from her mother. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow can I not be aware of it when you and Daddy are doing it all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Faith,\u201d said Mrs. Holland, \u201cI think you should date a long, long time. Your grandfather took me for two walks before we were married. I wish I\u2019d gotten to know him first, rather than count on my parents\u2019 judgment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you guys were an arranged marriage?\u201d Abby asked, perking up.</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Mrs. Holland said. \u201cYou think I would\u2019ve married him if my parents weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDying to get rid of her?\u201d Mr. Holland interjected.</p><p>\u201c\u2014pressuring me to marry him for his land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, your mother and I were a love match, kids,\u201d John said loudly, clearly trying to drown out his parents. \u201cLove at first sight, as they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Faith and Jeremy,\u201d Abby said. Levi felt his jaw locking. Jeremy smiled and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAbby, why are your panties in a twist?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cLevi\u2019s making me clean the tourist restrooms, that\u2019s why! I screw up one time, and I have to clean bathrooms!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you shouldn\u2019t go drinking with idiot boys, then, huh?\u201d Ned said.</p> <p>\u201cAt least I wasn\u2019t sleeping with anyone, Ned! I read your texts the other day. You and Sarah Cooper are so cute.\u201d</p><p>Levi felt his hackles rise.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only friends,\u201d Ned said, his voice panicky.</p><p>\u201cDo not distract my sister, Ned,\u201d Levi ground out. \u201cAnd do not sleep with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I wouldn\u2019t. Abby doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. She\u2019s an idiot, right, Abs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan everyone just settle down?\u201d Honor said calmly. \u201cLevi\u2019s our guest tonight. Let\u2019s save the reality of Holland family life for another time. Dad, Levi\u2019s dating Faith, he\u2019s her first boyfriend since the g*y ruined her for other men, she\u2019s thirty years old, and you already have one spinster daughter, so get over it.\u201d She picked up her fork and took another bite of potatoes.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d John said after a minute. \u201cSorry, Levi. I just... She\u2019s my daughter, that\u2019s all. I want the best for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d His watch must be broken.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d John continued, \u201cwho planted those chrysanthemums on your mother\u2019s grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Honor said.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful color, honey.\u201d He sighed. \u201cHard to believe it\u2019ll be twenty years in June.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the dating going, Dad?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cSince the transvestite, you mean?\u201d he answered, which went right over Levi\u2019s head. He supposed he should be grateful. \u201cWell,\u201d John continued, \u201cI think I\u2019ve given it a good shot, but I\u2019m probably happier alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Dad, no! Don\u2019t give up,\u201d Faith said. \u201cYou said that the lady from Corning was really nice. Please give me another chance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let Lorena back in the house,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThat woman makes my testicles retract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreach it, Uncle J.,\u201d Ned murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine on my own,\u201d John said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Faithie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, you live with a daughter and a housekeeper. You\u2019re not exactly on your own,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. I have Honor and Mrs. J. and all you kids.\u201d His eyes grew distant. \u201cConnie was the love of my life. You only get one of those, and you can\u2019t replace it just because you want to.\u201d</p><p>THEY WERE FINALLY ABLE to leave a decade or so later (after Jeremy had kissed Faith robustly on each cheek and hugged her. Levi was seriously considering punching him). Faith, though, had been a little...wan.</p><p>The full moon turned the landscape blue and white, casting wide shadows of the house, the trees. \u201cThanks for asking me to come tonight,\u201d Levi said, holding the car door for her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Sorry if it was...a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice,\u201d he lied. \u201cDid you have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>Seemed he wasn\u2019t the only liar in the car. She was quiet on the short drive home, quiet as they went into the Opera House, quiet as she unlocked her door. \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He leaned against the door frame, frowning. \u201cIs everything okay, Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course it is.\u201d Her eyes didn\u2019t meet his.</p><p>\u201cSeems like something\u2019s the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Something was very much the matter. \u201cYou feel okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been taking your meds?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Want to count them and make sure?\u201d Her voice was sharp.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked at her another minute, ignoring Blue, who was nosing his leg for a little lovin\u2019. \u201cMaybe I should stay at my place tonight,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks for coming tonight. Um...sleep well.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek and closed the door.</p><p>Well, shit. He\u2019d screwed up somehow. Maybe he hadn\u2019t talked enough. Maybe...he hated this next thought...maybe Jeremy was on her mind. Obviously, Jeremy wasn\u2019t exactly a rival, but he was still her buddy, still completely at home with her family, still here if she wanted to fall asleep on his couch. Love at first sight, love of her life. You only get one of those, according to John Holland.</p><p>He went into his own apartment, which suddenly seemed very bland. Sure, he had his own family photos here and there. But he didn\u2019t collect little treasures the way Faith did, didn\u2019t keep too much from the past. He was a guy, after all.</p><p>A guy who was in trouble with the woman across the hall for reasons unclear to him. She\u2019d pried some information out of him the other day up at the barn, had seemed intent on digging, and now she kinda wasn\u2019t talking to him.</p><p>Time to bake cookies.</p><p>When Levi was little, most of their desserts had come from a Hostess box, especially after Sarah arrived on the scene. But his mother had this one recipe, and she could whip a batch together in seconds, it had seemed. Levi\u2019s job had been to put the ingredients on the table, then stand back and watch, and maybe lick off the rubber spatula.</p><p>He took out the flour, the squares of unsweetened chocolate, sugar, vanilla. Eggs from the fridge.</p><p>A knock came on the door. He answered it, and there she was. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about my mom\u2019s accident?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cUh...you want to come in, Faith?\u201d She did. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said, and she obeyed, perching stiffly in the middle of the couch cushion, like she\u2019d forgotten what a couch was for. He sat down in the chair opposite from her and leaned forward.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look right.</p><p>\u201cSo did you ever hear anything about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. The guidance counselor talked to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...he said you guys were T-boned, and your mom died right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d Her eyes were bleak.</p><p>Levi ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYou had a seizure, right? You didn\u2019t remember anything. The fire department had to cut you out. We weren\u2019t supposed to bring it up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Kept nodding. Hadn\u2019t really looked at him since she came in.</p><p>\u201cFaith, are you okay? You don\u2019t seem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a seizure. I lied about that. I told my father I did because I didn\u2019t want to tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>The oven ticked as it preheated. \u201cAnd what was that?\u201d Levi asked.</p><p>\u201cI made her crash.\u201d</p><p>Those four words seemed to be torn out of the deepest part of her. Her face didn\u2019t change, but her eyes were desolate.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d he asked as gently as he knew how.</p><p>\u201cI was mad,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk to her, and she turned around, because I was sitting in the back. She asked me if I was okay, and I didn\u2019t answer.\u201d Faith swallowed. \u201cShe thought I was about to have a seizure, because I space out before one, as you know. So I let her think that. And then we got hit.\u201d Her face was white, her bloodless hands knotted hard in her lap.</p><p>\u201cFaith, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to leave my father.\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit. \u201cShe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t how Levi remembered Constance Holland from the few times he\u2019d seen her. She\u2019d seemed to be the Disney Channel\u2019s version of a mom\u2014pretty, happy, wisecracking and capable.</p><p>Or maybe he was confusing her with his mom.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t answer her.\u201d Faith\u2019s voice was hollow. \u201cShe kept talking about how it\u2019d been a mistake to get married so young, how she always wanted to do more but got stuck with us. I let her think I was about to have a seizure so she\u2019d stop talking. And then we got hit.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face was like an iron spike going through his heart. \u201cFaith, you were a kid. You can\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew what I was doing. I wanted her to feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as wanting her to die.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cNo. But I\u2019m responsible all the same. When I came back here in September, I thought if I found Dad someone else, maybe I could make up for it. But I haven\u2019t. My dad worships her memory\u2014Jack and my sisters do, too.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that seemed true. \u201cYou never told anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I... When my father came to the hospital, he was so...broken, and I was afraid he\u2019d stop loving me if he knew. So I lied.\u201d She dropped her gaze to the floor. \u201cI just wanted you to know. I don\u2019t want you to tell me how it wasn\u2019t really my fault. I know what I did.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say to that.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say anything,\u201d she said, her voice level now, and somehow that hurt his heart more than ever. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to know how she really felt.\u201d</p><p>Levi ran his hand through his hair again. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go home, actually,\u201d she said. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d She stood up, and he did, too, pulling her into a hug. She felt cold and brittle, Faith who was all soft and sweet and warm.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he said one more time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you tomorrow, maybe.\u201d And with that, she opened his door and went across to her own apartment.</p><p>The quiet of the night settled around him.</p><p>Faith\u2019s mother had been dead for twenty years. That was a long time to keep a secret.</p><p>The cookies would have to wait. Levi turned off the oven, grabbed his car keys and headed for the police station.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>THE DAY HER MOTHER had died had been utterly normal except that Faith had needed shoes.</p><p>Faith had always loved being the baby of the family. In exchange for all the fun things the rest of them had done before she was born or when she was tiny, it seemed only fair that she got special treatment. She knew her family viewed her as vaguely cute but somewhat useless. Mom still never asked her to start supper...only Honor could do that (and had been doing it for years, as her older sister liked to point out). Jack was in college learning how to make wine and already knew cool stuff like how to fix the harvester and clean the thresher. Prudence was a grown-up, married and everything.</p><p>So Faith got to be the cute one. Her parents\u2019 attention was spread thin, and Faith used it to get away with stuff...not being a straight-A student, for example, unlike her siblings. Not going to bed on time, because who really noticed? She didn\u2019t have to eat all her vegetables, because with four kids over seventeen years, her parents were a little weary of enforcing the rules.</p><p>Her epilepsy got her the kind of attention she didn\u2019t want\u2014the panicky eyes from Dad, the short, sharp orders from Mom. She\u2019d take some benign neglect any day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the day she needed shoes would be, she hoped, one of those rare and special times when she and Mom could do something, just the two of them, like those cloudy, lovely memories from when everyone else was in school, and Faith was her mom\u2019s little shadow. Maybe they\u2019d stretch the day out, get some ice cream at the cute place on Market Street.</p><p>Instead, Mom had been in a mood. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can try on every pair in the store, Faith,\u201d she said as they pulled into the parking lot. \u201cI have a thousand things to do today. Why you couldn\u2019t have told me you needed these last week, when I had to come to this exact same place when Jack was home...\u201d</p><p>And so Faith had ended up with a pair of not-bad sneakers, though she hadn\u2019t been one hundred percent sure she wanted those and not the cute Reeboks with the pink laces. No time for ice cream, just back in the car. \u201cYou can sit in the front, you know,\u201d Mom said, a trifle impatiently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Faith said. She\u2019d gotten in back automatically, accustomed to being low man on the totem pole when it came to the shotgun seat. It was a move that saved her life, the firefighters would say later.</p> <p>But still, Faith had new sneakers. She always felt as if she could run faster in new sneakers, and gym was on Tuesday. Jessica Dunn was the fastest girl in their class and often made fun of the way Faith ran, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice to run faster than Jessica, just once? Not that it was possible, but still...just once.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you see the world before you settle down, Faith,\u201d Mom said abruptly from the front seat. \u201cI told Prudence the same thing, and did she listen? No. You get married young, and your options are severely limited.\u201d</p><p>Faith frowned. Why would her mother say something like that? Pru and Carl were so cute. Plus, Faith was an aunt already. Everyone at school had been jealous. Possibly even Jessica Dunn.</p><p>Mom glanced in the rearview mirror. \u201cYou should see the world when you still can. This is a huge country, though if you asked anyone in the Holland family, they\u2019d probably tell you the earth falls into an abyss if you cross the county line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it here,\u201d Faith objected. She took a new shoe out of the box and stroked the pure white shoelace. Should\u2019ve gotten pink. Or maybe not. Maybe pink was babyish.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019ve never seen anywhere else, have you?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cThere are other places worth seeing, too, you know. Pru would have to be dragged kicking and screaming off the vineyard, and your brother\u2019s already a lost cause, but you and Honor don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s voice went on and on and on. And the thing was, Faith wanted to stay. Where else was better than home? She\u2019d already been to New York City on a field trip just a month ago. Levi Cooper and Jessica had gotten caught kissing in the back of the bus, which was bad enough (Faith still played with dolls...kissing? Gross!). The city had been so loud and hot; Manningsport seemed like heaven when they got back.</p><p>\u201cThere are days when all I can do is think about how nice it\u2019d be to live somewhere else. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to live in a city? Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, all these places I\u2019ve never even seen. And what does your father do? He laughs when I talk about it.\u201d Mom\u2019s voice was inescapable. \u201cThat\u2019s why you should live a little before you settle down. You\u2019ll regret it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Faith looked out the window. Daddy was perfect. He never seemed impatient or short. He always said Faith was his princess. And he loved Mom! He picked her flowers! Faith turned her eyes to the scenery outside, where black-and-white cows gazed placidly at their minivan. Leave here? Never.</p><p>Mom glanced in the rearview mirror. \u201cIt could be just us three,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, me and Honor. Girl power.\u201d</p><p>White-hot anger flashed like lightning. Oh, so now Mom was leaving? Fine! They\u2019d be fine without her! And girl power? Is that what she called divorce?</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you so quiet?\u201d her mother asked, as if she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Faith didn\u2019t look away from the fields. No, she didn\u2019t think she would answer at all. Mom could suck it up.</p><p>\u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s right. Call me honey, Faith thought. You should, after all that mean talk. From the corner of her eye, Faith saw Mom put a hand on the back of the passenger seat to turn around more fully. \u201cFaith?\u201d</p><p>Nope. Not gonna answer.</p><p>And then there was a slam, so loud it was like an explosion, and they were spinning, and the ground wasn\u2019t where it was supposed to be, and the noise, the screeching and crashing, they were tumbling so fast it felt like she was in a dryer, arms and legs flopping helplessly, the seat belt hurt, grinding into her shoulder, her new shoe hit her in the side of the face, and God, they were still rolling and bouncing, someone stop that horrible noise, the grinding and crunching, it was awful.</p><p>And then they stopped, and the noise stopped, too, except a hissing sound and someone\u2019s gasping little screams. She was dizzy, on an angle. There was a tree in the car with her, a chunk of the bark gouged out.</p><p>They\u2019d been in an accident. That was it.</p><p>She was the one making the noise. Faith wrestled her mouth closed and stopped those awful little scream-gasps. Was she still in the backseat? Because the car didn\u2019t look like the car anymore, bent around her, torn upholstery, wires and broken glass everywhere. It was crushed around her; the place where her seat belt fastened hidden in twisted metal. She seemed to be on her side, and her chest hurt. She could move her legs, if not see her feet. The door handle was against the ground.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t get out, in other words.</p><p>\u201cMommy?\u201d Her voice was weak and high. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>\u201cMom? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>No answer. No sounds at all, not even moaning. \u201cOh, Mommy, please, please,\u201d she heard herself say, and suddenly she was shivering and damp and could smell pee. She\u2019d wet herself.</p><p>There. There was her mother\u2019s hair, almost the same color as Faith\u2019s, a few feet in front of her face, just out of reach. Faith\u2019s fingers strained, but the car was trapping her. \u201cMommy,\u201d she whispered, and she didn\u2019t like the sound of her voice, not one bit.</p><p>Then she looked out the broken windshield, and there was her mother, standing in the field, completely unharmed, smiling and beautiful. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cMommy, get me out!\u201d she called, trying to pull herself from the mess of the car, tugging on her seat belt strap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou\u2019re fine. I love you!\u201d</p><p>Then she blew Faith a kiss. Why was she so happy when they\u2019d just been in an accident? Faith looked back at the hair in the front seat.</p><p>It was still there.</p><p>When she looked out the windshield again, the field was empty, and Faith understood in a sudden, wrenching tear.</p><p>Her mother was dead.</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d she cried, her voice so thin and ruined. \u201cOh, Mommy, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She stopped trying to get out.</p><p>No one came to help. For a very long time, the only sound was the birds and the wind. Horribly, the clock on the dashboard still worked, so Faith was all too aware of the time that passed. Fifty-two minutes before someone called out, \u201cAre you okay? Hello? Can you hear me?\u201d She wasn\u2019t able to answer, because then she\u2019d have to give the news that Mommy had died. Sixty-three minutes before she heard sirens in the distance. Sixty-eight minutes before Mr. Stoakes from the candy store appeared in the windshield, strange in his firefighter clothes, and said, \u201cOh, God, no. Oh, no,\u201d before he saw Faith looking at him.</p><p>Seventy-four minutes when they started cutting with the noisy tools, yelling reassuringly to her, their faces telling the true story.</p><p>A hundred and fifteen minutes before they lifted Faith out.</p><p>Two hours with her mother\u2019s body, two hours spent shivering and sobbing, fading in and out of shock. Two hours of whispering how sorry she was.</p><p>When she saw her father\u2019s face at the hospital, when she saw how old he\u2019d become since morning, when he\u2019d held her bruised hand, she told him she\u2019d had a seizure and didn\u2019t remember anything.</p><p>Better for him to think that than to know his daughter was a murderer.</p><p>THREE O\u2019CLOCK IN THE morning. The loneliest time, even with an eighty pound Golden retriever taking up two-thirds of the bed.</p><p>Since telling Levi, a strange, heavy fog seemed to be pressing on Faith\u2019s brain. For twenty years, she\u2019d tried to avoid indulging in memories of her mother, feeling almost like she didn\u2019t deserve them. But tonight, images of her mother, good and bad, flickered through her brain like a faulty movie\u2014Mom in the kitchen, ferociously scrubbing the sink after dinner, mad at someone. At bath time, when Faith was really small, laughing as she draped the face cloth on Faith\u2019s head. Chastising her over a teacher\u2019s comment about Faith being inattentive in class. Clapping for her as she rode her bike around the giant tree in the front yard for the first time. Sitting on the couch, reading to Honor, even though Honor could read by herself. Crying as she folded Jack\u2019s laundry before he left for college. Holding baby Ned in the hospital after he was born, her eyes so shiny as she smiled at Pru.</p><p>Kissing Dad in the back hall, then laughing, telling him he needed a shower.</p><p>Had Mom really been so unhappy? Had she really viewed her life as a mistake, filled with regret and bitterness?</p><p>It never seemed that way.</p><p>Suddenly, Blue leaped off the bed and raced out of the room. She heard his toenails clicking on the floor, then his bark. Feeling old and weary, Faith pushed the covers back and got out of bed.</p><p>A quiet knock came at the door.</p><p>It was Levi. \u201cGot a second?\u201d he asked, as if it wasn\u2019t the middle of the night.</p><p>She looked at him a long minute, then held the door open. He had a file and a laptop, but her brain felt too heavy to ask why.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he said, turning on the light that hung over the table, making her squint.</p><p>She sat. \u201cWould you like coffee or anything?\u201d she asked, her voice odd to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d How oddly formal they were being. He sat down, too, and put the folder on the table, then tapped it, looking at her solemnly. \u201cThis is your mother\u2019s accident report. It was in the storage place out on Route 54. Took me a little while to find it.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at it. \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t want to look at that, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might.\u201d He looked at her, then ran his hand through his hair, frowning.</p><p>Blue put his head in her lap and wagged, and she petted his beautiful head, not looking at Levi.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said you were responsible...why did you think that? The guy who hit you, Kevin Hart. He ran the stop sign. So why was the accident your fault?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, oddly wary. His gaze was steady, that slight frown creasing his forehead. \u201cBecause,\u201d she said, \u201cmy mother would\u2019ve seen him coming if she hadn\u2019t been looking at me, and she could\u2019ve stopped or swerved.\u201d</p><p>Mom would\u2019ve swerved into the field, where the cows chewed so placidly. Constance would\u2019ve cursed at the damage to the minivan, and by supper, it would\u2019ve become a great story, and Faith could have told her part, about bouncing over the field, the cows scattering and mooing, and everyone would have laughed and patted her hand and not expected her to do anything for cleanup, because she\u2019d had a scare, even though everything had turned out just fine.</p><p>It was a scenario she\u2019d pictured ten thousand times. She had a dozen others that ended about the same way.</p><p>Levi nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I figured you thought. And it\u2019s a logical assumption.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou remember Chief Griggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the most thorough guy.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI looked at the report, and it says, right here, mother distracted by sick child. But here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019d bet that she could tell if you were really about to have a seizure or not. You ever think about that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Faith frowned. \u201cNo. I mean, you might be right about that, but...no, I\u2019m pretty sure she thought I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I never could fool my mom, and I tried really hard. Anyway, even if she thought you were having a seizure, she\u2019d know that she couldn\u2019t help you. There\u2019s nothing you can do for a person who\u2019s seizing, and you were buckled in, nice and safe. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I wondered, even if your mom did think you were having a seizure, would she take her eyes off the road for very long?\u201d</p> <p>Faith pushed away the memory of her mother\u2019s face, peering back at her in those last seconds. \u201cShe did, Levi. She looked back at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And what did she say?\u201d</p><p>Faith took a deep breath, the air feeling heavy and thick. \u201cShe asked if I was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember exactly?\u201d Levi looked at his watch.</p><p>Of course she did. \u201cShe said, \u2018Honey, are you okay? Faith?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Constance Holland\u2019s last words. Trying to take care of her daughter, checking on the child whose selfishness would kill her. It felt as if a knife was stuck in Faith\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe three, five seconds to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took the report out to the accident site,\u201d he said.</p><p>A vision of that maple tree, that field, flared in her mind. It was horribly intimate, knowing Levi had been there, that place where she\u2019d sat in her own urine, whimpering for her mother. In all these years, Faith had never gone back to that spot.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Faith.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cLike I said, Chief Griggs wasn\u2019t the most thorough guy. He knew Kevin Hart had run the stop sign, figured your mom was distracted by you and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t see him coming. And that was the end of the investigation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a point, Levi?\u201d She was so tired.</p><p>\u201cJust...just bear with me. It\u2019s a good point. Well worth hearing. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He opened up the laptop and hit a key. \u201cI took some measurements based on what was in the report. Things like skid marks at the point of impact and how far your car rolled before it hit the tree, the weight of your car, the weight of Kevin Hart\u2019s.\u201d He turned the screen so she could see. \u201cThis is an accident reconstruction program. Obviously, Chief Griggs didn\u2019t have it twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>A blade of remembered fear sawed through her. There was the intersection, shown in stark lines. Two car icons, one red and one blue, touched each other. The red icon was bigger, pointing north on the road labeled Hummel Brook. That would be her mom\u2019s Dodge Caravan.</p><p>Levi pointed to the screen. \u201cBased on the skid marks, she was doing about forty, and Kevin was doing sixty-five. Not forty-five, like Kevin said. But the chief didn\u2019t do the math. Kevin left twenty feet of skid marks and sent your car rolling out to that tree. That puts him at about sixty-five.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Faith had been awake for twenty-one hours, and had told Levi her damning secret, was catching up with her. His words didn\u2019t quite make sense to her fuzzy brain. Even her hand didn\u2019t seem capable of petting Blue anymore. Her dog flopped on the floor, his muzzle on her bare foot.</p><p>\u201cEstimating that it took four seconds for your mom to look back at you\u2014which is a lot of time to take your eyes off the road, but assuming your memory is right\u2014that puts you guys here.\u201d He hit a key, and the red car moved back.</p> <p>Faith looked at the screen with her burning eyes. It was farther away from the intersection than she would\u2019ve guessed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two hundred and thirty-five feet away from the intersection. And Kevin Hart, doing sixty-five, ends up here, almost four hundred feet away from the intersection.\u201d Levi clicked another key, and the blue car moved back, quite far, on Lancaster Road. \u201cNow you can\u2019t forget these.\u201d He clicked another button, and round green objects popped up along Lancaster Road.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>\u201cMaple trees. There are\u2014and were\u2014maple trees all along that stretch.\u201d</p><p>The accident was on June fourth. The trees would\u2019ve been fully leafed out by then. No doubt about it.</p><p>Faith\u2019s heart was suddenly thudding fast and hard. She wiped her palms against her pajama pants and leaned forward, her fatigue forgotten.</p><p>Levi looked at her, his brows drawn. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now watch this.\u201d He clicked another key, and the cars advanced toward the intersection, stopping just before it. \u201cAccording to you, your mom never saw him coming, because she was looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did see him, Faith. When the chief heard you had a seizure, he just figured she was distracted. He didn\u2019t do the math.\u201d</p><p>It was getting hard to breathe. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have seen Kevin Hart until she was almost in the intersection, because he was doing sixty-five, tearing down the road. And the trees blocked her line of sight. But she couldn\u2019t have been looking back at you, because there were skid marks, Faith.\u201d He paused, letting the words sink in. \u201cSo she did see him. If she\u2019d been looking at you, she wouldn\u2019t have hit the brakes.\u201d</p><p>She never saw it coming. Those words, meant to comfort, had haunted Faith for nineteen and a half years.</p><p>Faith stared at the screen. Even here, even with the screen resembling a game more than a fatal car accident, it looked horribly ominous. Her brain couldn\u2019t quite compute what Levi was saying. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did see him, but it was too late...not because of anything you did or didn\u2019t do, but because the trees blocked her view, and because Kevin was coming so fast.\u201d</p><p>He covered her hand with his, and the warmth made her realize how cold she was. \u201cBut I remember...I remember her looking at me, not at the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople\u2019s memories are generally unreliable after an accident. You were looking out the window. You must not have seen her turn back.\u201d</p><p>The blood seemed to drain into her knees, and a strange floating sensation enveloped her head. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying it wasn\u2019t my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>How could that be true? Everyone thought she had some role in the accident. Everyone. Her father had told her hundreds of times it wasn\u2019t her fault...but he hadn\u2019t known what really happened.</p><p>Levi did.</p><p>He was still looking at her, his green eyes patient, waiting.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The news was so enormous, it had to creep slowly into her heart.</p><p>Could Levi be right? He just looked at her, solid and patient, a slight frown between his eyes, waiting for the news to register.</p><p>\u201cAre you really, really positive?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...it wasn\u2019t my fault, and it wasn\u2019t hers, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re not saying this just to be nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never say anything just to be nice.\u201d</p><p>He was telling the truth.</p><p>Faith pushed back from the table and turned her back on the laptop and on Levi. Went to the bookcase and grabbed the photo of her family...of her mom. No, no, that was too much. She picked up the little pink rock and closed it in her fist, leaning against the windowsill, looking out over the dark street, the quartz digging hard into her palm.</p><p>It was weird, then, because she was crying, tears pouring out of her eyes, but her mind was still reeling, as if she\u2019d been hit in the head. Her chest jerked with squeaky little noises, but she couldn\u2019t quite catch hold of that news.</p><p>Levi was there, then, pulling her against his broad, hard chest, wrapping his arms around her, standing behind her like a rock, and just held her close. She brought one of his hands to her lips and kissed it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t killed her mother.</p><p>That had to be the truth, because Levi would never, never lie to her.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>FAITH COULD CRY for a very long time, Levi noted. He was thinking it might be time for a tranquilizer. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have any.</p><p>He\u2019d led her across the hall to his place, because, well, frankly, he had no idea what to do with a sobbing woman, and being on his own turf might help him a little. He got a box of tissues and sat her on the couch, where she continued to cry, burying her face in her dog\u2019s neck, sobbing.</p><p>Those noises were like shrapnel to the heart, recalling the other time he\u2019d been helpless to comfort her\u2014her wedding day. \u201cWant me to make you something to eat?\u201d he asked, setting down a box of tissues. She shook her head. \u201cA beer? Wine? Whiskey, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Another head shake. She grabbed a tissue, blew her nose and kept crying.</p><p>Well, hell. He patted her shoulder awkwardly, and she kissed his hand again. Blue put his paw against Levi\u2019s leg and licked his hand as well, then put his muzzle on Faith\u2019s lap.</p><p>A bath. Women liked baths, right? A bath it would be. Also, he could get away from the crying for a second, because it made his insides hurt. His bathroom was needlessly enormous, and it did have a pretty amazing bathtub. Last time he\u2019d used it, Blue had been the beneficiary of all those water jets. He turned on the knobs, checked the temp. Went into his sister\u2019s bathroom and found some stuff under the sink\u2014vanilla almond bubble bath, like Faith needed anything to make her smell any more edible\u2014and went back to his bathroom and dumped in about half the bottle. Checked on Faith, who now had a pillow clutched to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Holland. Bath time.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, so reminiscent of that little ghost who\u2019d come back to sixth grade, that his heart gave a hard tug.</p><p>\u201cLevi,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cNo talking,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t need to hear it, and she didn\u2019t have to say it.</p><p>A half hour later, Faith\u2019s sobs had stopped, though the tears continued to pour out, almost like she didn\u2019t notice, starring her eyelashes. Even so, she looked like an old-school Playboy bunny, albeit a very sad one, her hair piled sloppily on her head, bubbles up to her neck. She\u2019d accepted the glass of wine he\u2019d pressed into her hand and was putting a fair dent in it. Her dog sat with his chin on the edge of the tub, slightly wary either of his beloved\u2019s mood or the memory of his own stint in this tub.</p><p>Levi sat on a little footstool, watching her. Those tears made him want to beat someone up. He wanted to drive to the Holland house, pound on the door and grab John by his shirt and shake him. How could she have thought this accident was her fault all these years? What kind of father lets his twelve-year-old think that she in any way was responsible for a fatal car accident? How could he miss the fact that she felt that way? Didn\u2019t anyone talk to her? How could she have kept that in for so damn long? Walking around, thinking of yourself as the reason your mother died, carrying that kind of guilt from the age of twelve on... It wasn\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>He handed her another tissue. This was his job of the night, apparently. She blew her nose, then gave him a bleary smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been really great tonight, Levi.\u201d Her voice wobbled.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He paused. \u201cTruth is, I have no idea what the hell to do here.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, this caused a smile, followed by a fresh stream of tears. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been wonderful. I\u2019ll never be able to thank you for what you did.\u201d Her face creased like she was about to start sobbing again, but instead, she rallied and took another swallow of wine.</p><p>For some reason, her words made him feel like utter crap.</p><p>All those years played back in his head. He remembered that girl from sixth grade and now saw, clear as day, that there was something darker, something heavier about her than simply a girl who\u2019d lost her mom. Saw her being Princess Super-Cute on all those committees that no one else joined, Environment and World Justice and all that crap, maybe trying to make up for something, maybe trying to avoid the secret she carried. Maybe just trying to avoid going home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saw her with Jeremy, grabbing on to him like a lifeline, because maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019d been. Marry the perfect boy next door, join your vineyards together, somehow create a kind of absolution.</p><p>No wonder she hadn\u2019t looked a little deeper at Jeremy. He\u2019d been her redemption.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come in?\u201d</p><p>The question startled him. \u201cIn the tub?\u201d</p> <p>She gave a little smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cSure,\u201d he said. Pulled off his shirt, then unlaced his boots and pulled them off, followed by his jeans and boxers, then got in behind her, her wet, slick skin sliding against his.</p><p>Now is not the time, his conscience barked. She\u2019s in mourning. Or something.</p><p>Well. Faith wasn\u2019t crying now. She was quiet, her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he asked, slipping his arms around her. Impossible to avoid touching breast, so why bother trying?</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hair. Wasn\u2019t sure what else to do. She relaxed into him, all soft, warm, wet sweetness. The dog eyeballed him like a disapproving chaperone. Right. Levi was supposed to be comforting Faith, not lusting after her.</p><p>She slid around so she was lying on him, causing some water to slosh over the side, and the lust factor shot up into the red zone. Her dog lapped at the puddle on the floor.</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he said, and his voice was rough, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve thought the wrong thing for so long. Someone should\u2019ve told you it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they did,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they...well, I told them I had a seizure. That\u2019s what they meant. It wasn\u2019t my fault because I couldn\u2019t help having a seizure. And I just couldn\u2019t tell them I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told the truth, honey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t break my father\u2019s heart even more. \u2018Daddy, I\u2019m sorry Mommy\u2019s dead, but she was going to leave you.\u2019 No. I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Her eyes were full again.</p><p>\u201cI hate this crying stuff,\u201d he whispered, and for some reason, it made her laugh, even as the tears slid down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWell, take me to bed and make love to me, and maybe I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>She was unpredictable, he\u2019d give her that. \u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could bake you cookies instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bake me cookies after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. You\u2019re the boss.\u201d He kissed her, that soft, pink mouth, then wrapped her legs around him and stood, keeping his mouth on hers, and lifted her out of the tub, resulting in a great rush of water and suds. The dog barked. \u201cGet out, Blue,\u201d Levi muttered against her mouth.</p><p>Her smiling mouth.</p><p>If her tears hurt his chest, for some reason, her smile made it ache all the more.</p> <p>LATER, WHEN HE\u2019D FOLLOWED her orders and made love to her till she was even pinker and sweeter and her cheek was against his chest, his own heart slowly returning to a normal pace, Levi was aware that something had changed.</p><p>When he\u2019d seen that empty, hollow look in her eyes, when she\u2019d looked far older than her years, something had built in him, a sense of urgency and protection and helplessness. For twenty years, she\u2019d been carrying this secret to protect her family, and no one had seen the cost.</p><p>He remembered how that little bad-girl streak in her had evaporated after her mother\u2019s death. Remembered how he\u2019d judged her as a little shallow, a little boring, when the truth was, maybe he should\u2019ve looked a little harder, too.</p><p>He kissed her hair and held her closer.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He froze. Not that he was moving to begin with, but it seemed his heart and lungs stopped for a good ten seconds.</p><p>Now was the time when he should say something back.</p><p>It was just that the words didn\u2019t come. There were a lot of feelings churning around, but actually putting a name to them...that was harder. He raised his head, expecting to see her waiting for his response, but instead her eyes were closed, that same little smile from before playing on her lips.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days,\u201d she said, her voice drowsy, \u201cyou\u2019re going to tell me you gave me that little pink rock.\u201d</p><p>Well, holy crap.</p><p>\u201cI used to wonder who gave it to me,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWould\u2019ve bet the farm it was anyone but you.\u201d She opened her eyes, looked at him for a second, then closed them again. \u201cBut now I see that it couldn\u2019t have been anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Another beat passed. Then he kissed her forehead. \u201cGo to sleep, Holland,\u201d he said, then watched as she did just that.</p><p>Then, when he was sure she wouldn\u2019t wake up, he got up and baked those cookies.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d be able to sleep after that, anyway.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>A WEEK LATER, FAITH WAS fairly sure that dropping the L-bomb had been a mistake.</p><p>She and Levi hadn\u2019t talked much since the night he\u2019d...well, changed her life. That revelation was still so stunning, Faith wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. But the knot that had been in her heart was loosening. Whether or not she should talk to her dad or say something to her sibs, Faith didn\u2019t know, but that charred spot in her soul, the one that had always told her she didn\u2019t deserve what other people did...it was healing over, pink and new and fragile.</p><p>As for Levi and her... Sigh. He\u2019d had to work\u2014a lot, it seemed, even more than before. He visited his sister and fixed something in her car. On the two nights Faith and he had spent together, he\u2019d been called away once and had to take two lengthy phone calls for something or another. She and Levi themselves had talked about very little, just ended up in bed where, admittedly, things felt much clearer. Actions, maybe, if not words.</p><p>One night after nooky, she\u2019d told him about walking in on her grandparents the other day, when they were both in the downstairs bedroom; for the life of her, she thought they were getting it on, Goggy saying, \u201cNo, it goes in there, not like that! Don\u2019t you remember? You don\u2019t like it there! It\u2019s never been comfortable that way! Push it to the left a little!\u201d But no, turned out they had simply been moving Pops\u2019s bed, thank you, Jesus.</p><p>Levi had laughed till there\u2019d been tears in his eyes, and the sound had been so wonderful, Faith had wondered how she could bottle it.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t escaped her notice that Levi had yet to say \u201cI love you\u201d back.</p><p>A clear-cut case of man panic.</p><p>And sure, it was a lot\u2014it almost made her cringe when she thought of that night, of telling him her secret, of her Olympic bout of weeping thereafter, followed up by her declaration of love and the assertion that he\u2019d been the one to put the pink quartz rock in her locker all those years ago. It would\u2019ve been nice, she thought as she made her way to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, if she could\u2019ve quit while she was ahead. But it was as if once the cork had been popped, she hadn\u2019t been able to keep anything in.</p><p>But Levi kept showing up. Maybe it wasn\u2019t as bad as she thought.</p><p>The barn was completely done, the library courtyard had been dedicated, and Faith was finishing up two other jobs. Snow had fallen three times already, and the air was cold and damp. Thanksgiving was coming, and Faith wondered if it would feel different now, now that she knew she hadn\u2019t caused the accident, if that aching, omnipresent regret would gentle to simply missing her mom.</p><p>Clearly, she didn\u2019t want to tell her father that his wife\u2019s last words to her had been to hint about leaving him. But maybe if Dad\u2014and Pru, Jack and Honor\u2014knew that it hadn\u2019t been a seizure that had caused the accident...maybe something would shift. What, Faith didn\u2019t know. She would\u2019ve talked to Levi about it...but Levi didn\u2019t seem up for talking these days. He\u2019d told her he\u2019d be working late tonight, so she was meeting Jeremy for dinner. That would be nice.</p><p>She had six jobs lined up for spring\u2014four private homes, two vineyards over on Seneca, and she was pitching to redo the park over by the glass museum in Corning. Already, local landscapers were calling, wanting to introduce themselves and show her their work.</p><p>She\u2019d thought about splitting her time between San Francisco and here, but who was she kidding? She was back in the heart of her family. She had her dad, who adored her. Her grandparents, who wouldn\u2019t be alive forever. Her niece and nephew, her sisters and Jack, Colleen and Connor. Faith was even thinking of joining the volunteer fire department, since Gerard kept heckling her about it. She had this new phase of friendship with Jeremy, who was loyal and generous and funny. She had the steep and beautiful hills, the cold, deep lakes with their infinite secrets, the quiet woods and gushing waterfalls. She was a Holland, and she belonged to this land.</p><p>And she had Levi, who might admit he loved her back.</p><p>Why go back when all she\u2019d ever wanted was to stay?</p><p>That being said, the architect who\u2019d given Faith her first job in San Francisco had just come through with a job to design a common area for a big condo complex in Oakland. Lots of land, lots of potential. He\u2019d sent her some photos, and right away, ideas had started forming. She could take the job, which paid very well, go back to the city by the bay, pack up her apartment, sell what she didn\u2019t want, say goodbye to her friends.</p><p>Being away, making something of herself without the goodwill generated by the Holland name, being alone...it had made her stronger. Mom had been right.</p><p>But it was time to come home.</p><p>So she\u2019d go to San Francisco, end things on a strong note, and then let her heart come back home.</p><p>Faith pushed open the door, the heat of the pub most welcome. A two-minute walk, but already her feet were like blocks of ice.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Connor greeted her as he pulled a Guinness. \u201cMy sister\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><p>As the words left his mouth, his twin pounced, dragging Faith into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cAnd hello to you, too,\u201d Faith said. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing with you and Levi...how serious is that?\u201d Colleen asked, her face unsmiling. \u201cYou totally smitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, actually. Why?\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s here. With his ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>Faith felt her mouth drop open. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re in a booth in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Faith glimpsed her face in the mirror. Not reassuring. \u201cThat\u2019s...sucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured you should have some warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Well, nothing to do but go out there. It wasn\u2019t like she was going to climb out the bathroom window. Not this time.</p><p>But she could fix her hair. And borrow some of Colleen\u2019s makeup.</p><p>AT FIVE-THIRTY THAT EVENING, Levi had been struggling through some paperwork that was endless, repetitious and irritating when the station door opened, and in came Nina Rodriguez, who not so long ago had been Nina Rodriguez-Cooper.</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger,\u201d she said with a big smile.</p><p>Gorgeous. That was his first thought. Clad in the same skin-tight clothes she always wore if she wasn\u2019t in uniform...and why not? She had a killer body.</p><p>His second thought was What the hell? because really, a little warning might\u2019ve been nice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a complaint you\u2019d like to register?\u201d Emmaline said, not bothering to keep the bitchery from her voice. She might be a pain in the ass, but she was loyal.</p><p>Nina ignored her. She was good at that. \u201cYou gonna stop staring and say hi?\u201d she asked Levi, raising a perfect eyebrow and leaning against Everett\u2019s desk. Ev, too, had frozen, his eyes on Nina\u2019s ass, which, granted, was one of the seven wonders of the natural world, right up there with Faith\u2019s rack.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Everett echoed.</p><p>Nina smiled and pulled up a chair. \u201cI was in the area. Figured I\u2019d stop in and see my favorite cop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He caught a whiff of the stuff she used in the shower, a musky, flowery scent, and waited for the surge of anger. This was, after all, the woman who\u2019d left him with a hug and a cheery wave after three months of marriage, making him look like an idiot, for one, and breaking his heart for another. Two things he hated.</p><p>The anger didn\u2019t come. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She tipped her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d Everett said, his voice faint.</p> <p>Nina glanced at Ev with that beautiful-woman smile, the kind that said In your dreams, mister. Everett only closed his mouth to swallow.</p><p>\u201cSo we gonna air our dirty laundry here?\u201d Nina asked. \u201cOr are you gonna buy a girl a drink? The best thing about this town was that little bar, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>And so Levi stood up, Everett watching in a trance, Emmaline hissing, and took his ex-wife across the square to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. Ignored Colleen\u2019s look, as well as the fact that three members of the town council fell silent upon his arrival. Victor Iskin waved, his latest taxidermied cat on the bar in front of him, poised as if to leap while Lorena Creech admired it.</p><p>\u201cTown hasn\u2019t changed much,\u201d Nina observed.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He took her to the farthest booth in the back and sat down.</p> <p>He was flustered. Shitty feeling, that.</p><p>They ordered a couple of beers and the nachos grande, which Nina recalled with great enthusiasm. Colleen took their order with another pointed look, kicking Levi\u2019s ankle. Nina talked about generic things\u2014the traffic in Scranton, the cow in the road in Sayre. The nachos and beers came, delivered with another kick from Colleen.</p><p>And then Nina started with the war talk, which was what soldiers did when they reunited. Levi waited for her to get to whatever point she was here to make. He knew from experience there was no changing of the subject with Nina; she had an agenda, and trying to rush her only drew things out.</p><p>Then, finally, after reminding him of their common past in as entertaining a way as possible, she got personal.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good,\u201d Levi said. Didn\u2019t mention the fact that she could\u2019ve used a sister-in-law this past year or so.</p> <p>\u201cIs she in college?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOver at Hobart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her! And your mom? Still hates me, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom died a couple months after you left.\u201d</p><p>Nina\u2019s face changed. \u201cOh, Levi, you ass. Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I would\u2019ve come for the funeral!\u201d She reached across the table and gripped his hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really see the point,\u201d he said, extracting his hand.</p><p>She sat back in her seat, her big brown eyes growing hot. \u201cThe point, idiot, is that just because our timing was off doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about you. Or Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cMan. You are totally furious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He declined to answer. Looked at her instead. It always made Faith irritable when he stared at her; hopefully it would work on Nina, too.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. She took a sip of her beer, smiling a little, her eyes still on his.</p><p>She was the type of woman who could seduce in seconds. A regular...what was that Greek chick\u2019s name? The one who caused the slaughter of an entire city? That one.</p><p>Levi took a careful breath. \u201cSo why the visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever could fool you, could I?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d say you fooled me pretty good,\u201d he answered calmly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s put it on the table.\u201d She leaned forward, boobs practically tumbling out of her skimpy shirt onto the nachos. \u201cThis last tour was it for me. I was thinking about you. Thought maybe we could give it another shot.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Nina huffed and rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook, moron,\u201d she said, and he felt an unwilling tug of affection for her total lack of sentimentality. \u201cWe were good together. It was the timing that sucked. I wasn\u2019t ready to settle down two years ago. I am now. Simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re leaving a lot out of that equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you fill me in?\u201d she said with another sex goddess smile.</p><p>I loved you. You left me. You left me when I wanted to have a family with you, when I thought we were happy, and you walked away like I was nothing.</p><p>But the feelings behind those words were old and tired, and not worth putting into words.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>It was Faith. She looked at both of them, then stuck out her hand. \u201cFaith Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Nina took her hand. \u201cWait a sec, Faith Holland? Holy shit! Jeremy\u2019s ex, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She looked at Levi, her cheeks flushing. Otherwise, her expression was calm.</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d Levi said, \u201cThis is my ex-wife, Nina. Nina, Faith is my...\u201d He looked at Faith, hoping she\u2019d supply the appropriate word.</p><p>\u201cNeighbor,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>Women. You never knew what they were up to.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap!\u201d came another voice. \u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy!\u201d Nina jumped up and hugged him hard, like they were old pals. \u201cIt\u2019s so great so see you!\u201d</p><p>Jeremy, Levi was pleased to note, did not hug her back, just gave Levi a look as Nina babbled and grinned.</p><p>There\u2019d been one night after Nina had re-upped when Jeremy had invited him up to the house, broke out the twenty-four-year-old single malt scotch and had very thoughtfully gotten drunk with Levi, and Levi had been able to be a normal person, to act not like a cop or a soldier or a big brother or the man of the house, but like a poor slob whose wife had left him.</p><p>Levi caught Faith\u2019s hand and tugged her into the seat next to him. \u201cStay,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your dog,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay.\u201d</p><p>There. She squeezed his hand. \u201cWhatever you want, neighbor.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. Now was not the time for sass. She blushed, and for some reason, it made his chest ache.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Chief,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I see a smile.\u201d</p><p>Before he realized what he was doing, he leaned in and gave her a quick kiss on her soft, pink lips.</p><p>Which did make Nina stop talking.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said. \u201cYou two are...together. I didn\u2019t...wow.\u201d She sat down, as did Jeremy, as if they were on a double date. \u201cSo, let me get this straight. Levi, you\u2019re dating Faith, who was once engaged to your g*y best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded appreciatively. \u201cAm I the only one who thinks that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems kind of perfect to me,\u201d Jeremy said.</p><p>Nina grinned, her perfect smile not quite masking her sharklike intentions. \u201cWell, this is awkward, Faith, because I\u2019m here to try to get my husband back.\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded sympathetically. \u201cWow, that is awkward. But you mean ex-husband, right?\u201d</p><p>Score one for Faith. She smiled sweetly, then looked at him, then back at Nina. \u201cThat being said, we\u2019ll let you guys talk. Jeremy and I were about to grab dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, you two are still BFFs? That\u2019s so cute!\u201d Yep. A great white.</p><p>Faith smiled calmly. \u201cYes, we\u2019re adorable. Very nice to have met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d Nina answered.</p><p>Faith slid out of the booth and looked at him. \u201cSee you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he answered, wishing she\u2019d stay.</p><p>With that, the cavalry left, Jeremy giving his shoulder a sympathetic squeeze as he left.</p><p>\u201cSo where were we?\u201d Nina asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were nowhere,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou were telling me we should get back together, and I\u2019m about to tell you that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what, hotshot?\u201d Nina said, nibbling a nacho with ridiculous sex appeal and a studied casualness. \u201cYour little birdie is right. We have a lot to talk about. Give me a couple hours of your precious time. I\u2019m here for the weekend, at least. Staying at the Black Swan.\u201d She raised her eyebrows and smiled at him from around the chip.</p><p>The Black Swan was where they\u2019d spent their wedding night.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cGet it over with.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>SO HIS EX-WIFE WAS BACK.</p><p>Faith sighed. Tried not to worry. Failed. Took another bite of Peanut Brittle. Another sigh. She held out the spoon for Blue\u2014it was his favorite flavor\u2014and took another bite for herself. A movie flickered on the TV\u2014one of those stupid old black-and-white movies she didn\u2019t like\u2014but it was better than the infomercials for those hellish workouts where the \u201cbefore\u201d body looked a helluva lot like the one she was in, and the \u201cafter\u201d looked way too much like Nina Rodriguez\u2019s.</p><p>Levi\u2019s wife. He was mad at her, sure, but he\u2019d loved her once.</p><p>Would he want another shot at that? The chance to do a better job? Maybe just to show that he hadn\u2019t been wrong about the woman he married? She could see that, understand how Levi, who tried so hard at everything, would want a better result than a quickie divorce in which he\u2019d had no say.</p><p>When she was first in San Francisco, Faith would occasionally dream that Jeremy was knocking on her door, confused as to why she wasn\u2019t at their wedding. No, of course he wasn\u2019t g*y, where had she been? The wedding disaster...that was the dream. She should come with him; everyone was waiting at the church.</p><p>Waking up from those dreams had always been like a kick in the stomach.</p><p>She wondered if Levi had similar dreams after Nina left.</p><p>\u201cShe can fly a helicopter,\u201d she told Blue, who was staring at the pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. She gave him another bite.</p><p>Levi was home, she knew. She\u2019d heard him come in after midnight, muted the TV and leaped for the door. Waited for his knock, which hadn\u2019t come. Saw through the peephole that he was alone.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke\u2019s closed at eleven. So where had he been?</p><p>Faith sighed and got up from the still-muted Bogart movie. Maybe Levi had sent her an email; he never had before, but it was worth checking, even if it did qualify her for Pathetic Female status.</p><p>Nothing except a note from Sharon Wiles saying she had a permanent tenant for the apartment, so if Faith could pack up her stuff and be out by the end of the month, that\u2019d be great.</p><p>Crap. She liked it here, across the hall from her man. Who might not be her man anymore.</p><p>No, no. No reason to think that (yet). Faith shut down the computer and went back to the couch. Fluffed the cushions. Folded the blanket.</p><p>This was where a mother would come in very handy. Pru would listen, but she wasn\u2019t great with advice, and given her recent marital roller coaster, might well be wearing Vulcan ears and doing her husband. Jack\u2014no. Dad, ditto. Honor\u2019s mysterious boyfriend hadn\u2019t materialized, and she probably wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to Faith\u2019s relationship woes. Also, it was 2:32 a.m.</p><p>But a mother...</p><p>Faith stopped at the picture of her family on Pru\u2019s wedding day, the last one taken of all of them. Next to it was the rose quartz heart. Levi hadn\u2019t denied giving it to her, but he hadn\u2019t admitted it, either.</p><p>Of course it was from him.</p><p>Faith picked up the photo.</p><p>The tarry guilt she\u2019d felt all these years wasn\u2019t easily scraped away. Faith could feel it lurking, waiting for another chance. But there\u2019d been flashes since Levi had unveiled the facts of that day. Flashes of pure memories undimmed by the belief that she\u2019d caused the accident. Memories of her mother\u2019s love so pure and bright and strong, they were shocking.</p><p>2:47 a.m.</p><p>\u201cWant to go for a ride, Blue?\u201d she asked her dog, whose ears pricked up at the magic word. \u201cWant to go in the car?\u201d</p><p>FOR TWO DECADES, FAITH had not been on either Lancaster or Hummel Brook roads. It had taken some doing. Hundreds of miles of avoidance. Her heart began thumping as she approached the intersection, and she exhaled shakily as she pulled over and turned off the engine. Rolled down the windows halfway so Blue could have some cold, fresh air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was beautiful here, the place her mother had died. The night was clear, the fields bathed in white from the nearly full moon. Faith had been afraid that the land had been sold to a developer, who\u2019d slapped up some McMansions and stuck in a painfully awkward street named Ciderberry Circle or Owl Hollow Lane or some such ghastly moniker.</p><p>But no. It was the same.</p><p>Blue whined, wagging his tail, eager to go out.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here, boy,\u201d she said, her voice loud in the perfect quiet.</p> <p>Pretty soon, maybe even later this week, Dad would start the ice harvest, calling up the troops at two o\u2019clock in the morning at the very second the temperature fell to seventeen degrees. But tonight, it was only in the twenties.</p><p>Only the twenties. Spoken like a true upstater.</p><p>Their car had been broadsided right here. Right in the intersection. Maybe her mom had died on impact, maybe it had taken a few minutes. She hoped with every molecule of her heart that her mother hadn\u2019t suffered, but the truth was, she\u2019d never know.</p><p>Faith went to the bank that ran along the edge of the road, climbed down. This was where the car had rolled. A long way, all the way to the maple tree. Kevin Hart had been going fast indeed.</p><p>Over the years, she\u2019d looked him up on Google from time to time; he\u2019d had a concussion from the accident, and broken the ring finger on his left hand. A college student at the time, not drunk, just driving far too fast on the lonely country road, unaware that during his first semester, a stop sign had been put up at the intersection. The judge had given him community service. He was a civil engineer now. Maybe the kind who studied where stop signs should go.</p> <p>Faith had never blamed him, not really.</p><p>She walked through the field, the brittle grass crunching softly under her feet, and came to the tree that had stopped their car. She remembered that sound, that final crunch, the shiver of the car, the patter as the splintered safety glass let loose.</p><p>Running her hand over the rough bark, she felt the smoother place where the tree had healed from the gash their car had left. The wood was still strong and smooth, all these years after that long-ago afternoon when the sky had been so blue.</p><p>She sat under the tree, distantly noting the cold, unyielding ground. It was so quiet tonight. No crickets, no coyotes yipping, no night birds. Just the quiet.</p><p>Maybe her mother had been planning to divorce Dad. Maybe not. Maybe, Faith thought, her mother had just been having a bad day and vented, inappropriately perhaps, to her youngest child. Maybe, for some reason, she thought her frustrations would be safe with Faith, that for whatever reason, Faith would understand. Maybe wanting more for your child than you had yourself didn\u2019t mean you were unhappy.</p><p>That was the thing with a sudden death. Some questions would never be answered.</p> <p>Faith would keep her mother\u2019s secret. She\u2019d let the guilt slink away, but she wouldn\u2019t sully the memories her family held. The truth was, they all probably knew Constance wasn\u2019t perfect; they were all intelligent, sensitive people, more or less. Maybe their beatification of St. Mom was more a choice than ignorance, and each one of them had tiny shards pricking their hearts, memories of Mom\u2019s imperfections kept to themselves.</p><p>Mom had loved them all. She\u2019d been a good mother, and John Holland had been a happily married man. Nothing could ever erase those truths.</p><p>Faith looked over to the spot where she\u2019d thought she\u2019d seen her mom standing that day, telling her she\u2019d be fine.</p><p>Mom had been right, hadn\u2019t she? Faith had survived the wreck, had turned out pretty well for a girl without a mother. Had found a profession she loved and had become successful, had survived heartbreak, had created a life in a strange city, had become somebody who loved the life she was living.</p><p>Too bad Mom couldn\u2019t see her now.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d Faith whispered.</p><p>Then she blew a kiss into the air, the same gesture she thought her mother had made to her, that last time she\u2019d ever seen or imagined her. Connie\u2019s kiss for her littlest girl, returned, finally, after nineteen and a half years.</p><p>And this time, the heat of tears in her eyes was welcome.</p> <p>When Blue appeared, having apparently wriggled his way out of the car window, she was glad for his furry head in her lap, his silky ears and big heart.</p><p>FAITH APPEARED ON her father\u2019s doorstep at seven that morning. She\u2019d gone home, slept for a couple of hours, then awoke twenty minutes ago, sure of what she had to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, sweetpea?\u201d Dad asked, ushering her in. \u201cBaby, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy, I\u2019m fine. Hey, Mrs. Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, she needs coffee,\u201d Mrs. J. surmised. \u201cShe, with her hair in a snarl and yet appearing in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t public, Mrs. J. It\u2019s home. Is Honor up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHonor is up,\u201d her sister said, coming into the room, dressed for work, hair band firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Faith said. \u201cUm...I need a minute with you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said.</p><p>\u201cOh, stay,\u201d Faith said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you won\u2019t be eavesdropping, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are in my kitchen,\u201d the housekeeper said with a hint of a rare smile, \u201ceven though this monstrous house has eleven rooms, half of which nobody ever uses.\u201d</p><p>They all sat around the table, Mrs. J. handing Faith a cuppa joe. \u201cThanks,\u201d Faith said. \u201cSo here\u2019s the thing.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the back door opened, and Pru and Jack came in, bickering. \u201cSo what?\u201d Pru said. \u201cWho cares what you think? Just because you\u2019re the boy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re eight years old,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you sound like the ass you are. Hey, guys! What\u2019s everyone doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here,\u201d Honor said. \u201cAs does our father.\u201d</p><p>Faith waved her hand. \u201cI need to tell you guys something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pregnant?\u201d Pru asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Faith said, even as Mrs. Johnson clapped her hands together in joy.</p><p>The housekeeper\u2019s expression fell back to thunderous. \u201cIs it really out of order?\u201d she said. \u201cFour of you adults now, but only two grandbabies, and they nearly grown at that. It\u2019s not fair. The three of you are wretched children, and Prudence, why did you not have more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cAnd back to me,\u201d Faith said. Such was the way of family gatherings. She should\u2019ve emailed instead. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d Pru said, rummaging in the cupboard. \u201cWhere\u2019s that mug I made in fourth grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, Mrs. J.,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cSo eat something, you rude boy,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said, cutting a muffin in half for him. \u201cI see hands attached to the ends of your arms. Am I expected to feed you like a baby bird?\u201d She handed him the plate.</p><p>\u201cThe day Mom died,\u201d Faith said loudly. That shut everyone up. Pru sat down; Jack froze with the muffin halfway to his mouth. \u201cThe day Mom died,\u201d she said in a more normal tone, though her heart began to gallop sickly in her chest, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a seizure.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI\u2014I just said I did.\u201d</p><p>Her siblings exchanged looks. Dad took her hand, which, Faith noted, seemed to be shaking.</p><p>\u201cGo on, sweetheart,\u201d he said.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWell, you know how everyone said Mom never saw what hit us? She...she did. She did try to stop. There were skid marks. But the other car was coming too fast. I told you I had a seizure because I thought the accident was my fault.\u201d</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Dad asked.</p><p>Faith drew a slow breath. \u201cMom asked me something, and I didn\u2019t want to answer. Um, I was a little mad at her over something. So she turned around to check on me. I always thought that\u2019s why Kevin Hart hit us, because she was looking at me and not the road. But Levi did an accident reconstruction, and it showed that Mom couldn\u2019t have seen him until we were almost in the intersection, and then it was too late. Even though she tried.\u201d</p><p>There was another silence while her siblings, Mrs. J. and Dad exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Dad said, squeezing her hand. \u201cNo one ever thought it was your fault. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you thought I had a seizure, and Mom was distracted, and that\u2019s why we got hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was that stupid kid, Faithie,\u201d Jack said. \u201cA kid in a muscle car, blowing through a stop sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one thought it was your fault, Faith,\u201d Honor said slowly. She looked at the others. \u201cDid you guys think that?\u201d</p><p>Pru shook her head. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was actually glad you had a seizure,\u201d Dad said slowly. \u201cBecause that way you wouldn\u2019t have remembered anything.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell around the table.</p><p>\u201cDo you, sweetheart?\u201d Mrs. Johnson asked, reaching out to touch her cheek. \u201cDo you remember the accident?\u201d</p><p>Faith hesitated, then nodded. \u201cI... Yes. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Faith,\u201d Honor whispered, her eyes filling with tears. Her sister\u2019s arms around her was such an alien feeling that for a second, Faith didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Then Pru hugged her, too, then Jack, and Dad, and Faith found that she was sobbing.</p><p>\u201cI thought you blamed me,\u201d Faith whispered, and Honor seemed to know the words were for her. \u201cYou were so mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cI was jealous. You were the last one who got to be with Mom. You were with her in the end.\u201d</p><p>A little while later, when eyes had been wiped and an extra box of tissues had been brought to the table and Mrs. Johnson was making sweet potato pudding for everyone and crying a little herself (though she wouldn\u2019t admit it), Dad reached out and put his hand on Faith\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWas that why you stayed in San Francisco?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause you felt responsible?\u201d</p><p>Faith took a deep breath. \u201cMaybe a little. I mean, at first, I just wanted to get away from Jeremy. But I remembered something Mom said, about how she always wanted to live somewhere far away. And it just felt...right. Like I was doing what she never got to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really nice, Faith,\u201d Honor said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what now?\u201d Dad asked. \u201cAre you going to stay in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Levi seem hot and heavy,\u201d Pru observed. Dad and Jack winced in unison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to stay,\u201d Faith said, her eyes filling again. Home had never felt more precious than it did at this moment, here in the kitchen of the New House, where Mom had cooked and laughed, where Mrs. Johnson had worked so hard to take care of them all these years.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap, another sister,\u201d Jack said, sighing, but he messed up her hair.</p><p>\u201cI do have to pack up my apartment, both at the Opera House and in San Francisco,\u201d she said, wiping her ever-leaking eyes. \u201cSharon Wiles found a tenant. So I might have to live here for a little while, once I\u2019m back from California. Please don\u2019t make me move back with Goggy and Pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive with me,\u201d Pru said. \u201cCarl\u2019s staying at his mom\u2019s indefinitely. I like having a long-distance marriage. The bathroom is certainly more pleasant. And you know the kids and I would love having you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out the logistics later,\u201d Dad said. \u201cFaith, sweetpea, you look exhausted. Come on, I\u2019m tucking you in.\u201d</p><p>Her room was filled with some boxes of both her stuff and Honor\u2019s, but her bed was the same, made up with a lavender comforter and fluffy white pillows. Faith was suddenly dead on her feet.</p><p>Dad pulled the covers up to her chin. \u201cNice to get to take care of my little girl,\u201d he said. He sat on the side of her bed and smiled down at her, and Faith\u2019s heart ached with love. He was so familiar, so unchanging\u2014the faded flannel shirt, the smell of wood smoke and coffee, his grape-stained hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoney,\u201d he said, \u201cthis...matchmaking stuff. Did that have to do with what you just told us?\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cI guess I thought if I could find you someone, it\u2019d wipe away some of my...guilt.\u201d</p><p>Dad shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been paying enough attention,\u201d he said. He was quiet for a few minutes as he stroked her hair. \u201cNow you listen,\u201d he said finally, \u201cand you listen good. I\u2019m always going to miss your mother, even if I get married again, which frankly, I can\u2019t picture. She wasn\u2019t perfect, but she was perfect for me, and if there\u2019s ever going to be anyone else, that\u2019s my responsibility, not yours. When the right person comes along, she will. It\u2019ll be my job to notice. You understand?\u201d She nodded, and he leaned over to kiss her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to take care of you, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Dang. More tears. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>Her father stood up. \u201cWell. You go to sleep, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d He paused. \u201cYour mom loved you so much, Faith. You were our little surprise. Our gift.\u201d</p><p>The words settled around her like a blanket, soft and warm, keeping her company as she fell asleep in her old room.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p> <p>LEVI\u2019S DAY HAD NOT been good.</p><p>First, there was Nina, who\u2019d shown up at his apartment at seven o\u2019clock with donuts and coffee from Lorelei\u2019s, which he hadn\u2019t accepted (though it had been hard...the donuts were still warm). She\u2019d followed him to the station. Bopped over to the post office, where she\u2019d rented a post office box, to demonstrate her intention to stay, she\u2019d said. Mel Stoakes had come in to say she\u2019d been in the candy store, did Levi know she was back? Gerard Chartier had entered just as Mel had been leaving to report the same news. \u201cHey, Levi, that hot chick you were married to...she back in town?\u201d</p><p>So rather than having her sit next to his desk and interrogate him in front of Emmaline and Everett, he\u2019d said yes to lunch at Hugo\u2019s, where hopefully Jess would spit in Nina\u2019s food, and reiterated the fact that he had no interest in getting back together with her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the anger talking, querido,\u201d she said, licking her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the brain talking,\u201d he replied wearily.</p><p>\u201cAh, but what does your heart say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame thing. As do the lungs, liver and kidneys. You know as well as I do that you\u2019re only back here because you\u2019re at loose ends.\u201d And that was another thing. Had she come back on leave, he might\u2019ve believed the sincerity of her words, not that it would\u2019ve changed his mind. As it was now, he was just a stopgap measure. The second Nina was bored, she\u2019d be off again.</p><p>Hopefully, she was bored now.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. At the end of his shift, there she was, coming into the station like she owned the place. He hadn\u2019t seen this much of her during their entire marriage. Ignoring Emmie and Ev, she plunked herself on the edge of his desk as he shut down his computer.</p><p>\u201cWanna get a drink, baby?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNina, I really would like to go spend some time with Faith,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cTo make me jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because she\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d Nina said, pulling a face and batting her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>The word surprised him, and it made Nina freeze. But only for a second. \u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cGo to the little princess. Bet she doesn\u2019t know what I know.\u201d She reached for his belt, right there in front of Everett and Emmaline, but he snagged her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he growled. \u201cGo back to the city, Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, baby. But for now, fly home to your little birdie. Just remember, your g*y best friend had her first.\u201d</p><p>There was the Nina he knew. Scratch the surface, and she was meaner than a fisher cat.</p><p>He walked across the green, jerked open the door of the Opera House and stomped up the stairs. Heard noises in Faith\u2019s apartment, opened the door.</p><p>There were boxes everywhere.</p><p>She was packing over by her bookcase, her back to him.</p><p>Packing, as in leaving. Moving.</p><p>Blue leaped over to him and tried to mount his leg. \u201cGet off, Blue,\u201d he muttered, and the dog slunk away, clearly wounded. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d he asked Faith.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She was wearing those ridiculous Dalmatian pajamas. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s it going with, um...with Nina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around. \u201cOh. Um, I only had this place month-to-month. Sharon Wiles found a permanent tenant. Wasn\u2019t happy about the red wall, either, but she said she\u2019d paint that over. Anyway, yeah, I have to get out.\u201d She seemed nervous, her hands knotted in front of her. \u201cBut after San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Coldness filled his chest. She was moving. \u201cSan Francisco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. I guess I didn\u2019t tell you. You\u2019ve been, um, otherwise occupied the past few days. Anyway, I have a job in Oakland, so I\u2019m heading back to San Francisco on Monday. It\u2019s this really nice common area for a condo complex, great view of the bridge, and while I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d She broke off, her mood visibly changing. Folded her arms under her chest, tossed her hair back. \u201cWhy are you scowling? If anyone has reason to scowl, isn\u2019t it me? Since my boyfriend has basically ignored me since his ex-wife popped into town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to San Francisco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and about the ex-wife and potential reconciliation, maybe you could at least talk to me about what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cA few weeks, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow few?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly six, hopefully more like four. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. And you never mentioned this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came up kind of fast. Why is the branch back up your ass, Levi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fast?\u201d he said, ignoring the question.</p><p>\u201cUm...I pitched the job in August, but I didn\u2019t hear until about a week ago, and it wasn\u2019t a sure thing until Friday. I would\u2019ve told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you make plans to move to San Francisco for a month, maybe more, but you don\u2019t think to talk about this with me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a beat or two. \u201cI guess it was a little hard to find the time,\u201d she said, her voice cool. \u201cSince you\u2019ve been so busy with Nina and the peace talks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve made the time. And there are no peace talks,\u201d he growled. \u201cGive me some credit. She left me. That was the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally nice of you to tell me. Funny, how it\u2019s taken you two days to mention this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really believe I\u2019d get back with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what to believe, Levi! Because you don\u2019t talk to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the woman who neglected to mention she\u2019s moving back to San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>She jammed her hands on her hips. \u201cWell, it looks like communication isn\u2019t our thing.\u201d She was mad now. Good. So was he. Kinda furious, actually.</p><p>Twice in his life, Levi had been left. Hadn\u2019t seen either time coming. Both times, he\u2019d had to pick up the pieces, jamming down misery, going on with day-to-day life, burying all that hurt, going on as if everything was fine.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel like doing that again.</p><p>She was glaring at him, waiting\u2014for what, he had no idea. This was too complicated, too difficult, too...emotional. He jammed a hand through his hair. \u201cOkay. That\u2019s fine. This wasn\u2019t working, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s head jerked back a fraction. \u201cWait. What? You\u2019re dumping me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, shaking his leg to dislodge her dog. \u201cHave fun in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened. \u201cI\u2019m coming home after this job, Levi,\u201d she said, her voice softer now. \u201cDon\u2019t make this into a big deal. It\u2019s just for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he said, his voice tight. \u201cBecause the first time you went for a few weeks, it turned out to be a few years. Then you come back here, and you decide maybe you\u2019ll stay. But maybe not. Maybe this is just a stopgap for you. You\u2019re going back to California, and, hell, maybe that\u2019ll be so great, you\u2019ll change your mind again!\u201d He seemed to be yelling. Not good. Definitely not good.</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cI have to say, your head does seem to be up your ass with that branch right now. You know what I think? I think this is really about Nina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands again. \u201cGreat! Another conversation we can\u2019t have. You won\u2019t talk about the war, you won\u2019t talk about your father, you won\u2019t talk about your ex-wife. And here\u2019s the thing, Levi. I\u2019ve already been with a guy who hid some very important things from me. I\u2019m not doing it again, so if there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to say, by all means. Go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not g*y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. Still, I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what on earth is really going on here. Blue, for the love of God, get a room, okay?\u201d She kicked the dog his pillow, which the dog happily jumped. \u201cYou have ten seconds. One.\u201d She grabbed a book and threw it into a box. \u201cTwo.\u201d Another book. \u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the picture of Jeremy,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>She froze, book in hand. \u201cReally? Are you really going there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you never got over him. I\u2019d hate to force you to take sloppy seconds with me.\u201d Ah, shit. This was bad, and getting worse by the second.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ironic,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who can\u2019t resist the chance to run off to open a jar or save a cat. You\u2019re the one with an ex-wife sniffing around. I\u2019m trying to make a real relationship here, but I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Felt some heat rising to his face that he didn\u2019t like one bit.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she said, walking over to him, her eyes narrowed. She poked him in the chest with her forefinger. Hard. \u201cI\u2019m the one who said I love you. The fact that you didn\u2019t say boo was duly noted, Chief Cooper. You can\u2019t even admit you gave me that damn rock, and I\u2019ve been carrying that thing around from place to place for decades!\u201d Another poke. \u201cSay what you want about Jeremy\u2014\u201d poke \u201c\u2014but g*y or not, at least he knew how to be in a relationship. At least he was willing to commit.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her. He didn\u2019t like having all these...these...feelings churning around. He didn\u2019t like fighting.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t like being wrong.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy California,\u201d he said.</p><p>With that, he turned around and left.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S A THERAPY DOG,\u201d Faith said, fishing out a tissue and Blue\u2019s papers at the same time. \u201cHe can ride with me. Persons with Disabilities Act and all that.\u201d She wiped her eyes and gave the TSA drone a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cBoarding begins in forty minutes. Next.\u201d</p><p>Faith sat down, Blue\u2019s head immediately resting in her lap.</p><p>Ah, irony. Back at the Buffalo-Niagara Airport, once again dumped. The tears wouldn\u2019t seem to stop leaking out of her eyes, but she gave her dog an ear-scratch nonetheless.</p><p>The first time she\u2019d gone to San Francisco, she\u2019d been fleeing in shock and heartbreak. This time, though, her heart was made of stronger stuff.</p><p>The trouble was, Levi Cooper had said heart in his fist. She loved him, the big dummy. No one\u2014no one\u2014could\u2019ve done what he did the night he went out to the accident site and...oh, crap, just the image of him walking around in the middle of the freezing, dark night, measuring stuff, then doing an entire accident reconstruction, then knocking on her door at three o\u2019clock in the morning...a little squeak escaped her throat, causing Blue to put his paws on her lap and lick away the tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Men. How could they do stuff like that, and then be completely unable to say, Please come back soon, I\u2019ll miss you so much, I love you. Huh? Why? Any answers? Anyone? No?</p><p>Blue whined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d she said to her dog. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with him when we get back.\u201d He wagged his tail.</p><p>You know what? This trip back to California...this was her farewell to the city she loved. She\u2019d design the common area and enjoy doing it, stick her chunky fee in the bank and say goodbye to all her pals and associates. She\u2019d go to Golden Gate Park again with Liza and Wonderful Mike, eat butter-drenched sourdough toast, have sushi, go to Rafael and Fred\u2019s wedding, and pack up her apartment.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to waste her trip crying over Levi Cooper.</p><p>Well, okay, she\u2019d give him ten more minutes of weep time. And then she really was going to stop.</p><p>Someone sat next to her. Faith looked up, ready to apologize for her tears and/or dog, and saw Jessica Does.</p><p>Jessica saw her at the same instant and gave a near comical twitch. \u201cHolland. What are you doing here?\u201d She glanced around, then frowned at Faith.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to California for a few weeks,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. Jess didn\u2019t ask why she was crying. That would be too human of her. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Faith said. \u201cBeautiful weather out there, huh?\u201d For heaven\u2019s sake. Was she condemned for all eternity to trying to make Jessica like her? \u201cSo why are you going out there? You look really nice, by the way.\u201d Question answered.</p><p>Jessica didn\u2019t speak right away. If she ever would. Then Blue put his paw on her foot, and she smiled a little at the beastie. \u201cCollege,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThis low-residency program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s great.\u201d Faith opened another tissue pack. \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarketing. Better late than never, right? I mean, we don\u2019t all have families who send us off to beautiful schools, do we?\u201d</p><p>Sigh. \u201cI guess not.\u201d Faith looked at her a second. She might be kind of a bitch, but the woman was beautiful. \u201cJess, why have you always hated me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Faith ignored the hostile tone. \u201cBecause my plane doesn\u2019t leave for an hour?\u201d</p><p>Jessica started to smile, then seemed to remember she was with Faith. After a second, she shrugged. \u201cThe usual reasons. Wearing your old clothes to school, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich made it okay to bully me at recess and make fun of me behind my back?\u201d What the hell. Time to be honest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jessica paused, petting Blue with her foot, then looked at Faith and sighed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t the only one in love with Jeremy, Super-Cute.\u201d</p><p>Holy guacamole. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jess rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah. But you know...clearly he was gonna go for you and not someone like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so mean?\u201d Again, what the hell.</p> <p>To her surprise, Jessica laughed. \u201cNot exactly what I meant, but who knows?\u201d Her cheeks grew pink, and she looked away. \u201cI was jealous. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Faith felt a pang of sympathy. Imagine being Jess, serving Jeremy and his super-cute girlfriend back in the day. Imagine seeing him adoring someone else, all that tender attention, that perfect teenage love. Having to wait tables at their rehearsal dinner, and then being a guest at the fairy-tale almost wedding. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jess. If I was ever a jerk, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were actually always pretty damn nice, Holland.\u201d She glanced at Faith and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe should be friends,\u201d Faith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in love with the same boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was never in love with Levi,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you could avoid it,\u201d she said, and just the thought of him made her eyes fill.</p><p>Jessica gave her a condescending stare. \u201cWow. You\u2019ve got it bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She gave a hiccupping sob.</p><p>Jessica started to laugh. \u201cI always sit next to the crazies,\u201d she said. \u201cSure, Holland, let\u2019s be friends. What the hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSARAH, I DON\u2019T CARE! You have two weeks left! You\u2019re not coming home to study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d get better grades if I could study from home.\u201d His sister was at the whining phase of their daily conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi! Don\u2019t you even care how I\u2019ll do on finals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care!\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut you can study there, Sarah! You\u2019re surrounded by entire buildings devoted to studying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! I\u2019m so sorry to be such a huge pain in your ass.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. You\u2019re not a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m gonna cry. You\u2019re so mean to me, Levi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, come on.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019ll drive up tomorrow and take you out for dinner, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks, Sarah. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He hung up from his sister, feeling worse than ever.</p><p>Faith had been gone for twenty-two days. Three weeks of one day after the next, three weeks of hardly sleeping, three weeks of every place in this damn town being about her.</p><p>The stupid phone rang again. Jeremy, the screen said. Levi let it go to voice mail. Despite the ridiculousness of the argument, he kind of hated Jeremy these days for being Faith\u2019s first and perfect love. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cEnough with the sighing!\u201d Emmaline barked. \u201cKnock it off, or I\u2019m gonna go work for Jeremy, and don\u2019t think he hasn\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. I still don\u2019t know what you do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out after I quit, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He closed the case he was working on\u2014all those petty burglaries had been courtesy of Josh Deiner, the kid who\u2019d gotten Abby Vanderbeek drunk that day. Another rich kid who had to get his jollies by breaking the law. \u201cI\u2019m done for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Baby Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverett, will you close up tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief! Thanks! Closing up, roger. Will call with a report at oh-eighteen hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need, Ev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do anyway, Chief!\u201d</p><p>Levi started to sigh, caught Emmaline\u2019s murderous look, and walked out instead. Went home, glancing automatically at Faith\u2019s door. Right. It wasn\u2019t her door anymore. Some middle-aged guy had moved in.</p><p>He went into his own apartment, which had once been very peaceful and relaxing and now seemed enormous and barren. Ignored those stupid thoughts, changed out of his work clothes. The refrigerator cycled on. From downstairs, he heard the theme song of Game of Thrones, which Eleanor Raines had recently discovered and was watching at extreme volumes to compensate for the fact that she refused to admit that she needed a hearing aid.</p><p>He didn\u2019t particularly want to go to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s, but it beat staying home listening to all those beheadings and wolf attacks.</p><p>Which reminded him: he missed Blue.</p><p>Two minutes later, he walked into the bar. \u201cHey, Levi,\u201d Connor said.</p><p>\u201cConnor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, ass**le,\u201d Colleen said to Levi, leaning down to make eye contact. \u201cI\u2019m not speaking to you, but if I was, that\u2019s what I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Levi grunted.</p><p>\u201cColl, get the man a beer and leave him alone,\u201d Connor said, going into the kitchen.</p><p>The only good thing that had happened in the past three weeks was that Nina was gone. She\u2019d knocked on Levi\u2019s door the day after his and Faith\u2019s breakup idiocy argument and told him that she\u2019d be on her way, sorry for the inconvenience, best wishes.</p><p>\u201cWhy the change of heart?\u201d he\u2019d asked. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m relieved, but...\u201d He\u2019d shrugged.</p><p>Nina had looked at him a long minute. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with your little birdie,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cI saw you yesterday. Okay, fine, I was spying, but her windows are right there overlooking the green.\u201d She smiled. \u201cSaw you fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never fought with me.\u201d Much to his surprise, Nina\u2019s eyes had filled with tears. \u201cWe never had a fight, not once. What does that say?\u201d</p><p>Levi would have guessed that said they\u2019d been compatible, but then again, he was dealing with a female, and females didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I put you through,\u201d Nina said. \u201cI really am. I\u2019m not proud of walking out on you. I just... I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, moron. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going.\u201d She inhaled sharply, dashed a hand across her eyes, then smiled at him. Hugged him hard. \u201cSee you, big man,\u201d she\u2019d said, had given him a noisy kiss on the cheek, and off she\u2019d gone.</p><p>Life in a small town during the winter...there wasn\u2019t a lot going on after the long and busy tourism season. The ice harvest would be any day now; that meant a bunch of workers out in frigid temperatures, usually at night, gathering the frozen grapes to make the sweet wines the region was famous for. In a few weeks, the village would have its Christmas stroll, lit up like a movie set. And then...not much.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d Jeremy came over and took the stool next to him. \u201cI just called you, not ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He took a sip of his beer.</p><p>\u201cOne-word answers,\u201d Jeremy said to Colleen as she set down a glass of red wine in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s enough to make me spit in his beer,\u201d Colleen said, causing Levi to look up sharply. She smiled enigmatically and gave him the finger.</p><p>\u201cColl, have you heard from Faith?\u201d Jeremy asked, for Levi\u2019s benefit, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cWe talk every day. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost every day. She sounds great, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cSo great. So happy, now that she\u2019s not stuck with an idiot, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHe\u2019s only an idiot maybe half the time. Sixty percent, tops. Hey, Carol! How\u2019s your bursitis? You\u2019re doing what I told you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeremy, give me a hug,\u201d Mrs. Robinson said. \u201cYou\u2019re so handsome! Don\u2019t make that face, just do it. You can have Levi arrest me on sexual harassment later.\u201d She giggled like a twelve-year-old as Jeremy obliged.</p><p>At that moment, Levi\u2019s phone buzzed. Dispatch. \u201cChief Cooper,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was an MVA out on Route 154. A rollover, people inside, possible injuries. Not a job for Everett, in other words.</p><p>Within seconds, Levi was in the cruiser, lights and sirens on. No ice tonight; it was cold and dry. On his way out of town, he saw three volunteer firefighters heading to the station in their pickup trucks, blue lights flashing in the early dark of the November night. That meant Levi would be first on the scene.</p><p>Sure enough, he was. He parked across the road, aiming the headlights at the vehicle. \u201cCar on its roof,\u201d he said into the radio. \u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to open the door. I\u2019m investigating.\u201d</p><p>He ran up to the Toyota minivan, which was flipped, having slid to the side of the road. Minimal damage. A blonde woman was yanking on the door. \u201cMy kids are inside, and the door\u2019s stuck!\u201d she yelled, hysteria edging her voice.</p><p>\u201cFire department and ambulance are on the way,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m a cop and an EMT.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said. \u201cOne minute we were fine, the next minute, a deer ran out, I jerked the wheel and we flipped. Should\u2019ve hit the damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy! Get us out!\u201d</p><p>The road was flat, so the chances of the van rolling farther were small. The side window was broken; Levi lay on the asphalt and worked his way in. His leather jacket would protect him from the shattered glass, and with little kids in the car, he wasn\u2019t going to wait for the fire department.</p><p>Both kids were strapped into booster seats, dangling upside down. No blood, though the older one was pretty pale. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d Levi said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet us out!\u201d the bigger kid said. He was maybe six or seven.</p><p>\u201cMy juice spilled,\u201d the younger one said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Levi said. \u201cYou get it all over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s yucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Levi said. No apparent injuries. \u201cYou\u2019ll get dry soon. Anything hurt? Neck, stomach, anything like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d the little guy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d said the older one.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll stay with you till the fire department comes, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the older boy whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay. Just a couple minutes more.\u201d He glanced at the mother, who was squatting next to the car. \u201cThey\u2019re doing all right, ma\u2019am. I need you to step back a little, though.\u201d She didn\u2019t move. He didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s right here,\u201d she said to the boys. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d the younger kid said. \u201cI\u2019m really brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both doing great,\u201d Levi assured them. \u201cJust hang tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them not to unbuckle,\u201d the mom said.</p><p>\u201cThat was smart,\u201d Levi told her. \u201cHow about you? You feel okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cA little banged up.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, he could hear the sirens of the ambulance and fire trucks. \u201cBoys, the fire department\u2019s on the way. They\u2019re gonna put a special brace on your necks to make sure you don\u2019t get hurt, and then we\u2019ll get you out of here, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get us out now?\u201d the older kid said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer if we wait. They\u2019re almost here. So, how old are you?\u201d he asked, just to keep them talking and calm.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m seven, and Stephen is four,\u201d the older one said.</p><p>\u201cFour and a half,\u201d Stephen corrected.</p><p>\u201cGot it. And what\u2019s your name, big guy?\u201d Levi asked. The siren was louder now.</p><p>\u201cCody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Levi. Nice to meet you.\u201d Engine One pulled up, and Levi could hear Gerard Chartier on the radio.</p><p>\u201cLevi, is that your ass hanging out of there?\u201d a familiar voice called.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jess,\u201d he answered. \u201cGood to have you back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, and why are you doing my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess who\u2019s here?\u201d he said to the boys. \u201cThe firefighters. You\u2019ll be out in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like upside down,\u201d the younger kid said, and there was something familiar about him. Levi wondered if he\u2019d seen them in town. Hard to tell from this angle.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chief,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cYou want to do the honors, since you\u2019re already in there?\u201d He handed in a neck brace, and Levi fastened it around the younger kid\u2019s neck, then did the same to Cody. Gerard got the cutter and clipped the hinges off the door.</p><p>\u201cKeep them in the car seats and we\u2019ll just carry them to the rig. I\u2019ll check them out there,\u201d Gerard said. He was a paramedic, the senior ranking member of the fire department.</p><p>Jess was talking to the mom, telling her about transporting them to the E.R., wouldn\u2019t hurt her to be checked out, too, because sometimes shock and adrenaline masked an injury, and was there someone she wanted to call, her husband or a friend, the usual.</p><p>Both kids seemed okay. The older one probably understood more and was therefore more shaken, but now that help was here, they were starting to realize they were the stars of the show. The ambulance had pulled up right after the engine, so Jess and Gerard took the bigger kid out and carried him to the ambulance, booster seat and all. Levi and Ned Vanderbeek did the same with the little guy, setting his car seat right on the gurney. Kelly Matthews was strapping the older boy\u2019s seat onto the bench in the back of the ambulance, chatting away with the kid, getting him to laugh.</p><p>The mom, who\u2019d done such a good job of keeping it together, started to cry at the sight of her boys in an ambulance, then did that horribly sweet thing moms did\u2014tried to smile instead.</p><p>Reminded Levi of his own mom the day he left for Basic.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d Levi said, going to the cruiser. He kept some of those little beanbag animals in the glove compartment for just this type of call. Grabbed two and gave a pig to Cody, a lamb to the little guy. \u201cThanks for giving us something to do tonight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the little brother said happily, holding the lamb up to study it more closely.</p><p>\u201cYou take care, kids,\u201d Levi said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for staying with us,\u201d the older boy said solemnly, and Levi felt his heart squeeze a little.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, pal,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he turned to the other kid, Stephen, and did a double take. His gut told him before his brain caught on, tightening so fast it stole his breath.</p><p>He looked back at Cody, then back at Stephen.</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d said the little guy, turning the stuffed lamb over to investigate its belly. His forehead was...what was the word Faith used? Crinkled.</p><p>Stephen looked like...like him.</p><p>The boys were his father\u2019s other sons.</p><p>He realized he was staring. \u201cUh...you take care, boys. You were really brave.\u201d</p><p>The boys\u2019 mother was looking at him, her mouth slightly open. Crap.</p><p>At that moment, a car screeched up, and Rob Cooper burst out of the door, running up to the back of the ambulance. \u201cHeather! Heather, baby, are you okay? Are the boys\u2014oh, God, hey, boys! Cody, you okay, buddy? Stevie? You doing all right?\u201d</p><p>His father kissed the little boys, wiped his eyes and held their hands. He asked Kelly something, looked back at the older kid, ruffled his hair.</p><p>Get moving. Levi walked to the cruiser, head down. His hands buzzed with adrenaline. Almost there.</p><p>God, he wished Faith was around. Wished he could go home and pull her into his arms and breathe in that smell and have her dopey dog jump up against them.</p><p>And maybe he\u2019d tell her he\u2019d met his brothers today.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His father\u2019s wife had followed him the few yards to the cruiser. She looked at him steadily, then held out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Heather Cooper.\u201d</p><p>She was maybe thirty-eight, forty; in other words, closer to his own age than his father\u2019s. Levi took a breath, then shook her hand. \u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping my sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re okay.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThey seem like great kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d Yeah. She knew.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cLevi Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Her eyes were wet. \u201cAnd my sons...they\u2019re your half brothers, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the one who should be sorry.\u201d She tried to smile, but it faltered. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I should go. You take care, Mrs. Cooper,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHeather. Since I\u2019m your stepmother and all.\u201d This time, the smile was a little more resolute. \u201cThis is quite a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeather? Babe, the ambulance is almost ready to\u2014oh. Oh.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Oh. It was almost comical, the expressions running across his father\u2019s face\u2014anxiety, then shock, then that realization that yep, the shit had hit the fan. \u201cUh...hey,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you two have met before,\u201d Heather bit out. \u201cThis man just saved your sons\u2019 lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s slightly exaggerated,\u201d Levi said. He looked at his father. Rob Cooper was smaller than Levi remembered. Skinnier, too. In addition to looking guilty as sin, his father looked...weak.</p><p>Because he was. Somehow, Rob Cooper had made something of himself, had found a nice woman, had been given two more sons, and he must\u2019ve been doing something right. But he\u2019d never once had the guts to own up to walking out on his firstborn. He\u2019d never even told his wife he had another child.</p><p>\u201cYou two need to take care of your sons. I\u2019m glad everyone\u2019s okay.\u201d He turned to his cruiser.</p><p>Then he stopped and turned back to his sorry excuse of a father and suddenly had him by the front of his shirt, lifting him off the ground. His father\u2019s familiar eyes were suddenly wide with terror.</p><p>\u201cDo better with them,\u201d Levi growled, giving his father a shake. \u201cIf you walk out on them the way you walked out on me, you\u2019d better pray to God I don\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>He released Rob Cooper, who staggered a few steps back and turned and went to his other sons. Fast.</p><p>Levi looked at Heather. \u201cIf you ever need anything, let me know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the police chief in Manningsport.\u201d</p><p>It had never felt better to say those words.</p><p>She gave a wobbly smile. \u201cLevi...for whatever it\u2019s worth, you\u2019ll always be welcome in my home. I\u2019d be proud for the boys to know you.\u201d</p><p>The words went straight to his heart. He looked at her another minute, gave her a nod, not quite trusting himself to speak, then got in the cruiser and carefully drove away from the scene.</p><p>When he was a few miles off, he pulled over, and before he was aware of what he was doing, his sister\u2019s voice was on the line. \u201cCalling to be a prick again?\u201d she said, her voice slightly sullen.</p><p>\u201cYou can come home whenever you want,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, tomorrow, Saturday, any time you need to, day or night.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cWho is this?\u201d his sister asked, and Levi smiled.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to help you get through this time, get you on your feet, whatever. If that means coming home twice a week, that\u2019s fine, Sarah. You\u2019re gonna turn out great no matter what.\u201d</p><p>There was silence on the other end, then a snuffle. \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>When he got back to the station, Everett was still there, playing Angry Birds. \u201cHey, Chief!\u201d he said, bolting upright and falling out of the chair in the process.</p><p>\u201cIs your mother home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, I think so. Why?\u201d</p><p>Levi punched in the mayor\u2019s phone number. \u201cMarian, it\u2019s Levi. Listen. I need an actual cop to help me out here. Your son can go to the police academy, but I\u2019m hiring someone else, too. Probably Emmaline. You have a week to find the money, or I quit. Have a great night. Oh, I\u2019m gonna be taking some vacation time. Starting now.\u201d With that, he hung up. \u201cGood night, Ev,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Chief,\u201d Everett said.</p><p>O\u2019ROURKE\u2019S WAS MUCH the same as he\u2019d left it. Colleen hissed at him once more, Jeremy was feeling Carol Robinson\u2019s glands. Those two should get a room.</p><p>Prudence Vanderbeek sat alone at a booth, clicking away at her phone. \u201cHey, Chief,\u201d she said amicably. \u201cI\u2019m sexting my husband. Give me a minute.\u201d She muttered as she typed. \u201c\u2018I refuse to sign your contract, Mr. Grey, and furthermore, I\u2019ve never even heard of that Japanese thingamajig you mentioned in your last email. And yes, I remain untouched, I have never even kissed a man before, yadda yadda.\u2019\u201d She looked at Levi. \u201cI\u2019m forty-seven years old, Levi, and the mother of Carl\u2019s children. Why I have to pretend to be an insipid virginal college student is beyond me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you enjoy it?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She put her phone away. \u201cSo. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>He sat down.</p><p>The thing was, he had no idea what to ask.</p> <p>Prudence shoveled some popcorn into her mouth. \u201cLet me guess. This is about Faith,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed her once. A long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow thrilling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wondered if she ever talked to you about it.\u201d This was...unexpected. He hoped like hell that no one could overhear them.</p><p>\u201cHonor!\u201d Pru bellowed. \u201cLevi wants to talk about Faith!\u201d</p><p>So that hope was dashed.</p><p>Honor Holland came over, a glass of wine in her hand. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked, almost kindly, making him a little wary.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Pru said. \u201cHe says he kissed her one time and wants to know if she got all swoony and some such shit.\u201d</p><p>Levi made a note never again to ask for help from evil sisters. \u201cThanks, ladies,\u201d he said, standing.</p> <p>\u201cOh, man up,\u201d Prudence said.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Honor said at the same time.</p><p>Levi sighed and obeyed. \u201cOkay, so, I screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. You\u2019re a guy,\u201d Prudence said. Her pocket buzzed, and she jumped. \u201cGod, that felt good,\u201d she said, almost to herself, taking her phone out to read the text. Laughed and began typing her response.</p><p>\u201cI thought you dumped my sister,\u201d Honor said.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think you deserve her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat, Chief Cooper, is the correct answer.\u201d Honor smiled. She didn\u2019t say anything else. Pru was busy sexting Carl. Honor still said nothing, just looked at her nails.</p><p>Right. He waved to Colleen, who flipped him off. \u201cAnother round for these two on my tab,\u201d he said, standing up.</p><p>\u201cOrder me something expensive,\u201d Pru instructed her sister, not looking up from her phone.</p><p>He was halfway across the green when Honor called his name. She didn\u2019t have her coat on, and he shrugged out of his and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Honor said, putting it on. \u201cGreat jacket. I\u2019m keeping it, by the way. She called me when I was a senior at Cornell. So Faith would\u2019ve been a senior in high school. Would the timing be right for your little dilemma?\u201d</p><p>Levi nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I remember it, because it was the one and only time she ever said anything weird about Jeremy, and also, I had finals and the last thing I wanted to talk about was her love life.\u201d Honor crossed her arms. \u201cBut it was strange, because from day one, Jeremy was Prince Charming and Dr. Wonderful all rolled into one. And she was asking me for advice, and that didn\u2019t happen too much. We weren\u2019t...\u201d Honor cleared her throat. \u201cWe weren\u2019t that close back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what she said?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m inclined to make you wait, just to watch you suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me back my coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. She asked me how to know if you were in love. She said she and Jeremy had taken a break, and something had happened and...I don\u2019t know. What did being in love feel like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I had finals and she should read Seventeen magazine. I was kind of a bitch.\u201d She looked at the ground. \u201cSorry. I wish I had more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then get your ass in gear. And thanks for the coat.\u201d</p><p>Levi went up to his apartment and booted up his computer. Called Sarah once again.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m trying to study for my exams, Levi! Can you please leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, clicking on a travel site. \u201cI know I said you could come home, but I\u2019m going to San Francisco for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever. Love you, gotta go.\u201d She paused. \u201cI have a friend here to study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me. Call me when you land, and make sure you bring me a present.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>THE PHONE RANG AT TWO o\u2019clock in the morning, and it took Faith a minute to remember where she was. Her apartment in San Francisco? Nope. Opera House? Nope. Goggy\u2019s? No.</p><p>The phone shrilled again. \u201cNo!\u201d came a sleepy wail from down the hall. Right. She was at Pru\u2019s, having gotten in from California a few hours ago. At the moment, she was so tired she felt dizzy, but if your last name was Holland, a phone call in the middle of a November night could only mean one thing\u2014someone was dead, or it was time for the ice wine harvest.</p><p>Pru was already up. \u201cHey! Ice wine!\u201d She banged on Abby\u2019s door, then Faith\u2019s. \u201cIce wine! Come on, Ned\u2019s already gone. You don\u2019t want to miss it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI so want to miss it,\u201d Abby muttered, stumbling into the hall, Blue leaping excitedly about, looking for somebody to love. \u201cI hate my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, now,\u201d Faith said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hell. A frozen, barren wasteland.\u201d</p><p>For weeks, Dad had watched the forecast like a hawk, sleeping in his truck some nights, waiting for his special alarm-thermometer to announce that magical second when the temperature hit seventeen. Then the phone calls went out, and every living Holland was expected to show up within minutes to cut down the frozen grapes, which would be pressed that night.</p><p>\u201cBet you wish you were in San Fran still, huh?\u201d Abby asked as she, Pru and Faith drove up the hill to Blue Heron, bundled in their warmest gear.</p><p>\u201cAnd miss this?\u201d She smiled at her niece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill to miss this,\u201d Abby muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, Faith, your timing was perfect,\u201d Pru said.</p><p>Faith\u2019s project had finished early, everything going ahead of schedule, which was practically unheard of. She\u2019d done the job she was hired to do and did it well, took her buddies out for ridiculously beautiful and expensive martinis, went to Rafael and Fred\u2019s wedding, hired movers to pack up her stuff from the apartment, formally turning her lease over to Wonderful Mike.</p><p>Then she\u2019d taken a long walk in the cold, damp air, and said goodbye to the city that had welcomed her, where her heart had mended, and went back to the place she loved with every molecule in her body. And to the man she loved just as much. More, even.</p><p>Twice in her life, Faith had been in love. Once with a man so perfect she should\u2019ve known there was something wrong. And now with a man who wasn\u2019t perfect at all, who was stubborn, occasionally irritable, and mildly to moderately constipated when it came to emotions, and maybe had some abandonment issues going on, too, not to mention the weight of the world on his shoulders.</p><p>He was also the best man she knew.</p><p>There was nothing he wouldn\u2019t do to help someone. Find a cat on a dark night, drive an hour to do his sister\u2019s laundry, wash a dog covered in chicken poop, let his ex-wife say her piece.</p><p>Go out in the middle of the night to reconstruct a twenty-year-old accident.</p><p>Stop his best friend\u2019s wedding when he knew it would only lead to misery...for Jeremy and for her.</p><p>But the thought of his expression when he broke up with her...that hurt like a splinter in her heart. Just so...decided. So damn resolute.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting out of the truck or what?\u201d Abby said.</p><p>Right. They were here.</p><p>\u201cIce wine!\u201d Dad called, the veritable kid at Christmas. It was a genetic defect or something. Jack was talking to the grapes already. \u201cAre you ready to get pressed, sweeties? Are you excited?\u201d Ned rolled around with Blue on the thin film of snow that had fallen sometime when Faith was asleep. Even Abby accepted her grandfather\u2019s hug and said, yes, she, too, was so excited. Honor already had half a basket full of grapes, and Goggy was manning the forklift, shining the headlights down the row so they could all see what they were doing, snapping at Pops to take a step back or she\u2019d run him over and enjoy her widowhood. Carl was here, too, and returned Faith\u2019s wave a little shyly, perhaps guessing (correctly) that Faith knew far too much about his sex life.</p><p>The faint smell of bacon was in the air; Mrs. J. would be making breakfast at the New House.</p><p>Faith got to work. The frozen clusters of grapes came off easily in her hand, firm, cold little bundles. The stars were brilliant overhead; no moon tonight, the brief snow squall finished. The night air was filled with the sounds of her family bickering, laughing, shouting insults and encouragement to each other. Lights shone over at the Lyons Den, too, as just about every vineyard around made ice wine.</p><p>Mom had always loved the ice harvest. She used to bring cocoa in Thermoses, and muffins hot from the oven. One year, there\u2019d been enough snow to go sledding, and Faith could recall, in a bright flash of memory, the feeling of her mom\u2019s arms around her, the sound of her laugh, the thrill of flying down the hill, knowing her mom would keep her safe.</p><p>She glanced up to find Dad looking at her with a smile, as if he was thinking the same thought.</p><p>After a good hour, they heard another motor. \u201cAhoy, Hollands!\u201d came Jeremy\u2019s voice. It was another tradition started when the Lyons had first moved to New York; the two families took turns bringing coffee to the other. Attached to Jeremy\u2019s tractor was a small trailer, and leave it to the g*y guy, he had a bright red plaid blanket, a huge Thermos, thick ceramic mugs, matching sugar and creamer set, two trays of sugar cookies and a flask of good brandy to lace the coffee.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your eighty-four-year-old great-grandmother isn\u2019t complaining, should you be?\u201d Pru said. \u201cJeremy, pour me a coffee, easy on the coffee, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, will do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how\u2019s pretty Faith?\u201d He gave her a warm hug, which she returned. He\u2019d called her almost daily while she was in San Francisco, sent her funny emails, and she knew he was doing his best to make her feel better about Levi.</p><p>\u201cWhat a great night!\u201d he exclaimed, releasing her to serve as coffee host. \u201cBeautiful skies, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great night,\u201d Honor quipped. \u201cEasy for you to say, lord of the manor. You have people to do the work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d he agreed, handing her dad a cup of coffee. \u201cI should\u2019ve done what you did, John, and just had a litter of children. Would\u2019ve been cheaper that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter get adopting,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI know I\u2019m available.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy put his arm around Faith\u2019s shoulders, his dark eyes smiling. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s my biggest regret about our breakup. We would\u2019ve made beautiful babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely sentiment, Jeremy dear,\u201d Goggy said, pouring a liberal amount of brandy into a mug and handing it to Pops.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not making babies with anyone but me.\u201d</p><p>Faith jumped.</p><p>Levi stood just outside their little circle, jeans and a couple of layers of flannel, seemingly oblivious to the cold. His hair was rumpled, and he looked tired.</p><p>Faith felt that slow, golden heat starting in her heart. Her knees wobbled; her heart did, too. He looked so...good. Kind of grumpy, but good, too.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cGetting enough B12?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jeremy,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cI am tired. I\u2019ve just spent nineteen hours flying back and forth across the country.\u201d He shot Honor a glare. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have made a phone call, Honor? It would\u2019ve been nice to hear she was on her way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d Honor said, unsuccessfully trying to hide her smile with a coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cFaith, listen,\u201d Levi said. He stood in front of her, glanced at her family, then back at her. \u201cLook.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook. Listen. He\u2019s so bossy,\u201d Pru said.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Faith said. \u201cNot you, Levi. You go ahead.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair. A big, masculine, capable hand that, in the fairly recent past, had elicited all sorts of interesting noises from her. Down, girl, Faith\u2019s brain murmured. Let the man say what he came to say.</p><p>Her heart was pretty sure it was going to be good.</p> <p>\u201cFaith,\u201d he said again. \u201cI know that Jeremy is pretty damn near perfect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Levi, I appreciate that,\u201d Jeremy said solemnly. Faith shot him a look, and he smothered a smile.</p><p>Levi glanced again at her family.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Ignore them,\u201d Faith said, taking him by the hand. She towed him away a few rows, farther from the little cabal. \u201cDo not follow us,\u201d she said over her shoulder. She turned back to Levi, wanting so much to simply wrap herself around him, to kiss him until he smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you, too.\u201d He scowled, most definitely not looking happy to see her. \u201cI went to San Francisco to see you. But you\u2019d left already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. So you said.\u201d She raised her eyebrows, hoping to encourage him. It didn\u2019t seem to work. He just stared. \u201cWas there anything else, Levi?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRight. Yes. There is.\u201d He fished something out of his pocket and pressed it into her hand, then curled her fingers around it, holding her hand in both his own. Despite the temperature, he was warm. \u201cI love you, Faith. I\u2019m sorry for being an idiot. I hired someone to help at work, and I\u2019ll try to tell you more about...stuff. But I don\u2019t want to lose you, I love you, and...and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>As speeches went, it wasn\u2019t great. As feelings went...different story. Looked like the branch may have been removed.</p><p>She looked into those soft, green eyes, at the slight frown on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s more than enough,\u201d she whispered, feeling the sting of tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh. Good. That\u2019s good.\u201d He nodded. Looked over her shoulder. Back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou should kiss me now, Levi.\u201d</p> <p>Before the words were fully out of her mouth, he was doing just that, her face cupped in his gentle hands, and his mouth on hers was...well, she hated to even think the word, but it was perfect. Most things in life weren\u2019t, but this was. He kissed her the way a man kisses the woman he loves, as if they were alone, or on an altar, as if they weren\u2019t standing in the freezing dark night with far too many relatives watching their every move.</p><p>\u201cYou need a ring and a date, young man,\u201d her father called. \u201cThis is my princess we\u2019re talking about. None of this living together nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain with the princess crap,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be the princess once in a while?\u201d Prudence added.</p><p>She felt Levi smile against her mouth. He kissed her forehead, held her close, then looked over at her father, who was doing his best impression of a stern parent. \u201cWay ahead of you, sir,\u201d he said.</p><p>He uncurled her fingers\u2014right, she\u2019d almost forgotten\u2014and there, in her palm, was an engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to think about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShe said yes,\u201d he told her family, and a cheer rose from the ranks. Jeremy even wiped his eyes. Dad, too.</p> <p>Then Levi kissed her again, and slid the ring onto her finger, and nothing had ever felt so right.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>THE REHEARSAL DINNER was at Hugo\u2019s so Colleen and Connor wouldn\u2019t have to work, and where Jessica Dunn was a guest this time. Tomorrow, everyone would be dressed in their finery, but tonight was loud, casual and fun; Faith walked in on Pru and Carl in the coatroom; Goggy and Pops had danced half of one dance before the bickering became too intense; Mrs. Johnson scowled, criticized the food and drank pi\u00f1a coladas.</p><p>Ted and Elaine Lyon had come for the wedding, as well as Liza and Wonderful Mike. Freakishly enough, Lorena Creech was also there; Levi had invited Victor Iskin, and apparently Victor and Lorena had made a quickie trip to Vegas on Christmas Day and came back married. \u201cI just want someone to take care of, Faith, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d she\u2019d said, and yes, Faith did. The Bible Study Babes were knocking back the pinot grigio, and the fire department was playing cards at a table in the back.</p><p>Tomorrow, the cast would be much the same as Faith\u2019s first attempt at getting married, with a few minor changes: Colleen was still maid of honor, Faith\u2019s sisters bridesmaids, as well as Abby and Sarah Cooper.</p><p>Jeremy would be best man. Of course.</p><p>He\u2019d also brought a date, which was rather wonderful\u2014a good-looking guy named Patrick who was shy and sweet and a terrible dancer.</p><p>When the party was over, Levi led Faith across the icy town green to his apartment. They\u2019d be living in the Opera House for a while, though Faith had her eye on a little house on Elm Street. It was in a nice mix of a neighborhood\u2014outside the Village but close enough to walk, a peek of the Crooked Lake from the top floor window, a lovely porch. But for now, they\u2019d live at Levi\u2019s place, which was looking much improved with a red-painted wall. Sarah would still live here when she was back from school, and Faith thought it was nice, finally having a little sister to boss around as Honor and Pru had bossed her all those years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting any action tonight, Chief Cooper,\u201d she said, her breath clouding the quiet air. \u201cYou\u2019re not even supposed to see me after midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got half an hour to go.\u201d With that, he scooped her up over his shoulder and carried her, caveman style, up the stairs, making her laugh so hard she could hardly breathe.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d he said, setting her down to open the door. \u201cBlue, you\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait for me, buddy,\u201d Faith said, kneeling down to rub the dog\u2019s tummy. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my first love. Right? Who\u2019s my best boy, hmm?\u201d She took off her coat as Levi rustled around in his desk. \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019d better be good,\u201d she added, sitting on the couch. Blue leaped up next to her.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d he said, sitting across from her. He held a little package, but handed her a folded up piece of paper first.</p><p>\u201cIf this is a poem, I may faint,\u201d she said, smiling. Her smile stopped. He looked...tense.</p><p>\u201cJust read it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She unfolded the paper\u2014notebook paper, soft with age and filled with rather sloppy, youthful handwriting.</p><p>Dear Faith, it said.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry your mom died. I wish could think of something better to say. I think you\u2019re a nice girl, and also pretty. That probably doesn\u2019t help any. But I mean it.</p><p>Sincerely, Levi Cooper.</p><p>\u201cOh, Levi,\u201d she said, feeling the hot burn of tears down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only person who keeps stuff, I guess,\u201d he said, looking at the floor. \u201cI should\u2019ve given it to you back then. It just felt...inadequate at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not inadequate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and wiped her tears away. \u201cI don\u2019t want you crying the night before we get married,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve thought of that before,\u201d she said, smoothing the paper. \u201cI\u2019m very mushy, in case you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Which is why I think you\u2019ll like this, too.\u201d He smiled and handed her the box.</p><p>The rose quartz heart had been set in silver with a tiny chain. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI thought this was in a box at my dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stole it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re finally admitting you gave it to me?\u201d she said, a few more tears slipping down her cheeks as he fastened it around her neck.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think it was Asswipe Jones, but I\u2019m gonna take the credit here.\u201d</p><p>She gave a watery smile. \u201cSorry, pal. It couldn\u2019t have been anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his green eyes softening. \u201cYou happen to be right, Holland.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her, and kissed her again. And then he pulled back and smiled. \u201cAll right, let me get you back to your dad\u2019s. I have a wedding to go to tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>On a beautiful day in January, in front of literally half the town, wearing a wedding dress that made her look like a 1940s film star and holding a bouquet of perfect red roses, Faith Elizabeth Holland married the man she was meant to have. The man, you might say, she was fated to have, if you believed in that stuff.</p><p>Which we absolutely do.</p>  </body></html>"]
