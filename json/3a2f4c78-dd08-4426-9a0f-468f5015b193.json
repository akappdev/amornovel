The war he\u2019d fought had waged for generations. It had been waged, in fact, for so many years that in time, the people fighting it had completely forgotten the reason that they fought. One day, the soldiers looked at the men they battled and realized they did not know why they wanted to kill them. It took the officers a little longer to come to the same conclusion, but eventually they had been prevailed upon, and all the soldiers on both sides of the war had laid down their arms. Peace had been declared.</p><p>So now our soldier marched home on a lonely road. But since the war had gone on for so many years, he no longer had a home to march to, and really he marched to nowhere. Still, he had a pack with some food on his back, the sun shone overhead, and the road he\u2019d chosen was a straight and easy one. He was content with his lot in life.</p><p>His name was Laughing Jack. . . .</p> <p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Jack marched down the road, whistling merrily, for he was a man without a care in the world. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>London, England</p> <p>May 1765</p><p>There are few things more unfortunate in a man\u2019s life than being thrown over by one\u2019s prospective bride on one\u2019s wedding day, Jasper Renshaw, Viscount Vale, reflected. But being thrown over on one\u2019s wedding day whilst suffering the lingering aftereffects of a night of heavy drinking . . . well, that had to set some kind of damnable record for bad luck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so s-s-s-sorry!\u201d Miss Mary Templeton, the prospective bride in question, wailed at a pitch guaranteed to bring a man\u2019s scalp right off his skull. \u201cI never meant to deceive you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cI expect so.\u201d</p><p>He had an urge to rest his aching head in his hands, but this was obviously a highly dramatic point in Miss Templeton\u2019s life, and he felt it wouldn\u2019t show the proper gravity for the moment. At least he was sitting down. There was one straight-backed wooden chair in the church vestry, and he\u2019d commandeered it in a very ungentlemanly manner when first they\u2019d entered.</p><p>Not that Miss Templeton seemed to mind.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my lord!\u201d she cried, presumably to him, although considering where they were, she might\u2019ve been calling on a far higher Presence than he. \u201cI could not help myself, truly I couldn\u2019t. A frail wreck is woman! Too simple, too warmhearted to withstand the gale of passion!\u201d</p><p>Gale ld \u201eof passion? \u201cNo doubt,\u201d Jasper muttered.</p><p>He wished he\u2019d had time for a glass of wine this morning\u2014or two. It might\u2019ve settled his head a bit and helped him to understand what exactly his fianc\u00e9e was trying to tell him\u2014beyond the obvious fact that she no longer wished to become the fourth Viscountess Vale. But he, poor dumb ass, had tottered out of bed this morning expecting nothing worse than a tedious wedding followed by a protracted wedding breakfast. Instead, he\u2019d been met at the church doors by Mr. and Mrs. Templeton, the former looking grim, the latter suspiciously nervous. Add to that, his lovely bride with fresh tears on her face, and he\u2019d known, somewhere deep in his dark and heavy soul, that he would not be eating wedding cake today.</p><p>He smothered a sigh and eyed his erstwhile bride-to-be. Mary Templeton was quite lovely. Dark shining hair, bright blue eyes, a fresh creamy complexion, and nicely plump titties. He\u2019d been rather looking forward to the plump titties, he thought morosely as she paced in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Julius!\u201d Miss Templeton exclaimed now, throwing out her lovely, round arms. It was really too bad that the vestry was such a little room. Her drama needed a larger venue. \u201cIf only I didn\u2019t love you so!\u201d</p><p>Jasper blinked and leaned forward, conscious that he must\u2019ve missed something, because he didn\u2019t remember this Julius. \u201cAh, Julius . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She turned and widened her robin\u2019s-egg-blue eyes. Really, they were rather magnificent. \u201cJulius Fernwood. The curate in the town near Papa\u2019s country estate.\u201d</p><p>He was being thrown over for a curate?</p> <p>\u201cOh, if you could see his gentle brown eyes, his butter-yellow hair, and his grave demeanor, I know you would feel as I do.\u201d</p><p>Jasper arched an eyebrow. That seemed most unlikely.</p><p>\u201cI love him, my lord! I love him with all my simple soul.\u201d</p><p>In an alarming move, she dropped to her knees before him, her pretty, tearstained face upturned, her soft white hands clutched together between her rounded bosom. \u201cPlease! Please, I beg of you, release me from these cruel bonds! Give me back my wings so that I may fly to my true love, the love I will cherish in my heart no matter if I am forced to marry you, forced into your arms, forced to endure your animal lusts, forced to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Jasper cut in hastily before she could enlarge on her portrait of him as a slavering beast bent on ravishment. \u201cI can see that I\u2019m no match for butter- colored hair and a curate\u2019s living. I retire from the field of matrimony. Please. Go to your true love. Felicitations and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, my lord!\u201d She seized his hands and pressed moist kisses on them. \u201cI will be forever grateful, forever in your debt. If ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite. Should I ever need a butter-haired curate or a curate\u2019s wife, et cetera, et cetera. I\u2019ll keep the thought in mind.\u201d With a sudden inspiration, Jasper reached into his pocket and drew out a handful of half crowns. They\u2019d been meant to throw to the rabble outside after the wedding. \u201cHere. For your nuptials. I wish you every happiness with, er, Mr. Fernwood.\u201d</p><p>He poured the coins into her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Miss Templeton\u2019s eyes grew even larger. \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d</p><p>With a last moist kiss to his hand, she skipped from the room. Perhaps she realized that the gift of several pounds\u2019 worth of coins was an impulse on his part and that if she stayed longer, he might rethink his largess.</p><p>Jasper sighed, took out a large linen handkerchief, and wiped his hands. The vestry was a little room, the walls the same ancient gray stone as the church he\u2019d planned to be married in. Dark wood shelves lined one wall, filled with the detritus of the church: old candlesticks, papers, Bibles, and pewter plates. Above, a window with small diamond panes sat high on the wall. He could see the blue sky with a single puffy white cloud floating serenely. A lonely little room to be once more left alone. He replaced the handkerchief in his waistcoat pocket, noticing absently that a button was loose. He\u2019d have to remember to tell Pynch. Jasper leaned his elbow on the table beside his chair and cradled his head, eyes closed.</p><p>Pynch, his man, made a wonderful pick-me-up to settle a sore head after a night of overindulgence. Soon he could go home and take the brew, perhaps go back to bed. Goddammit, but his head hurt, and he couldn\u2019t leave just yet. Voices rose from outside the vestry, echoing off the vaulted ceiling of the old stone church. From the sound, Miss Templeton was meeting with some paternal resistance to her romantic plan. A corner of Jasper\u2019s mouth kicked up. Perhaps her father wasn\u2019t as swayed by butter-yellow hair as she. In any case, he\u2019d far rather face charging Frenchies than the family and guests outside.</p><p>He sighed and stretched his long legs before him. Thus was six months\u2019 hard work undone. Six months was the amount of time he\u2019d taken to court Miss Templeton. A month to find a suitable lass\u2014one from a good family, not too young, not too old, and pretty enough to bed. Three months to carefully court, flirting at balls and salons, taking her for rides in his carriage, buying her sweets and flowers and little fripperies. Then the question put to her, a satisfactory answer, and the chaste kiss on a virginal cheek. After that, the only thing left had been the calling of the banns and various purchases and arrangements made for the upcoming blissful nuptials.</p><p>What, then, had gone wrong? She\u2019d seemed perfectly complacent to his plans. Had never once before this morning voiced any doubts. Indeed, when presented with pearl and gold earrings, one might even go so far as to say she\u2019d been ecstatic. Whence, then, this sudden urge to marry a butter-haired curate?</p><p>This problem of losing fianc\u00e9es would never have happened to his elder brother, Richard, had he lived long enough to seek his own viscountess. Perhaps it was him, Jasper thought morbidly. Something in him that was anathema to the fairer sex\u2014at least when it came to matrimony. One couldn\u2019t help but make note of the fact that this was the second time in less than a year that he\u2019d been handed his cong\u00e9. Of course, the first time it\u2019d been Emeline, who\u2014let us be fair, here\u2014was more sister than lover. Nevertheless, a gentleman might very well\u2014</p><p>The sound of the vestry door creaking open interrupted Jasper\u2019s thoughts. He opened his eyes.</p><p>A tall, slim woman hesitated in the doorway. She was a friend of Emeline\u2019s\u2014the one whose name Jasper could never remember.iv height=\"0%\"&gt;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I wake you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, merely resting.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looked quickly over her shoulder, and shut the door behind her, closeting herself quite improperly with him.</p><p>Jasper raised his eyebrows. She\u2019d never struck him as the dramatic sort, but then his perception in this area was obviously faulty.</p><p>She stood very straight, her shoulders square, her chin lifted ever so slightly. She was a plain woman, with features that a man would be hard-pressed to remember\u2014probably why he couldn\u2019t remember her name now, come to think of it. Her light hair was an indeterminate color between blond and brown, and worn in a knot at the back of her head. Her eyes were a nondescript brown. Her dress was a grayish brown, with an ordinary, square-cut bodice that revealed a meager bosom. The skin there was rather fine, Jasper noted. It was that translucent bluish-white that was often compared to marble. If he peered closer, no doubt he would be able to trace the veins that ran beneath the pale, delicate skin.</p><p>Instead, he raised his eyes to her face. She\u2019d stood there, unmoving, as he\u2019d examined her, but a faint flush was now visible high on her cheekbones.</p><p>The sight of her discomfiture, however slight, made him feel a cad. His words, in consequence, were rather sharp. \u201cIs there some way in which I can assist you, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>She answered with a question of her own. \u201cIs it true that Mary will not marry you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt appears that she has set her heart on capturing a curate, and a mere viscount will no longer do.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile. \u201cYou do not love her.\u201d</p><p>He spread his hands. \u201cSadly true, though it marks me as a blackguard to confess it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She clasped her hands in front of her and did the impossible. She straightened farther. \u201cI wonder if you might marry me instead.\u201d</p><p>MELISANDE FLEMING MADE herself stand still and look Lord Vale in the eye, steadily and without any hint of girlish fluster. She wasn\u2019t a girl, after all. She was a woman in her eight and twentieth year, well past the age of orange blossoms and spring weddings. Well past the hope of happiness, in fact. But it seemed that hope was a hardy thing, almost impossible to beat down.</p><p>What she had just proposed was ridiculous. Lord Vale was a wealthy man. A titled man. A man in the prime of his life. In short, a man who could have his pick of simpering girls, both younger and more beautiful than she. Even if he had just been left at the altar for a penniless curate.</p><p>So Melisande braced herself for laughter, scorn, or\u2014worst of all\u2014pity.</p><p>Instead, Lord Vale simply looked at her. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t heard. His beautiful blue eyes were a trifle bloodshot, and from the way he\u2019d been holding his head when she entered the room, leded the she suspected that he might have overcelebrated his impending nuptials the night before.</p><p>He lounged in his chair, his long muscular legs sprawled before him, taking up much more space than he should. He stared at her with those shockingly bright green-blue eyes. They were luminescent\u2014even whilst bloodshot\u2014but they were the only thing about him that could be called lovely. His face was long, creased with deep lines around the eyes and mouth. His nose was long, too, as well as overlarge. His eyelids drooped at the corners as if he were perpetually sleepy. And his hair . . . actually, his hair was rather nice, curly and thick, and a lovely reddish brown color. It would\u2019ve looked boyish, perhaps even effeminate, on any other man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d nearly not come to his wedding today. Mary was a distant cousin, one she\u2019d spoken to only once or twice in her life. But Gertrude, Melisande\u2019s sister-in-law, had felt ill this morning and insisted that Melisande come to represent their branch of the family. So here she was, having just made the most reckless move of her life.</p><p>How odd fate was.</p><p>Finally, Lord Vale stirred. He rubbed a large bony hand down his face and then looked at her through long, spread fingers. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot\u2014you must forgive me\u2014but for the life of me I can\u2019t remember your name.\u201d</p><p>Naturally. She\u2019d always been the type to hover round the edges of a crowd. Never in the center, never drawing attention to herself.</p> <p>While he was just the opposite.</p><p>She inhaled, tightening her fingers to still their nervous trembling. She would have only this one chance, and she mustn\u2019t bungle it.</p><p>\u201cI am Melisande Fleming. My father was Ernest Fleming of the Northumberland Flemings.\u201d Her family was old and well respected, and she didn\u2019t deign to elaborate. If he hadn\u2019t heard of them before this, her protestations of respectability would do her no good now. \u201cFather is dead, but I have two brothers, Ernest and Harold. My mother was a Prussian \u00e9migr\u00e9, and she is also dead. You may remember that I am friends with Lady Emeline, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d He lifted his hand from his face to wave away her credentials. \u201cI know who you are, I just didn\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name.\u201d</p> <p>He inclined his head. \u201cQuite. As I said\u2014an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cMay I have your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u201d\u2014he shook his head and gestured vaguely with long fingers\u2014\u201cI know I had too much to drink last night and I\u2019m still a little dazed by Miss Templeton\u2019s defection, so my mental facilities may not yet be up to par, but I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a viscount, my lord. False modesty ill becomes you.\u201d</p><p>His wide mouth curved in a faint smile. \u201cRather tart-tongued, aren\u2019t you, for a lady seeking a gentleman\u2019s hand?\u201d</p><p>She felt the heat rise in her neck and cheeks and had to fight the urge to simply fling open the door and run.</p> <p>\u201cWhy,\u201d he a wh\"&gt;\u201cWhy,sked softly, \u201camongst all the other viscounts in the world, why marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an honorable man. I know this from Emeline.\u201d Melisande stepped cautiously, picking and choosing her words with care. \u201cFrom the brevity of your engagement to Mary, you are anxious to wed, are you not?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cIt would certainly appear so.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd I wish to have my own household instead of living on the generosity of my brothers.\u201d A partial truth.</p><p>\u201cYou have no monies of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an excellent dowry and monies that are mine besides that. But an unmarried lady can hardly live by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>He contemplated her, apparently quite content to have her stand before him like a petitioner before the king. After a bit, he nodded and stood, his height forcing her to look up. She might be a tall woman, but he was a taller man.</p> <p>\u201cForgive me, but I must be blunt in order to avert an embarrassing misunderstanding later. I wish a real marriage. A marriage that, with God\u2019s grace, will produce children begot in a shared marriage bed.\u201d He smiled charmingly, his turquoise eyes glinting just a little. \u201cIs that also what you seek?\u201d</p><p>She held his eyes, not daring to hope. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cThen, Miss Fleming, I am honored to accept your offer of marriage.\u201d</p><p>Her chest felt constricted, and at the same time it was as if a fluttering wild thing beat against her rib cage, struggling to burst free and go flying about the room in joy.</p><p>Melisande held out her hand. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He smiled quizzically at her proffered hand and then took it. But instead of shaking to seal the bargain, he bent his head over her knuckles, and she felt the soft brush of his warm lips. She repressed a shudder of longing at the simple touch.</p><p>He straightened. \u201cI only hope that you will still thank me after our wedding day, Miss Fleming.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to reply, but he was already turning away. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have an awful head. I\u2019ll call on your brother in three days, shall I? I must play the forsaken lover for at least three days, don\u2019t you think? Any shorter a period and it might reflect badly on Miss Templeton.\u201d</p><p>With an ironic smile, he gently closed the door behind him.</p><p>Melisande let her shoulders slump with the release of tension. She stared at the door a moment and then looked around the room. It was ordinary, small and a bit untidy. Not the sort of place one would associate with her world turning upside down. And yet\u2014unless the last quarter hour had been a waking dream\u2014this was the place that had seen her life take a new and completely unexpected diversion.</p><p>She examined the back of her hand. There was no mark to show where he had kissed her. She\u2019d known Jasper Renshaw, Lord Vale, for years, but in all that time, he\u2019d never hsho he\u2019d nad occasion to touch her. She pressed the back of her hand to her mouth and closed her eyes, imagining what it would be like when he touched his lips to hers. Her body trembled at the thought.</p><p>Then she straightened her back again, smoothed her already smooth skirts, and ran her fingertips across her hair to make sure everything was in order. Thus settled, she began to leave the room, but as she moved, her foot struck something. A silver button lay on the flagstones, hidden by her skirts until she\u2019d stepped forward. Melisande picked it up and turned it slowly in her fingers. The letter V was embossed in the silver. She stared at it a moment before hiding the button up her sleeve.</p><p>Then she walked from the church vestry.</p><p>\u201cPYNCH, HAVE YOU ever heard of a man losing a bride and gaining a fianc\u00e9e on the same day?\u201d Jasper asked idly later that afternoon.</p><p>He was lounging in his specially made, very large tin bathtub.</p><p>Pynch, his valet, was over in the corner of the room, messing about with the clothes in the dresser. He replied without turning. \u201cNo, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, then, that perhaps I am the first in history to do so. London should put up a statue in my honor. Small children could come and gape whilst their nannies admonish them not to follow in my fickle footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lord,\u201d Pynch replied in a monotone.</p><p>Pynch\u2019s voice was the perfect tone for a superior manservant\u2014smooth, evenly deep, and unruffled\u2014which was just as well since the rest of him wasn\u2019t much like a superior manservant at all. Pynch was a big man. A very big man. Shoulders like an ox, hands that could easily span a dinner plate, a neck as thick as Jasper\u2019s thigh, and a big bald dome of a head. What Pynch looked like was a grenadier, a heavy infantryman used by the army to charge breaches in the enemy line.</p><p>As it happened, a grenadier was exactly what Pynch had originally been in His Majesty\u2019s army. That was before he\u2019d had a slight difference of opinion with his sergeant, which had resulted in Pynch spending a day in the stocks. Jasper had actually first seen Pynch in the stocks, stoically receiving spoiled vegetables to the face. This sight had so impressed Jasper that immediately upon Pynch\u2019s liberation, Jasper had offered him the position of his batman. Pynch had readily accepted the offer. Two years later, when Jasper had sold his commission, he\u2019d also bought out Pynch and Pynch had returned to England with him as his valet. A satisfactory series of events all around, Jasper reflected as he stuck a foot out of his bath and flicked a droplet of water from his big toe.</p><p>\u201cHave you sent that letter to Miss Fleming?\u201d He\u2019d dashed off a missive politely stating that he\u2019d call on her brother in three days if she did not signify a change of mind in the meantime.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Good. I think this engagement will take. I have a feeling about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feeling, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jasper said. He took up a long-handled brush and ran it across the top of his toe. \u201cLike the one I had a fortnight ago when I wagered half a reegered hguinea on that long-necked chestnut.\u201d</p><p>Pynch cleared his throat. \u201cI believe the chestnut came up lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it?\u201d Jasper waved a hand. \u201cNo matter. One should never compare ladies to horses, in any event. The point I\u2019m trying to make is that we are already three hours engaged, and Miss Fleming hasn\u2019t yet called it off. You\u2019re impressed, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA positive sign, my lord, but may I point out that Miss Templeton waited until your wedding day to break the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but in this case, it was Miss Fleming herself who brought up the idea of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Jasper paused in scrubbing his left foot. \u201cNot that I\u2019d want that fact to leave this room.\u201d</p><p>Pynch stiffened. \u201cNo, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Jasper winced. Damn, he\u2019d insulted Pynch. \u201cNo good would come of hurting the lady\u2019s feelings, even if she did rather fling herself at my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFling, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d Jasper gestured with the long-handled brush, spraying a nearby chair with water. \u201cShe seemed to be under the impression that I was desperate to be married and therefore might take a chance on her.\u201d</p><p>Pynch arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t correct the lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPynch, Pynch, haven\u2019t I told you never to contradict a lady? It\u2019s ungentlemanly and a waste of time to boot\u2014they\u2019ll just go on believing what they want anyway.\u201d Jasper scrunched his nose at the bath brush. \u201cBesides, I have to get married sometime. Wed and beget as all my noble forefathers have done. It\u2019s no use trying to avoid the chore. A male child or two\u2014preferably with at least half a brain in their head\u2014must be fathered to carry on the ancient and moldy Vale name. This way it saves me months of having to go out and court another chit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Then one lady would do as well as any other in your view, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jasper said, then immediately changed his mind. \u201cNo. Damn you, Pynch, for your lawyerly logic. Actually, there\u2019s something about her. I\u2019m not sure how to describe it. She\u2019s not exactly the lady I\u2019d choose, but when she stood there, looking so very brave and at the same time frowning at me as if I\u2019d spat in front of her . . . Well, I was rather charmed, I think. Unless it was the lingering aftereffects of the whiskey from last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally, my lord,\u201d Pynch murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnyway. What I was trying to say was that I hope this engagement ends with me safely wed. Otherwise I shall very soon have a reputation as a rotten egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Jasper frowned at the ceiling. \u201cPynch, you are not to agree with me when I compare myself to a rotten egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can only pray that Miss Fleming will not meet any curates in the coming weeks before the wedding. Especially yellow-haired ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d Jasper said musingly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever met a curate I liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always seem to be lacking a chin.\u201d Jasper fingered his own rather long chin. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s some type of necessary requirement to enter the English clergy. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible, yes. Likely, no, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of the room, Pynch transferred a stack of linens to the top shelf of the wardrobe. \u201cWill you be at home today, my lord?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlas, no. I have other business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould your business involve that man in Newgate Prison?\u201d</p><p>Jasper switched his gaze from the ceiling to his valet. Pynch\u2019s usually wooden expression had a bit of squint about the eyes, which was Pynch\u2019s version of a worried face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Thornton\u2019s to be tried soon, and he\u2019s sure to be convicted and hanged. Once he\u2019s gone, any information he has dies with him.\u201d</p> <p>Pynch crossed the room with a large bath sheet. \u201cAlways assuming he has any information to impart.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stepped from the tub and took the sheet. \u201cYes, always assuming that.\u201d</p><p>Pynch watched him as he dried off, that same squint in his eyes. \u201cPardon me, my lord, I don\u2019t like to speak when it isn\u2019t my place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you will anyway,\u201d Jasper muttered.</p><p>His manservant continued as if he hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cBut I am worried that you are becoming obsessed with this man. He\u2019s a known liar. What makes you think he\u2019ll speak the truth now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Jasper threw aside the towel and strode to a chair where his clothes lay and began dressing. \u201cHe is a liar and a rapist and a murderer and God only knows what else. Only a fool would trust his word. But I cannot let him go to the gallows without at least trying to learn the truth from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear that he is merely toying with you for his own amusement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no doubt correct, Pynch, as you usually are.\u201d Jasper didn\u2019t look at the valet as he pulled a shirt over his head. He\u2019d met Pynch after the massacre of the 28th Regiment of Foot at Spinner\u2019s Falls. Pynch had not fought in the battle. The valet didn\u2019t have the same drive to find out who had betrayed the regiment. \u201cBut, sadly, reason does not matter. I must go.\u201d</p><p>Pynch sighed and brought him his shoes. \u201cVery well, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Jasper sat to\"0%Jasper draw on his buckle shoes. \u201cBuck up, Pynch. The man\u2019ll be dead in another sennight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say, my lord,\u201d Pynch muttered as he picked up the debris of the bath.</p> <p>Jasper finished dressing in silence and then went to his dresser to comb and club his hair back.</p><p>Pynch held out his coat. \u201cI trust you haven\u2019t forgotten, my lord, that Mr. Dorning has made another request for your presence on the Vale lands in Oxfordshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Dorning was his land steward and had written several appeals for his help with a land dispute. He\u2019d already put the poor man off in order to get married and now . . . \u201cDorning\u2019ll just have to wait another few days. I can\u2019t leave without talking to Miss Fleming\u2019s brother and Miss Fleming herself. Remind me again, please, when I return.\u201d</p><p>Jasper shrugged on his coat, grabbed his hat, and was out of the room before Pynch could make another protest. Jasper clattered down the stairs, nodded to his butler, and strode out the door of his London town house. Outside, one of the stable lads was waiting with Belle, his big bay mare. Jasper thanked the boy and mounted the horse, steadying her as she sidled sideways, mouthing her bit. The streets were crowded, necessitating that he keep the mare to a walk. Jasper headed west, toward the dome of St. Paul\u2019s, looming above the smaller buildings surrounding it.</p><p>The bustle of London was a far cry from the uncivilized woodland where this whole thing had started. He remembered well the tall trees and the falls, the sound of roaring water mixing with the screams of dying men. Nearly seven years before, he\u2019d been a captain in His Majesty\u2019s army, fighting the French in the Colonies. The 28th Regiment of Foot had been marching back from the victory at Quebec, the line of soldiers strung out along a narrow path, when they\u2019d been attacked by Indians. They\u2019d never had time to form a defensive position. Nearly the entire regiment had been massacred in less than half an hour and their colonel killed. Jasper and eight other men were captured, marched to a Wyandot Indian camp and . . .</p><p>Even now he had trouble thinking about it. Once in a while, shadows of that period appeared at the edge of his thoughts, like a fleeting glimpse of something out of the corner of one\u2019s eye. He\u2019d thought the whole thing over, the past dead and buried, if not forgotten. Then six months ago, he\u2019d walked out the French doors of a ballroom and seen Samuel Hartley on the terrace outside.</p><p>Hartley had been a corporal in the army. One of the few men to survive the massacre of the 28th. He\u2019d told Jasper that some traitor within the regiment had given their position to the French and their Indian allies. When Jasper had joined Hartley in searching for the traitor, they\u2019d discovered a murderer who\u2019d assumed the identity of one of the Spinner\u2019s Falls fallen\u2014Dick Thornton. Thornton\u2014Jasper had trouble calling him anything else, though he knew it wasn\u2019t his true name\u2014was now in Newgate, charged with murder. But on the night they\u2019d captured him, Thornton had claimed that he wasn\u2019t the traitor.</p><p>Jasper nudged Belle\u2019s flanks to guide her around a pushcart piled high with ripe fruit.</p> <p>\u201cBuy a sweet plum, sir?\u201d the pretty dark-eyed girl next to the cart cried to him. She cocked her hip flirtatiously as she held out the fruit.</p><p>Jasper grinned appreciatively. \u201cNot as sweet as your apples, I\u2019ll wager.\u201d</p><p>The fruit girl\u2019s laughter followed him as he rode through the crowded street. Jasper\u2019s thoughts returned to his mission. As Pynch had so rightly pointed out, Thornton was a man who told lies as a matter of habit. Hartley had certainly never voiced any doubt as to Thornton\u2019s guilt. Jasper snorted. Then again, Hartley had been busy with a new wife, Lady Emeline Gordon\u2014Jasper\u2019s first fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Jasper looked up and realized that he\u2019d come to Skinner Street, which led directly into Newgate Street. The imposing ornamental gate of the prison arched over the road. The prison had been rebuilt after the Great Fire and was suitably decorated with statues representing such fine sentiments as peace and mercy. But the closer one drew to the prison, the more ominous the stench became. The air seemed heavy, laden with the foul odors of human excrement, disease, rot, and despair.</p><p>One leg of the arch terminated in the keeper\u2019s lodge. Jasper dismounted in the courtyard outside.</p><p>A guard lounging beside the door straightened. \u201cBack are ye, milord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a bad penny, McGinnis.\u201d</p><p>McGinnis was a fellow veteran of His Majesty\u2019s army and had lost an eye in some foreign place. A rag was wrapped about his head to hide the hole, but it\u2019d slipped to reveal red scarring.</p><p>The man nodded and yelled into the lodge. \u201cOy, Bill! Lord Vale \u2019as come again.\u201d He turned back to Jasper. \u201cBill\u2019ll be \u2019ere in two ticks, milord.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded and gave the guard a half crown, insurance that the mare would still be in the yard when he returned. He\u2019d quickly figured out on his first visit to this dismal place that extravagantly bribing the guards made the entire experience much simpler.</p><p>Bill, a runty little man with a thick shock of iron-gray hair, soon came out of the lodge. He held the badge of his trade in his right hand: a large iron ring of keys. The little man hunched a shoulder at Jasper and crossed the yard to the prison\u2019s main entrance. Here, a huge overhanging doorway was decorated with carved manacles and the biblical quote VENIO SICUT FUR\u2014I come as a thief. Bill hunched his shoulder at the guards who stood about by the portal and led the way inside.</p><p>The smell was worse here, the air stale and unmoving. Bill trotted ahead of Jasper, through a long corridor and outside again. They crossed a large courtyard with prisoners milling around or huddled in clumps like refuse washed upon a particularly dismal shore. They passed through another, smaller building, and then Bill led the way to the stairs that emptied into the Condemned Hold. It was belowground, as if to give the prisoners a taste of the hell they would soon spend eternity in. The stairs were damp, the stone worn smooth by many despairing feet.</p><p>The subterranean corridor was dim\u2014the prisoners paid for their own candles here, and the prices were inflated. A man was singing, a low, sweet dirge that every now and again rose on a high note. Someone coughed and low voices quarreled, but the place was mostly quiet. Bill stopped before a cell that held four occupants. One lay on a pallet in the corner, most likely asleep. Two men played cards by the light of a single flickering candle.</p><p>The fourth man leaned against the wall near the bars but straightened when he saw them.</p><p>\u201cA lovely afternoon, isn\u2019t it, Dick?\u201d Jasper called out as he neared.</p><p>Dick Thornton cocked his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, would I?\u201d</p><p>Jasper tsked softly. \u201cSorry, old man. Forgot you can\u2019t see the sun much from in here, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Jasper regarded the man behind the bars. Thornton was an ordinary man of middling height with a pleasant, if forgettable, face. The only thing that made him stand out in the least was his flaming red hair. Thornton knew damn well what he wanted\u2014Jasper had asked often enough in the past. \u201cWant? Why, nothing. I\u2019m merely passing the time, seeing the sweet sights of Newgate.\u201d</p><p>Thornton grinned and winked, the facial expression like a strange tic he couldn\u2019t control. \u201cYou must think me a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Jasper eyed the man\u2019s threadbare clothes. He dipped his hand in his pocket and came up with a half crown. \u201cI think you a rapist, a liar, and a murderer many times over, but a fool? Not at all. You wrong me, Dick.\u201d</p><p>Thornton licked his lips, watching as Jasper flipped the coin between his fingers. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jasper tilted his head and gazed rather absently at the stained stone ceiling. \u201cI was just remembering when we caught you, Sam Hartley and I, at Princess Wharf. Terribly rainy day. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you may recollect that you claimed not to be the traitor.\u201d</p><p>A crafty gleam entered Thornton\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no claim about it. I\u2019m not the traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jasper dropped his gaze from the ceiling to stare Thornton in the eye. \u201cWell, you see that\u2019s just it. I think you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I lie, then I\u2019ll die for my sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll die anyway, and in less than a month. The law says that convicted men must be hanged within two days of their sentencing. They\u2019re rather strict about it, I\u2019m afraid, Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if I\u2019m convicted at trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you will be,\u201d Jasper said gently. \u201cNever fear.\u201d</p><p>Thornton looked sullen. \u201cThen why should I tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shrugged. \u201cYou still have a few weeks left of life. Why not spend it with a full belly and clean clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you somethin\u2019 for a clean coat,\u201d one of the men playing cards muttered.</p><p>Jasper ignored him. \u201cWell, Dick?\u201d</p><p>The red-haired man stared at him, his face blank. He winked and suddenly thrust his face at the bars. \u201cYou want to know who betrayed us to the%\" yed us French and their scalping friends? You want to know who painted the earth with blood, there by that damned falls? Look at the men who were captured with you. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the traitor.\u201d</p><p>Jasper jerked his head back as if a snake had struck. \u201cNonsense.\u201d</p><p>Thornton stared a moment more and then began laughing, high, staccato barks.</p><p>\u201cShaddup!\u201d a male voice from another cell yelled.</p><p>Thornton continued the odd sound, but the entire time his eyes were wide and fixed maliciously on Jasper\u2019s face. Jasper stared stonily back. Lies or insinuated half-truths, he\u2019d not get any more from Dick Thornton. Today or ever. He held Thornton\u2019s gaze and deliberately dropped the coin to the floor. It rolled to the center of the passage\u2014well out of reach of the prison cell. Thornton stopped laughing, but Jasper had already turned and was walking out of that hell-damned cellar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Presently, Jack came upon an old man, sitting by the side of the road. The old man\u2019s clothes were rags, his feet were bare, and he sat as if the whole world rested upon his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOh, kind sir,\u201d the beggar cried. \u201cHave you a crust of bread to spare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more than that, Father,\u201d Jack replied.</p> <p>He stopped and opened his pack and drew out half a meat pie, carefully wrapped in a kerchief. This he shared with the old man, and with a tin cup of water from a nearby stream, it made a very fine meal indeed. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>That night, Melisande sat at dinner and contemplated a meal of boiled beef, boiled carrots, and boiled peas. It was her brother Harold\u2019s favorite meal, in fact. She was on one side of a long, dark wood dining table. At the head of the table was Harold and at the foot was his wife, Gertrude. The room was dim and shadowy, lit only by a handful of candles. They could well afford beeswax candles, of course, but Gertrude was a frugal housekeeper and did not believe in wasting candle wax\u2014a philosophy that Harold heartily approved of. Actually, Melisande had often thought that Harold and Gertrude were the epitome of the perfectly matched husband and wife: they had the same tastes and views and were both a trifle boring.</p><p>She looked down at her grayish portion of boiled beef and considered how she was to tell her brother and his wife of her understanding with Lord Vale. Carefully she cut off a small piece of beef. She picked it up in her fingers and held the bite down by her skirts. Under the table, she felt a cold little nose against her hand, and then the beef was gone.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry to have missed Mary Templeton\u2019s wedding,\u201d Gertrude commented from the foot of the table. Her smooth, wide brow was marred by a single indent between her eyebrows. \u201cOr rather, her not wedding, for I am sure that her mother, Mrs. Templeton, would=\"4\u201e have appreciated my presence there. I am told by many people, many people, that I am a comfort and a relief to those whose fortunes are in decline, and Mrs. Templeton\u2019s fortunes are quite in decline at the moment, are they not? One might even say Mrs. Templeton\u2019s fortunes are abysmal.\u201d</p> <p>She paused to take a tiny bite of boiled carrot and looked to her husband for his concurrence.</p><p>Harold shook his head. He had their father\u2019s heavy jowls and thinning light brown hair, covered now with a gray wig. \u201cThat gel ought to be put on bread and water until she comes to her senses. Throwing over a viscount. Foolish, is what it is. Foolish!\u201d</p><p>Gertrude nodded. \u201cI think she must be insane.\u201d</p><p>Harold perked up at this. He was always morbidly interested in disease. \u201cDoes lunacy run in the family?\u201d</p><p>Melisande felt a nudge against her leg. She looked down to see a small black nose poking out from beneath the table edge. She cut off another piece of beef and held it under the table. Both nose and beef disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI do not know if there is lunacy in that family, but I would not be surprised,\u201d Gertrude replied. \u201cNo, not surprised at all. Of course, there is no lunacy on our side of the family, but the Templetons cannot say the same, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>Melisande used the tines of her fork to scoot the peas to the edge of her plate, feeling rather sorry for Mary. Mary had only followed her heart, after all. She felt a paw against her knee, but this time she ignored it. \u201cI believe that Mary Templeton is in love with the curate.\u201d</p><p>Gertrude\u2019s eyes widened like boiled gooseberries. \u201cI don\u2019t think that pertains.\u201d She appealed to her husband. \u201cDo you think that pertains, Mr. Fleming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it does not pertain at all,\u201d Harold replied predictably. \u201cThe chit had a satisfactory match, and she threw it away on a curate.\u201d He chewed meditatively for a moment. \u201cVale is well rid of her, in my opinion. Might\u2019ve brought a bad strain of insanity into his bloodline. Not good. Not good at all. Better for him to find a wife elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs to that . . .\u201d Melisande cleared her throat. She would find no better opening. Best to get it over with. \u201cI have something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d Gertrude was sawing at the lump of beef on her plate and didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>Melisande took a deep breath and stated it bluntly, because really, there didn\u2019t seem to be any other way to do it. Her left hand lay in her lap, and she felt the comforting touch of a warm tongue. \u201cLord Vale and I came to an understanding today. We are going to be married.\u201d</p><p>Gertrude dropped her knife.</p><p>Harold choked on the sip of wine he\u2019d taken.</p> <p>Melisande winced. \u201cI thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Gertrude said. \u201cTo Lord Vale? Jasper Renshaw, Viscount Vale?\u201d she clarified as if there might be another Lord Vale in England.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYesnt&gt;</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Harold looked at his wife. Gertrude stared back at him, quite obviously at a loss for words. He turned to Melisande. \u201cAre you quite sure? Might you have mistaken a look or . . .\u201d His sentence trailed away. It was probably quite hard to think of what else might be mistaken for a marriage proposal.</p><p>\u201cI am sure,\u201d she said quietly but clearly. Her words were steady, though her heart was singing inside. \u201cLord Vale said he would call upon you in three days to settle the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Harold stared in consternation at his boiled English beef, as if it had turned to Spanish stewed squid. \u201cWell. Then I offer my congratulations, my dear. I wish you every happiness with Lord Vale.\u201d He blinked and looked up at her, his brown eyes uncertain. He\u2019d never really understood her, poor man, but she knew he cared for her. \u201cIf you are sure?\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled at him. However little they had in common, Harold was still her brother, and she loved him. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, though he still looked worried. \u201cThen I shall send a missive informing Lord Vale that I will be glad to receive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Harold.\u201d Melisande aligned her fork and knife precisely on her plate. \u201cNow, if you will excuse me, it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>She rose from the table, conscious that the minute she exited the room, Harold and Gertrude would discuss the matter. The skitter of claws against the wood floor trailed her as she entered the dim hallway\u2014Gertrude\u2019s economy of candles prevailed here as well.</p><p>Their amazement was only to be expected, really. Melisande had shown no interest in matrimony for many years, not since her disastrous engagement to Timothy so long ago. Strange, to think now how devastated she\u2019d been when Timothy had left her. All that she\u2019d lost had been unbearable. Her emotions had been sharp and burning then, so awful that she\u2019d thought she might die from his rejection. The pain had been physical, a deep cutting thing that had made her chest ache and her head pound. She never wanted to feel such agony again.</p><p>Melisande rounded a corner and mounted the stairs. Since Timothy, she\u2019d had few suitors and none of them serious. Harold and Gertrude had probably long resigned themselves to her living with them for the rest of her natural life. She was grateful that they had never shown any aversion to her constant company. Unlike many spinsters, she\u2019d not been made to feel a burden or out of place.</p><p>In the upper hall, her room was the first around a curve to the right. She shut the door, and Mouse, her little terrier, jumped onto the bed. He turned three times, then lay down on the counterpane and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAn exhausting day for you as well, Sir Mouse?\u201d Melisande inquired.</p><p>The dog tilted his head at her voice, his black bead eyes alert, his button ears\u2014one white, the other brown\u2014pricked forward. The fire was burning low in the grate, and she used a taper to light several candles around the small bedroom. The room was sparsely furnished, yet each piece was chosen carefully. The bed was narrow, but the delicately carved posts were a rich, golden brown. The counterpane was a plain white, but the sheets hidden underneath were made of the finest silk. There was only one chair in front of thshun fronte fireplace, but the arms were gilt, the seat richly embroidered in gold and purple. This was her refuge from the world. The place where she could simply be herself.</p><p>Melisande went to her desk and contemplated the pile of papers there. She was nearly done with the fairy-tale translation, but\u2014</p><p>A knock sounded at her door. Mouse sailed off the bed and barked wildly at the door as if marauders were without.</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Melisande toed him aside and opened the door.</p><p>A maid stood outside. She bobbed a curtsy. \u201cPlease, miss, might I have a word with you?\u201d</p><p>Melisande raised her brows and nodded, stepping back from the door. The girl eyed Mouse, who was grumbling under his breath, and made a wide berth around the dog.</p><p>Shutting the door, Melisande looked at the maid. She was a pretty girl, with gold curls and fresh, pink cheeks, and she wore a rather elegant green printed calico gown. \u201cSally, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The maid bobbed again. \u201cYes, mum, Sally from downstairs. I heard . . .\u201d She gulped, squeezed her eyes shut, and said very quickly, \u201cI heard that you\u2019ll be marrying Lord Vale, ma\u2019am, and if you do that, you\u2019ll be leaving this house and going to live with him, and then you\u2019ll be a viscountess, ma\u2019am, and if you\u2019re a viscountess, ma\u2019am, then you\u2019ll be needing a proper lady\u2019s maid, because viscountesses have to have their hair and clothes just so, and begging your pardon, ma\u2019am, but they\u2019re not just so right now. Not\u201d\u2014her eyes widened, as if fearing she\u2019d just insulted Melisande\u2014\u201cnot that there\u2019s anything wrong with your clothes or hair right now, but they\u2019re not, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly like that of a viscountess,\u201d Melisande said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWell, no, ma\u2019am, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so, ma\u2019am. And what I wanted to ask\u2014and I\u2019ll be ever so grateful if you let me, truly I will, you won\u2019t be a wit disappointed, ma\u2019am\u2014is if you\u2019d take me with you as your lady\u2019s maid?\u201d</p><p>Sally\u2019s flow of words stopped abruptly. She simply stared, eyes and mouth wide, as if Melisande\u2019s next words would decide her very fate.</p><p>Which well they might, since the difference in station between a downstairs maid and a lady\u2019s maid was considerable. Melisande nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Sally blinked. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You may go with me as my lady\u2019s maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Sally\u2019s hands flew up and it seemed she might grasp Melisande\u2019s in gratitude, but then she must have thought better of it and merely waved them excitedly in the air. \u201cOh! Oh, thank you, ma\u2019am! Oh, thank you! You\u2019ll not regret it, really you won\u2019t. I\u2019ll be the best lady\u2019s maid you ever did see, just you watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d Melisande opened the door again. \u201cWe can discuss your duties more thoroughly in the morning. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Thank you, ma\u2019am. Good night, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Sally bobbed into the hall, did a half-turn, bobbed again, and was still bobbing as Melisande shut the door.or.</p><p>\u201cShe seems a nice enough girl,\u201d she said to Mouse.</p><p>Mouse snorted and leaped back onto the bed.</p><p>Melisande tapped him on the nose, then crossed to her dresser. A plain tin snuffbox sat on top. She briefly brushed the battered surface with her fingertips before taking out the button from where she\u2019d hidden it in her sleeve. The silver V winked in the candlelight as she contemplated it.</p><p>She\u2019d loved Jasper Renshaw for six long, long years. It must\u2019ve been shortly after he\u2019d returned to England that she\u2019d attended the party where she\u2019d met him. He hadn\u2019t noticed her, of course. His blue-green eyes had drifted over her head as they were introduced, and shortly afterward, he\u2019d excused himself to flirt with Mrs. Redd, a notorious and notoriously beautiful widow. Melisande had watched from the side of the ball, sitting next to a line of elderly ladies, as he\u2019d thrown his head back and laughed with complete abandon. His neck had been strong, his mouth opened wide with mirth. He was a captivating sight, but she probably would\u2019ve dismissed him after that as a silly, feckless aristocrat if not for what had happened several hours later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was after midnight, and she\u2019d long since grown tired of the festivities. In fact, she would\u2019ve gone home if it wouldn\u2019t have spoiled her friend Lady Emeline\u2019s pleasure. Emeline had bullied her into attending, for it had been over a year since the fiasco with Timothy, and Melisande\u2019s spirits were still low. But the noise, the heat and press of bodies, and the staring of strangers had become unbearable, and Melisande had drifted away from the ballroom. She thought she\u2019d gone in the direction of the ladies\u2019 retiring room, until she\u2019d heard male voices. She should\u2019ve turned back then, crept away down the dark corridor, but one of the male voices had risen, had seemed to be weeping, in fact, and curiosity had gotten the better of her. She\u2019d peered around a corner and had witnessed . . . well, a tableau.</p><p>A young man she\u2019d never seen before leaned against a wall at the end of the corridor. He wore a white wig, beneath which was a pale and smoothly flawless complexion, save for the ruddy color in his cheeks. He was beautiful, but his head was flung back, his eyes closed, his face the picture of despair. In one hand, he grasped a bottle of wine. Next to him was Lord Vale, but a completely different Lord Vale than the man who\u2019d spent three hours flirting and laughing in the ballroom. This Lord Vale was silent and still and listening.</p><p>Listening to the other man weep.</p><p>\u201cThey used to come to me only in my dreams, Vale,\u201d the young man cried. \u201cNow they come even when I wake. I see a face in a crowd, and I imagine it a Frenchie or one of those savages, come to take my scalp. I know \u2019tisn\u2019t so, but I can\u2019t convince myself. Last sennight, I struck my valet and knocked him down just because he startled me. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if it will end. I can\u2019t rest!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush,\u201d Vale murmured, almost as a mother would a child. His eyes were sad, his mouth twisted down. \u201cHush. It\u2019ll end. I promise you, it\u2019ll end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there, too, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d Vale answered. With one hand, he took the bottle gently from the other man\u2019s hand. \u201cI survived and so will you. You must be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you see the demons?\u201d the young man whispered.</p><p>Vale closed his eyes as if in pain. \u201cIt\u2019s best to ignore them. Turn your mind to lighter, more wholesome images. Don\u2019t dwell on the morbid and hellish thoughts. They\u2019ll capture your mind if you do and will pull you down with them.\u201d</p> <p>The other man sagged against the wall. He still looked unhappy, but his brow was clearing. \u201cYou understand me, Vale. No one else does.\u201d</p><p>A footman came from the other end of the hall and caught Lord Vale\u2019s eye. Lord Vale nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour carriage is already waiting. This man will show you the way.\u201d Lord Vale placed his hand on the other man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo home and rest. On the morrow, I shall call \u2019round, and we shall go riding in Hyde Park together, my friend.\u201d</p><p>The young man sighed and let himself be led away by the footman.</p><p>Lord Vale stared after them until they disappeared around the corner. Then he tilted his head back and drank a long swallow from the bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he muttered when he lowered the bottle, and his wide mouth twisted in pain or another less understandable emotion. \u201cGoddamn it to hell.\u201d</p> <p>And he turned and strode away.</p><p>A half hour later, she saw Lord Vale again. He was in the ballroom, slyly whispering in Mrs. Redd\u2019s ear, and Melisande would never have believed this careless rogue the same man who had comforted his friend, if she had not seen it herself. But she had seen it, and she\u2019d known. Despite Timothy and the hard lessons learned about love, grief, and loss, she\u2019d known. Here was a man who kept his secrets as close as she did her own. Here was a man she would fall helplessly\u2014hopelessly\u2014in love with.</p><p>For six years, she\u2019d loved him, though she knew he did not know her. She\u2019d stood and watched as Emeline became engaged to Lord Vale, and she hadn\u2019t turned a hair. After all, what use was mourning when the man would never be hers? She\u2019d watched as he\u2019d engaged himself again to the insipid Mary Templeton, and she\u2019d been serene\u2014at least on the outside. But when she\u2019d realized in that church yesterday that Mary had actually thrown Lord Vale over, something wild and uncontrollable had risen up in her breast. Why not? it\u2019d cried. Why not try and claim him?</p><p>And so she had.</p><p>Melisande tilted the button until the candlelight flashed off its polished surface. She would have to be very, very careful how she proceeded with Lord Vale. Love, as she so well knew, was her Achilles\u2019 heel. Not by word or deed must she let him know how she really felt. Melisande opened the snuffbox and placed the button carefully inside.</p><p>She undressed and extinguished the candles before climbing into bed. Holding the covers up, she let Mouse bustle underneath. The bed trembled as he turned around and then lay down, his smooth, warm back against her calves.</p><p>Melisande stared into the darkness. Soon she would be sharing her bed with more than little Mouse. Would she be able to lie with Jasper without revealing her terrible love? She shivered at the questild at thtion and closed her eyes to sleep.</p><p>ONE WEEK LATER, Jasper drew his matched grays to a halt in front of Mr. Harold Fleming\u2019s town house and sprang down from his phaeton. His new phaeton. It was tall and elegant, had cost an extravagant amount of money, and the wheels were absolutely enormous. He was rather looking forward to driving Miss Fleming to an afternoon musicale. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to the musicale itself, of course, but he supposed one must end up somewhere when driving a phaeton.</p> <p>Tilting his tricorne at a jaunty angle, he bounded up the steps and knocked. Ten minutes later, he was cooling his heels in a rather boring library while he waited for his fianc\u00e9e to appear. He\u2019d actually seen this library only four days before when he\u2019d called upon Mr. Fleming to discuss the marriage settlement. That had been an entirely tedious three hours, brightened only by the fact that Miss Fleming had been quite right: She did indeed have an excellent dowry. Miss Fleming herself had not appeared once during his visit. Not that she was required for the business meeting\u2014in fact, it was usual for the lady involved to be absent\u2014but her presence would\u2019ve been a welcome break.</p><p>Jasper strolled the library and inspected the shelves. The books seemed to be all in Latin, and he was just wondering if Mr. Fleming actually read everything in Latin or if he\u2019d bought the books by the crate at a booksellers when Miss Fleming entered the room, drawing on her gloves. He hadn\u2019t seen her since that morning in the vestry, but she wore nearly the same expression: a look of mingled determination and faint disapproval. Oddly, he found the expression rather charming.</p><p>Jasper bowed with a flourish. \u201cAh, my dear, you are as winsome as the breeze on a sunny summer\u2019s day. That frock enshrines your beauty like gold does a ruby ring.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cI believe your simile is not quite correct. My dress is not gold-colored, and I am not a ruby.\u201d</p><p>Jasper widened his smile, showing more teeth. \u201cAh, but I have no doubt that your virtue will prove you a ruby among women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her mouth twitched, whether in irritation or amusement it was hard to tell. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never understood why there isn\u2019t a similar passage in the Bible instructing husbands.\u201d</p><p>He tsked. \u201cCareful. You come perilously close to blasphemy. Besides, are not husbands universally virtuous?\u201d</p><p>She humphed. \u201cAnd how do you explain my dress that is not gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not be gold, but the color is, ah . . .\u201d And here he rather unfortunately ran out of ideas, because, in fact, the frock Miss Fleming wore was the color of horse dung.</p><p>Miss Fleming slowly arched an eyebrow.</p><p>Jasper clasped her gloved hand and bent over it, inhaling the spicy orange scent of Neroli water as he thought for something to say. All he could think was that the sensuous Neroli scent was in sharp contrast to her plain gown. It did stimulate his brain, however, because when he rose, he smiled charmingly and said, \u201cThe color of your frock reminds me of a wild and stormy cliff.\u201d</p><p>Miss Fleming\u2019s eyebrow remained arched skeptically. \u201cIndeed?\u201d nodeed?\u201d&lt;</p><p>Damnable girl. He tucked her hand in his elbow. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is an exotic and mysterious color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was plain brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d He widened his eyes in feigned shock. \u201cNever say \u2018plain brown.\u2019 Ash or oak or tea or fawn or perhaps even squirrel-colored, but certainly not brown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSquirrel-colored?\u201d She looked at him sideways as he led her down the steps. \u201cIs that a compliment, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so,\u201d he said. \u201cI have certainly tried my best to make it so. But it might depend on how one feels about squirrels.\u201d</p><p>They had halted in front of his phaeton, and she was frowning up at the seat. \u201cSquirrels are rather pretty sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, you see. Definitely a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly man,\u201d she murmured, and gingerly placed a foot on the wooden steps set before the phaeton.</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d He grasped her elbow to steady her as she climbed into the carriage, conscious that he could wrap his fingers all the way about her arm\u2014the bones beneath her flesh were delicate and thin. He felt her stiffen as she settled, and it occurred to him that she might be nervous sitting so high. \u201cHold on to the side. There\u2019s nothing to be worried about, and Lady Eddings\u2019s house isn\u2019t far.\u201d</p><p>That earned him a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he called as he rounded the carriage and climbed in. He could feel her body, stiff and still beside him as he took the ribbons and started the horses. One of her hands lay limply in her lap, but the other grasped the carriage\u2019s side tightly. Whatever she might say, his fianc\u00e9e was indeed wary of the carriage. He felt a twinge of tenderness for her. She was such a prickly thing, she must hate to show weakness.</p><p>\u201cI think you are very fond of squirrels,\u201d he said to distract her.</p><p>A line knit itself between her brows. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wear it so often\u2014that squirrel color. I have deduced from your fondness for squirrel-colored gowns that you are fond of the animal itself. Perhaps you had a pet squirrel as a child, and it ran about the house, upsetting the maids and your nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a flight of fancy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe color is brown, as you well know, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fond of brown, but I am used to it.\u201d</p><p>He snuck a look at her. She was frowning at his hands handling the ribbons. \u201cThey wear it so they can\u2019t be seen.\u201d</p><p>She tore her gaze from his hands and looked at him rather bemusedly. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost me, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe squirrels again, I\u2019m afraid. I am sorry, but if you don\u2019t start another topic, I shall probably babble about them all the way to the musicale. Squirrels are squirrel-colored because squirrel color is harng color d to see in a forest. I wonder if that\u2019s why you wear it as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that I might hide in a forest?\u201d Her smile was definite this time.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Perhaps you want to flit from tree to tree in a shadowed forest, eluding both beast and poor, poor man. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p><p>And he turned and looked at her as she stared back at him, amused, but with her hand still tightly gripped on the carriage\u2019s side. \u201cNo, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He did want to know her, though, he realized, this vexing creature who refused to show fear.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy with the arrangements your brother and I came to?\u201d he asked. The first banns had been called yesterday, and they would be married in another three weeks. Many ladies would not like such a short engagement. \u201cI must tell you that we tussled long and hard. At one point, I thought our men of business would come to fisticuffs. Fortunately, your brother averted the crisis with the quick application of tea and muffins.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, dear, poor Harold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Harold indeed, but what about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are obviously a saint among men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad you realize it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the arrangements?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am content with them,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI should tell you that I\u2019ll be leaving town tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her tone was still even, but the hand in her lap had fisted.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be helped, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ve been the recipient of letters from my land steward for weeks now. He informs me that my presence is desperately needed to settle some type of dispute. I can ignore them no longer. I suspect,\u201d he confided, \u201cthat Abbott, my neighbor, has again let his tenants build on my land. He does it every decade or so\u2014tries to expand his border. The man\u2019s eighty if he\u2019s a day, and he\u2019s been doing it for half a century. Used to drive my pater mad.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause as he guided the horses into a smaller street.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know when you shall return?\u201d his fianc\u00e9e inquired.</p><p>\u201cA week, maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. Her lips were thinned. Did she want him to stay? The woman was as inscrutable as the Sphinx. \u201cBut I shall certainly return by our wedding date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He looked up and saw that they were already at Lady Eddings\u2019s town house. He drew the horses to a halt and threw the ribbons to a waiting boy before jumping from the carriage. Despite his swiftness, Miss Fleming was already standing when he rounded to her side, which rather irritated him.</p> <p>He held out his hand. \u201cLet me help you.\u201d</p><p>She stubbornly ignored his hand and, still gripping the carriage side, gingerly lowered a foot toward the steps set beside the carriage.</p><p>Jasper felt something snap. She could be as brave as she wanted, but she need not spurn his help. He reached up and wrapped his hands about her slender, warm waist. She gave a breathless squeak, and then he was letting her go in front of him. The scent of Neroli floated in the air.</p><p>\u201cThere was no need for that,\u201d she said, shaking out her skirts.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, there was,\u201d he muttered before tucking her hand safely into his elbow. He led her toward the imposing white doors of the Eddings town house. \u201cAh, a musicale. What a delightful way to spend an afternoon. I do hope there will be country ballads about damsels drowning themselves in wells, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Miss Fleming shot a disbelieving glance at him, but a formidable butler was already opening the door. Jasper grinned at his fianc\u00e9e and ushered her in. His blood was running high, and it wasn\u2019t at the prospect of an afternoon of screeching or even the company of Miss Fleming, interesting as she was. He hoped to see Matthew Horn here. Horn was a very old friend, a fellow veteran of His Majesty\u2019s army and, more to the point, one of the few men to survive Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>MELISANDE SAT ON a narrow chair and tried to concentrate on the young girl singing. If she sat very still and closed her eyes, she knew the awful panic would recede eventually. The trouble was, she hadn\u2019t anticipated how much comment the news of their precipitous engagement would excite in the ton. The moment they\u2019d stepped into Lady Eddings\u2019s town house, she and Jasper had been the center of all eyes\u2014and Melisande had wanted to simply disappear. She loathed being the center of attention. It made her hot and sweaty. Her mouth went dry and her hands trembled. And worst of all, she always seemed to lose the power of intelligent speech. She\u2019d just stared dumbly when that horrid Mrs. Pendleton had inferred that Lord Vale must be desperate to\u2019ve made Melisande an offer. Tonight, a half-dozen biting repartee would come to her as she lay sleepless in her bed, but right now she might as well be a sheep. She hadn\u2019t anything more intelligent to say than baaaaa.</p><p>Next to her, Lord Vale leaned close and whispered hoarsely and none too quietly, \u201cDo you think she\u2019s a shepherdess?\u201d</p> <p>Baaa? Melisande blinked up at him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cHer.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head at the cleared space next to the harpsichord where Lady Eddings\u2019s youngest daughter stood. The girl actually sang rather well, but the poor thing wore enormous panniers and a floppy bonnet, and she carried a pail of all things.</p><p>\u201cSurely she\u2019s not a chambermaid?\u201d Lord Vale wondered. He\u2019d taken their notoriety in stride, laughing loudly when he\u2019d been cornered by several gentlemen before the musicale. Now he jiggled his left leg like a small boy forced to sit at church. \u201cI\u2019d think she\u2019d be carrying a coal shuttle if she were a chambermaid. Though that might be rather heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a milkmaid,\u201d Melisande murmured.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His shaggy eyebrows drew together. \u201cSurely not with those panniers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d someone hissed from behind them.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Lord Vale whispered only a little lower, \u201cwouldn\u2019t the cows trod on her skirts? Don\u2019t seem practical at all. Not that I know all that much about cows and milkmaids and such, but I do like cheese.\u201d</p><p>Melisande bit her lip, fighting down an unusual urge to giggle. How strange! She wasn\u2019t the giggling sort at all. She glanced at Lord Vale out of the corner of her eye only to see him watching her.</p><p>His wide mouth curved, and he leaned closer, his breath brushing her cheek. \u201cI adore cheese and grapes, the dark, round, red kind of grape that burst in one\u2019s mouth all sweet and juicy. Do you like grapes?\u201d</p><p>Although the words were perfectly innocent, he said them with such a deep drawl, that she was hard pressed not to blush. And she suddenly realized that she\u2019d seen him do this before: lean close to a lady and whisper wicked things in her ear. She\u2019d watched him do it innumerable times over the years to innumerable ladies at innumerable parties. But this time was different.</p><p>This time he was flirting with her.</p><p>So she straightened her back and cast her eyes down demurely and said, \u201cI do like grapes, but I think I prefer raspberries. The sweetness is not so cloying. And sometimes there\u2019s a tart one with a bit of a . . . bite.\u201d</p><p>When she raised her eyes and looked at him, he was staring back thoughtfully, as if he didn\u2019t know quite what to make of her. She held his gaze, whether in challenge or warning, she wasn\u2019t quite sure, until her breath began to grow short, and his cheeks darkened. He\u2019d lost his habitual careless smile\u2014he wasn\u2019t smiling at all, in fact\u2014and something serious, something dark, was staring out of his eyes at her.</p><p>Then the audience burst into applause, and Melisande started at the crash of sound. Lord Vale looked away, and the moment was lost.</p><p>\u201cShall I bring you a glass of punch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>And she watched him get up and saunter away, aware that the world had rushed back into her senses. Behind her, the young matron who had shushed them was gossiping with a friend. Melisande caught the word enceinte and tilted her head away so she could no longer overhear the murmurs. Lady Eddings\u2019s daughter was being congratulated on her performance. A spotty youth stood next to the girl loyally holding her pail. Melisande smoothed her skirts, glad that no one had bothered to come talk to her. If she were allowed to only sit and observe the people around her, she might enjoy events like this one.</p><p>She turned her head and located Lord Vale in the crowd around the refreshments table. He wasn\u2019t hard to find. He stood half a head taller than all the other gentlemen, and he was laughing in that open way he had, one arm thrown out, the glass of punch in his hand in danger of splashing in the wig of the gentleman next to him. Melisande smiled\u2014it was hard not to when he was so boisterous\u2014but then she saw his face change. It was a subtle thing, a mere narrowing of the eyes, his wide smile falling just sligh wang justtly. Probably no one else in the room would notice it. But she had. Melisande followed his gaze. A gentleman in a white wig had just entered the room. He stood talking to their hostess, a polite smile on his face. He looked almost familiar, but she couldn\u2019t place him. He was of average height, his countenance open and fresh, his bearing military.</p><p>She looked back at Lord Vale. He\u2019d started forward, the glass of punch still in his hand. The young man glanced up, saw Vale, and excused himself from Lady Eddings. He walked toward Vale, his hand extended in greeting, but his face was somber. Melisande watched as her fianc\u00e9 took the other man\u2019s hand and drew him close to murmur something; then he glanced around the room and, inevitably, met her eyes. He\u2019d lost his smile somewhere as he\u2019d crossed the room, and now his face was quite expressionless. Deliberately, he turned his back to her, drawing the other man with him. Just then, the young man in the white wig looked over his shoulder, and Melisande inhaled, finally remembering where she\u2019d seen him before.</p><p>He was the man she\u2019d seen weeping six years before.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>After the last crumb of meat pie was eaten, the old man stood, and a very strange thing happened. His tattered clothes fell away, and suddenly there stood before Jack a young, handsome man in shining white garments.</p><p>\u201cYou have been kind to me,\u201d the angel said\u2014for who else could he be but an angel of God? \u201cAnd so I shall reward you.\u201d</p><p>The angel drew forth a little tin box and pressed it into Jack\u2019s palm. \u201cLook inside for what you need, and it shall be there.\u201d</p><p>He turned and was gone.</p><p>Jack blinked for a moment before peering inside the box. And then he laughed, for there was nothing inside but a few leaves of snuff. Tucking the little tin snuffbox into his pack, he set off along the road again. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Three weeks later, Melisande hid her trembling hands in the full skirts of her wedding dress. Behind her, Sally Suchlike, her new lady\u2019s maid, was doing some last- minute fussing with the skirts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you just look a treat, miss,\u201d Suchlike said as she worked.</p><p>They stood in the enclosed church porch, just off the nave. The organ had already started inside, and soon Melisande would have to walk into the crowded church. She shivered with nerves. Even on such short notice, nearly all the pews were full.</p><p>\u201cI thought gray was a bit dull when you picked it out,\u201d Suchlike chattered, \u201cbut now it almost shines like silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too much, is it?\u201d Melisande looked down worriedly. The dress was more ornamented than she\u2019d originally wished, with pale yellow ribbons tied in small r, \u201ebows all along the low round neckline. Her overskirt was pulled back to reveal the heavily embroidered underskirt of gray, red, and yellow.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s very sophisticated,\u201d the lady\u2019s maid replied. She came around to face Melisande and frowned, inspecting her rather like a cook examining a haunch of beef. Then she smiled. \u201cLord Vale will be that taken with you, I\u2019m sure. After all, it\u2019s been ages since he last saw you.\u201d</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t quite true, Melisande reflected, but it had been several weeks since she\u2019d seen the viscount. Lord Vale had left the day after Lady Eddings\u2019s musicale and had not returned to London until yesterday. She\u2019d even begun to wonder if he was staying away to avoid her. He\u2019d been rather distracted at the musicale after talking to his friend, and he\u2019d never introduced her to the man. Indeed, his friend had disappeared after talking to Lord Vale. But none of that mattered, she chided herself. After all, Lord Vale stood right now at the front of the church waiting for her appearance.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d called Gertrude, who hurried in from the nave door and reached out to twitch at Melisande\u2019s skirts. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see this day, my dear, never! Married, and to a viscount. The Renshaws are a very nice family\u2014no hint of bad blood at all. Oh, Melisande!\u201d</p><p>To her amazement, Melisande saw that phlegmatic Gertrude had tears in her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d Gertrude gave her a stiff hug, pressing her cheek briefly to Melisande\u2019s. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>Melisande straightened her back and drew in a steadying breath before answering. Even her trembling nerves couldn\u2019t keep the quiet joy from her voice. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>JASPER LOOKED DOWN at the slice of roasted duck on his plate and thought how very odd the tradition of the wedding breakfast was. Here was a group of friends and family gathered to celebrate love when in reality it was fertility they should be feting. That was, after all, the desired point to a union such as this: the production of children.</p><p>Ah, well, he was finally married, and perhaps he should lay aside cynicism and look no further than that fact. Yesterday, whilst riding toward London, he\u2019d begun to wonder if he\u2019d left off returning for too long. What if Miss Fleming had grown weary of being ignored? What if she didn\u2019t even bother showing up at the church to give him his cong\u00e9? He\u2019d been detained in Oxfordshire far longer than he\u2019d planned. There always seemed to be something more to delay his return there\u2014another field his land steward wanted to show him, a road that badly needed repair, and, if he was honest with himself, the very steadiness of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s gaze. She seemed to see right through him with those tilted brown eyes, seemed to look beyond his surface laughter and saw what he hid in the depths of his soul. At Lady Eddings\u2019s musicale, when he\u2019d turned and saw Melisande Fleming watching him and Matthew Horn, he\u2019d had a moment of stark terror\u2014fear that she knew what they talked about.</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t know. Jasper took a swallow of ruby wine, reassured on that point. She didn\u2019t know what had happened at Spinner\u2019s Falls, and she would never know if, with God\u2019s grace, he could help it.</p><p>\u201cJolly good wedding, what?\u201d an elderly gentleman leaned forward to shout down the table.</p><p>Jasper hadn\u2019t a notion who the gentleman was\u2014must be a relative of his bride\u2019s\u2014but he grinned and raised his wineglass to the fellow. \u201cThank you, sir. I rather enjoyed it myself.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman winked hideously. \u201cEnjoy the wedding night more, what? I say, enjoy the wedding night more! Ha!\u201d</p><p>He was so taken with his own wit that he nearly lost his gray wig laughing.</p> <p>The elderly lady sitting across from the gentleman rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough, William.\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Jasper felt his bride still, and he cursed under his breath. Some of the color had finally returned to her cheeks. She\u2019d gone quite white at the ceremony, and he\u2019d prepared himself to catch her should she faint. But she hadn\u2019t. Instead, she\u2019d stood like a soldier before a firing squad and grimly recited her marriage vows. Not quite the expression a bridegroom hoped for on his bride on her wedding day, but he\u2019d learned not to be particular after the last fiasco.</p><p>Jasper raised his voice. \u201cWill you tell us the story of your own wedding, sir? I feel we shall be quite entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d the old lady said before her husband could recover enough to speak. \u201cHe was so drunk he fell asleep afore he even came to bed!\u201d</p><p>The guests within earshot roared.</p><p>\u201cAw, Bess!\u201d the elderly man shouted above the laughter. \u201cYou know I was plumb worn out from chasing you.\u201d He turned to the young lady beside him, eager to recount his memories. \u201cCourted her for nigh on four years and . . .\u201d</p> <p>Jasper gently replaced his wineglass and glanced at his bride. Miss Fleming\u2014Melisande\u2014was pushing her food into neat piles on her plate.</p><p>\u201cEat some of that,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe duck is not nearly as bad as it looks, and it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him, but her body stiffened. \u201cI am fine.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn girl. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are,\u201d he replied easily. \u201cBut you were as white as a sheet in the church\u2014for a while, you were even green. I can\u2019t tell you how it shattered my bridegroom\u2019s nerves. Indulge me now and have a bite.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved a little, and she ate a small piece of the duck. \u201cIs everything you say in jest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly everything. I know it\u2019s tedious, but there it is.\u201d He motioned to a footman, and the man bent near. \u201cPlease refill the viscountess\u2019s wineglass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured when the man had poured more wine. \u201cIt\u2019s not, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour jesting.\u201d She looked at him, her tilted eyes mysterious. \u201cIt isn\u2019t tedious. I like it, actually. I only hope you will be able to bear my own reticence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you look at me like that, I shall bear it most admirably,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She held his eyes as she sipped from her wineglass, and he\"&gt;</p><p>The thought was strange at this highly civilized breakfast. Strange, and at the same time pleasantly arousing. What a very odd thing marriage was between people of his rank. Like breeding horses in many ways. One picked out the dam and the sire based on their bloodlines, put them in proximity to each other, and hoped nature took its course and produced more horses\u2014or aristocrats, depending on the parties.</p><p>He smiled as he watched his new wife, wondering what she would say if he told her his thoughts about horses and aristocratic marriages. Alas, though, the topic was too risqu\u00e9 for virginal ears.</p><p>But others were not. \u201cIs the wine to your liking, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s acidic, tart, with just a tiny bit of sweetness from the grapes.\u201d She smiled slowly. \u201cSo, yes, it\u2019s to my liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow delightful,\u201d Jasper murmured, his eyelids drooping lazily. \u201cIt is, of course, my duty as your husband to see that your every desire, no matter how small, is fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is my duty as your wife?\u201d</p><p>To bear my heirs. The reply was too blunt to voice. This was a time for pretty flirtation and banter, not the cold realities of a marriage such as theirs. \u201cMy lady, you have no more onerous a duty than to be lovely and grace my home and heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I believe I may soon become bored by such light duties. I\u2019d require additional tasks to fulfill than merely looking lovely.\u201d She sipped her wine and set the glass down; as she did so, her tongue darted out to slowly lick a droplet from her bottom lip. \u201cPerhaps you can invent a more exacting duty?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled, for his entire attention had become focused on her wet bottom lip. \u201cMy lady, my mind is awhirl with possibilities. It dances hither and yon, brushing many but alighting on none, though several tantalize. Have you no examples to give me of what a wife\u2019s duties should be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, examples abound.\u201d A smile was playing about her lips. \u201cShould I not obey and honor you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but those are light duties, and you specified an exacting one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObeying you may not always be a light task,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWith me it shall be. I will merely bid you to do such things as smile at me and make my day brighter. Will you obey me in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen already I feel a surfeit of wifely honor. But I seem to remember another vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo love you,\u201d she said. Her eyes dropped in maidenly modesty. He could no longer see her expression.</p><p>\u201cYes, only that,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cTo love me is, I fear, a much greater taexach greask than any other wifely duty\u2014I am a very unlovable fellow at times\u2014and I\u2019ll not blame you should you choose to forsake it. You may merely admire me instead, if it is more to your liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am a woman of honor, and I have made a vow,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at her and tried to see which was the banter and which was her real feeling\u2014if she had one. \u201cThen you will love me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He raised his glass to her. \u201cCount me, then, the most fortunate man alive.\u201d</p><p>But she merely smiled now, as if wearying of their wordplay.</p><p>He sipped his wine. Was she looking forward to this night or dreading it? Surely the latter rather than the former. Even at her age\u2014older than many brides\u2014she likely knew very little of the physical act between a man and a woman. Perhaps that fact accounted for some of the paleness in her face earlier. He must remind himself to go slowly tonight and not to do anything that might frighten or disgust her. Despite her lively repartee, she was by her own admission a reserved woman. Perhaps he ought to consider putting off the consummation for another day or so, in order that she grow more used to him. A depressing thought.</p><p>He shook his head and shoved all depressing thoughts aside, then took another slice of roast duck. After all, it was his wedding day.</p><p>\u201cOH, IT WAS a beautiful wedding, my lady,\u201d Suchlike said dreamily that night as she helped Melisande from her gown. \u201cHis lordship looked so handsome in his red embroidered coat, didn\u2019t he? So tall and with those lovely wide shoulders. I don\u2019t think he needs to use padding at all, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Melisande murmured. Lord Vale\u2019s shoulders were one of her favorite things about him, but her new husband\u2019s physique didn\u2019t seem quite the thing to discuss with her maid. She stepped out of her underskirts.</p><p>Suchlike draped the underskirts over a chair and began unlacing Melisande\u2019s stays. \u201cAnd when Lord Vale threw those coins to the crowd! What a kind gentleman he is. Did you know, ma\u2019am, that he gave a guinea to every servant in this house, even the little bootblack boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Melisande bit back a fond smile at this evidence of Lord Vale\u2019s sentimental nature. She wasn\u2019t surprised at all. She rubbed a sore spot under her arm where the stays had chafed a bit. Then, clad in her chemise, she sat at a dainty burlwood vanity and began taking down her stockings.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cook says that Lord Vale is a very pleasant gentleman to work for. Pays a regular wage and doesn\u2019t shout at the maids as some gentlemen do.\u201d Suchlike shook out the stays and laid them carefully in the big carved wardrobe in the corner.</p><p>The viscountess\u2019s rooms in Renshaw House had been closed since Lord Vale\u2019s father had died and his mother had moved to the London dowager residence. But Mrs. Moore, the housekeeper, was obviously a very competent woman. The rooms had been thoroughly cleaned. The bedroom\u2019s honey-colored woodwork was freshly waxed and shining dully, the dark blue and gold drapes had been aired and brushed, and even the carpets looked to have been taken out and beaten.</p><p>The bedroom was not overly large but was quite lovely. The walls were a soothing creamy white, the carpets dark blue with spots of gold and ruby patterning. The fireplace was a pretty little thing, tiled in cobalt blue and surrounded by a white woodwork mantel. There were two gilt-legged chairs in front of it with a low marble-topped table between them. On one wall was a door that led to the viscount\u2019s rooms\u2014she looked quickly away from it\u2014on the opposite wall, a door that led to her dressing room, and beyond, a private little sitting room. Now and again, a faint scratching came from the dressing room, but she ignored it. Overall, the rooms were very comfortable and pleasant.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve met the other servants?\u201d Melisande asked to distract herself from staring at Lord Vale\u2019s connecting door like a lovesick ninny.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Suchlike came over and began taking down her hair. \u201cThe butler, Mr. Oaks, is very stern, but he seems fair. Mrs. Moore says she respects his judgment wholeheartedly. There are six downstairs maids and five upper, and I don\u2019t know how many footmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI counted seven,\u201d Melisande murmured. She\u2019d been introduced to the household this afternoon, but it would take time to learn individual names and duties. \u201cThey were all kind to you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Suchlike was silent a moment, taking out the myriad of pins that had held her hair up. \u201cAlthough . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melisande watched the little maid in the vanity\u2019s mirror. Suchlike\u2019s delicate brows were drawn together. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said, then immediately added, \u201cOnly that man, Mr. Pynch. There I was being quite polite as Mr. Oaks introduced everyone, and that man Mr. Pynch looked down his nose at me\u2014and a very big nose it is, too, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t think he should be so awfully proud of it. And he says, \u2018Rather young for a lady\u2019s maid, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 in this terribly stuffy voice. And what I want to know is, what business is it of his anyway?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Melisande blinked. She\u2019d never seen Suchlike take offense at anyone or anything before. \u201cWho is this Mr. Pynch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s his lordship\u2019s man,\u201d Suchlike said. She picked up the brush and ran it through Melisande\u2019s hair with vigorous strokes. \u201cA big oaf of a man, no hair at all on top. Cook said he served with Lord Vale in the Colonies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen he\u2019s been with Lord Vale for many years.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike braided her hair with quick, sure movements. \u201cWell, I think he\u2019s gotten full of himself. A less likable, stuck-up, nasty man I\u2019ve rarely met.\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled, but then the smile faded and she looked up at a sound, her breath quickening.</p><p>The door connecting her rooms to the viscount\u2019s opened. Lord Vale stood in the doorway dressed in a scarlet banyan over breeches and a shirt. \u201cAh. I\u2019ve arrived too early. Come back, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need, my lord.\u201d Melisande struggled to keep her voice from quavering. She was having trouble not staring at him. His shirt was unbuttoned at the throat, and that small bit of intimate skin was having a devastating effect on her. \u201cThat will be all, Suchlike.\u201d</p> <p>The maid bobbed a curtsy, suddenly tongue-tied in the presence of her new master. She trotted to the door and left.</p><p>Lord Vale looked after Suchlike. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t frightened your little maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just nervous in a new house.\u201d Melisande watched him in the mirror as he roamed her room, an exotic male beast. She was his wife. She was hard-pressed not to laugh aloud at the thought.</p><p>He strolled to the little fireplace and peered at a china clock on the mantel. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to disturb your evening toilet. I\u2019m terrible about time. I can return in another half hour or so, if you\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m perfectly ready.\u201d She took a breath, stood, and turned.</p><p>He looked at her, his gaze trailing down over her lace-trimmed chemise. It was voluminous but nearly sheer, and she felt her belly tighten at the touch of his eyes.</p> <p>Then he blinked and looked away. \u201cPerhaps you would like some wine?\u201d</p><p>A small twinge of disappointment went through her, but she didn\u2019t let it show. She inclined her head. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He moved to a side table by the fireplace where a decanter stood and poured two glasses.</p><p>She came to the fireplace and was standing near him when he turned back around.</p><p>He held out a glass. \u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She took the glass and sipped. Was he nervous? He was staring into the fire, so she sank into one of the gilt chairs and waved at the other. \u201cPlease. Won\u2019t you sit, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Quite.\u201d He sat and drained half his glass, then leaned forward suddenly, the glass dangling from his fingers between his legs. \u201cLook here, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to say this properly all day, and I\u2019ve yet to find a way, so I\u2019ll just say it. We married rather rapidly, and I was away for most of our engagement, which was my own damned fault, and I\u2019m sorry. But because of all that, we haven\u2019t had a chance to become properly acquainted and I was thinking, ah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d rather wait.\u201d He finally raised his eyes to hers and watched her with something very much like pity. \u201cIt\u2019s your decision\u2014I leave it completely up to you.\u201d</p><p>It came to her, in a blinding, terrible flash of light, that perhaps he didn\u2019t find her attractive enough to bed. Why should he, after all? She was tall and rather thin, her figure not particularly shapely. And her face had never been called pretty. He\u2019d flirted with her, but then he flirted with every woman he met, high or low. It didn\u2019t mean anything. She looked at him mutely. What was she to do? What could she do? They\u2019d married just this morning; it wasn\u2019t something that could be undone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want it undone.</p><p>He\u2019d continued speaking during her awful realization. \u201c. . . and we could wait a bit, a month or two, or however long you wished because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>If they waited, there was a chance the marriage would never be consummated. That was the last thing she wanted\u2014the last thing he\u2019d said he wanted. She couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>She set her glass on the table in front of the fire. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . see.\u201d</p><p>She stood and went to stand in front of him. He looked up at her, his eyes brilliantly blue.</p><p>He drained his wineglass, set it down, and stood as well, making her look up. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>She merely raised her brows. She would not beg.</p><p>He nodded, his lips firming, and took her hand, leading her to the bed. She was trembling already, just at the touch of his hand, and now she didn\u2019t bother trying to hide her reaction. He folded back the covers and indicated she should climb in. She lay down, still in her chemise, and watched as he took a small tin out of his banyan pocket and placed it on the bedside table. Then he took off his banyan and shoes.</p><p>The bed dipped beneath his weight when he climbed in beside her. He was warm and large, and she reached out to touch the sleeve of his shirt. Just that, because she thought her heart might beat itself to death if she touched any other part of him. He leaned over her and brushed his lips against hers; she closed her eyes in ecstasy. Oh, dear Lord, finally. She was now drinking sweet sherry after spending her entire life living in a dry, lonely desert. His mouth was soft but firm, the tart taste of wine on his lips. He laid his hand on her breast, large and warm through the thin cloth of the chemise, and she shuddered.</p><p>She opened her mouth in invitation, but he pulled his head back. He looked down, fumbling between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cVale,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He brushed a kiss over her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019ll soon be over.\u201d He reached for the tin on the table beside her bed and opened it. Inside was some type of unguent. He dipped a finger in, and his hand disappeared between them again.</p><p>She frowned. It being over soon wasn\u2019t exactly what she\u2019d hoped for. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d hiked up her chemise, baring her to the waist, and she was distracted by the feel of his hands on her hips. Perhaps if she stopped thinking so much and simply felt . . .</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He widened her legs and settled between them, and she realized that he\u2019d opened the placket of his breeches. She could feel him, hot and hard, pressing against her thigh. All sound left her throat as she felt a spurt of excitement.</p><p>\u201cThis may seem rather odd, and it may hurt, but I won\u2019t be long,\u201d he muttered rapidly. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll only hurt the first time. You can close your eyes if you wish.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>And he entered her.</p><p>Instead of closing her eyes, she widened them, staring up at him, wanting to experience every small part of this. His eyes were closed, his brow furrowed as if he were in pain. She wrapped her arms around him, feeling the width of his shoulders and how tensely he held them.</p><p>\u201cAhhh. That\u2019s . . .\u201d He jerked against her. \u201cJust hold still a moment.\u201d</p><p>He raised himself up on straight arms, and to her disappointment, knocked aside her arms. And then he thrust. Once, twice, a third time, heavy and hard. He grit his teeth and made a sort of choked coughing sound and slumped over her.</p><p>Soon indeed.</p><p>She shifted to wrap her arms about him again so that she might at least lie with him afterward, but he rolled to the side and off her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Didn\u2019t mean to crush you.\u201d</p><p>He turned his back and presumably put himself to rights. Melisande pulled her chemise slowly down over her thighs, fighting a feeling of chagrin. The bed bounced as he rolled off it. He yawned and bent to pick up his banyan and shoes, then leaned over her to buss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cNot too bad, I hope?\u201d His blue eyes were worried-looking. \u201cGet some sleep and I\u2019ll make sure the footmen bring up a hot bath in the morning. That\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure to drink some more wine if you have any pain.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair and nearly dislodged his tie. \u201cGood night, then.\u201d</p><p>And he left the room.</p><p>Melisande stared for a moment at the closed door, completely dumbfounded. The scratching came from her dressing room door again. She closed her eyes and tried to ignore the sound. She slid her hand up under her chemise. She was wet down there, slippery with his semen and her own fluids. She ran her fingers between her folds, concentrating, thinking how he\u2019d felt inside of her, how very blue his eyes were. She brushed that bit of flesh at the top of her cleft. It was swollen, throbbing with frustrated need. She stroked, trying to relax, trying to remember . . .</p><p>The scratching came again.</p><p>She huffed and opened her eyes, staring at the silk canopy of her bed. It was blue and had a slight hole in the corner. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>The scratching was accompanied by a whine this time.</p><p>\u201cOh, have a little patience!\u201d</p><p>She climbed from the big bed, annoyed, and felt semen slide down her inner thigh. A pitcher of water was on the dresser, and she poured a little out into the washbowl. Dipping a cloth into the cool water, she washed herself. Then she walked to the dressing room door and opened it.</p><p>Mouse sneezed indignantly and came bustling out. He jumped to the bed and turned around three times before settling on a pillow, his back pointedly toward her. He hated being locked away in the dressing room.</p><p>Melisande climbed back in the bed, feeling just as grumpy as theShegrumpy terrier. She lay for a moment staring at the silk canopy, wondering where, exactly, she\u2019d gone wrong in that hasty exercise. She sighed and decided she could figure it all out in the morning. She snuffed the bedside candle and closed her eyes. As she drifted to sleep, she had one last coherent thought.</p><p>Thank goodness she hadn\u2019t been a virgin.</p><p>TONIGHT\u2019S WORK HADN\u2019T been his most sterling moment as a lover, Jasper reflected just a few minutes later. He sat in his own rooms, in a large chair before his fire. He hadn\u2019t shown Melisande true pleasure. The whole thing had been much too quick and hurried for that, he knew. He\u2019d been fearful that if he\u2019d drawn it out too much, he might forget himself and use her harder than he meant. So the experience hadn\u2019t been exciting for her. But on the other hand, he fancied he hadn\u2019t hurt her overmuch either. And that, after all, had been his main intention: not to frighten his virgin bride on her first night in his bed.</p><p>Or rather hers. He glanced at his own bed, huge, dark, and rather overwhelming. Just as well that he\u2019d gone to her rooms instead of trying to bring her into his. His bed would frighten the most intrepid woman on her initiation into the pleasures of the flesh. Not to mention that afterward, he would\u2019ve had to find a way to eject her from his rooms. He downed the last swallow of brandy in his glass. That would\u2019ve been an awkward moment.</p><p>All in all, the act had gone as well as could be expected. Time enough later to show her how pleasurable the joining of a man\u2019s and a woman\u2019s bodies could be. Assuming, of course, that she wanted to linger in the connubial bed in the first place. Plenty of aristocratic ladies weren\u2019t very interested in making love with their husbands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned at the thought. He\u2019d never before seen anything particularly wrong with fashionable marriages of that sort. The ones in which the interested parties produced an heir or two and then went their separate ways socially and sexually. It was the type of marriage that was almost usual in his tier of society. The type of marriage he himself had been expecting. Now, however, the thought of a marriage in which the man and wife were civil and nothing more seemed . . . cold. And rather unpleasant, actually.</p><p>Jasper shook his head. Perhaps matrimony was having a morbid effect on his brain. That might explain these odd thoughts. He stood and set the glass by the decanter on a side table. His rooms were more than twice as large as his new wife\u2019s. But that fact only made the space hard to adequately light at night. Shadows loomed in the corners near the wardrobe and around the big bed.</p><p>He disrobed and washed himself in the chilly water already in his rooms. He could\u2019ve sent down for fresh, warm water, but he didn\u2019t like anyone entering his rooms after dark. Even Pynch\u2019s presence made him restless. He blew out all but one candle. Picking that up, he took it into his dressing room. Here there was a small bed such as a valet might use. Pynch, however, had other rooms, and this bed was never used. Beside the bed, in the corner against the far wall, was a rather wretched pallet.</p><p>Jasper set the candle on the floor near the pallet and checked, as he did every night, that everything was here. There was a bundled pack with a change of clothes, water in a tin canteen, and some bread. Pynch refreshed the loaf and water every couple of days or so, even though Jasper had never discussed his pack with his valet. Beside the pae\u2019sBeside ck was a small knife and a steel and flint. He knelt and wrapped the one blanket about his naked shoulders before lying down on the thin pallet, his back to the wall. He stared for a moment at the flickering shadows the candle cast against the ceiling, and then he closed his eyes.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>By and by, Jack came upon another old man in tattered rags sitting by the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cHave you aught to give me to eat?\u201d the second beggar called in a disagreeable voice.</p><p>Jack set down his pack and took out some cheese. The old man snatched it from his hand and gobbled it down. Jack brought out a loaf of bread. The old man ate the entire loaf and then held out his hands for more. Jack shook his head and dug to the very bottom of his pack to find an apple.</p><p>The old man devoured the apple and said, \u201cIs this rubbish all that you can offer?\u201d</p> <p>And finally Jack\u2019s patience broke. \u201cFor pity\u2019s sake, man! You\u2019ve eaten the last of my food and not a word of thanks in return. I\u2019ll be on my way and damn you for my trouble!\u201d</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Renshaw House was the grandest place Sally Suchlike had ever seen, and she was still a bit in awe. Cor! Pink and black marble floors, carved wood furniture so delicate the legs looked hardly more than toothpicks, and fancy embroidered silks and brocades and velvets everywhere, yards and yards of them, much more than was needed to cover a window or chair, all just draped for the finery of it. Oh, Mr. Fleming\u2019s house had been lovely, but this, this was like living in His Majesty\u2019s own palace; it was so beautiful. Indeed it was!</p><p>And wasn\u2019t it an amazing step up from the Seven Dials area where she\u2019d been born and had lived? If you could call living working every day from sunup until sundown, picking up horseshit and dog shit and any other shit to be found and sold again for just a scrap of bread and a tiny piece of gristly meat if she and her pa were lucky. She\u2019d stayed until the age of twelve, which was when her pa had talked about marrying her off to his friend Pinky, a large, stinking man with all his front teeth missing. She\u2019d seen a life full of shit and sorrow if she married Pinky, stretching away until she died too young in the same neighborhood she\u2019d been born in.</p><p>Sally had run away that very night to seek her fortune as a kitchen wench. She\u2019d been clever and quick, and when the cook had found a better house\u2014Mr. Fleming\u2019s\u2014she\u2019d taken Sally along with her. And Sally had worked\u2014hard. She\u2019d made sure not to find herself alone with any footman or butcher\u2019s boy. For the last thing she needed was to get herself with child. All along, she\u2019d kept herself neat and her ears open. She\u2019d listened to how the Flemings spoke, and at night in her narrow bed next to Alice, the downstairs maid, who snored like an old man, she\u2019d whisper the words and the inflections over and over until her speech was nearly as good as Miss Fleming\u2019s.</p><p>When the time came\u2014when Bob the footman had run into the kitchens, breathless with the news that Miss Fleming, who had such a plain, sad face, had somehow caught herself a viscount\u2014Sally had been ready. She\u2019d folded the mending she\u2019d been doing and quietly crept from the kitchens to make her plea to Miss Fleming.</p> <p>And here she was! The lady\u2019s maid of a viscountess! Now, if only she could learn all the passages and floors and doors in this great, grand house, everything would be perfect. Sally straightened her apron as she pushed open a door in the servant\u2019s passage. If she\u2019d calculated correctly, she would enter into the hallway outside the master bedrooms. She peeked. The hall was large, with dark wood-paneled walls and a long red and black carpet. Unfortunately, it looked quite a bit like all the other halls in the house until she turned her head to the right and saw the scandalous little black marble statue of some ancient gentleman attacking a naked lady. She\u2019d noticed the figures before\u2014well, they were hard to miss\u2014and she knew they stood outside the door of the viscount\u2019s room. Sally nodded and shut the concealed panel door behind her before pausing to examine the little statue.</p><p>Both figures were naked, and the lady didn\u2019t look all that worried. In fact, she had a dimpled arm thrown around the gentleman\u2019s neck. Sally cocked her head. The gentleman seemed to have furry goatlike flanks, and on his head were stumpy little horns. Actually, now that she peered closer, it occurred to her that the nasty stone man looked quite a bit like the viscount\u2019s man, Mr. Pynch\u2014if Mr. Pynch had hair and horns and furry flanks. Which made her gaze drop lower on the statue gentleman and wonder if Mr. Pynch also had a long\u2014</p><p>A man cleared his throat behind her.</p><p>Sally shrieked and spun around. Mr. Pynch stood directly behind her, as if summoned by her thoughts. He had one eyebrow raised, and his bald head shone dully in the dim hallway.</p><p>She could feel a hot flush rise up her neck. She planted both fists on her hips. \u201cCor! Was you trying to give me a start? Don\u2019t you know you can kill a person that way? I knew a lady once, got killed by a lad sneaking up behind her and yelling, \u2018Boo!\u2019 I might be lying stiff and dead on the carpet this very minute. And what would you say to my lord had you gone and killed me the day after his wedding, I\u2019m wondering? Fine fix you\u2019d be in then.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch cleared his throat again, a sound like rocks being rolled around in a tin pail. \u201cPerhaps if you had not been so engrossed in your examination of that statue, Miss Suchlike\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sally blew out a snort, which was quite unladylike but fitting at the moment. \u201cAre you accusing me of staring at this statue, Mr. Pynch?\u201d</p><p>Both of the valet\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cI simply\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I was merely checking for dust on that statue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDust.\u201d Sally jerked her head in a single sharp nod. \u201cMy lady can\u2019t abide dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Mr. Pynch said in lofty tones. \u201cI shall keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should certainly hope you do,\u201d Sally replied. She tugged at her apron to straighten isay straigt and then looked at her mistress\u2019s door. It was already eight of the clock, late for the new Lady Vale to rise, but on the day after her wedding . . .</p><p>Mr. Pynch was still watching her. \u201cI suggest you knock.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him. \u201cI know well enough how to wake my mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s not alone.\u201d She felt her hot blush rise again. \u201cYou know. What if he\u2019s in there? Right fool I\u2019d look if I go trotting in there and they\u2019re not . . . not . . . not\u201d\u2014Sally inhaled deeply, trying to get a grip on her runaway tongue\u2014\u201cright. I\u2019d be most embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn there,\u201d Mr. Pynch said with utter certainty, and entered the room of their master.</p><p>Sally scowled after him. What a nasty man. She gave a last tug to her apron and rapped smartly on her mistress\u2019s door.</p><p>MELISANDE WAS SITTING at her desk, translating the last of the fairy tales when she heard a rap on her door. Mouse, who\u2019d been lying at her feet, jumped up to growl at the door.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she called, and was unsurprised when Suchlike peeked in.</p><p>Melisande glanced at the china clock on her mantel. It was just after eight o\u2019clock, but she\u2019d been awake for over two hours. She rarely slept past sunrise. Suchlike knew her routine and usually came to dress her much earlier than this. The maid probably had been circumspect because of Melisande\u2019s newly wedded status. She felt a flash of mortification. Soon the entire household would know that she\u2019d slept apart from her husband on their wedding night. Well, it couldn\u2019t be helped. She\u2019d just have to get through it.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d Suchlike eyed Mouse and edged around the terrier.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. Come here, Mouse.\u201d Melisande snapped her fingers.</p><p>Mouse gave a last suspicious sniff at the maid and ran to sit under the desk next to Melisande\u2019s legs.</p><p>She\u2019d already pulled back the drapes from the window over the desk, but Suchlike went now to open the other drapes as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day. Sunshine, not a cloud in the sky, and hardly any wind. What would you like to wear today, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the gray,\u201d Melisande murmured absently.</p><p>She frowned over a German word in the story she was working on. The old book of fairy tales had belonged to her dearest friend Emeline, a memento from her childhood. It had apparently come from Emeline\u2019s Prussian nanny. Before she had left to sail to America with her new husband, Mr. Hartley, Emeline had given the book to Melisande so that she could translate its stories. When she\u2019d accepted the task, she\u2019d understood that it meant much more to both of them than a simple translation. Giving the cherished book to her was Emeline\u2019s way of promising that their friendship would endure this separation, and Melisande had been touched and grateful for the gesture.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped to translate the book and then have the stories copied out and hand-bound to give to Emeline when next she visited England. Unfortunately, Melisande had run into a problem. The book consisted of four related fairy tales, each the story of a soldier returning from war. Three of these stories she\u2019d translated handily enough, but the fourth . . . The fourth was proving to be a challenge.</p><p>\u201cThe gray, my lady?\u201d Suchlike repeated doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, the gray,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>The problem was the dialect. And the fact that she was trying to translate the written word. She\u2019d learned German from her mother but had mostly spoken the language, not read it, and the difference was proving to be key. Melisande stroked her finger across the brittle page. Working on the book reminded her of Emeline. She wished her friend could have been there for her wedding. And she wished even more that she was here right now. How comforting it would be to talk to Emeline about her marriage and the puzzle that was gentlemen in general. Why had her husband\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhich gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Melisande finally glanced at her maid and saw that Suchlike wore an exasperated frown.</p><p>\u201cWhich gray?\u201d Suchlike opened wide the doors to the wardrobe, which, admittedly, was filled with a rather dull-colored collection of gowns.</p><p>\u201cThe bluish gray.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suchlike took down the indicated gown, muttering under her breath. Melisande chose not to comment on the sound, instead rising and pouring out a basin of tepid water to wash her face and neck. Thus refreshed, she stood patiently while Suchlike dressed her.</p><p>Half an hour later, Melisande dismissed the maid and made her way to the lower hall, paneled in palest pink marble with gold and black accents. Here she hesitated. Surely breakfast was served in one of the lower rooms. But there were so many doors to choose from, and yesterday, in all the excitement of meeting the staff and moving in, she\u2019d not thought to ask.</p><p>Nearby, someone cleared his throat. Melisande turned to find the butler, Oaks, behind her. He was a short man with round shoulders and hands that were too big for his wrists. On his head he wore an extravagantly curled and powdered white wig.</p><p>\u201cMight I help you, my lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cCould you have one of the footmen take my dog, Mouse, out into the garden? And please show me to the room where breakfast is served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Oaks snapped his fingers, and a lanky young footman sprang forward like an acolyte to a priest. The butler gestured to Mouse with a flick of his hand. The footman bent toward the dog and then froze as Mouse lifted a lip and snarled.</p><p>\u201cOh, Sir Mouse.\u201d Melisande bent, picked up the little dog, and deposited him, still growling, in the footman\u2019s arms.</p><p>The footman arched his head as far away from his own arms as possible.</p><p>Melisande tapped the dog on the nosp hog on te with one finger. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p> <p>Mouse ceased growling, but he still eyed his bearer with suspicion. The footman headed to the back of the house with Mouse held straight-armed before him.</p><p>\u201cThe breakfast room is through here,\u201d Oaks said.</p><p>He led the way through an elegant sitting room to a room that overlooked the town-house gardens. Melisande looked out the window and could see Mouse sprinkling every ornamental tree along the main path as the footman followed.</p><p>\u201cThis is the room the viscount uses to breakfast when he has guests,\u201d Oaks said. \u201cNaturally, should you wish to make other arrangements, you need only inform me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is quite nice. Thank you, Oaks.\u201d She smiled and sat in the chair he held for her at the long, polished wood table.</p><p>\u201cCook\u2019s coddled eggs are excellent,\u201d Oaks said. \u201cBut if you wish for herring or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe eggs will be fine. I\u2019d also like a sweet bun or two and some hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cThen I shall have a maid bring them up directly.\u201d</p><p>Melisande cleared her throat. \u201cNot yet, please. I\u2019d like to wait for my husband.\u201d</p><p>Oaks blinked. \u201cThe viscount is a late riser\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I shall wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d And Oaks eased out of the room.</p><p>Melisande watched Mouse finish his business, then come trotting to the house. In another few minutes, he appeared at the breakfast room door with the footman. Mouse\u2019s button ears pricked forward when he saw her, and he ran over to lick her hand and then settle beneath her chair with a groan.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Melisande smiled at the footman. He looked quite young, his face still spotty beneath his white wig. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSprat, my lady.\u201d His cheeks reddened at her notice.</p><p>Good Lord, hopefully his parents hadn\u2019t christened him Jack. Melisande nodded. \u201cSprat, you shall be in charge of Sir Mouse. He needs to visit the garden in the morning, again just after lunch, and before retiring for bed. Can you remember to see to him for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Sprat\u2019s head jerked down in a nervous bow. \u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Melisande repressed a smile. Sprat didn\u2019t look entirely sure if he should be grateful. From beneath her chair, Mouse gurgled a soft growl. \u201cThank you. That will be all.\u201d</p><p>Sprat backed out and Melisande was alone again. She sat for a minute until her nerves couldn\u2019t stand her inaction anymore; then she stood and paced to the windows. How to face her new husband? With wifely serenity, of course. But was there any way she could gently\u2014discreetly\u2014make it known that last night had been, well, a disappointment? Melisande winced. Probably not over the breakfast table. Gentlemen were notoriously sensitive in this area, and many were not at their most reasonable in the early m&gt;much better than last night.</p><p>Somewhere a clock chimed the nine o\u2019clock hour. Mouse stood and stretched, yawning until his pink tongue curled. With a twinge of disappointment, Melisande gave up waiting and went to the hall. Sprat was standing there, staring rather vacantly at the ceiling, although he brought his gaze hastily down when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cPlease bring me my breakfast,\u201d Melisande said, and went back to the breakfast room to wait. Had Vale already left the house, or did he always sleep this late?</p><p>After a solitary meal shared with Mouse, Melisande turned her mind to other matters. She sent for the cook and found an elegant yellow and white sitting room to plan the week\u2019s meals.</p><p>The cook was a small, wiry woman, her face thin and lined with concern, her graying black hair scraped back into a tight knot at the crown of her head. She perched on the edge of her seat, leaning forward and nodding rapidly as Melisande spoke to her. Cook didn\u2019t smile\u2014her face didn\u2019t seem to know how\u2014but the tight purse of her mouth relaxed as Melisande praised the tasty coddled eggs and hot chocolate. In fact, Melisande was just feeling that she\u2019d established a nice understanding with the woman when a loud commotion interrupted their discussion. Both women looked up. Melisande realized that she could hear barking at the center of raised male voices.</p><p>Oh, dear. She smiled politely at the cook. \u201cIf you will excuse me?\u201d</p><p>She rose and walked unhurriedly to the breakfast room where she found the makings of a pantomime drama. Sprat stood gaping, Oaks\u2019s beautiful white wig was askew, and he was talking rapidly, but unfortunately in a voice that couldn\u2019t be heard. Meanwhile, her husband of only one day was waving his arms and shouting as if impersonating a particularly angry windmill. The object of his ire stood resolute only inches from Lord Vale\u2019s toes, barking and growling.</p><p>\u201cWhere did this mongrel come from?\u201d Vale was demanding. \u201cWho let it in? Can\u2019t a man have breakfast without having to defend his bacon from vermin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouse,\u201d Melisande said quietly, but it was loud enough for the terrier. With one last triumphant arf! Mouse came trotting over to sit on her slippers and pant.</p><p>\u201cDo you know this mongrel?\u201d Lord Vale asked, wild-eyed. \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d</p><p>Oaks was straightening his wig, muttering under his breath, while Sprat stood on one leg.</p><p>Melisande\u2019s eyes narrowed. Really! After making her wait an hour. \u201cMouse is my dog.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale blinked, and she couldn\u2019t help noticing that even confused and out of sorts, his blue eyes were startling in their beauty. He lay on me last night, she thought, feeling the heat pool low in her belly. His body became one with mine. He is my husband at last.</p><p>\u201cBut it ate my bacon.\u201d</p><p>Melisande looked down at Mouse, who panted up at her adoringly, his mouth curvedrea mouth as if in a grin. \u201cHe.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale ran a hand through his hair, dislodging his tie. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe,\u201d Melisande enunciated clearly, then smiled. \u201cSir Mouse is a gentleman dog. And he\u2019s particularly found of bacon, so really you ought not to tempt him with it.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her fingers and sailed from the breakfast room, Mouse on her heels.</p><p>\u201cGENTLEMAN DOG?\u201d Jasper stared at the door where his new wife had just swanned from the room. She\u2019d looked remarkably elegant for a woman being followed by a foul little beast. \u201cGentleman dog? Have you ever heard of a gentleman dog?\u201d he appealed to the males remaining in the room.</p><p>His footman\u2014a tall, lanky fellow with a name like a nursery rhyme that Jasper couldn\u2019t remember at the moment\u2014scratched under his wig. \u201cMy lady seemed right fond of that dog.\u201d</p><p>Oaks had put himself together by now, and he cast a rather fishy eye on his master. \u201cThe viscountess had specific instructions for the animal when she broke her fast an hour ago, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Which was when it finally dawned on Jasper that he might\u2019ve been an ass. He winced. To be fair, he\u2019d never been particularly quick in the morning. But even for him, shouting at his new wife on the day after their marriage was a bit beyond the pale.</p><p>\u201cI shall instruct Cook to make another breakfast for you, my lord,\u201d Oaks said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jasper sighed. \u201cI\u2019m no longer hungry.\u201d He stared meditatively at the door a minute more before deciding that he hadn\u2019t the eloquence at the moment to apologize to his wife. Some might call him a coward, but discretion was the better part of valor when it came to women. \u201cHave my horse brought \u2019round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Oaks bowed and whispered from the room. Amazing how lightly the man moved on his feet.</p><p>The young footman still stood in the breakfast room. He looked as if he wanted to say something.</p><p>Jasper sighed. He hadn\u2019t even had his tea before the dog had spoiled his meal. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell her ladyship that you\u2019re off?\u201d the fellow asked, and Jasper felt like a cad. Even the footman knew better than he how to behave with a wife.</p><p>\u201cYes, do.\u201d And then he avoided his footman\u2019s eyes and strode from the room.</p><p>A little more than half an hour later, Jasper was riding through the crowded streets of London, headed to a town house in Lincoln Inns Fields. The sun was out again, and the populace seemed determined to enjoy the fair weather, even at this early hour. Street venders were stationed at strategic corners, bawling their wares, fashionable ladies strolled arm in arm, and carriages lumbered by like ships in full sail.</p><p>Six months ago, when he and Sam Hartley had questioned survivors of the Spinner\u2019s Falls massacre, they hadn\u2019t been able to contact every soldier. Many had gone missing. Many were old men, crippled and reduced to begging and thieving. They lived their lives on the edge\u2014the possibility that they might fall off and disappear at any moment wh=\" any moas a real one. Or perhaps the danger was simply fading into oblivion, not so much dying as ceasing to live. In any case, many had been impossible to locate.</p><p>Then there were the survivors like Sir Alistair Munroe. Munroe hadn\u2019t actually been a soldier in the 28th but a naturalist attached to the regiment and charged with discovering and recording the animal and plant life for His Majesty. Of course, when the regiment had been attacked at Spinner\u2019s Falls, the hostile Indians hadn\u2019t made a distinction between soldier and civilian. Munroe had been in the group captured with Jasper and suffered the same fate as those who\u2019d been eventually ransomed. Jasper shuddered at the thought as he halted his mare, letting a team of shouting sedan-chair bearers past. Not everyone who had been captured and force-marched through the dark and mosquito-infested woods of America had come back alive. And those who had survived were not the same men as they\u2019d been before. Sometimes Jasper thought he\u2019d left a piece of his soul in those dark woods. . . .</p><p>He shook the thought away and guided Belle into the wide, fashionable square of Lincoln Inns Field. The house he rode to was a tall elegant redbrick with white trim around the windows and door. He dismounted and handed the reins to a waiting boy before mounting the steps and knocking. A few minutes later, the butler showed him into a study.</p><p>\u201cVale!\u201d Matthew Horn rose from behind a large desk and held out his hand. \u201c \u2019Tis the day after your wedding. I hadn\u2019t thought to see you so soon.\u201d</p><p>Jasper took the other man\u2019s hand. Horn wore a white wig and had the pale skin of a redheaded man. His cheeks often had reddened patches from the wind or his razor, and no doubt he\u2019d be ruddy by the time he was fifty. His jaw and cheekbones were heavy and angular as if to balance his pretty complexion. In contrast, his eyes were light blue and warm, with laugh lines crinkling the corners, though he hadn\u2019t yet seen his thirtieth birthday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am a blackguard to leave my lady wife so soon.\u201d Jasper dropped Horn\u2019s hand and stepped back. \u201cBut the matter is pressing, I fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Jasper flicked the skirts of his coat aside and lowered himself into the chair opposite Horn\u2019s desk. \u201cHow is your mother?\u201d</p><p>Horn cast his eyes to the ceiling as if he could see into his mother\u2019s bedroom in the floor above. \u201cShe is bedridden, I fear, but her spirits are bright. I take tea with her every afternoon if I can, and she always wants to know the latest gossip.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned Spinner\u2019s Falls at the Eddings musicale,\u201d Horn said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you remember Sam Hartley? Corporal Hartley? He was a Colonial attached to our regiment to guide us to Fort Edward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to London last September.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was touring Italy.\u201d Horn leaned back in his chair to pull a bell cord. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to\u2019ve missed him.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded. \u201cHe came to see me. He showed me a letter that had come into his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt detailed the march of the 28th Regiment of Foot from Quebec to Fort Edward, including the route we would take and the exact time we\u2019d be at Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Horn\u2019s eyes had narrowed, and suddenly Jasper could see that this man was no longer a boy. Had not been a boy for some time.</p><p>Jasper leaned forward. \u201cWe were betrayed, our position given to the French and their Indian allies. The regiment walked into a trap and was slaughtered at Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p> <p>The door to Horn\u2019s study opened, and the butler entered, a tall, thin fellow. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>Horn blinked. \u201cAh . . . yes. Have Cook send up some tea.\u201d</p><p>The butler bowed and retreated.</p><p>Horn waited until the door closed before speaking. \u201cBut who could\u2019ve done this? The only ones who knew of our route were the guides and the officers.\u201d He tapped his fingers on his desk. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? Did you see this letter Hartley had? Perhaps he mistook it.\u201d</p><p>But Jasper was already shaking his head. \u201cI saw the letter; there is no mistake. We were betrayed. Hartley and I thought it was Dick Thornton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that you\u2019d talked to him before he was hung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>Jasper inhaled deeply. \u201cThornton swore he wasn\u2019t the traitor. He insinuated it was one of the men captured by the Indians.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Horn stared at him, his eyes widening; then abruptly he shook his head and laughed. \u201cWhy would you believe a murderer like Thornton?\u201d</p><p>Jasper glanced at his hands, clasped together between his spread knees. He\u2019d asked himself the same question many times. \u201cThornton knew he was going to die. He had no reason to lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the reason of a madman.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded. \u201cEven so . . . Thornton was a prisoner in chains when we marched. He was at the back of the line. I think he may\u2019ve seen things, heard things the rest of us missed because we were busy leading the regiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you accept Thornton\u2019s accusations as truth, where does that take you?\u201d</p><p>Jasper watched him, not moving.</p><p>Horn spread his hands. \u201cWhat? Do you think I betrayed us, Vale? Do you think I asked to be tortured until my voice was hoarse from screaming? You know the nightmares I suffered from. You know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cStop. Of course I don\u2019t think you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d Horn looked at him, his eyes blazing through his tears. \u201cWho among us would betray the entire regiment? Nate Growe? They cut off half his fingers. Munroe? They cut out only his eye; that\u2019s little enough for what must\u2019ve been a grand payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen St. Aubyn? Oh, but he\u2019s dead. Perhaps he miscalculated and got himself burned at the stake for his troubles. Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it, damn you!\u201d Jasper\u2019s voice was low, but it was harsh enough to cut through Horn\u2019s awful recitation. \u201cI know. I know all that, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Horn closed his eyes and said quietly, \u201cThen you know none of us could have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone did. Someone set a trap and walked four hundred men into an abattoir.\u201d</p><p>Horn grimaced. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>A maid entered then, bearing a laden tea tray. Both men were silent while she set it up on a corner of the desk. The door closed gently behind her when she left.</p><p>Jasper looked at his old friend, his comrade in arms so long ago.</p><p>Horn pushed a pile of papers to the side of his desk. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to help me find who betrayed us,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cAnd then help me kill him.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS WELL past the dinner hour when Lord Vale finally returned home. Melisande knew this because the large sitting room at the front of the house had a terribly ugly clock on the mantelpiece. Fat pink nymphs cavorted about the clock face in a manner that was no doubt meant to be erotic. Melisande snorted. How little the man who had designed that clock knew of true eroticism. At her feet, Mouse had sat up at the sound of Lord Vale\u2019s arrival. Now he trotted to the door to sniff at the crack.</p><p>She pulled a silk thread carefully through her embroidery hoop, leaving behind a perfect French knot on the right side of the fabric. She was pleased at how steady her fingers were. Maybe with continued proximity to Vale, she\u2019d overcome her terrible sensitivity to him. Lord knew that the anger that had built during the hours she had waited for him certainly helped in that regard. Oh, she still felt his presence, still longed for his company, but those feelings were presently masked with exasperation. She hadn\u2019t seen him since breakfast, hadn\u2019t received word that he wouldn\u2019t be home for supper. Theirs might be a marriage of convenience, but that didn\u2019t mean that simple courtesy must be thrown out the window.</p><p>She could hear her husband talking in the hallway with the butler and footmen. Not for the first time that evening, she wondered if he\u2019d entirely forgotten that he had a wife. Oaks seemed like a capable man. Perhaps he\u2019d remind his master of her existence.</p><p>The ugly clock on the mantel chimed the quarter hour, the tones tinny and flat. Melisande frowned and placed another stitch. The smaller yellow and white sitting room at the back of the house was much prettier. The only reason she\u2019d chosen this sitting room was because of its proximity to the front hall. Vale would have to walk past to go to his rooms.</p><p>The sitting room door opened, startling Mouse, who jumped back and then, as if realizing he\u2019d been caught in retreat, leapt forward to bark at Lord Vale\u2019s ankles. Lord Vale gazed down at Mouse. Melisande had the distinct impression that he wouldn\u2019t mind kicking her dog.</p><p>\u201cSir Mouse,\u201d she called to prevent any tragedy.</p><p>Mouse gave one last bark, trotted over to her, and jumped up on the settee beside her.</p><p>Lord Vale closed the door and advanced into the room, making a bow to her. \u201cGood evening, madam wife. I apologize for my absence at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Humph. Melisande inclined her head and gestured to the chair opposite her. \u201cI am sure the business that detained you was most important, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale leaned back in his chair and laid one ankle over the opposite knee. \u201cPressing, yes, but whether important or not, I don\u2019t know. It seemed so at the time.\u201d He flicked a finger against the skirts of his coat.</p><p>She set another stitch. He seemed somehow downcast this evening, as if his usual joie de vivre had deserted him. Her outrage deflated as she wondered what had made him somber.</p><p>Lord Vale frowned at her and Mouse. \u201cThat settee is covered in satin.\u201d</p><p>Mouse laid his head on her lap. Melisande stroked his nose. \u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale opened his mouth and then closed it. His gaze roamed the room, and she could almost feel his need to jump up and pace. Instead, he drummed his long fingers against the arm of his chair. He looked tired and, with the humor in his eyes gone, older.</p><p>She hated to see him down. It made her heart ache. \u201cWould you care for a brandy? Or something from the kitchen? I\u2019m sure Cook has some kidney pie left over from dinner.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>She watched him a moment, perplexed. She\u2019d loved this man for years, but in many ways, she didn\u2019t know him. She didn\u2019t know what to do for him when he was weary and sad. She looked down, her brows knit, and snipped off the end of her thread. From her basket, she selected a silk the exact shade of ripe raspberries.</p><p>Lord Vale stopped drumming. \u201cYour design looks like a lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it is a lion,\u201d she murmured as she placed the first stitch in the lion\u2019s lolling tongue.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that unusual?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him beneath lowered brows.</p><p>A small amount of amusement crept into his face. \u201cNot that it\u2019s not a fine piece of embroidery. Very, ah, pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He drummed some more.</p><p>She outlined the lion\u2019s tongue and began to fill it in with smooth satin stitches. It was nice to sit here together even if they both didn\u2019t know quite what to do. She silently sighed. Perhaps that wisdom would come with time.</p><p>Lord Vale stopped drumming. \u201cAlmost forgot. Got you something whilst I was out.\u201d He fished in his coat pocket.</p><p>Melisande laid aside her embroidery hoop to accept aks p to ac small box.</p><p>\u201cA token apology for shouting at you this morning,\u201d Lord Vale said. \u201cI was a cad and a blackguard and the worst of husbands.\u201d</p><p>A corner of her mouth tilted up. \u201cYou weren\u2019t quite that bad.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the thing, to yell like a madman at one\u2019s lady wife, and I won\u2019t do it as a rule, I assure you. At least not after I\u2019ve had my morning tea, in any case.\u201d</p><p>She opened the box to find small garnet-drop earrings. \u201cHow lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Across from her, he nodded and leapt to his feet. \u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll bid you a good night, then.\u201d</p><p>She felt the brush of his lips against her hair, and then he was at the door. He touched the doorknob and then half turned toward her. \u201cI say, no need to wait up for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cThat is, I shan\u2019t be coming to your rooms. Too soon after our wedding night, what? I just thought you should know so you wouldn\u2019t be worried. Sleep well, my heart.\u201d</p><p>She inclined her head, biting her lip to keep back the tears, but he was already out the door.</p><p>Melisande blinked rapidly, then looked back to the little box with the garnet earrings. They were quite lovely, but she never wore earrings. Her ears weren\u2019t pierced. She touched one of the garnets with a fingertip and wondered if he\u2019d ever looked\u2014really looked\u2014at her at all.</p><p>She closed the box gently and put it in her embroidery bag. Then she gathered her things and left the room, Mouse trailing behind.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The second beggar stood, and all his rags fell away, revealing a horrible thing, half beast, half man, and entirely covered with black and rotting scales.</p><p>\u201cDamn me, will you?\u201d rasped the demon, for such it obviously was. \u201cI will see you damned in my stead!\u201d</p><p>Jack began to shrink, his legs and arms growing shorter, until he stood only the height of a child. At the same time, his nose grew and hooked down until it nearly met his chin, which had elongated and curved up.</p><p>The demon roared with laughter and vanished in a sulfurous cloud of smoke. And then Jack stood all alone in the road, the sleeves of his soldier\u2019s uniform trailing in the dust. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>\u201cAh, lovely,\u201d Jasper said over dinner three days later. \u201cBeef and gravy with Yorkshire pudding, the v\"9%\u201eery epitome of an English supper.\u201d Could he sound any more of an ass if he tried? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sipped from his wineglass and watched over the rim to see if his new wife would agree with his self- assessment of assedness, but as usual, the dratted woman wore a polite mask.</p><p>\u201cCook does make a pleasant Yorkshire pudding,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He\u2019d hardly seen her in the last few days, and this was the first supper they\u2019d shared together. Yet she didn\u2019t scold or fret or indeed show any emotion at all. He set his wineglass down and tried to pinpoint the source of his discontent. This was what he\u2019d wanted, surely? To have a complacent wife, one who didn\u2019t make scenes or cause a fuss? He\u2019d thought\u2014when he\u2019d thought ahead at all\u2014that he\u2019d see her now and again, escort her to the odd ball, and when she\u2019d become safely pregnant, discreetly take a mistress. He was well on the way to achieving that goal.</p><p>And yet the reality was oddly dissatisfying.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve invitations to Lady Graham\u2019s annual masked ball, I noticed,\u201d he said as he cut his beef. \u201cRather a tedious event, of course, what with the need to wear masks. Mine always makes me hot and gives me a terrible urge to sneeze. But I thought you might like to come?\u201d</p><p>She winced slightly as she raised her glass of wine. \u201cThank you for asking, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He applied himself to his meat, feeling a twinge of disappointment. \u201cIf a mask is the problem, I can have one made in a trice. Perhaps a gilt one with feathers and little jewels about the eyes?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. \u201cI should look like a crow in a peacock\u2019s finery. Thank you, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI trust you\u2019ll attend, however,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish to spoil your enjoyment.\u201d</p><p>He thought of the endless damnable night hours and how he tried to fill them with the company of drunken strangers. \u201cMost kind. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t withstand the temptation of a masquerade ball. Perhaps it\u2019s the pleasure of watching otherwise dignified gentlemen and ladies prance about in dominoes and masks. Childish, I know, but there it is.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment but merely watched him as she sipped from her wineglass. A single line had incised itself between her brows. Perhaps he\u2019d revealed too much.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely tonight,\u201d he said to change the subject. \u201cThe candlelight becomes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed.\u201d She shook her head sadly. \u201cI sit with one of London\u2019s most famous lovers, and he tells me the candlelight becomes me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cI am chastised, madam. Then shall I compliment your eyes?\u201d</p> <p>She widened them. \u201cAre they liquid pools that doth reflect my soul?\u201d</p><p>A surprised laugh burst from his lips. \u201cLady, you are a hard critic. Shall I tell you of your wondrous smile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may, but I may yawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shower praises on your figure.\u201d</p><p>She arched a mocking brow.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall expound upon your sweet soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know my soul, sweet or otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said before.\u201d He sat back in his chair and examined her. She looked away from his gaze as if regretting her challenge. Which only piqued his interest more. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t offered any insight into who you are either.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. One hand was pressed to her belly; the other idly twirled her glass stem.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should go exploring into my lady wife\u2019s mind. I shall begin simply,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWhat do you like to eat?\u201d</p><p>She nodded to the cooling beef and Yorkshire pudding on her plate. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t make this easy.\u201d He cocked his head. Most ladies of his acquaintance loved to talk about themselves\u2014it was their favorite subject, in fact. Why not his wife? \u201cI mean, what do you like to eat most of all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoast chicken is nice. We can have that tomorrow night, if it\u2019s agreeable to you.\u201d</p><p>He placed his arms on the table and leaned toward her. \u201cMelisande. What is your favorite food in all the world?\u201d</p><p>She finally looked up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I have a favorite food in all the world.\u201d</p><p>Which nearly drove him over the edge of reason. \u201cHow can you not have a favorite food? Everyone has a favorite food.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in exasperation. \u201cGammon steak? Biscuits with butter? Ripe grapes? Seed cake? Syllabub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyllabub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have something you like. No. Something you adore. Something you crave in the dark of night. Something you dream about at afternoon teas when you should be listening to the old lady sitting next to you, droning on about cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou yourself must have a favorite dish, if your theory holds true.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. A feeble attack. \u201cPigeon pie, gammon steak, raspberry tart, ripe fresh pears, a good beef steak, biscuits hot from the oven, roasted goose, and any kind of cheese.\u201d</p><p>She touched her wineglass to her lips but did not sip. \u201cYou\u2019ve listed many foods, instead of one favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I have a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps your mind cannot settle on one favorite.\u201d Her lips tilted at one corner, and he noticed for the first time that although they weren\u2019t lush and full, her lips were elegantly curved and rather lovely. \u201cOr perhaps, having none to raise above the others, they are all equally mundane to you.\u201d</p><p>He sat up in his chair and coack chair cked his head. \u201cAre you calling me frivolous, madam?\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cIf the shoe fits . . .\u201d</p><p>An affronted laugh puffed from his mouth. \u201cI am insulted at my own table and by my own wife! Come, I will kindly give you a chance to retract your statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet I cannot in all conscience do so,\u201d she replied at once. That smile still played about her mouth, and he wanted to reach across the table and touch it with his thumb. To physically feel her amusement. \u201cWhat would you call a man who has so many favorite foods he can\u2019t choose amongst them? Who gains and loses two fianc\u00e9es in the course of less than a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a low blow!\u201d he protested, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWho I have never seen wear the same coat twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is the friend of every man he meets, yet has not a favorite friend himself?\u201d</p><p>Her smile had died, and he had stopped laughing. He\u2019d had a favorite friend once. Reynaud St. Aubyn. But Reynaud had died in the bloody aftermath of Spinner\u2019s Falls. Now he spent his nights among strangers. She was right, his damnable wife; he was the acquaintance of many and the soul mate of none.</p><p>Jasper swallowed and said low, \u201cTell me, madam, why having a plethora of likes is worse than being too fearful to pick one at all?\u201d</p><p>She set her wineglass on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t like this conversation anymore.\u201d</p><p>Silence hung between them for several heartbeats.</p><p>He sighed and pushed back from the table. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he strode from the room, feeling as if he were admitting defeat. No, this wasn\u2019t defeat; this was a short retreat to regroup his forces. Nothing shameful in that. Many of the best generals considered falling back much preferable to an all-out rout.</p><p>SHE\u2019D COME CLOSE to revealing too much about herself this evening. Too much about her feelings for Vale.</p><p>Melisande pressed a hand to her lower belly as Suchlike pulled a brush through her hair. To have anyone, but especially Vale, be that interested in discovering her inner soul was seductive. His entire attention had been focused on her tonight. That kind of total concentration might very well become addictive if she wasn\u2019t careful. She\u2019d let her emotions take hold of her once before with Timothy, her fianc\u00e9, and it had nearly destroyed her. Her love had been deep and single-minded. To love like that was not a blessing. It was a curse. To be capable of\u2014to endure\u2014that unnaturally strong emotion was a kind of mental deformity. It had taken her years to recover from losing Timothy. She kept the reminder of that hurt close, a warning of what might happen if she let her emotions gain control of her person. Her very sanity depended on her strict constraint.</p><p>She shivered on the thought, and another pain hit her. The ache was low and dull in her belly, like a knot drawn tight there. Melisande swallowed and gripped the edge of her dresser. She\u2019d been enduring this monthly pain for he hly paififteen years, and there was no point in making a fuss over it.</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s so pretty when it\u2019s down, my lady,\u201d Suchlike said from behind her. \u201cSo long and fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine brown, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Suchlike conceded. \u201cBut it\u2019s a pretty brown. Like the color oak wood turns when it ages. Sort of a soft blondy brown.\u201d</p><p>Melisande stared skeptically at her maid in the mirror. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to flatter.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike met her gaze in the glass and seemed genuinely startled. \u201cIt\u2019s not flattery, my lady, if it\u2019s true. And it is. True, that is. I like the way your hair waves a bit about your face, if you don\u2019t mind me saying so. Pity you can\u2019t wear it down always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine sight that\u2019d be,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cMe looking like a sad dryad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about them things, my lady, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Melisande closed her eyes as another pain squeezed her belly.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Melisande lied. \u201cDon\u2019t fuss.\u201d</p><p>The lady\u2019s maid looked uncertain. Naturally she must be aware of what the problem was since she took care of Melisande\u2019s linens. But Melisande hated having anyone, even someone as innocuous as Suchlike, know such an intimate thing.</p><p>\u201cShall I fetch a heated brick, my lady?\u201d Suchlike asked tentatively.</p><p>Melisande almost snapped at the maid, but then another pain hit her, and she nodded mutely. A wrapped hot brick might very well help.</p><p>Suchlike hurried from the room, and Melisande made her way to the bed. She crawled underneath the covers, feeling the ache reach long tentacles into her hips and thighs. Mouse hopped on the bed and crept over to lay his head on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh, Sir Mouse,\u201d she murmured to the dog. She stroked the tip of his nose, and his tongue darted out to lick her fingers. \u201cYou are my most loyal cavalier.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike returned, carrying the hot brick wrapped in flannel. \u201cThere, my lady,\u201d she said, shoving the brick beneath the bedcovers. \u201cSee if that helps at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Melisande hugged the brick against her belly. Another wave crested and she bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something else?\u201d Suchlike still stood beside the bed, her eyes worried, her hands twisted together. \u201cSome hot tea and honey? Or another blanket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Melisande softened her voice. The little maid really was a dear. \u201cThank you. That will be all.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike bobbed a curtsy and shut the door quietly.</p><p>Melisande closed her eyes, trying to ignore the pains. Behind her, she felt Mouse creep beneath the covers and settle his warm little body against her hips. He sighed and then there was silence in the room. Hhern the rer mind drifted a bit, and she shifted a little, groaning under her breath as her belly fisted.</p><p>A knock came on the connecting door and then it opened. Lord Vale strolled in.</p><p>For a second, Melisande closed her eyes. Why had he chosen tonight to resume his marital duties? He\u2019d kept his distance since their wedding night, presumably to let her heal, and now here he came when she was entirely unable to entertain him. And how exactly was she to tell him that without sinking through the floor in mortification?</p><p>\u201cAh, already abed?\u201d he started to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he was interrupted by Mouse bursting from the covers, leaping atop her hip and barking furiously.</p><p>Lord Vale started back, Mouse lost his balance and skidded off her hip, and Melisande groaned as she was jostled by the terrier.</p><p>\u201cHas he hurt you?\u201d Lord Vale came toward her, his brows knit, which caused Mouse to bark so hard that all four paws left the bed at once.</p><p>\u201cHush, Mouse,\u201d Melisande moaned.</p> <p>Lord Vale looked at Mouse with cold blue eyes. Then, in a move so sudden and fast she didn\u2019t have time to protest, he grabbed the dog by its ruff, picked him up off the bed, and tossed him into the dressing room. He shut the door firmly and returned to the bed to frown down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, a bit put out that he\u2019d taken Mouse away. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Her answer caused him to frown more sternly. \u201cDo not lie to me. Your dog has hurt you somehow. Now tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Mouse.\u201d She closed her eyes, because she couldn\u2019t look at him and say this. \u201cI have my . . . my courses.\u201d</p> <p>The room was so quiet, she wondered if he was holding his breath. She opened her eyes.</p><p>Lord Vale was staring at her as if she\u2019d metamorphosed into a salted herring. \u201cYour . . . ah . . . quite.\u201d</p><p>He glanced about the room as if for inspiration.</p><p>Melisande wished she could vanish. Simply disappear into the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you . . . ah.\u201d Lord Vale cleared his throat. \u201cDo you require anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Thank you.\u201d She tucked the comforter under her nose.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Well, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words collided with his. He stopped and looked at her, then gracefully waved a large-knuckled hand for her to speak.</p><p>Melisande cleared her throat. \u201cActually, could you let Mouse out again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He strode to the dressing room door and cracked it open.</p><p>Mouse immediately da&gt;</p><p>Lord Vale arched an eyebrow at Melisande. \u201cYour pardon, but it\u2019s best if we work this out now.\u201d</p><p>Once again he moved with startling speed, but this time he reached out and closed his hand about the dog\u2019s muzzle. Mouse must\u2019ve been surprised as well, for he squeaked.</p> <p>Melisande opened her mouth in instinctive protest, but Vale shot her a glance, and she closed it again. It was his house, and he was her husband, after all.</p><p>Still holding Mouse\u2019s muzzle, Lord Vale leaned down and looked the dog in the eye. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Man and dog stared a moment more, and man gave the dog a firm shake. Then he released him. Mouse sat down against Melisande and licked his muzzle.</p><p>Lord Vale\u2019s gaze returned to her. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>And he left the room.</p><p>Mouse came and pressed his nose against her cheek.</p><p>She stroked his head. \u201cWell, you really did deserve that, you know.\u201d</p><p>Mouse exhaled gustily and then pawed the edge of the coverlet. She held it up so he could creep beneath and resume his place against her back.</p><p>Then she closed her eyes. Men. How was it possible that Vale had had a parade of paramours in the last several years and still didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with his own wife? Even insulated as she was by society, she\u2019d heard whispers each time he\u2019d taken a new mistress or formed a liaison. Each time it was like a tiny bit of glass pressed into the softness of her heart, grinding, grinding, oh so silently, until she no longer noticed when she bled. And now she had him\u2014finally had him\u2014all to herself, and it turned out that he had the sensitivity of . . . an ox.</p><p>Melisande turned and thumped her pillow, causing Mouse to grumble as he resettled himself. Oh, this was a great cosmic joke! To have the man of her dreams and find he was made of lead. But he couldn\u2019t be a universally bad lover and have the reputation he had with the ladies of the ton. Some of them had stayed with him for months, and most were sophisticated creatures, the type who could have their pick of paramours. The type who had dozens of men.</p><p>She stilled at the thought. Her husband was used to experienced lovers. Perhaps he simply did not know what to do with a wife. Or\u2014terrible thought!\u2014perhaps he intended to keep his passion for a mistress and use his wife merely to mother his children. In that case, he might feel that there was no need to expend extra energy in seeing that she enjoyed the marriage bed.</p><p>Melisande scowled into the darkness of her lonely room. If they continued on their present course, she would have a loveless and sexless marriage. The love she could do without\u2014had to do without, if she were to maintain her sanity. She no more wanted Valen ae wante to find out her true feelings for him than she wanted to jump from the roof of a building. But that didn\u2019t mean she had to do without passion as well. If she was very careful, she might seduce her husband into a satisfying marriage bed without him ever discovering her pathetic love for him.</p><p>EVERY TIME HE looked at Matthew Horn, he felt guilt, Jasper reflected the next afternoon. They were riding side by side in Hyde Park. Jasper thought of his thin pallet and wondered if Matthew had a secret badge of shame as well. They all seemed to, in one way or another, the ones who had survived. He patted Belle\u2019s neck and pushed the thought aside. Those demons were for the night.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to offer felicitations on your marriage the other morning,\u201d Horn said. \u201cI had thought not to see the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and many others,\u201d Jasper replied.</p><p>Melisande had still not risen when he\u2019d left the house, and he supposed his wife might spend the day abed. He wasn\u2019t very well versed in these feminine matters; he\u2019d known many women, but the subject had not arisen when the ladies in question had been paramours. This marriage business took more work than it first appeared.</p><p>\u201cDid you tie a blindfold around the poor lady\u2019s eyes to get her to the altar?\u201d Horn asked.</p><p>\u201cShe came most willingly, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d Jasper glanced at the other man. \u201cShe wanted a small wedding; otherwise, you would\u2019ve been invited.\u201d</p><p>Horn grinned. \u201cQuite all right. Weddings tend to be dull affairs for all but the principals. No offense meant.\u201d</p><p>Jasper inclined his head. \u201cNone taken.\u201d</p><p>They guided their horses around a stopped carriage. A scrawny fellow was sitting, scratching his head under his wig as his female companion leaned down to gossip with two lady pedestrians. He and Horn doffed their hats as they passed. The gentleman nodded absently; the ladies curtsied and then bent their heads together to whisper furiously.</p><p>\u201cHave you any aspirations in that direction yourself?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>Horn turned to look a question at him.</p><p>Jasper nodded to the various knots of vibrant colors that marked the presence of the female sex in the park. \u201cMarriage?\u201d</p><p>Horn grinned. \u201cThus it begins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery newly married man must needs lure his fellows into the trap.\u201d</p><p>Jasper arched an eyebrow repressively.</p><p>Not that it did any good. Horn shook his head. \u201cNext you\u2019ll be introducing me to a whey-faced creature with a squint and informing me how vastly improved my lot will be once I tie myself to her forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jasper murmured, \u201cI do have a maiden cousin. She\u2019s nearing her fourth decade, but her estate is quite large and of course her connections good.\u201d</p><p>Horn turned a face full of mute horror.</p><p>Jasper grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, mock me if you will, but I had a very similar offer just last month.\u201d Horn shuddered.</p><p>\u201cIs this unnatural aversion to the fairer sex your reason for spending so much time on the continent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d Horn bowed to a carriage of elderly ladies. \u201cI traveled Italy and Greece to view the ruins and collect statuary.\u201d</p><p>Jasper raised his eyebrows. \u201cI had not realized you were a connoisseur of art.\u201d</p><p>Horn shrugged.</p><p>Jasper looked ahead. They\u2019d nearly reached the far end of the park. \u201cDid you find Nate Growe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Horn shook his head. \u201cWhen I went to the coffeehouse I thought I\u2019d seen him at, they had no knowledge of him. It may not even have been Growe in the first place. It was months ago now. I\u2019m sorry, Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does that leave us with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many. There were eight captured: You, me, Alistair Munroe, Maddock, Sergeant Coleman, John Cooper, and Growe.\u201d Jasper frowned. \u201cWho am I missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain St. Aubyn.\u201d</p><p>Jasper swallowed, remembering Reynaud\u2019s sharp black eyes and sudden wide grin. \u201cOf course. Captain St. Aubyn. Cooper was killed on the march. Coleman died from what the Indians did to him when we made the camp, as did St. Aubyn, and Maddock died in the camp as well,from his battle wounds festering. Who does that leave alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, me, Munroe, and Growe,\u201d Horn said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We\u2019ve hit a dead end. Munroe won\u2019t talk to you, and Growe has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Jasper stared at the dirt track, trying to think. There had to be something he\u2019d missed.</p><p>Horn sighed. \u201cYou said yourself that Thornton was probably lying. I think you have to give it up, Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He had to find out the truth\u2014who had betrayed them and how. There\u2019d been too many men lost, his men, at Spinner\u2019s Falls for it all to be simply forgotten. He could never forget, God knew. He glanced around. People strolled and rode and gossiped. What did these gentle people in their silks and velvets, their slow paces, their elegant bows and curtsies know about a forest half a world away? A place where the trees blocked out the light and the silence of the forest swallowed the panting of terrified men? Sometimes, late at night, he wondered if the whole thing had been a nightmarish fever dream, a vision he\u2019d had many years ago that he was unable to escape even now. Had he really seen his regiment slaughtered, his men killed like cattle, his commanding officer pulled from his horse and nearly beheaded? Had Reynaud St. Aubyn really been stripped and crucified? Tied to a stake and set alight? Sometimes at night, the dreams and the reality seemed to merge so that he couldn\u2019t tell what was real and what was false.</p><p>\u201cVale\u2014\u201ddis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said yourself that it was the officers who knew our route,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>Horn looked at him patiently. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let us concentrate on the officers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead, save me and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if we talked to their survivors\u2014friends or relatives. Perhaps something was mentioned in a letter.\u201d</p><p>Horn was looking at him with something close to pity. \u201cSergeant Coleman was near to illiterate. I doubt he wrote any letters home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what about Maddock?\u201d</p><p>Horn heaved a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. His brother is Lord Hasselthorpe, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s head whipped around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Hasselthorpe,\u201d Horn said slowly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jasper shook his head. He\u2019d been a guest of Hasselthorpe just last fall and had never known the man was related to Maddock. \u201cI must talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how he\u2019ll know anything,\u201d Horn said. \u201cHasselthorpe was in the Colonies as well, or so I\u2019ve heard, but he was in an entirely different regiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. I must try and talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d They\u2019d come to the end of the track and the entrance to Hyde Park, and Horn pulled his horse to a halt. He looked worriedly at Jasper. \u201cGood luck, Vale. Let me know if there is anything I can do.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded and shook hands with Horn before they parted. The mare shifted beneath him and mouthed her bit as he watched Horn ride off. Jasper turned her head toward his town house, trying to dispel the awful images still in his mind\u2019s eye. Maybe Melisande would be up by now, and he could sit with her a while and spar. Bantering with his new wife was proving to be a surprisingly entertaining sport. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when he entered his home and inquired of Oaks, he was informed that his wife had gone out. Jasper nodded to the butler and gave him his tricorne before mounting the stairs to the upper story.</p><p>Strange. She\u2019d only lived here less than a week, and already her presence was imprinted on the house. She hadn\u2019t redecorated the rooms or replaced all the servants, but she\u2019d made the house hers nevertheless. It was in the little things. The elusive scent of her Neroli perfume in the small sitting room, the fire that was always laid there, the thread of yellow silk he\u2019d found on the carpet the other day. It was almost like living with a ghost. He reached the upper hall and turned toward his rooms but hesitated as he passed her door. His fingers touched the doorknob, and then he was inside her rooms before he could rethink the impulse.</p><p>The room was so neat it might not\u2019ve been inhabited at all. The hangings were freshly washed, of course, in preparation for a new viscountess. She had the same tall, dark wood wardrobe his mother had used, a dressing table and chair, and several low chairs by the fireplace. For the first time, it occurred to him that she\u2019d not brought anyeadt broug of her own furniture when she\u2019d come to live here.</p><p>He wandered to the wardrobe and opened it, seeing rows and rows of dull-colored dresses. Her bed was neatly made, no lace pillow or sachet to give it her own touch. The bedside table held only a candlestick, no pins or a book she might read late at night. He crossed to the dressing table. A gilt and mother-of-pearl brush lay on the surface. He ran his fingers through the bristles but couldn\u2019t find any hairs. She had a small china dish to hold her hairpins and next to it, a pretty ivory box. Inside was her jewelry\u2014a few pins, a string of pearls, and the garnet earrings he\u2019d given her. He closed the box. There was a single drawer in the dressing table, which he pulled open but found only ribbons and lace and more pins. He shut it gently and looked around the room. She must have something of her own, some possession that had special value to her.</p> <p>If she did, she kept it well hidden. He crossed to the chest of drawers and pulled out the top, finding linens neatly folded. The scent of oranges rose as he fingered them. The next drawer held the same, and the third as well, but underneath the linens in the bottom drawer he finally found something. He sat on his heels to examine it: an old tin snuffbox, no bigger than the length of his thumb. He turned it over in his palm. Where had she gotten such a thing? Surely her father and brothers, if they took snuff, owned much fancier boxes?</p><p>He pulled back the little hinged lid. Inside was a silver button, a tiny china dog, and a pressed violet. He stared at the button, then picked it up. It must be his own\u2014the monogrammed V proclaimed it, but he didn\u2019t remember losing it. He placed it back in the little tin box. He hadn\u2019t a clue what it or the other items signified to her, why she saved them, if they even were important to her or perhaps only placed there on a whim. She was right: he didn\u2019t know her, his wife.</p><p>Jasper closed the tin snuffbox and replaced it under the linens in the bottom drawer. Then he stood and looked around the room. He wouldn\u2019t find her here. The only way to learn Melisande would be to study the lady herself.</p><p>He nodded to himself, decision made, and left the room.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Well, this was a terrible thing, but what could Jack do but continue on his way? After walking for another day, he came to a magnificent city. When he entered the gates, people stared and laughed, and a little crowd of boys followed him, jeering at his long nose and curving chin.</p><p>Jack threw down his pack, placed tiny hands on hips, and yelled, \u201cD\u2019you think me a figure of fun?\u201d</p><p>And then behind him came another laugh, but this one was soft and sweet. When Jack turned, he beheld the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen, with rich golden hair and rosy cheeks.</p><p>She bent down and said to him, \u201cI think you the funniest little man I\u2019ve ever seen. Will you come and be my fool?\u201d</p><p>And that was how Jack becathe\u201eme fool to the daughter of the king. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p> <p>Melisande was enjoying her usual coddled eggs and buns the next morning at the usual time\u2014half past eight o\u2019clock\u2014when something unusual happened. Her husband entered the breakfast room.</p><p>Melisande paused with her cup halfway to her lips and darted a quick glance at the china clock that stood on the side table. She hadn\u2019t mistaken the time. The clock read 8:32.</p><p>She took a sip of her chocolate and set the cup precisely back down on the saucer, glad that her hands didn\u2019t tremble at his presence. \u201cGood morning, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lord Vale smiled, those lines beside his mouth deepening in a way she\u2019d always found devastatingly charming. \u201cGood morning, my dearest wife.\u201d</p><p>Mouse came out from under her skirts, and for a moment, man and dog eyed each other. Then Mouse wisely conceded the moment and retreated to his lair.</p><p>Her husband strolled to the sideboard and frowned. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any bacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t usually eat it.\u201d Melisande beckoned to the footman, standing by the door. \u201cHave Cook prepare some bacon, eggs, a few buttered kidneys, toast, and a fresh pot of tea for Lord Vale. Oh, and make sure that Cook includes some of her good marmalade.\u201d</p><p>The footman bowed and left the room.</p> <p>Vale came to sit opposite her. \u201cI am enchanted. You know what I like to eat in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She\u2019d been studying him for years, after all. \u201cThat is one of a wife\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResponsibility,\u201d he murmured as he slouched in his chair. His lips twisted a little as if he found the word distasteful. \u201cAnd is it the responsibility of a husband to know what his wife eats?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but as she\u2019d just put a forkful of egg into her mouth, she couldn\u2019t reply.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think it must be, so I shall take note. Soft coddled eggs, buttered buns, and hot chocolate. No jam or honey for your buns, I see.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cNo. Unlike you, I don\u2019t much care for jam.\u201d</p><p>He slouched farther into the chair, his turquoise eyes lazy. \u201cI admit I have a sweet tooth. Jam and honey and even treacle syrup. Spread it on anything and I just might lick it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d She could feel her belly heat at just his words, wicked, wicked man.</p><p>\u201cI would indeed. Would you like me to list the possible things I could spread treacle on?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him. She was terribly pleased that he\u2019d joined her, but what an odd mood he seemed to be in</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never known you to rise before eleven of the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you\u2019ve only been married to me less than a week. Perhaps I habitually rise before nine or even five, like a crowing cock.\u201d</p><p>She felt a blush begin to heat her cheeks. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you up so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was hungry for my marmalade jam.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him from under her brows.</p><p>He stared back, his look rather disconcerting. \u201cOr perhaps I fancied my lovely wife\u2019s company for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. She wasn\u2019t sure whether to be intrigued or alarmed at his sudden interest. \u201cWhy would\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Two maids entered, bearing his breakfast, and she swallowed the question. They were both silent as the maids arranged the dishes and looked to her for approval. Melisande nodded and the servants left.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014?\u201d</p><p>But he spoke at the same time. They both stopped, and he gestured for her to speak.</p><p>Melisande said, \u201cNo, I beg your pardon. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely wish to inquire about your plans for the day.\u201d</p><p>She reached across the table and poured him some tea. \u201cI hope to call on my great-aunt, Miss Rockwell.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from buttering his toast. \u201cOn your mother\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My father\u2019s mother\u2019s sister. She\u2019s quite elderly now, and I heard that she took a fall last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He took a huge bite of toast and crunched it, holding up a finger to indicate she should wait. She stared as he masticated and then gulped down half his tea.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Hot,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThink I\u2019ve burned my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot mean to accompany me on a visit to my aunt,\u201d Melisande burst out.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy elderly aunt, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a terrible fondness for elderly ladies. It\u2019s a weakness of mine, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll expire from boredom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not whilst in your company, sweet wife,\u201d he said softly. \u201cUnless, of course, you don\u2019t wish me to accomt yh me topany you?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. He lounged in his chair like a big tomcat, his expression relaxed as he ate his bacon. But his greenish-blue eyes had a spark in them. Why did she feel as if she\u2019d just walked straight into a trap? What possible motive could he have to want to visit her great-aunt, of all people? If he were the cat, did that make her the little brown mouse? And why did the thought of playing mouse to his cat make her so very, very warm?</p><p>Oh, she was an idiot. \u201cI\u2019d be most pleased to have you accompany me,\u201d she murmured, the only answer she could possibly make to his question.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cExcellent. We\u2019ll take my phaeton.\u201d And he crunched into a fresh slice of toast.</p><p>Melisande\u2019s eyes narrowed. She was sure of it now. Her husband was up to something.</p><p>IT COULD\u2019VE BEEN worse, Jasper thought cheerfully as he handled the ribbons of his phaeton. She could\u2019ve been going to see . . . hmm. Actually, there really weren\u2019t too many things worse than an elderly maiden aunt. But it didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d sent Pynch off this morning to learn if Lord Hasselthorpe was in town and, if so, where Jasper might find him. In the meantime, Jasper had no pressing business. The day was fine, he was driving his new phaeton, and his lovely wife sat beside him unable to escape. Sooner or later, she would have to talk to him too.</p><p>He glanced sideways at her. She sat ramrod straight in the phaeton seat, her back not even touching the crimson leather seat. Her expression was serene, but she clutched at the carriage side. At least her eyes no longer held that edge of pain he\u2019d seen two nights before. He looked away. He\u2019d rarely felt as useless as he had the other night, seeing her in pain but unable to do anything about it. How did other men deal with this part of marriage? Did they have some secret remedy for a wife\u2019s womanly ills, or did they simply pretend nothing was wrong?</p><p>He slowed the phaeton as a gaggle of ladies crossed the street in front of them. \u201cYou seem better this morning.\u201d</p><p>Her back stiffened even more. He knew at once that it was not the right thing to say. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d He gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>A perverse part of him couldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cYou weren\u2019t perfectly fine two nights ago, and I only saw you in passing yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIs it always like this? I mean, I know it happens monthly, but is it always so painful? How long does it last?\u201d A sudden thought struck him. \u201cI say, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s because we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord,\u201d she muttered. Then rapidly, in a low voice he had to bend his head to hear, \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine. Yes, this happens every month, but only for a few days and the . . . the pain is usually over after the first day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many days, exactly?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look of pure exasperation. \u201cWhyever would you wish to know that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause, sweetest wife,\u201d he said, \u201cif I know when your flow ceases, then I will know when I may visit your rooms again.\u201d</p><p>That made her quiet for a few minutes, and then she said softly, \u201cUsually five.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. This was the third day. If she was \u201cusual,\u201d then he might bed her again in three nights. He was rather looking forward to the prospect, actually. The first time was never very good for the lady\u2014or so he\u2019d heard. He wanted to show her how lovely it could be. He had a sudden vision of cracking that mask she wore, making her head arch back in ecstasy, her eyes opened wide, her mouth soft and vulnerable.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably at the thought. Several days of waiting yet. \u201cThank you for telling me. Still. Rotten luck, that. Does it happen with every lady?\u201d</p> <p>She turned her head to stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou know. Does every lady have this much pain, or do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d she muttered, either to herself or to the horses; there wasn\u2019t anyone else within earshot. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t born under a rock. Why are you asking these questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife now. I\u2019m sure every man wants to know these things about his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI very much doubt it,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>\u201cI at least want to know these things.\u201d He felt his lips curve. Theirs might be an unorthodox conversation, but he was enjoying it nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my wife,\u201d he said, and knew suddenly that it was true, deep in his soul. \u201cMy wife to hold, my wife to protect and shield. If there is something hurting you, I want\u2014no, I need\u2014 to know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t something you can do anything about.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI still need to know. Don\u2019t ever keep this or any other pain from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand men,\u201d she said under her breath.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a rummy lot, it\u2019s true,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cBut it\u2019s good of you to put up with us.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at that and then leaned forward, unconsciously placing her hand on his arm. \u201cTurn the corner here. My aunt\u2019s house is down this lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my lady wife wishes.\u201d He guided the horses as directed, all the while aware of her hand on his arm. She let it drop a minute later, and he wished he could have it back.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d she said, and he halted the horses in front of a modest town house.</p><p>He tied the reins off and jumped from the phaeton. Even with his haste, by the time he rounded the carriage, she had stood and was about to get down from the high seat by hrthigh seaerself.</p><p>He gripped her about the waist and looked her in the eye. \u201cPermit me.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t made it a question, but she inclined her head anyway. She was a tall woman, but fine boned. His hands nearly met around her waist. He lifted her easily and felt a kind of thrill go through his body. Held above his head, she was helpless and in his power.</p><p>She looked down at him and arched an awful eyebrow, despite the fact that he could feel her trembling beneath his hands. \u201cMight you set me on the ground now?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He lowered her slowly, relishing the feel of control. He knew it wouldn\u2019t become an everyday occurrence with her. As soon as her toes touched the road, she stepped back and shook out her skirts.</p><p>She gave him a repressive look from under her brows. \u201cMy aunt is rather hard of hearing, and she doesn\u2019t like gentlemen much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d He held his arm for her. \u201cThis should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d She placed her fingertips on his sleeve, and again he felt that thrill. Perhaps he\u2019d had too much tea at breakfast.</p><p>They mounted the steps, and he let the tarnished brass knocker fall against the door. Then there was a rather extended wait.</p><p>Jasper glanced at his bride. \u201cYou said she was deaf, but are her servants deaf as well?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, which had the contrary effect of making him want to kiss her. \u201cThey\u2019re not deaf, but they are rather old and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door creaked open, and a rheumy eye peered out at them. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord and Lady Vale to see Miss . . .\u201d He turned to Melisande and whispered, \u201cWhat was her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Rockwell.\u201d She shook her head and addressed the aged butler. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Miss Fleming,\u201d the old man wheezed. \u201cCome in, come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lady Vale,\u201d Jasper said loudly.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The butler cupped a hand behind his ear.</p><p>\u201cLady Vale,\u201d Jasper bawled. \u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, indeed, sir.\u201d The man turned and tottered down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he understood me,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>\u201cOh, good Lord.\u201d Melisande tugged at his sleeve, and they entered the house.</p><p>Her aunt must either have a dislike of using candles or be able to see in the dark, for the hallway was very nearly black.</p><p>Jasper squinted. \u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d Melisande marched forward as if she knew exactly where to go.</p><p>And she did, for after a series of turns and a flight of stairs, they were presented with a door and a room with a light.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d a querulous voice asked from beyond the door.</p><p>\u201cMiss Fleming an\u2019 a gentleman, mum,\u201d the old butler replied.</p><p>\u201cLady Vale,\u201d Jasper shouted as they entered the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A petite elderly lady sat upright in a daybed, surrounded by white lace and ribbons and bows. She held a long brass horn to her ear, which she swiveled in their direction. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jasper bent and spoke into the ear horn. \u201cShe\u2019s Lady Vale now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Miss Rockwell lowered the ear horn in evident exasperation. \u201cMelisande, dear, it\u2019s so nice to see you, but who is this gentleman? He says he\u2019s a lady. That can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>Jasper felt a tremble go through Melisande\u2019s slight frame, and then she was still again. He had a violent urge to kiss her, but he suppressed it with effort.</p><p>\u201cThis is my husband, Lord Vale,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>\u201cIs he indeed?\u201d The lady didn\u2019t look particularly pleased at the news. \u201cWell, why\u2019ve you brought him \u2019round here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to meet you,\u201d Jasper said, tiring of being talked about as if he weren\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you had the best cakes,\u201d he bawled.</p><p>\u201cCheek!\u201d The old lady\u2019s head reared back, making the ribbons on her cap tremble. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, everyone,\u201d Jasper said. He sat in a settee and pulled his wife down to sit beside him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it true?\u201d</p><p>The old lady pursed her lips in a manner he\u2019d grown to recognize from Melisande. \u201cMy cook does make rather good cakes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the butler, who looked somewhat surprised to be sent from the room.</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d Jasper crossed one ankle over the opposite knee. \u201cNow, I\u2019m hoping you know what kind of mischief my wife used to get up to as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Vale!\u201d Melisande exclaimed.</p><p>He looked at her. Her cheeks were pink, and her eyes were wide in irritation. She was quite lovely, in fact.</p><p>He tilted his head toward her. \u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips.</p><p>His eyes dropped to her mouth and then rose again to meet her own. \u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, vulnerable and a little tremulous, and he thanked God that the skirts of his coat covered his groin.</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And at that moment, he knew he was lost. Lost aady lost. nd blind and going down for the third time without any hope of salvation, and he didn\u2019t give a damn. He would give anything to unravel this woman. He wanted to search out her innermost secrets and bare her soul. And when he knew her secrets, knew what she kept hidden away in her heart, he would guard it and her with his life.</p><p>She was his, to protect and to hold.</p><p>IT WAS WELL past midnight by the time Melisande heard Vale return home that night. She\u2019d been dozing in her own room, but the muted voices in the hall brought her to full wakefulness. After all, she\u2019d been waiting for his return. She sat up in excited anticipation, and Mouse stuck his black nose out from under the covers. He yawned, his pink tongue curling up.</p><p>She tapped his nose. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>She rose and reached for the wrapper laid out in the chair beside her bed. It was a deep violet color, shaped almost like a man\u2019s banyan and without the usual feminine frills and ribbons. Melisande pulled it on over her fine lawn chemise and shivered from the sensuous weight. It was of heavy satin, overembroidered in fine crimson thread. As she moved, the fabric subtly changed color from violet to crimson and back again. She crossed to her dresser and dabbed scent at her throat, trembling as the cold liquid slid between her breasts. The scent of bitter oranges rose in the air.</p><p>Thus armored, she went to the connecting door and pulled it open. The rooms beyond were Vale\u2019s, and she\u2019d never ventured into his domain. She looked about curiously. The first thing she saw was the enormous black wood bed, draped in linens of such a dark red it was almost black. The second thing she noticed was Mr. Pynch. Vale\u2019s man had straightened away from the banyan he\u2019d laid on the bed and now stood, huge and immobile, in the middle of the room.</p><p>Melisande had never actually spoken to the valet. She leveled her chin and looked him in the eye. \u201cThat will be all.\u201d</p><p>The valet didn\u2019t move. \u201cMy lord will need me to undress him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The valet\u2019s eyes sparked with something that might\u2019ve been amusement. Then he bowed and glided from the room.</p><p>Melisande felt a knot between her shoulder blades loosen in relief. The first obstacle passed. Vale may\u2019ve surprised her this morning, but tonight she planned to turn the tables on him.</p><p>She glanced around the room, noting the fire blazing in the hearth and the abundance of lit candles. The room was almost as bright as day. Her brows rose a little at the expense, and she strolled the room, pinching out a few of the tapers until only a soft glow lit the room. The scent of candle wax and smoke drifted in the air, but under them was another, more exciting scent. Melisande closed her eyes and inhaled. Vale. Whether she imagined it or not, the scent of her husband was in the room: sandalwood and lemons, brandy and smoke.</p><p>She was trying to calm her nerves when the door opened. Vale walked in, already shrugging out of his coat.</p><p>\u201cHave you sent for hot water?\u201d he asked, throwing the coat into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYesnt&gt;</p><p>He whirled at the sound of her voice, his face oddly expressionless, his eyes narrowed. If she were not a very, very brave woman, she would\u2019ve stepped back from him. He was so large and stood so still and grim, staring at her.</p><p>But then he smiled. \u201cMy lady wife. Forgive me, but I didn\u2019t expect you here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely, not trusting her voice. A queer shivering excitement gripped her, and she knew she must control herself so that her emotions might not burst forth.</p><p>He crossed to the dressing room and glanced in. \u201cIs Pynch here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then closed the dressing room door.</p><p>Sprat entered the open door, carrying a large steaming pitcher. He was trailed by a maid bearing a silver tray of bread, cheese, and fruit.</p><p>The servants set down their burdens, and Sprat looked at Melisande. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat will be all.\u201d</p><p>They trooped from the room, and then there was silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vale looked from the tray of food to her. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d found out easily enough from the servants that he habitually ate a light snack when he returned in the evenings. She shrugged and glided to him. \u201cI do not mean to disturb your schedule.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s, ah . . .\u201d</p><p>He seemed to lose his train of thought, possibly because she\u2019d started unbuttoning his waistcoat. She concentrated on the brass buttons and the slitted holes, aware that her breathing had quickened with the temptation of his proximity. This close she could feel his warmth through the layers of his clothes. An awful thought intruded: how many other women had had the privilege of undressing him?</p> <p>She looked up, meeting his turquoise blue eyes. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cUh, kind of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d She raised her brows and returned her gaze to the buttons. Had he been with another woman tonight? He was a man of known appetites, and she was unable to fulfill them at the moment. Was it enough to make him look elsewhere? She slipped the last one through the hole and glanced up. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He raised his arms, allowing her to slide the garment from his shoulders. She was aware of his intent gaze as she untied his neck cloth. His breath stirred her hair, and she could smell wine. She had no idea where he went in the evenings. Presumably he was out doing gentlemanly things\u2014gambling, drinking, and perhaps wenching. Her fingers fumbled on that last thought, and she finally identified the emotion flooding her brain: jealousy. She was completely unprepared for it. She\u2019d known before they\u2019d married who he was\u2014what he was. She had believed she would be content with whatever small part of himself he could share with her. The other women, when they came, she would simply ignore.</p><p>But now she fodthut now und she couldn\u2019t. She wanted him. All of him.</p> <p>She laid aside his neck cloth and started unbuttoning his shirt. The warmth of his skin seeped through the thin cloth and surrounded her fingers. The scent of his skin was hot and masculine. She breathed in through her nose, discreetly sniffing. He smelled of sandalwood and lemon soap.</p><p>Above her, his voice rumbled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>With the last button unfastened, he bowed and she pulled the shirt over his shoulders and head. He straightened and for a moment, she forgot how to breathe. He was a tall man\u2014even at her height, her head came only to his chin\u2014and his chest and shoulders were in proportion to his height. Broad and almost bony. With his shirt on, one might think him skinny. With it off, it was impossible to make that mistake. Long, lean muscle corded his arms and shoulders. She knew he rode almost every day, and she must approve of the exercise, if this was the result. He had a light sprinkling of body hair on his upper chest that broke over his abdomen and started again low on his belly. That thin line of hair leading from his navel was the most erotic thing she\u2019d ever seen. She had a desperate urge to touch it, to trail her fingers down that line until it disappeared into his breeches.</p><p>She pulled her gaze away and glanced up. He was watching her, his cheeks lined and hollowed. So often his face seemed almost comical, but right now there was no trace of laughter. His lips had a cruel edge.</p><p>She inhaled and gestured to the chair behind him. \u201cPlease. Sit.\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows shot up, and he looked from the pitcher of hot water to her as he sat. \u201cDo you mean to play barber as well?\u201d</p><p>She soaked a cloth in the hot water. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p><p>He eyed her, and she had to master the twitch of her lips as she laid the cloth against his jaw. She\u2019d found out from Sprat that Vale liked to shave and bathe in the evenings. It was perhaps too soon to help him with his bath, but shaving she could do. When her father had been bedridden in his final illness, she was the only one he\u2019d let near with the razor. Odd, since he\u2019d never been particularly affectionate with her.</p><p>She went to the chest of drawers where Pynch had laid out the shaving implements and picked up the razor. She tested the edge with her thumb. \u201cYou seemed quite entertained by my aunt\u2019s stories about me this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She watched him as she strolled back to his chair, the razor held casually in her fingers. His eyes glinted with amusement over the white cloth.</p><p>He peeled the cloth from his face and tossed it to the table. \u201cI particularly enjoyed the story of how you cut off all your hair at the age of four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d She set the razor on the table and picked up a small cloth. She dipped it in a pot of soft soap and began rubbing it on his face, working up a lather. The scent of lemons and sandalwood filled the room.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He closed his eyes and tilted back his head like a great cat being stroked. \u201cAnd the one about the ink.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;\"&gt;She\u2019d drawn pictures on her arms with ink and had looked tattooed for a month.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to have provided a source of amusement,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>One bright blue eye opened warily.</p><p>She smiled and laid the razor against his neck. She raised her eyes to meet his.\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered where you go in the evenings.\u201d</p><p>He opened his lips. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>She touched his lips with her finger, feeling his breath against her skin. \u201cAh. Ah. You don\u2019t want me to cut you, do you?\u201d</p><p>He closed his mouth, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>She made the first careful stroke. The rasp was loud in the room. She flicked the lather from the blade with a practiced movement and reapplied the razor. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered if you see females when you go out.\u201d</p><p>He started to answer, but she gently tilted his head back and stroked along his jaw. She could see him swallow, his Adam\u2019s apple dipping in his strong neck, but the look in his eyes told her he wasn\u2019t afraid. Far from it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go anywhere special,\u201d he drawled as she wiped the blade. \u201cBalls, soirees, various events. You could accompany me, you know. I believe I asked to escort you to Lady Graham\u2019s masked ball tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d His reply gave a little relief to the burning jealousy in her breast. She concentrated on his chin. So many indentations just waiting to be nicked. She had a dislike of social events where one was expected to make small talk. To smile and flirt and always have a witty reply on the tip of one\u2019s tongue. That kind of light discourse had never been her forte, and she was resigned to the fact that it never would be. When he\u2019d mentioned the ball, she hadn\u2019t even thought before making an excuse not to attend.</p><p>\u201cYou could come with me at night,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAttend some of the social events.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands. \u201cOr you could stay here with me at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The corner of his mouth curved in a sad, self-mocking smile. \u201cI fear I am too capricious a creature to be amused for long by evenings by the fire at home. I need chatter and people and loud laughter.\u201d</p><p>Everything she hated, in fact. She swished the razor in the hot water.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see other women when I go out at night, sweet wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She met his eyes as she stroked the razor delicately down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He held her gaze. It was strong and steady.</p><p>She swallowed and lifted the razor. His cheeks were perfectly smooth now. Only a thin line of soap lingered by the corner of his mouth. She carefully smudged it away with her thumb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said, her voice husky. She leaned close, her lips hovering over his wide mouth. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Heof t size=r lips met his in a whispered kiss. She felt his arms rise to grasp her, but she\u2019d already slipped away.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Now, the princess of this wonderful city was named Surcease, and while Princess Surcease was beautiful beyond a man\u2019s dreams, with eyes as bright as stars and skin as smooth as silk, she was a haughty woman and had not found a man she would consent to marry. One man was too old, another too young. Some talked too loudly, and quite a few chewed with their mouths agape. As the princess neared her twenty-first birthday, the king, her father, lost patience. So he proclaimed that there would be a series of trials held in honor of the princess\u2019s natal day and that the man who won them would also win her hand in marriage. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>After the scene the night before, Melisande had been rather disappointed this morning when she\u2019d breakfasted alone. Vale had already left the house on some vague male business, and she\u2019d resigned herself to go about her own affairs and not see him again until nightfall.</p><p>And so she had. She\u2019d conferred with both the housekeeper and Cook, had partaken of a light luncheon and done a little bit of shopping, and then she\u2019d arrived at her mother-in-law\u2019s garden party. Where all her expectations had been overthrown.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe my son has ever attended one of my afternoon salons,\u201d the dowager Viscountess of Vale mused now. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that it is your influence that has drawn him here. Did you know he would attend this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Melisande shook her head. Her mind was still assimilating the fact that her husband had come to a sedate and boring garden party. This simply couldn\u2019t be one of his usual rounds, and that thought had her rather breathless with anticipation, though she was doing her best to keep a calm face.</p><p>She and her mother-in-law sat in the dowager\u2019s large town garden, which was in its full midsummer glory. The elder Lady Vale had had small tables and numerous chairs scattered about on her slate terrace so that her guests could enjoy the summer day. They sat or strolled in small groups, the majority of them well into their sixth decade or older.</p><p>Vale stood across the terrace with a group of three older gentlemen. Melisande watched as her husband threw his head back and laughed at something one of the gentlemen said. His throat was strong and corded, and something in her heart clenched at the sight. In a thousand years, she would never grow bored of watching him when he laughed so uninhibitedly.</p><p>She hastily glanced away so she wouldn\u2019t be caught making cow\u2019s eyes at him. \u201cYour garden is lovely, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cIt should be, considering the army of gardeners I employ.\u201d</p><p>Melisande hid a smile behind her teacup. She\u2019d found before her marriage that she greatly liked Vale\u2019s mother. The dowager countess was a petite lady. Her son looked like a giant when he stood next to her. Nonetheless, she seemed to have no problem in setting him or any other gentleman down with merely a poDid\u201einted stare. Lady Vale wore her softly graying hair pulled into a simple knot at the crown of her head. Her face was round and feminine and not at all like her son\u2019s, until one came to her eyes\u2014they were a sparkling turquoise. She\u2019d been a beauty in her youth and still had the confidence of a very handsome woman.</p><p>Lady Vale eyed the pretty pink and white pastries that sat on a dainty plate on the table between them. She leaned a little forward, and Melisande thought she might take a cake, but then the elder lady looked away.</p><p>\u201cI was so glad when Jasper chose to marry you instead of Miss Templeton,\u201d Lady Vale said. \u201cThe girl was pretty but overly flighty. She hadn\u2019t the temper to keep my son in hand. He would\u2019ve been bored with her within the month.\u201d The dowager countess lowered her voice confidentially. \u201cI think he was enamored of her bosom.\u201d</p><p>Melisande checked an impulse to glance at her own small chest.</p><p>Lady Vale patted her hand and said somewhat obscurely, \u201cDon\u2019t let it worry you. Bosoms never last. Intelligent conversation does, though the majority of gentlemen don\u2019t seem to realize it.\u201d</p><p>Melisande blinked, trying to think of a reply. Although perhaps one wasn\u2019t needed.</p><p>Lady Vale reached for a cake and then seemed to change her mind again, picking up her teacup instead. \u201cDid you know that Miss Templeton\u2019s father has given his permission for her to marry that curate?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melisande shook her head. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d</p><p>The dowager countess set her teacup down without sipping from it. \u201cPoor man. She\u2019ll ruin his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not.\u201d Melisande was distracted by Vale taking leave of the group of gentlemen and sauntering in their direction.</p><p>\u201cMark my words, she will.\u201d The countess suddenly darted out a hand and snatched a pink cake from the plate. She set it on her dish and glared at it a moment before looking at Melisande. \u201cMy son needs warmth, but not gentleness. He hasn\u2019t been the same since he returned from the Colonies.\u201d</p> <p>Melisande had only a moment to register these words before Vale was upon them.</p><p>\u201cLady wife and lady mother, good afternoon.\u201d He bowed with a flourish and addressed his mother. \u201cMight I steal my wife for a stroll about your lovely gardens? I had a mind to show her the irises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why since the irises have stopped blooming,\u201d his mother replied tartly. She inclined her head. \u201cBut go. I think I\u2019ll ask Lord Kensington what he knows about the palace scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are kindness personified, ma\u2019am.\u201d Vale proffered his elbow to Melisande.</p><p>She rose as her mother-in-law muttered, \u201cOh, pish\u201d behind them.</p> <p>Melisande\u2019s lips curved as Vale guided them toward a pea-gravel path. \u201cYour mother thinks I\u2019ve saved you from a terrible fate in a marriage to Miss Templeton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bow to my mater\u2019s wonderful common sense,\u201d Vale said cheerfully. \u201cCan\u2019t think what I saw in Miss Templeton in the first C in\u201cI place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother says it may\u2019ve been the lady\u2019s bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She felt him look at her, though she kept her gaze on the path ahead. \u201cWe men are pitiful creatures made of clay, I\u2019m afraid, easily distracted and led astray. A lush bosom may have indeed fogged my innate intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She remembered the parade of women who had been his lovers. Had they all had lush bosoms as well?</p><p>He leaned toward her, his breath brushing her ear, making her shiver. \u201cI would not be the first to mistake quantity for quality and reach for a large, sugary cake, when a neat, small bun was in reality more to my taste.\u201d</p> <p>She tilted her head to glance at him. His eyes were sparkling, and a smile played around his mobile lips. She had trouble maintaining a stern expression. \u201cDid you just compare my form to a baked good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA neat and delectable baked good,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou should take it as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face away to hide her smile. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><p>They turned a corner, and he abruptly pulled her to a stop in front of a clump of greenery. \u201cBehold. My mother\u2019s irises, no longer in bloom.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the plant\u2019s lobed leaves. \u201cThat\u2019s a peony. Those\u201d\u2014she pointed to some plants with sword-shaped leaves farther down the path\u2014\u201care irises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Are you sure? How can you tell without the flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the shape of the leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing. It\u2019s almost like divination.\u201d He stared first at the peony and then the irises. \u201cDon\u2019t look like much without the flowers, do they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mother did say they weren\u2019t in bloom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he murmured, and turned them down a new path. \u201cWhat other talents have you hidden from me? Do you sing like a lark? I\u2019ve always wanted to marry a girl who could sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve asked about it before we wed,\u201d she said practically. \u201cMy voice is only fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA disappointment I shall have to bear with fortitude.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and wondered what he was about. He sought her out, almost as if he were courting her. The thought was disconcerting. Why court a wife? Perhaps she was seeing more than was there, and the possibility frightened her. If she hoped, if she let herself believe he actually might want her, then the fall when he turned away again would be even more terrible.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you can dance,\u201d he was saying. \u201cCan you dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am reassured. What about the pianoforte? Can you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very well, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dreams of evening musicales by the fireplace are crushed. I\u2019 Cre heive seen your embroidery, and that\u2019s quite fine. Do you draw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd paint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d come to a bench at a turn in the path, and he carefully dusted the seat with a cloth from his pocket before gesturing for her to sit.</p><p>She sat slowly, marshalling her defenses. A rose arbor shielded the seat, and she watched as he broke off a blossom.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d He\u2019d pricked himself on a thorn and stuck his thumb in his mouth.</p><p>She looked away from the sight of his lips around the digit and swallowed. \u201cServes you right for mangling your mother\u2019s roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said, too close. He\u2019d braced a hand on the seat and leaned down to her. She caught the scent of sandalwood. \u201cThe prick of the thorns only makes attaining the rose that much more gratifying.\u201d</p><p>She turned and his face was only inches from hers, his eyes a strange tropical color that never occurred naturally in England. She thought she saw sadness lurking in their depths. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked idly. He brushed the rose against her cheek, the softness of the petals sending a shudder down her spine.</p><p>She caught his hand, hard and warm beneath her fingertips. \u201cThis. You act as if you\u2019re wooing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d He was very still, his lips only inches from hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already your wife. There\u2019s no need to woo me,\u201d she whispered, and couldn\u2019t keep the plea from her voice.</p><p>He moved his hand easily, though she still had her fingers wrapped about his. The rose drifted across her parted lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think there\u2019s every need,\u201d he said.</p><p>HER MOUTH WAS the exact same shade as the rose.</p><p>Jasper watched as the petals brushed against her lips. So soft, so sweet. He wanted to feel that mouth beneath his own again. Wanted to part it and invade it, marking it as his own. Five days, she\u2019d said, which left another still to go. He\u2019d have to practice patience.</p><p>Her cheeks were flushed a delicate pink, her eyes wide above the rose, but as he watched, they lost focus, and her lids began to drift down. She was so sensitive, so responsive to the smallest of stimuli. He wondered if he could make her come simply by kissing her. The thought quickened his breath. Last night had been a revelation to him. The luscious creature who\u2019d invaded his room and taken charge was every man\u2019s erotic dream. Where had she learned such sensuous wiles? She\u2019d been like quicksilver\u2014mysterious, exotic, slipping away from him when he\u2019d tried to grasp her.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d never noticed her before that day in the vestry. He was a stupid, blind fool, and he thanked God for it. Because if he was a fool, then so were all the other men who\u2019d passed her by at innumerable balls and soirees and never taken the time to look. C tifoo None of them had noticed her either, and now she was his.</p><p>His alone to bed.</p><p>He had to fight to keep his smile from turning wolfish. Who would\u2019ve thought chasing one\u2019s own wife would be so arousing? \u201cI have every right to woo you, to court you. After all, we had no time before we were married. Why not do it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother at all?\u201d she asked. Her voice sounded dazed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He teased her mouth again with the rose, watching as the flower pulled down her lower lip, revealing the moist inner skin. His groin tightened at the sight. \u201cShould not a husband know his wife, cherish and possess her?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered up at the word possess. \u201cDo you possess me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do legally,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I do spiritually. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t.\u201d He pulled back the flower to let her speak, and her tongue touched her bottom lip where it had been. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you ever will.\u201d</p><p>Her frank gaze was a challenge.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPerhaps not, but that won\u2019t stop me from trying.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed his thumb across her mouth. \u201cWhat other talents have you not told me of, my fair wife? What secrets do you keep hidden from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no secrets.\u201d Her lips brushed his thumb like a kiss as she spoke. \u201cIf you look, you\u2019ll not find any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAnd I wonder why.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids dropped, veiling her gaze. He felt the moist heat of her tongue against his thumb.</p><p>He caught his breath. \u201cWere you found, fully formed, in some ancient spot? I fancy you as one of the fey, strange and wild, and completely enticing to a human male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was a simple Englishman. He would\u2019ve scoffed at the thought of fairies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was from Prussia and even more pragmatic than he.\u201d She sighed softly, her breath brushing his flesh. \u201cI am no romantic maiden. Just a plain Englishwoman.\u201d</p><p>He very much doubted that.</p><p>He took his hand away, caressing her cheek as it left. \u201cDid you grow up in London or in the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe country, mostly, though we came to London to visit at least yearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you have playmates? Sweet girls to whisper and giggle with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmeline.\u201d Her eyes met his, and there was a vulnerability there.</p><p>Emeline lived in the American Colonies now. \u201cYou miss her.\u201d</p><p>Eont size=\"3\"&gt;\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He brought the rose up to absently brush her bare neck as he tried to remember details of Emeline\u2019s childhood. \u201cBut you did not know her until you were nearly out of the schoolroom, yes? My family estates adjoin hers, and I have known both her and her brother, Reynaud, since the nursery. I would\u2019ve remembered you had you been with Emeline then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d Her eyes flashed with anger, but she continued before he could make a defense. \u201cI met Emeline when I came to visit a friend in the area. I was fourteen or fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd before that? Who did you play with? Your brothers?\u201d He watched as the rose brushed her collarbone, then moved lower.</p><p>She shrugged. The rose must tickle, but she didn\u2019t bat it away. \u201cMy brothers are older than I. They were both away at school when I was in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were alone.\u201d He held her gaze as the rose dipped between the upper curve of her breasts.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI had a nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same as a playmate,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>When she inhaled, her breasts pressed a little against the rose. O, fortunate flower!</p><p>\u201cYou were a quiet child,\u201d he said, because he knew it must be true.</p><p>Even with the stories he\u2019d heard yesterday from her aunt, he knew in the main that she would\u2019ve been a quiet child. A nearly silent child. She held herself contained. Her limbs under strict control, her body small and neat, even though she wasn\u2019t a little woman. Her voice was always well modulated, and she stayed at the back of gatherings. What childhood had made her so determined not to be noticed?</p><p>He leaned closer to her, and even though the sweet scent of roses surrounded them, he smelled spicy oranges. Her scent. \u201cYou were a child who kept her inner thoughts secret from the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut I want to know you. I want to learn you until the workings of your mind are as familiar to me as I am to myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She drew in her breath, pulling back almost as if in fear. \u201cI will not become\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he laid a finger against her lips and then quickly straightened away again. He could hear voices on the path they\u2019d just come from. A moment more and another couple rounded the corner.</p><p>\u201cPardon,\u201d the gentleman said, and at the same time Jasper realized it was Matthew Horn. \u201cVale. I had not thought to meet you here.\u201d</p><p>Jasper bowed with irony. \u201cI have always found it instructive to walk my mother\u2019s gardens. Just this afternoon, I have been able to teach my wife the difference between a peony plant and an iris.\u201d</p> <p>A sound that might have been a muffled snort came from behind him.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIs this your wife, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jasper turned and met Melisande\u2019s secretive brown eyes. \u201cMy heart, may I present Mr. Matthew Horn, a former officer in the 28th Regiment like myself. Horn, my wife, Lady Vale.\u201d</p><p>Melisande held out her hand, and Matthew took it and bent over it. All quite proper, of course, but Jasper still felt an instinctive need to lay his hand on Melisande\u2019s shoulder as if to claim ownership.</p><p>Matthew stepped back. \u201cMay I present Miss Beatrice Corning. Miss Corning, Lord and Lady Vale.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper bent over the pretty chit\u2019s hand, suppressing a smile. Matthew\u2019s presence at the salon was explained, and his motives were similar to Jasper\u2019s. He was in pursuit of the lady.</p><p>\u201cDo you make your home in London, Miss Corning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI usually live in the country with my uncle. I think you must know him, for we are neighbors of yours, I believe. He is the Earl of Blanchard.\u201d</p><p>The girl said something else, but Jasper lost it. Blanchard had been Reynaud\u2019s title, the one he should\u2019ve inherited on his father\u2019s death. Except Reynaud had been dead by then. Captured and killed by the Indians after Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>Jasper focused on the girl\u2019s face, really looking at her for the first time. She was chatting with Melisande, her countenance open and frank. She had a fresh, country appearance, her hair the color of ripened wheat, her eyes a contented gray. Tiny sandy freckles dotted her upper cheeks. She had no title herself, but Matthew was still reaching high if he thought to court the niece of an earl. The Horns were an old family but not titled. Whereas the Blanchard name went back centuries, and the earldom\u2019s seat was a sprawling feudal mansion. The girl had said she lived in that mansion.</p><p>In Reynaud\u2019s home.</p> <p>Jasper felt his chest tighten, and he looked away from Miss Corning\u2019s expressive face. No use to blame this girl. She would\u2019ve been in the schoolroom six years ago when Reynaud died on a fiery cross. It wasn\u2019t her fault that her uncle had inherited the title. Or that she now lived on the estate that had been Reynaud\u2019s birthright. Still, he could not bear to look her in the face.</p><p>He held out his arm to Melisande and interrupted the conversation. \u201cCome. We have an afternoon engagement, I believe.\u201d</p><p>He bowed to Matthew and Miss Corning as they made their farewells. He didn\u2019t look at Melisande, but he was aware that she watched him curiously, even as she laid her hand on his arm. She knew there was no afternoon engagement. It occurred to him\u2014finally, belatedly\u2014that in searching out her secrets, he ran the risk of revealing his own, far darker ones. That, simply, must never happen.</p><p>Jasper covered her hand with his. It was a gesture that appeared husbandly, when in reality it was instinctive. An urge to capture and keep her from fleeing. He couldn\u2019t tell her about Reynaud and what had happened in the dark woods of America, couldn\u2019t tell her how his soul had been fractured there, couldn\u2019t tell her of his greatest failure and his greatest grief. But he could hold her and keep her.</p><p>And he would.</p><p>\u201c. . . AND DIDN\u2019T HE look right gormless, his arse hangin\u2019 out for all to see?\u201d Mrs. Moore, Lord Vale\u2019s housekeeper, finished her tale by slapping the kitchen table with a loud thump.</p><p>The three upstairs maids collapsed together in a heap of giggles, the two footmen at the end of the table nudged each other, Mr. Oaks gave a deep bass chuckle, and even Cook, whose face normally wore a pinched expression, let a smile show.</p><p>Sally Suchlike grinned. Lord Vale\u2019s household was a real change from Mr. Fleming\u2019s. There were more than twice as many servants, but under the guidance of Mr. Oaks and Mrs. Moore, they were more friendly, almost like a family. Within a couple of days of starting here, Sally had made friends with both Mrs. Moore and Cook\u2014who was a shy woman under that stern demeanor\u2014and her fears of not being liked, not being accepted, were put to rest.</p> <p>Sally leaned over her cooling tea. Lord and Lady Vale had already taken their dinner, and it was the servants\u2019 dinnertime now. \u201cAn\u2019 what happened then, Mrs. Moore, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d that lady began, obviously quite pleased to be asked to continue her ribald tale.</p><p>But she was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Pynch. Immediately, Mr. Oaks sobered, the footmen straightened in their seats, one of the upstairs maids giggled nervously\u2014a sound shushed by her neighbor\u2014and Mrs. Moore blushed. Sally let out a sigh of frustration. Mr. Pynch was like a bucket of muddy Thames river water thrown over everyone: cold and unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you, Mr. Pynch?\u201d the butler asked.</p><p>\u201cThank you, no,\u201d Mr. Pynch said. \u201cI\u2019ve come for Miss Suchlike. She\u2019s wanted by the mistress.\u201d</p><p>His wooden tones produced another giggle from the upstairs maid. Her name was Gussy, and she was the sort to giggle at nearly anything. Her little giggle stopped on a gasp, though, when Mr. Pynch turned his cold green gaze on her.</p><p>Bully, Sally thought. She pushed back from the long kitchen table and rose. \u201cWell, I thank you, Mrs. Moore, for a most delightful story.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Moore blinked and a pleased flush lit her cheeks.</p><p>Sally smiled at the people around the table before hurrying in Mr. Pynch\u2019s footsteps. He, of course, hadn\u2019t waited for her leave-taking.</p><p>She caught up with him on a turn on the back stairs. \u201cWhy do you have to be so nasty?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pause in his climb. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you refer to, Miss Suchlike.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes as she panted in his wake. \u201cYou hardly ever eat with the rest of the servants, and when you do make an appearance, you flatten the talk like a horse sitting on a cat.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached a landing, and he stopped so suddenly that she ran into his back and nearly lost her balance on the stairs.</p><p>He turned and grasped her arm without any sign of confusion. \u201cYou h Cfusghtave a colorful turn of phrase, Miss Suchlike, but I believe it is you who are overly familiar with the other servants.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her arm and continued his climb.</p><p>Sally had to suppress an urge to stick out her tongue at his broad back. Sadly, Mr. Pynch was correct. As a lady\u2019s maid, she should be placing herself above all the other servants save Mr. Oaks and Mrs. Moore. Probably she, too, should disdain their jolly meals and turn up her nose at their laughter. Except that would leave her with hardly anyone to talk to below stairs. Mr. Pynch might be content to lead the life of a hermit, but she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt you to be friendly at least,\u201d she muttered as they reached the hallway outside the master bedrooms.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMiss Suchlike, a young girl like yourself can hardly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so young as all that,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stopped again, and she saw amusement on his face. Considering how wooden he usually looked, he might as well be laughing at her.</p><p>She set her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019ll be twenty next birthday.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched.</p><p>She scowled. \u201cAnd how old are you, Grandfather?\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow, which was a very irritating thing to do. \u201cTwo and thirty.\u201d</p><p>She staggered back, pretending shock. \u201cOh, my goodness! It\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re still standing, a man your age.\u201d</p><p>He merely shook his head at her antics. \u201cSee to your mistress, little girl.\u201d</p><p>She gave up suppressing the urge and stuck out her tongue before fleeing into Lady Vale\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>MELISANDE HID HER trembling hands in the fullness of her skirts as she entered Lady Graham\u2019s masked ball that night. It had taken all her courage to come. As it was, the decision to attend had been last minute\u2014if she\u2019d thought of it longer, she would\u2019ve talked herself out of it. She loathed these types of entertainments. They were filled with tight knots of people, gossiping and staring, and always seeming to exclude her. But this was Vale\u2019s own ground. She needed to confront him in just such a venue as this if she was to show him that she could be a fitting replacement for his parade of paramours.</p><p>She rubbed her skirt between nervous fingers and tried to steady her breathing. She was a little helped by the fact that it was a masquerade ball. She wore a velvet demimask that was so purple it was nearly black. It didn\u2019t hide her identity\u2014that wasn\u2019t its purpose, after all\u2014but it still gave her a small measure of confidence. Melisande took a fortifying breath and looked about. Around her, masked ladies and gentlemen laughed and shouted, all of them confident in the knowledge that they were here to see and be seen. Some wore dominoes, but many ladies had decided to wear colorful ball gowns and rely only on a demimask for their disguise.</p><p>She was enveloped in a domino of purple silk, and she drew the folds around herself as she moved through the crowds, looking for Vale. She hadn\u2019t see CSheinon him since the garden party that afternoon. They\u2019d parted ways when they\u2019d left the party\u2014he on his horse, she in the carriage. From subtle questioning of Mr. Pynch, she knew her husband was wearing a black domino, but then so were half the men in the room. A lady moved past her, jostling her shoulder. The other woman glanced back at her dismissively.</p><p>For a moment, Melisande fought down an urge to flee. To abandon the room and this night\u2019s purpose and seek the shelter of her waiting carriage. But if Vale could brave a crowd of elderly ladies to stalk her at a garden party in the afternoon, then by God she could brave the terrors of a ballroom to hunt him by night.</p><p>She heard his laugh then. Turning, she saw him. Vale stood nearly a head taller than those around him. He was surrounded by smiling men and one or two giggling ladies. They were all beautiful, all entirely sure of themselves and their place in the world. Who was she to try inserting herself in this group? Would they not take one look at her and laugh?</p><p>She was on the point of turning away and seeking the sanctuary of the waiting carriage when the lady to Vale\u2019s left, a beautiful yellow-haired woman with rouged cheeks and a large bosom, laid a hand on his sleeve. It was Mrs. Redd, Jasper\u2019s onetime mistress.</p><p>This was her husband, her love. Melisande folded her fingers into a fist and sailed toward the group.</p><p>When she was still several yards away, Vale looked in her direction and stilled. She met his eyes, gleaming blue behind a black satin demimask, and held his gaze as she walked toward him. The people around them seemed to step back, parting as she approached, until she stood directly in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIs this not your dance?\u201d she asked, her voice husky from nervousness.</p><p>\u201cMy lady wife.\u201d He bowed. \u201cYour pardon for my unforgivable forgetfulness.\u201d</p><p>She took the arm he offered her, triumphant that he\u2019d left the other woman so easily. He led her silently through the throng. She felt his muscles shift beneath the fabric of coat and domino, and her breath came short. Then they were on the dance floor and taking their respective places. He bowed. She curtsied. They paced toward each other and then apart, his eyes never leaving her face.</p><p>When the movement next brought them close, he murmured, \u201cI had not hoped to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She raised her eyebrows behind her mask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou seem to favor the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>The dance took them apart while she thought on that odd statement. When they drew close again, she laid her palm against his as they paced in a semicircle. \u201cPerhaps you mistake habit for love.\u201d</p><p>His eyes seemed to spark behind his mask. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cMy usual social rounds are in the day; yours are in the night\u2014but this does not mean that you love the night and I the day.\u201d</p><p>A line appeared between his brows.</p><p>\u201cPerh Csizsizaps,\u201d she whispered as they moved apart again, \u201cyou play in the night because that is what you\u2019re used to. Perhaps you actually prefer the day.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head in query as they paced together. \u201cAnd you, my sweet wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps my domain is really the night.\u201d</p> <p>They parted and glided away. She moved through the figures of the dance until they came together again, the touch of his hand on hers sending a thrill through her.</p><p>He smiled as if he knew what his touch did to her. \u201cWhat would you do with me, then, my mistress of the night?\u201d They paced around each other, only the fingertips of their hands touching. \u201cWill you lead me? Taunt me? Teach me about the night?\u201d</p><p>They separated and dipped. She watched him the entire time. His eyes glinted with green and blue lights. They advanced, and he bent his head to her ear, their bodies not touching at all. \u201cTell me, madam, will you dare to seduce a sinner such as I?\u201d</p><p>Her breath was coming fast, her heart fluttering in her chest, alive with excitement, but her face was serene. \u201cIs that really the question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat question do you prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you allow yourself to be seduced by me?\u201d</p> <p>They halted as the dance concluded and the music died away. Her eyes on his, Melisande sank into a curtsy. She rose, her gaze still locked with her husband\u2019s.</p><p>He took her hand and bent over the knuckles, murmuring as he kissed her hand, \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>He guided her from the dance floor, and they were immediately surrounded.</p><p>A gentleman in a scarlet domino pressed into Melisande\u2019s side. \u201cWho is this delectable creature, Vale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife,\u201d Vale said lightly as he adroitly maneuvered Melisande to his other side, \u201cand I\u2019ll thank you not to forget it, Fowler.\u201d</p><p>Fowler laughed drunkenly, and someone else shouted a quip that Vale responded to easily, but Melisande couldn\u2019t hear the words. She was too conscious of the press of hot bodies, of the leer of unkind eyes. Mrs. Redd had disappeared\u2014for good, she hoped. She\u2019d found Vale and danced with him, and now only wished to go home.</p><p>But he was guiding her farther into the crowd, his hand firm and strong on her elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, my lord?\u201d Melisande asked.</p> <p>\u201cI thought . . .\u201d He glanced at her distractedly. \u201cLord Hasselthorpe just came in, and I had some business to discuss with him. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the knot of gentlemen standing by the entrance to the ballroom. They were a noticeably more somber group than the one Vale had been with earlier.</p><p>\u201cHasselthorpe! How fortuitous to meet you here,\u201d Vale called.</p><p>Lord Hasselthorpe turned, and even Melisande could see his confusion. But Vale held out his hand, and the other man was forced to take it, eyeing him warily. Hasselthorpe was a nondescript man of medium height with heavy-lidded eyes and deep lines incising his cheeks about his mouth. His habitual expression was grave as befitted a leading member of Parliament. Beside him was the Duke of Lister, a tall, heavyset man in a gray wig. Hovering several paces away was a beautiful blond woman, Lister\u2019s longtime mistress, Mrs. Fitzwilliam. She didn\u2019t look to be enjoying the ball, standing all by herself.</p><p>\u201cVale,\u201d Hasselthorpe said slowly. \u201cAnd is this your lovely wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Vale said. \u201cI believe you met my viscountess at your house party last fall?\u201d</p><p>Hasselthorpe murmured an assent as he bowed over Melisande\u2019s hand. He hadn\u2019t taken his eyes from Vale\u2019s face, and indeed she might not\u2019ve been there at all. She looked at Vale as well and saw that he wasn\u2019t smiling. There was an undercurrent of something here that she couldn\u2019t quite place, but she knew one thing\u2014it was masculine business.</p><p>Melisande smiled and placed her hand on Vale\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI fear I\u2019ve grown weary, my lord. Will you be terribly disappointed if I retire home early?\u201d</p><p>He turned and she could see the conflict in his face, but then he darted a look at Lord Hasselthorpe and his expression smoothed. He bowed over her hand. \u201cTerribly, terribly disappointed, my heart, but I shall not detain you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, then, my lord.\u201d She curtsied to the gentlemen. \u201cYour grace. My lord.\u201d</p><p>The gentlemen bowed, murmuring their farewells.</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and whispered in Vale\u2019s ear, \u201cRemember, my lord: one more night.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned away. But as she made her way through the crowd, she heard two words from the group of huddled men behind her.</p><p>Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Well, you can imagine what happened upon the king\u2019s proclamation. Suitors began arriving in the little kingdom, traveling from the four corners of the world. Some were princes, high and low, with caravans of guards and courtiers and lackeys. Some were dispossessed knights, seeking their fortune, their armor battered from many tournaments. And a few even traveled on foot, beggars and thieves without much hope. But they all had one thing in common: they each believed they were the one who would win the trials and marry a beautiful princess royal. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>For a mistress of the night, his wife certainly rose early in the morning. Standing outside the newly appointed breakfast room, Jasper tried to shake the sleep from his frame. She\u2019d left the ball early the night before, but it\u2019d still been nearly an hour past midnight. How, then, could she be awake and, from the sound of it, already breaking her fast? He, in contrast, had stayed another hour or so, futilely trying to get Lord Hasselt Fhe horpe to listen. Hasselthorpe had found the whole idea of his brother\u2019s regiment being betrayed by a French spy preposterous, and he\u2019d been loud in his denial. Jasper had decided to wait several days before attempting to talk to the man again.</p><p>Now he widened his eyes in a last desperate attempt at seeming awake and entered the breakfast room. There she sat, her back ramrod straight, every hair carefully controlled into a simple knot at the crown of her head, her light brown eyes cool and composed.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cGood morning, my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>Watching her this morning, one would never guess at the mysterious woman in the purple domino from the night before. Perhaps he\u2019d dreamed that seductive vision. How else to explain the dichotomy of the two women living in one body?</p><p>She glanced at him, and he thought he saw a fleeting glimpse of his midnight mistress, lurking somewhere behind her serene gaze. She nodded. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Her little dog came out from beneath her skirts to cast a jaundiced eye on him. Jasper stared the animal down, and it retreated again under her chair. The dog obviously loathed him, but at least they\u2019d established which of them was master in this house.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d Jasper asked as he strolled to the side table.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied from behind him. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He stared blindly at the plate of fish staring blindly back at him and thought of his rude little pallet on the floor of his dressing room. \u201cLike the dead.\u201d</p><p>Which was correct, assuming the dead slept with a knife under their pillow and tossed all night long. He stabbed a fish and transferred it to the dish in his hand.</p><p>He smiled at Melisande as he neared the table. \u201cDo you have plans for the day?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at him. \u201cYes, but none that would interest you.\u201d</p><p>This statement had the natural effect of piquing his interest. He sat opposite her. \u201cOh, indeed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she poured him a cup of tea. \u201cSome shopping with my maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d</p><p>She peered at him skeptically. Perhaps his enthusiasm was overdone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to accompany me.\u201d It was a statement, her lips pressed together primly.</p><p>What would she say if she knew her censorious face only aroused him? She\u2019d be appalled, surely. But then Jasper recalled the seductive woman from the night before, the one who\u2019d whispered a bold challenge with unflinching eyes, and he wondered. Which was his true wife? The prim lady of the day or the adventuress of the night?</p><p>But she waited for his reply. He grinned. \u201cI can think of nothing more enjoyable than a morning of shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other man who would say the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re K\"&gt;\u201cy o lucky to be married to me, are you not?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer that but merely poured herself another cup of chocolate.</p><p>He broke open a bun and buttered a piece. \u201cIt was a delight to see you at the ball last night.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened almost imperceptibly. Was he not supposed to mention her nocturnal actions?</p><p>\u201cI had not met your friend Matthew Horn until yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you close?\u201d</p><p>Ah, then this was how it would be played. She would try to ignore her own nightly mechanisms. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cI knew Horn when I was in the army,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a good friend back then. We\u2019ve grown apart since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never speak of your time in the army.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was six years ago.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cHow long were you commissioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you held the rank of captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw action.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, and he didn\u2019t know if he should bother to answer. Action. Such a small word for the blood and sweat and screaming. The thundering of the cannons, the smoke and ashes, the corpses littering the field afterward. Action. Oh, yes, he\u2019d seen action.</p><p>He sipped his tea to wash the taste of acid from his mouth. \u201cI was at Quebec when we took the city. A tale I hope to someday tell our grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cBut that\u2019s not where Lord St. Aubyn died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled grimly. \u201cThink you this is a pleasant conversation for the breakfast table?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t back down from him. \u201cShould not a wife know about her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy time in the army is not everything I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think it is a fair part of you.\u201d</p><p>And what could he say to that? She was right. Somehow she knew, though he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d given any sign. She knew he was changed, forever scarred and diminished, by what had happened in the north woods of America. Did he wear it like a badge of the devil? Could she see what he was? Did she know somehow of his deepest shame?</p><p>No, she must not. If she knew, her face would hold contempt. He looked down as he broke apart the rest of his bun.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you no longer want to accompany me this morning?\u201d his wife asked softly.</p><p>He looked up at that. Sly creature. \u201cI don\u2019t scare that easily.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened a bit. Perhaps his smile had shown too much teeth. Perhaps she\u2019d seen Kps ighthe thing that lurked beneath. But she was brave, his wife.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d she said, \u201cabout the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell,\u201d he lied. \u201cI was a captain in the 28th.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Lord St. Aubyn\u2019s rank as well,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cYou bought your commissions together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So young, so thickheaded. He\u2019d been mostly interested in the dashing uniform. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never knew Emeline\u2019s brother,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cNot well, at least. I only saw him once or twice. What was he like?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the last of his bun, trying to buy time. He thought of Reynaud\u2019s crooked grin, his dark laughing eyes. \u201cReynaud always knew he would someday inherit the earldom, and he spent his life rehearsing for that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAs a boy, he was too serious. That burden of responsibility marks a man, even when he\u2019s but a child. Richard was the same way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour elder brother,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes. He and Reynaud were more alike.\u201d His mouth twisted at the old realization. \u201cReynaud should\u2019ve chosen him as a friend, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps Reynaud saw in you something that he himself lacked.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and smiled. The idea that he should possess a feature that Richard, his perfect elder brother, lacked seemed comical. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cYour joy of life?\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her. Did she really see joy of life in the shell that was all that remained of him? \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. You were a friend full of delight and mischief,\u201d she said, and then, almost to herself, \u201cHow could he resist you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d His teeth scraped together. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d She rose from the table. \u201cI think you\u2019d be surprised how much I know you. Ten minutes, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was caught flat-footed and blinking up at his wife like a fool.</p><p>She smiled. Maybe she had a love of fools. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready to go shopping in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>And she slipped from the breakfast room, leaving him confused and intrigued.</p><p>MELISANDE WAS STANDING by the carriage consulting with Suchlike when Vale emerged from the town house a short time later. He ran down the front steps and sauntered over.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Melisande asked.</p><p>He spread his arms. \u201cI am at your disposal, my lady wife.\u201d He nodded to Suchlike. \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p><p>The little maid flushed and looked worriedly at Melisande. Suchl Klisheiike usually came on these outings to consult with wardrobe selections and to carry packages. Vale was watching her, too, waiting to see if she\u2019d object.</p><p>Melisande smiled tightly and nodded at the maid. \u201cPerhaps you can do that mending.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike bobbed a curtsy and went into the town house.</p><p>When Melisande turned back to Vale, he was eyeing Mouse, who was standing against her skirts.</p> <p>She spoke before he could dismiss her dog as well. \u201cSir Mouse always accompanies me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, glad that at least was established, and mounted the steps to the carriage. She settled on the plush seat that faced the front, and Mouse hopped up beside her. Vale sat facing her, his long legs stretched diagonally across the floor. It had seemed like a large\u2014even huge\u2014vehicle until he entered, and then the space was filled with male elbows and knees.</p><p>He knocked on the roof and looked across at her, catching her frowning at his legs. \u201cAnything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She glanced out the window. It seemed strange to be confined with him in such a small space. Too intimate somehow. And that was an odd thought. She\u2019d had sexual congress with this man, had danced with him only the night before, and had had the audacity to strip off his shirt and shave him. Yet those things had been done in the night, lit only by candlelight. Somehow she found it easier to be relaxed at night. The shadows made her brave. Perhaps she really was the mistress of the night, as he called her. And if so, did that make him master of the day?</p><p>She watched him, struck by the thought. He sought her out mainly during the daylight hours. Stalked her in the sunlight. He might like to go to balls and gaming hells at night, but it was during the day that he sought to discover her secrets. Was it because he sensed that she felt more weak exposed to sunlight? Or because he was stronger in the day?</p><p>Or maybe both?</p><p>\u201cDo you take it everywhere?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, her thoughts scattered. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog.\u201d He pointed his chin at Mouse, curled on the seat beside her. \u201cDoes it go everywhere with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Mouse is a him, not an it,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cAnd, yes, I do like taking him places that he might enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Vale\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cThe dog enjoys shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes carriage rides.\u201d She stroked Mouse\u2019s soft nose. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever had any pets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, there was a cat when I was a boy, but it never came when I called it and had a habit of scratching when displeased. It was often displeased, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was its name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat.\u201d</p><p>She l Ksizeigooked at him. His face was solemn, but there was a diabolical gleam in his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you have pets as a child, my fair wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked out the window again, not wishing to revisit her lonely childhood.</p><p>He seemed to sense her aversion to talking about that time and for once did not press. He was silent a moment before saying softly, \u201cActually, the cat was Richard\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, curious.</p><p>His wide lips curved into a lopsided smile as if he mocked himself. \u201cMother doesn\u2019t particularly like cats, but Richard was sickly as a child, and when he took a liking to a kitten in the stables\u201d\u2014he shrugged\u2014\u201cI suppose she made an exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much older than you was your brother?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet thirty years.\u201d He no longer smiled. \u201cHe\u2019d always been weak\u2014he was thin and often had trouble catching his breath\u2014but he took the ague while I was in the Colonies and never quite recovered. Mother didn\u2019t smile for a year after I came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He turned his palm upward. \u201cIt was long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father was already dead, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, lounging so carelessly in the carriage as he talked about the premature death of his brother and father. \u201cYou must have found that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be the viscount even though Richard was always so ill. Somehow everyone in my family thought he would live to beget an heir.\u201d He suddenly looked at her, the corner of his mouth cocked. \u201cHe might have been weak of body, but my brother had a strong spirit. He carried himself like a viscount. He could command men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do you,\u201d she reminded him gently.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot as he did. Nor as Reynaud did, for that matter. They were both better leaders than I.\u201d</p><p>She found that hard to believe. Vale might mock himself, might like to tell jokes and sometimes play the fool, but other men listened to him. When he entered a room, the very air sizzled. Both men and women were drawn to him like a miniature sun. She wanted to tell him this, wanted to tell him how much she herself admired him, but the fear that she might reveal too much of her own emotions held her back.</p><p>The carriage slowed, and she looked out the window to find that they were on Bond Street.</p><p>The door opened and Vale jumped to the ground before turning and offering his hand in assistance. She rose and placed her hand in his, feeling the strength of his fingers. She climbed down from the carriage, and Mouse hopped down as well. The street was lined with fashionable shops, and both ladies and gentlemen strolled by the display window Kdispeds.</p><p>\u201cWhich way do you fancy, my sweet wife?\u201d Vale asked, holding out his arm. \u201cYou shall lead and I will follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown here a bit, I think,\u201d Melisande replied. \u201cI want to visit a tobacconist first, to purchase some snuff.\u201d</p><p>She felt him glance at her. \u201cAre you a fashionable snuff-taker, like our queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at the thought before she recalled herself and smoothed out her expression. \u201cIt\u2019s for Harold. I always give him a box of his favorite snuff on his birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Lucky Harold, then.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cDo you like snuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His turquoise eyes were warm as he smiled down at her. \u201cI referred to his fortune in having such a caring sister. If I\u2019d known\u2014\u201d</p><p>But his words were cut off by a sharp bark from Mouse. Melisande looked around in time to see the terrier bound from her side and tear across the crowded street.</p><p>\u201cMouse!\u201d She started forward, her eyes on the dog.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Vale grabbed her arm, holding her back.</p><p>She pulled her arm. \u201cLet me go! He\u2019ll be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Vale yanked her back from the road, just as a big brewer\u2019s cart rumbled by. \u201cBetter him than you.\u201d</p><p>She could hear shouting across the street, a series of growls, and Mouse barking hysterically.</p><p>She turned and placed her palm on Vale\u2019s chest, trying to convey her desperation. \u201cBut Mouse\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her husband muttered something, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll get the little beast for you, never fear.\u201d</p><p>He let a cart pass and then darted into the road. Melisande could now see Mouse across the street, and her heart seized with fear. The terrier was in battle with a huge mastiff at least four times his size. As she watched, the mastiff shook off Mouse and snapped. Mouse skittered away, missing the gaping jaws by inches. Then he charged forward again, fearless as ever. Several boys and men had stopped to watch the fight, some yelling encouragement to the mastiff.</p><p>\u201cMouse!\u201d She looked this time for carriages, horses, and carts as she dashed across the street after Vale. \u201cMouse!\u201d</p><p>Vale reached the dogs just as the mastiff gripped Mouse in its huge jaws. The mastiff lifted Mouse and began shaking him. Melisande felt a scream build in her throat, but strangely no sound came. The bigger dog would break Mouse\u2019s neck if he kept shaking him.</p><p>And then Vale brought both fists down on the mastiff\u2019s snout. The big dog backed up a step but didn\u2019t release his prize.</p><p>\u201cOy!\u201d Vale yelled. \u201cDrop it, you devil spawn!\u201d</p><p>He hit the dog again just as Mouse twisted wildly in the bigger dog\u2019s grasp. This must\u2019ve been too much, for the mastiff finally dropped Mouse. Kdro ju For a moment, it looked like the massive animal might attack Vale, but her husband aimed a kick at the animal\u2019s flank, and that decided the matter. The bigger dog took off running, much to the crowd\u2019s disappointment. Mouse leapt forward to continue the chase, but Vale grabbed him by the scruff of the neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t, you little idiot.\u201d</p><p>To Melisande\u2019s horror, Mouse twisted in Vale\u2019s hold and sank his teeth into his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mouse!\u201d She reached for her pet.</p><p>But Vale held her off with his other arm. \u201cDon\u2019t. He\u2019s mad with temper and might bite you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned, one hand still holding the dog that was biting him, and looked at her. His eyes were a deep blue now and held only a certainty of purpose; his face was more stern than she\u2019d ever seen it, dark and lined and with no trace of amusement. It came to her that this must be what he looked like when he\u2019d ridden into battle.</p><p>His voice was as cold as the North Sea. \u201cListen to me. You are my wife, and I\u2019ll not see you hurt, even if it makes me your enemy. There can be no compromise in this matter.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded.</p><p>He eyed her a moment more, seemingly oblivious to the blood dripping from his hand. Then he jerked a nod. \u201cGood. Stand back and don\u2019t interfere in what I do.\u201d</p><p>She grasped her hands in front of herself so that she might not be tempted to snatch at Mouse. She adored the dog, even knowing he was an ill-tempered animal that no one else liked. Mouse was hers, and he returned her adoration. But Vale was her husband, and she could not contradict his authority\u2014even if it meant sacrificing Mouse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vale shook the dog in his hand. Mouse growled and held on. Vale calmly thrust his free thumb down Mouse\u2019s throat. The dog gagged and let go. In a flash, Vale wrapped his hand around the dog\u2019s snout.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to her, holding the dog in both hands. The crowd had scattered when the prospect of blood had disappeared. Now Vale led her back to their carriage.</p><p>One of the footmen saw them coming and started forward. \u201cAre you hurt, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Vale said. \u201cIs there a box or bag in the carriage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a basket under the coachman\u2019s seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have a lid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, a sturdy one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetch it, please.\u201d</p><p>The footman ran back to the carriage.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d Melisande asked.</p><p>Vale glanced at her. \u201cNothing terrible. He needs to be contained until he calms down a bit.\u201d</p><p>Mouse had stopped growling. Every now and then, he gave Kthe/p&gt;a violent wriggle in a bid for freedom, but Vale held fast.</p><p>The footman had the basket out and open when they reached the carriage.</p><p>\u201cClose it as soon as I put him in.\u201d Vale eyed the man. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p> <p>The action was done in a flash, the footman wide-eyed, Mouse struggling desperately, and Vale grim. And then her pet was confined in a basket that rocked violently in the footman\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cPut it back under the seat,\u201d Vale said to the footman. He took Melisande\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s return home.\u201d</p><p>HE MAY HAVE alienated her, perhaps made her hate him, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. Jasper watched his wife as she sat opposite him in the carriage. She held herself rigidly erect, her back and shoulders straight, her head tilted down just a little as she stared at her lap. Her expression was veiled. She wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman\u2014a part of him was coldly aware of that fact. She dressed in demure, forgettable clothes, didn\u2019t do anything, in fact, to make herself known. He\u2019d engaged\u2014bedded\u2014women far more beautiful. She was an ordinary, plain woman.</p><p>And still, his mind furiously worked as he sat, planning his next assault against the fortress of her soul. Perhaps this was a kind of madness, for he was as fascinated by her as if she were a magical fairy come to lure him into another world.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked, her voice dropping into his thoughts like a pebble into a pond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re a fairy,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Her eyebrows arched delicately upward. \u201cYou\u2019re bamming me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, no, my heart.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him, her light brown eyes unfathomable. Then her gaze lowered to his hand. He\u2019d wrapped a handkerchief around the bite as soon as they\u2019d entered the carriage.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, even though his hand had begun to throb. \u201cNot at all, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She still frowned down at his hand. \u201cI should like Mr. Pynch to bandage it properly when we return. Dog bites can be ugly. Do make sure he washes it properly, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>She looked out the window and clasped her hands tightly together in her lap. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mouse bit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he ever done it to you?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cHas the dog ever bitten you, my lady wife?\u201d If the animal had, Jasper would have it put down.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo. Oh, no. Mouse is terribly affectionate with me. In fact, he\u2019s never bitten anyone else at all.\u201d</p><p>Jasper smiled wryly. \u201cThen I suppose I should be honored to be the Kredghtfirst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely let him stew for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Her face was once again expressionless. He knew how much the mongrel meant to her; she\u2019d all but confessed that it was her only friend in the world.</p><p>He shifted on the seat. \u201cWhere did you get him?\u201d</p><p>She was quiet so long that he thought she might not answer.</p><p>Then she sighed. \u201cHe was one of a litter of puppies found in my brother\u2019s stables. The head groom wanted them drowned\u2014he said they already had enough ratters about. He\u2019d put the puppies into a sack while a stable boy went to fetch a bucket of water. I came into the stable yard just as the puppies escaped the sack. They scattered and all the men were running about and yelling, trying to catch the poor things. Mouse ran to me and immediately caught the hem of my dress between his teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you saved him,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt seemed the thing to do. I\u2019m afraid Harold was not best pleased.\u201d</p><p>No, he doubted her stodgy brother would\u2019ve been happy with a mongrel in his house. But Melisande would\u2019ve ignored any complaints and simply done as she pleased, and poor Harold would\u2019ve had to eventually give up. Jasper was learning that his wife was almost terrifyingly determined when she set her mind to something.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He looked up to find they were drawn up in front of his town house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the footman bring Mouse inside.\u201d He caught her gaze to impress upon her his inflexibility in this matter. \u201cDon\u2019t let him out or touch him until I say you may.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her face as serene and regal as a queen. Then she turned and descended the carriage without waiting for his help. She walked to the town house steps and climbed them unhurriedly. Her head was erect, her shoulders level, and her back straight. Jasper found that back oddly provoking.</p><p>He frowned, cursed under his breath, and followed in his wife\u2019s wake. He may\u2019ve won that round, but in some ways he felt as if he\u2019d been ignominiously routed.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Princess Surcease stood high on the battlements of the castle and watched as her suitors arrived below. Beside her was Jack the Fool. She\u2019d become quite fond of him, and he accompanied her everywhere. He stood now on an overturned piece of masonry, the better to see over the wall, since he was only half her height.</p><p>\u201cAh, me!\u201d sighed the princess.</p><p>\u201cWhat troubles you, o fair and gusty maid?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Foo Nckql, I wish my father would let me choose a husband of my own liking,\u201d the princess said. \u201cBut that will never happen, will it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore likely that a fool marry a beautiful princess royal,\u201d Jack replied. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Mouse was barking.</p><p>Melisande winced as Suchlike set a pin in her hair. The sound was muffled, true, because it came from three floors below. Vale\u2019d had the dog locked in a little stone storage room off the cellar. Mouse had begun barking shortly after he\u2019d been locked in. Probably when he realized that he wasn\u2019t going to be let out again right away. Since that time\u2014late this morning\u2014he\u2019d barked steadily. It was evening now. Once in a while, he\u2019d stop as if listening for a rescue, but when none came, he\u2019d start up again. And each time the barking seemed louder than before.</p><p>\u201cLoud little dog, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Suchlike said. She didn\u2019t sound particularly put out by the racket.</p><p>Maybe the household wasn\u2019t as affected as Melisande thought. \u201cHe\u2019s never been locked up before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo him good, then.\u201d Suchlike set another pin and then stepped back to eye her handiwork critically. \u201cMr. Pynch says he\u2019ll go stark raving mad soon.\u201d</p><p>Her lady\u2019s maid sounded as if she\u2019d relish the valet\u2019s insanity.</p><p>Melisande arched an eyebrow. \u201cHas Lord Vale returned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. A half hour or so ago.\u201d Suchlike began to tidy the dressing table.</p><p>Melisande stood and wandered across the room. Mouse\u2019s barking stopped suddenly, and she held her breath.</p><p>Then he began again.</p><p>Vale had forbade her from going to the dog, but if this lasted much longer, she didn\u2019t know if she could stay away. Mouse\u2019s distress was terribly hard for her to bear.</p><p>A knock sounded on her door.</p><p>She turned and stared. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>Vale opened the door. He may not\u2019ve been home long, but from the dampness of his hair, he\u2019d had time to wash and change his clothes. \u201cGood evening, my lady wife. Would you care to accompany me on a visit to the prisoner?\u201d</p><p>She smoothed down her skirts and nodded. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He stood aside, and she led the way down the stairs, the barking becoming clearer the nearer they got.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a boon to ask, my lady,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to stand back and let me handle the dog.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. Mouse had only ever responded to her. What if the terrier tried to bite Vale again? Her husband seemed a gent S seipsle man, but she sensed that the gentleness was but a surface layer.</p><p>\u201cMelisande?\u201d</p><p>She turned. He had stopped on the stairs, waiting for her answer. His turquoise eyes seemed to gleam in the shadows.</p><p>She nodded jerkily. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>He descended the last steps and took her hand, leading her back to the kitchens.</p><p>The hallway became more dim as they entered the servants\u2019 domain until they reached the kitchen. The room was huge, dominated by a large arched brick fireplace at one end. Two windows at the back of the house let in light, making it a bright room during the day. At the moment, candles supplemented the fading light from outside.</p><p>The cook, three scullery maids, several footmen, and the butler were all in the midst of dinner preparations. At their entrance, the cook dropped her spoon into a pot of simmering soup, and everyone else stilled. Mouse\u2019s barking echoed from below.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Oaks began.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t wish to interrupt your work,\u201d Vale said. \u201cI\u2019ve just come to deal with my lady\u2019s dog. Ah, Pynch.\u201d</p><p>The valet had risen from a chair by the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cDid you find a scrap of meat?\u201d Vale asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Mr. Pynch said. \u201cCook has most kindly given me some of the beef from last night\u2019s supper.\u201d He proffered a lumpy folded handkerchief.</p><p>Melisande cleared her throat. \u201cActually . . .\u201d</p><p>Vale looked down at her. \u201cMy heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s for Mouse, he loves cheese,\u201d she said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI bow to your superior knowledge.\u201d Vale turned to the cook, who was hovering near her soup. \u201cHave you a bit of cheese?\u201d</p><p>Cook curtsied. \u201cAye, my lord. Annie, fetch that round of cheese from the pantry.\u201d</p><p>A scullery maid scurried into a room off the kitchen and reappeared with a wheel of cheese nearly as large as her head. She set it on the kitchen table and carefully unwrapped the cloth about it.</p><p>Cook took a sharp knife and cut off a slice. \u201cWill this do, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, Mrs. Cook.\u201d Vale grinned at the woman, making her thin cheeks tinge a light pink. \u201cI am forever in your debt. Now if you will show me your cellar, Mr. Oaks?\u201d</p><p>The butler led the way through the pantry and to a door that opened to a short flight of stairs leading into the partially underground cellar.</p><p>\u201cMind your head,\u201d Vale admonished Melisande. He had to bend nearly double to descend the stairs. \u201cThank you, Oaks. You may leave us.\u201d</p><p>The butler looked greatly relieved. The cellar was lined in cold, damp stone, the walls stacked with shelves holding all matter of foo S malood and wine. In one corner was a little wooden door, behind which Mouse had been imprisoned. He\u2019d stopped barking at the sound of their footsteps on the stairs, and Melisande could imagine him behind the door standing with his head cocked to the side.</p><p>Vale looked at Melisande and put his finger to his lips.</p><p>She nodded, pressing her lips together.</p><p>He grinned and cracked the cellar door. Immediately a small black nose peeped through the opening. Vale squatted and pinched off a bite of cheese. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow, then, Sir Mouse,\u201d he murmured as he held out the cheese in long, strong fingers. \u201cHave you thought over your sins?\u201d</p><p>The nose twitched, and then Mouse took the cheese very carefully from Vale\u2019s hand and disappeared.</p><p>Melisande expected Vale to push into the little cellar room, but he simply waited, still squatting on the stone floor as if he had all the time in the world.</p><p>A few seconds more and the black, twitching nose reappeared. This time Vale held the cheese just out of the dog\u2019s reach.</p> <p>Melisande waited, holding her breath. Mouse could be terribly stubborn. On the other hand, he did adore cheese. The dog nudged the door open with his nose. Dog and man eyed each other a moment, until Mouse trotted out and took the second piece of cheese from Vale. He immediately retreated a few steps, turned his back, and gobbled down the cheese. This time Vale held the cheese in his open palm on his knee. Mouse crept forward and hesitantly took the cheese.</p><p>When he came back for another bite, Vale ran his hand gently over the dog\u2019s head as he ate. Mouse didn\u2019t seem to mind or even notice the touch. Vale took a long, thin leather cord from his pocket. One end had been made into a loop. When Mouse came back for his next bite of cheese, Vale deftly slipped the loop over the dog\u2019s neck, where it hung loosely. Then he fed Mouse more cheese.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d consumed the entire slice of cheese, Mouse was letting Vale rub him all over his little body. Vale stood and tapped his thigh. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the cellar. Mouse shot a puzzled glance at Melisande, but since he was on the other end of the lead, he was compelled to follow.</p><p>Melisande shook her head with wonder and trailed behind. Vale continued through the kitchen and out the back door, where he played out the lead enough to let Mouse do his business.</p> <p>Then he reeled in the leash and smiled at Melisande. \u201cShall we partake of supper?\u201d</p><p>She could only nod. Gratitude was welling in her chest. Vale had tamed Mouse, proved his mastery over the dog, and all without hurting him. She knew of very few men who would bother to do the same, let alone without beating an animal. What he had done had taken intelligence and patience and not a little compassion. Compassion for a dog that had bitten him only that morning. If she didn\u2019t already love him, she would love him now.</p><p>MOUSE LAY UNDER the table at Jasper\u2019s feet. The leash was wrapped about his wrist, and he\u2019d felt the tug when the animal h Sn tAY ad made a couple of abortive attempts to go to his mistress. Now, the animal simply lay, head between his paws, and gave a theatrical sigh every now and again. Jasper felt a smile curve his lips. He could see why Melisande was fond of the little beast. Mouse had an outsized presence.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to go out again tonight?\u201d Melisande asked from across the table.</p><p>She was watching him over the rim of her wineglass, her eyes shadowed and mysterious.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down as he sawed at the roast beef on his plate. Did she wonder why he was always going out, why many nights he stayed away until the wee hours of the morn? Or did she simply think him a mindlessly drunken wastrel? What a lowering thought. Especially since he didn\u2019t particularly like the gaming hells and balls he attended every night. He simply hated the hours of black night more.</p><p>\u201cYou could stay in,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>He looked at her. Her expression was bland, her movements unhurried as she broke a roll and buttered it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She raised her brows, her gaze still on her roll. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>He felt his belly tighten at the single, subtly taunting word. \u201cAnd what would we do, sweet wife, if I did stay here with you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOh, there\u2019re many things we could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could play cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith only two players? Not a very interesting game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheckers or chess?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cWe could talk,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He took a sip of wine. He chased her during the day, but for some reason the idea of simply spending the evening talking with her made him uneasy. His ghosts were most ferocious at night. \u201cWhat would you like to discuss?\u201d</p><p>A footman brought in a tray of cheeses and fresh strawberries and set it between them. Melisande didn\u2019t move\u2014her back, as always, was militarily straight\u2014but Jasper thought she leaned a little forward. \u201cYou could tell me about your youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, a rather boring subject\u201d\u2014he idly fingered the wineglass\u2014\u201cexcept for the time Reynaud and I nearly drowned in the St. Aubyn pond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear about that.\u201d She still hadn\u2019t taken a strawberry.</p><p>\u201cWe were in a perilous time of life,\u201d Jasper began. \u201cEleven, to be exact. The summer before we were sent away to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She selected one strawberry and transferred it to her plate. It was neither the biggest nor the smallest berry, but it was perfectly red and ripe. She stroked it with her forefinger as if savoring the anticipation of eating Stioles it.</p><p>Jasper swallowed some wine. His throat had gone suddenly dry. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019d escaped from my tutor that afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaped?\u201d She turned the strawberry on the plate.</p><p>He watched her fingers on the fruit and imagined them somewhere else entirely. \u201cMy tutor was a rather elderly man, and if I had a bit of a head start, I could outrun him easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor man,\u201d she said, and bit into the strawberry.</p><p>For a moment, his breath caught and all coherent thought fled his mind. Then he cleared his throat, though his voice still emerged hoarse. \u201cYes, well, and what was worse, Reynaud had slipped his traces as well.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we chose to meet up by the pond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately?\u201d</p><p>He winced, remembering. \u201cSomehow we got the notion to build a raft.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows lifted, delicate light brown wings.</p><p>He skewered a bit of cheese on his knife and ate it. \u201cAs it turns out, building a raft from fallen branches and bits of twine is actually much harder than one would at first think. Especially if one is an eleven-year-old boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense a tragedy in the making.\u201d Her face was grave, but somehow her eyes laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He took a strawberry and twirled the stem between his fingers. \u201cBy afternoon, we were covered in mud, sweaty and panting, and we\u2019d somehow constructed a contraption about three feet square, although square it certainly was not.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip as if to keep from laughing. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He set his elbows on the table, still holding the strawberry, and assumed a solemn expression. \u201cIn retrospect, I very much doubt that the thing we\u2019d assembled could float on the water by itself. Naturally, the notion of trying it out on the water before actually trying to sail on it never occurred to us.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling now, no longer holding back the laughter, and he felt a thrill of gladness. To make this woman lose composure, to make her express joy, was no mean feat. And the wonder of it was the pleasure he took in making her smile.</p><p>\u201cThe outcome was inevitable, I fear.\u201d He reached across the table and pressed the strawberry he held against that smiling mouth. She parted her pale pink lips and bit into the fruit. His groin tightened, and he stared at her mouth as she chewed. \u201cWe came a cropper almost immediately, the very instability of the raft saving us.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>He tossed aside the strawberry stem and folded his arms on the table. \u201cWe got only about a yard from shore before we sank. We landed in the weeds, the water only to our waists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>He felt th S\"3\"idte corner of his mouth kick up. \u201cWell, it would\u2019ve been all had not Reynaud managed to land almost on top of a goose nest.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOh, dear, indeed. The gander took exception to us invading his pond-side cottage. Chased us nearly back to Vale Manor. And there, my tutor finally caught up with us and gave me such a caning I could hardly sit for a week. Haven\u2019t really cared for roast goose since.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he held her laughing brown eyes, the room quiet, the servants somewhere out in the hall. Jasper could feel each inhale, feel time seem to pause as he looked into his wife\u2019s eyes. He was on the precipice of something\u2014a turning point in his life, a new way of feeling or thinking\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure, but it was right beneath his feet. All he had to do was take the step.</p><p>But it was Melisande who moved. She shoved back her chair and rose.</p><p>\u201cI thank you, my lord, for a very amusing tale.\u201d And she walked to the dining room door.</p><p>Jasper blinked. \u201cAre you leaving me so soon?\u201d</p><p>She paused, her ramrod-straight back still toward him. \u201cI hoped you would accompany me upstairs.\u201d She looked over her shoulder at him, her eyes grave, mysterious, and just a little teasing. \u201cMy courses are over.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door very quietly behind her.</p><p>MELISANDE HEARD A muttered curse followed by a sharp bark as she left the dining room. She smiled. No doubt Vale had forgotten Mouse\u2019s leash tied to his wrist. She mounted the stairs quickly, not looking back. She could feel the beat of her pulse, was aware that he would be following her. The thought sped her feet as she reached the upper hallway.</p><p>Heavy footsteps sounded behind her on the stairs, drawing swiftly closer. He must be taking the treads two at a time. She reached her bedroom door, her breath coming in short pants of excitement. She pushed through the door into the empty room and ran to the fireplace, where she whirled around.</p><p>Vale prowled into the room a moment later.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with Mouse?\u201d She struggled to keep her voice even.</p><p>\u201cGave him to a footman.\u201d He locked the door.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her and halted, his head cocked. He seemed to be waiting for her move.</p><p>Melisande inhaled and glided forward. \u201cHe sleeps with me usually, you know.\u201d</p><p>She grasped the edges of his coat and drew them apart, urging it from his arms.</p><p>\u201cIn this room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my bed.\u201d She laid his coat carefully on a chair.</p><p>\u201cAh. Indeed.\u201d His eyebrows were drawn together as if he were puzzling something out.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she repeated softly. She pulled loose hi Sullfons neck cloth and laid it on the coat. Her hands shook as if she had a palsy.</p><p>\u201cIn the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She unbuttoned his waistcoat.</p><p>He shrugged out of it and dropped it to the floor. She glanced at it and decided to leave it. She began working on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI would think . . .\u201d He trailed away, seeming to lose his train of thought.</p><p>She drew his shirt off over his head and looked at him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps we should sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to let this go the way of their wedding night. She laid her fingertips on his chest and traced down lightly over his stomach, reveling in the freedom to touch his bare skin.</p><p>He sucked in his belly in reaction. \u201cAh . . .\u201d</p><p>She reached his breeches and found the buttons.</p><p>\u201cSlow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we should slow down?\u201d she asked gently. She slipped buttons through their holes.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The flap of his breeches sagged open.</p><p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr no?\u201d She slid her hand into his smallclothes and found him hard and heavy, waiting just for her. Warmth pooled at her center in anticipation. She\u2019d have him tonight\u2014have him the way she wanted.</p><p>He closed his eyes as if in agony and said quite distinctly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI concur.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she slipped her other hand into his breeches to cradle him.</p><p>He swayed a little before planting his feet.</p><p>She was caught in discovery. Oddly, her hands had stopped shaking, finally, now that she touched the most intimate portion of his anatomy. She could feel the crisp hair brushing the back of her fingers, and her palms were filled with hot flesh. She wrapped her left hand about his width and explored him with her right. Soft skin, granite-hard muscle beneath. The slight bumps of veins, a wide flanged head. She ran her fingertips across that head, sensitive skin to sensitive skin, and felt the tiny slit. The moisture that seeped from that slit. She rubbed the moisture in little circles and at the same time squeezed with her left hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Vale implored. \u201cYou make me weak, my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, a secret, feminine smile of triumph, and stood on tiptoe, his cock still in her hands. \u201cKiss me, please.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened, and he looked at her almost wildly. Then he grasped her arms and bent his head to kiss her. His mouth was open, wet, a little desperate\u2014exactly the way she wanted it. She made a humming sound of pleasure in her throat and stroked Sat ope him firmly. He groaned and thrust his tongue into her mouth, his cock into her hands. She captured his tongue and sucked. His big hands dropped to her bottom, squeezing. A thrill of pure pleasure rushed through her center.</p><p>He pulled back suddenly, gasping. \u201cSweet my heart, maybe we should . . .\u201d</p><p>No. She shoved his breeches down, off his hips. She examined his beautiful, bared cock and felt her internal muscles squeeze at the sight.</p><p>\u201cMelisande . . .\u201d</p><p>His penis was a dark red, proud and erect, his balls drawn up tight and hard beneath. She placed her thumb under the head, in that small, sensitive indent on the underside. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back up at him. Her husband looked a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quite firmly, and leaned forward to lick his left nipple.</p><p>He jerked in reaction and pulled her toward him, smashing her hands between them.</p><p>She relinquished her prize and, placing her palms on his chest, pushed him backward to a chair. He stumbled a step before bending impatiently and stripping off his breeches and smallclothes, followed by hose and shoes. He sat splendidly naked in the chair and then seemed to realize she was still dressed.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d She laid a fingertip across his mouth, feeling the humid brush of his breath, the smooth satin of his lips.</p><p>He closed his mouth, and she stepped back. Her hands went to the laces of her bodice, and he watched intently as she took off her clothes. The room was hushed, save for the pop of the fire and the sound of his breathing. The firelight highlighted his big body. His broad shoulders more than spanned the chair back. His long fingers gripped the arms of the chair tightly, as if he held himself in check. The muscles in his upper arms swelled with the tension. And below . . .</p><p>She caught her breath as she stepped from her skirts. His hard thighs braced his erection, which pointed aggressively up. The sight made her legs tremble, made her core heat and liquefy. She met his gaze, and he no longer looked dazed. He stared at her, intent, focused, no trace of a smile on his wide, expressive mouth.</p><p>She took a steadying breath and let her stays drop to the floor. She wore only a silk chemise now, fine as a dragonfly wing. As she stepped toward him, he started to rise from the chair. But she put a hand on his shoulder and placed one knee by his hip in the chair.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She was gratified that he had to clear his throat. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and raised the hem of her chemise to her hips before climbing into the chair. She straddled his lap carefully and let the chemise fall. Then she sat. For a moment, all she could do was savor the heat of his thighs against her bottom. She could feel his body hair tickling her most intimate parts.</p> <p>Then she smiled and wove her arms about his neck. \u201cWill you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He pulled her tightly against his chest, his arms strong around her back. She almost giggled; it was so wonderful to finally be held by him like this. But then he brought his mouth to hers and all laughter fled. He kissed her as if he were a starving man, and she was the first bite of bread he\u2019d seen in weeks. His mouth was wide, moving over hers, gasping for breath, nipping at her lips. His hands were hard on her, and she wondered if she\u2019d have bruises in the morning.</p><p>She lifted a little, bringing herself closer to his cock. He froze, his mouth still on hers, as if waiting to see what she would do. She scooted forward in his lap until his penis lay beneath her, trapped firmly between their bodies. Then she slowly rubbed herself against him. The head of his cock parted her folds, and she ground her secret flesh against him. Her eyes fluttered closed at the exquisite feeling.</p><p>He broke their kiss and tried to reach between them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She opened her eyes and gazed at him sternly. Then she ground against him again.</p><p>His face was flushed, his lips wet. The long vertical lines about his mouth had deepened until his face looked saturnine.</p><p>She ground against him, the heat building, her folds slippery now. She still held his eyes, defying him to stop her.</p><p>Instead, he brought both hands between them and covered her breasts. \u201cDo it now.\u201d</p><p>She raised up on her knees and pushed against his cock. She was panting now. He watched her and brought his thumbs and forefingers together, pinching her nipples. She gasped and arched her back, but his cock slid to one side. Frantically, she reached between them to hold his slippery length steady. She ground against him. She could feel her folds, swollen beneath her fingers. She imagined her sex, crimson and wet, flowering against his cock. She rubbed the head of his penis against her clitoris, biting her lips, striving, struggling toward that goal.</p><p>Then he leaned forward and sucked a nipple into his hot, humid mouth, and she went over the cliff. Rushing, panting, she shattered in space. Her chemise collapsed like tissue beneath his tongue, and he sucked hard on her nipple. She watched him through slitted eyes, her head thrown back in pleasure. Vale. She was shuddering against him, trembling, still between heaven and earth, not wanting to return.</p><p>His hands were soothing now instead of hard, running up and down her back. She quivered in his arms, her breathing beginning to subside, even as her need to have him inside her grew urgent. He shifted and wrapped his hands about her waist, lifting her without any show of effort. His cock was suddenly lower, at her entrance. She lifted her head, and her eyes met his implacable ones. He held her gaze and pushed against her, into her, stretching her passage, making her shudder with renewed pleasure. She tilted her pelvis and bore down, taking his entire length, seating herself firmly on his penis. Female to male. Wife to husband.</p><p>Their eyes were still locked, and she wondered what he thought\u2014if he was surprised or pleased or displeased. Or perhaps he didn\u2019t have any such coher Sanyed,ent thoughts at all. His wide mouth was stretched, almost frowning, and his eyes were narrowed. A bead of sweat ran down his jaw. Perhaps he didn\u2019t need to think. Perhaps he only felt.</p><p>And so would she. She leaned forward and licked the bead of sweat, tasting salt and man\u2014her man now. She took his face between her hands and bit his lower lip. He grunted, tightening his hands and lifting her, sliding his cock from her sheath, and then letting her body drop on his again.</p><p>She wanted to laugh, wanted to sing. She was flying and free\u2014finally free\u2014making love to the man she loved. She swiveled her hips the next time he brought her down, and he pulled his lip from between her teeth and muttered a curse. Then he was moving beneath her, surging up like a wave, roughly pushing his flesh into her as if he wanted to mark her.</p><p>She grabbed his broad shoulders and hung on. Her legs were wide, her breasts jiggling, and her mouth was open against his face, kissing, licking, biting. And all the while, his cock plundered her. Leaping. Demanding. Plunging.</p><p>Until all his muscles tightened at once. He shook his head, his teeth clenched, his body rigid, and she felt the hot wash of his seed into her body. He jerked once. Again. Then exhaled as if all the air was leaving his body at once.</p><p>She trailed kisses down his face and over his jaw, watching him, her husband, as he relaxed from their lovemaking. Gradually his muscles loosened. His hands fell from her waist. His head lolled against the chair back. And still she kissed him. On his neck, his ear, his shoulder. Light, soft kisses. Vale. Vale. Vale. She couldn\u2019t say aloud what her heart sang, but she could worship him with her mouth. His body was hot, his chest damp beneath her palms. She could smell the musk of their bodies, intimate in sex. This was right in a way it never had been before. All the various pieces of her life\u2014her world\u2014were in their correct places, all aligned in harmony. At peace.</p><p>She could stay here forever.</p><p>But he shifted beneath her and withdrew his flesh from hers. She bit back the cry of loss, because he was lifting her and carrying her to the bed. He lay her down and bent over her to kiss her gently on the lips. Then he turned away and left the room through the connecting door.</p><p>He never even saw the arms she held out to him.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>On the day that the trials were to begin, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hopeful men stood outside the castle walls. A tall platform was built for the king to stand on so that all the suitors could hear. And from this platform, the king explained what was to happen. There would be three trials in all, in order that the man who would win the princess be thoroughly tested. The first test was to find and bring back a ring of bronze. This ring lay at the bottom of a deep and chilly lake. And in this lake there lived a giant serpent. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Melisande awoke to a solitary bed. Suchlike must\u2019ve let Mouse into the room during the night, for the dog was curled in a tight Vlisball at the foot of her bed. She lay for a moment, staring at the silk canopy overhead, sorting through her emotions. Their lovemaking last night had been wonderful\u2014or at least she had thought so. Had Jasper left afterward because he was repulsed by her boldness? Or because it was simply a physical act for him and therefore he felt no need to stay and lay with her? Wasn\u2019t that what she wanted in the first place? To share with Vale the physical part of marriage without engaging her unnaturally intense emotions? Melisande blew out a frustrated breath. She didn\u2019t know anymore what she wanted, it seemed.</p><p>At the foot of the bed, Mouse uncurled himself and stretched, rump in the air. Then he padded softly toward her and nudged her hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think, Sir Mouse?\u201d Melisande inquired as she stroked his soft ears. \u201cHas he quite tamed you?\u201d</p><p>Mouse shook himself all over, then jumped from the bed and trotted to the door. He made his purpose known by scratching at the wood with a paw.</p><p>Melisande sighed and flung back the covers. \u201cVery well, then. I suppose I won\u2019t answer my questions lying abed anyway.\u201d</p><p>She rang for Suchlike, and while she waited for the maid, she washed with the pitcher of rather chilly water on the dresser. Then, with the maid\u2019s help, she dressed quickly and was soon pattering down the stairs with Mouse. She handed over the dog\u2019s care to Sprat before making her way to the breakfast room, bracing herself to see Vale.</p><p>But the breakfast room was empty. Melisande hovered on the threshold for a moment before entering. The table had been cleared and cleaned, of course, but a few leftover crumbs made the case for her husband already having come and gone. She bit her lip. Why hadn\u2019t he waited?</p><p>\u201cShall I bring some chocolate, my lady?\u201d Sprat asked from behind her. He\u2019d returned with Mouse.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she murmured automatically. Then she whirled, startling the footman. \u201cNo. Have the carriage brought \u2019round instead, will you?\u201d</p><p>Sprat looked confused. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Suchlike to meet me in the hall.\u201d</p><p>The footman bowed and left the room. Melisande went to the sideboard where a selection of buns and meats were already laid out. She wrapped several buns in a cloth and headed to the hall, Mouse at her heels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suchlike was already waiting in the hallway. She looked up as Melisande entered. \u201cAre we going somewhere, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought a walk in the park would be nice,\u201d Melisande said briskly. She glanced at Mouse, sitting sedately by her feet. He gazed back at her innocently. \u201cSprat, I believe we will need Mouse\u2019s leash as well.\u201d</p><p>The footman hurried back to the kitchens to fetch the leash, and soon dog and women were in the carriage, headed west toward Hyde Park.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day, isn\u2019t it, my lady?\u201d Suchlike commented. \u201cBlue sky and sunshine. \u2019Course, Mr. Pynch says we should enjoy it while we can, because soon it\u2019ll rain.\u201d The maid\u2019s brows lowered. \u201cHe\u2019s always predicting bad weather, Mr. Pynch is.\u201d</p> <p>cau=\"0%\"&gt;</p><p>Melisande looked at her maid, amused. \u201cA dour sort, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark and scowling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The maid\u2019s brow cleared. \u201cWell, he is dark, but not so much scowling as always looking down his nose at people, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Melisande nodded. \u201cA superior sort, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady, that\u2019s it exactly,\u201d Suchlike exclaimed. \u201cHe acts like other people aren\u2019t quite as bright as he. Or just because a person is younger than him, she might not know as much.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike brooded for a bit on the superior valet. Melisande watched her with interest. Suchlike was usually a very cheerful sort of girl. She had never seen her in a glum frame of mind\u2014and over a bald valet a dozen years her senior at that.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s Hyde Park, my lady,\u201d Suchlike said.</p><p>Melisande glanced up and saw they\u2019d entered the park. It was early still, and the park was not yet crowded with the fashionable carriages that would later parade. Right now, there were only a few riders, a carriage or two, and several figures strolling in the distance.</p><p>The carriage rolled to a stop. The door opened and a footman peered in. \u201cIs this spot good, my lady?\u201d</p> <p>They were near a small duck pond. Melisande nodded. \u201cVery nice. Tell the coachman to wait here while we stroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d The footman helped Melisande down first and then Suchlike. Mouse scampered to the ground and immediately lifted his leg against a bush.</p><p>Melisande cleared her throat. \u201cShall we make for the duck pond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you\u2019d like to go, my lady.\u201d Suchlike fell into step several paces behind Melisande.</p><p>She sighed. It was most proper for the lady\u2019s maid to follow her instead of walking by her side, but it did preclude any kind of intimate conversation. But the day was indeed fine, and she set out determinedly. Why wait at home for a husband who had a life of his own? No, she would enjoy the day, enjoy this walk, and not think about Vale and why he\u2019d not waited to have breakfast with her.</p><p>However, Melisande found that it was somewhat hard to achieve a serene state of mind whilst out walking Mouse. The terrier strained against the leash, his sturdy legs digging into the ground as if he fought for each footstep. Indeed, he strained so mightily against the loop of leather that he was half strangling himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, you silly, silly animal?\u201d Melisande muttered as the dog choked and coughed dramatically. \u201cIf you simply stopped pulling, you\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>Mouse didn\u2019t even turn at the sound of her voice, intent on his struggle with the braided leather lead.</p> <p>Melisande sighed. The portion of the park they were walking in was nearly deserted. In fact, the only people in sight were a woman and two children by the duck pon [y tk td, still ahead. And Mouse had always loved children. She bent and slipped the loop off Mouse\u2019s head.</p><p>The dog immediately put his nose to the ground and began running in circles.</p><p>\u201cMouse,\u201d Melisande called.</p><p>He stopped and looked at her with ears pricked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>The dog wagged his tail and scampered to investigate the base of a tree.</p><p>\u201cHe does seem to like a ramble, doesn\u2019t he, my lady?\u201d Suchlike called from behind her.</p><p>\u201cYes, and he hasn\u2019t had one in quite a while.\u201d</p><p>Melisande walked more easily now that Mouse was no longer pulling against her. She unwrapped the cloth and took out the buns, offering one to Suchlike.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Melisande strolled and munched. Mouse came running back and took a bite of bun from her hand before exploring again. She could hear the laughter of the children in the distance now, as well as the lower tones of the woman with them. The children were crouched near the pond\u2019s edge, the woman a little farther off but still near. One child had a long stick and was poking it about in the mud while the other watched.</p><p>Mouse saw a duck and drake waddling on the bank, and giving a joyful bark, he rushed at them. The ducks took flight. The silly terrier flung himself into the air, teeth snapping, as if he could actually catch a flying duck.</p><p>The children looked up and one shouted something. Mouse took this as an invitation and trotted over to make friends. As Melisande strolled closer, she could see that Mouse\u2019s new acquaintances were a boy and a girl. The boy looked about five or six, while the girl was perhaps eight. The boy was wearing a lovely suit but now had his arms wrapped about Mouse\u2019s neck. Melisande winced to think what mud was being transferred from dog to boy. The girl was less enthusiastic, which was fortunate since she wore a pristine white gown.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am! Ma\u2019am, what\u2019s his name?\u201d the boy called when he saw her. \u201cHe\u2019s a grand dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t shout,\u201d his sister said in a repressive tone.</p><p>Melisande smiled at the girl. \u201cHis name is Mouse, and he is a grand dog indeed.\u201d</p><p>Mouse seemed to grin before putting his nose into the mud near the edge of the pond. Boy and dog went back to investigating the water.</p><p>Melisande paused. She hadn\u2019t much experience talking with children, but surely some things were universal? She nodded at the girl. \u201cAnd what is your name?\u201d</p><p>The child blushed and looked down. \u201cAbigail Fitzwilliam,\u201d she whispered to her toes.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Melisande\u2019s mind worked as she looked from the child to her mother, whom she\u2019d seen just the other night at the masked ball. Helen Fitzwilliam was the Duke of Lister\u2019s mistress. The duke was a powerful man, but no matter how powerful the man in such si [mann Ftuations, the woman was still considered beyond the pale. She smiled at Helen Fitzwilliam\u2019s daughter. \u201cI am Lady Vale. How do you do?\u201d</p><p>The girl still stared at her toes.</p><p>\u201cAbigail,\u201d a low feminine voice said. \u201cCurtsy to the lady, please.\u201d</p><p>The girl dropped a wobbly but pretty curtsy even as Melisande looked up. The woman who had spoken was beautiful\u2014shining golden hair, wide blue eyes, and a perfect cupid\u2019s-bow mouth. She must be a little older than Melisande, but she would outshine women both younger and older than herself. But then it wasn\u2019t surprising that the Duke of Lister would choose a blindingly beautiful woman as his mistress.</p><p>She should walk away, not acknowledge the courtesan by either look or word. By the set of Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s shoulders, that was exactly what the other woman expected. Melisande\u2019s gaze dropped to the little girl, her eyes still firmly fixed on the ground. How many times had she seen her mother cut dead?</p><p>Melisande inclined her head. \u201cHow do you do? I am Melisande Renshaw, Viscountess Vale.\u201d</p><p>She saw the flash first of surprise, then gratitude, on Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s face before the woman sank into a curtsy. \u201cOh! It\u2019s an honor to meet you, my lady. I am Helen Fitzwilliam.\u201d</p><p>Melisande returned the curtsy, and when she rose, found the little girl looking at her. She smiled. \u201cAnd what is your brother\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>The girl glanced over her shoulder to where her brother was squatting by the water, poking at something with a stick. Mouse was sniffing at whatever they\u2019d found, and Melisande hoped he wouldn\u2019t take it into his head to roll in something noxious.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jamie,\u201d Abigail said. \u201cHe likes stinky things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Melisande concurred. \u201cSo does Mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I go see, Mother?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but do try not to paint yourself with the mud like your brother,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said.</p><p>Abigail looked insulted. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>She walked carefully over to where the boy and dog were playing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty child,\u201d Melisande commented. Usually she disliked trying to make conversation with strangers, but she knew that if she was quiet, the other woman would take it as a snub.</p><p>\u201cShe is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said. \u201cI know a mother isn\u2019t supposed to notice, but I\u2019ve always thought her rather lovely. They\u2019re the light of my life, you know.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded. She wasn\u2019t sure how long Mrs. Fitzwilliam had been Lister\u2019s mistress, but the children were almost certainly his. What a strange half-life it must be to be a man\u2019s concubine. Lister had a legitimate family with his wife\u2014some half-dozen sons and daughters already grown. Did he even acknowledge Jamie and Abigail as his own children?</p><p>\u201cThey love the park,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam continued. \u201cI come here with them as often as I can, which, I\u2019m afraid, i [ I\u2019t ssn\u2019t often enough. I don\u2019t like coming when there are too many other people about.\u201d</p><p>She said it matter-of-factly, without any self-pity.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you suppose little boys and dogs love the mud so much?\u201d Melisande mused. Abigail was keeping her distance, but Jamie had stood and stomped at something in the muck. Mud flew up in great lumps. Mouse barked.</p><p>\u201cThe stench?\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam guessed.</p><p>\u201cThe mess?\u201d</p><p>Abigail shrieked and leaped back as her brother stomped in the mud again.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that it disgusts little girls?\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled. \u201cThat certainly explains Jamie\u2019s fascination, but not Mouse\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She found herself wishing she could ask the other woman to tea. Mrs. Fitzwilliam wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected at all. She didn\u2019t ask for sympathy, didn\u2019t seem distressed at her lot in life, and she had a sense of humor. She might make a very good friend.</p><p>But, alas, it would never do to invite a cyprian to tea.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you are newly wed,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said. \u201cMay I offer my felicitations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Melisande murmured. Her brow wrinkled as she was reminded of how Jasper had left her the night before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve often thought that it must be hard to actually live with a man,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam mused.</p><p>Melisande darted a glance at her.</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s cheeks reddened. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t offended you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that a man can be so distant sometimes,\u201d the other lady said quietly. \u201cAs if one is intruding on his life. But perhaps not all men are like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cI\u2019ve only the one husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam looked down at the ground. \u201cI wonder, though, if it is even possible for a man and a woman to be truly close. In a spiritual sense, I mean. The sexes are so far apart, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Melisande clasped her hands together. Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s view of marriage was rather cynical, and a part of her\u2014the sensible, pragmatic part\u2014urged her to agree. But another part of her disagreed violently. \u201cI don\u2019t think that always has to be the case, surely? I have seen couples very much in love with each other, so close that they seem to understand each other\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you have such a bond with your husband?\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam asked. The question would\u2019ve been rude coming from any other lady, but Mrs. Fitzwilliam seemed honestly curious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Melisande answered. \u201cLord Vale and I don\u2019t have that type of marriage.\u201d</p><p>And that was what she wanted, wasn\u2019t it? She\u2019d loved once before and had [bef0%\" been wounded to her very soul. She simply couldn\u2019t endure that kind of pain again. Melisande felt a shrinking, a sadness, infuse her being as she acknowledged this fact. She would never have one of those glorious marriages based on love and mutual understanding.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said, and then they stood together silently and watched the children and Mouse.</p><p>Finally, Mrs. Fitzwilliam turned to her and smiled, a wonderfully beautiful smile that simply took Melisande\u2019s breath away. \u201cThank you for letting them play with your dog.\u201d</p> <p>As Melisande opened her mouth to answer, she heard a shout from behind her. \u201cMy lady wife! What a joy to find you here.\u201d</p><p>And she turned to see Vale riding toward them with another man.</p><p>MELISANDE HAD BEEN so deeply in conversation with the other woman that she didn\u2019t even notice Jasper until he hailed her. As he and Lord Hasselthorpe rode closer, the other woman turned and strolled unhurriedly away. Jasper recognized the woman. She called herself Mrs. Fitzwilliam, and she\u2019d been the Duke of Lister\u2019s mistress for almost a decade.</p><p>What had Melisande been doing, talking to a demimondaine?</p><p>\u201cYour wife keeps fast company,\u201d Lord Hasselthorpe said. \u201cSometimes young matrons get the idea in their head that they can become fashionable by skirting the edges of respectability. Best warn her, Vale.\u201d</p> <p>A biting retort was on Jasper\u2019s lips, but he swallowed it. He\u2019d just spent the prior half hour ingratiating himself to Hasselthorpe.</p><p>He grit his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d Hasselthorpe replied, pulling his horse to a stop before they\u2019d reached Melisande. \u201cNo doubt you wish to discuss matters with your lady wife, so I\u2019ll part ways with you here. You\u2019ve given me much to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll help us find the traitor?\u201d Jasper pressed.</p><p>Hasselthorpe hesitated. \u201cYour theories seem sound, Vale, but I dislike rushing into things. If my brother Thomas was indeed killed because of some cowardly traitor, you will have my help. But I would like to contemplate the matter further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cMay I call on you tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBest make it the day after,\u201d Hasselthorpe said.</p><p>Jasper nodded, though he hated the delay. He shook hands with the other man and then rode toward Melisande. She had turned to watch him approach, her hands folded at her waist, her back as usual impossibly straight. She didn\u2019t look at all like the woman who\u2019d seduced him so expertly the night before. For a moment, he wanted to take her by the shoulders and shake her, make her lose her impenetrable poise, make her back bend.</p><p>He did no such thing, of course; one didn\u2019t accost one\u2019s wife in a public park in the middle of the morning even if she had just been conversing with persons of low repute.</p><p>Instead, he smiled and hailed her again. \u201cOut for a walk, my hear [ waeigt?\u201d</p><p>Mouse caught sight of him and, abandoning a small, muddy boy, raced toward Vale\u2019s horse, barking frantically. The dog really did have the brains of a peahen. Fortunately, Belle merely snorted at the terrier dancing at her hooves.</p><p>\u201cMouse,\u201d Jasper said sternly. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Miraculously, the dog planted its arse in the grass.</p><p>Jasper swung down from the bay and looked at Mouse. Mouse wagged his tail. Jasper continued to stare until Mouse lowered his head, his tail still wagging so vigorously that the dog\u2019s rear half wriggled as well. Mouse laid his head almost on the ground and crept toward Jasper on his elbows, his mouth drawn back in a grimace of submission.</p> <p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Jasper muttered. One would think from the dog\u2019s behavior that he\u2019d beaten the animal.</p><p>Mouse took his words as permission to jump up, trot toward him, and sit expectantly at Jasper\u2019s feet. He stared down at the dog, nonplussed.</p><p>He heard a muffled giggle. Cocking an eye at Melisande, he saw that she now had one hand over her mouth. \u201cI think he likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but do I like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you like him.\u201d She strolled closer. \u201cHe likes you and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Jasper looked back at the dog. Mouse had his head tilted to the side as if awaiting instructions. \u201cGo on, then.\u201d</p><p>The dog gave one bark and ran in a wide circle around Jasper, Melisande, and the horse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d dislike me after I shut him in the cellar,\u201d Jasper muttered.</p><p>Melisande gave an elegant shrug. \u201cDogs are funny that way.\u201d She bent and picked up a stick between forefinger and thumb. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Jasper eyed the stick. It was muddy. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed by your thoughtfulness, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not for you, silly. Throw it for Mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he likes to fetch sticks,\u201d she said patiently, as if talking to a very slow child.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He took the stick, and Mouse immediately stopped running and looked up. Jasper flung the stick as far as he could, absurdly aware that he was showing off.</p><p>Mouse raced after the stick, pounced on it, and shook it vigorously. Then he trotted off around the pond.</p><p>Jasper frowned. \u201cI thought he was supposed to bring it back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said he was very good at playing fetch.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked down at his wife. The morning air had pinkened her normally pale cheeks; her eyes were sparkling at having winged him, and she looked . . . lovely. Quite, quite lovely.</p><p>He had to swallow before he could speak. \u201cAre you informing me that I\u2019ve lost a perfectly good stick?\u201d</p><p>There was a muted snap! from across the little pond as Mouse chewed through the stick.</p><p>Melisande winced. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019d want it back now anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t eat it, will he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never has before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d And then he wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say\u2014a circumstance that happened very rarely in his life. He wanted to ask her what she\u2019d been talking about with Mrs. Fitzwilliam, but for the life of him, he wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to phrase the question. Have you been taking lessons in seduction from a courtesan? didn\u2019t seem quite the thing. He noticed that Mrs. Fitzwilliam and her children seemed to have left the park. They were no longer in sight.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you not wait for me at breakfast?\u201d she asked into the silence.</p><p>They had begun to stroll about the pond, Jasper leading his horse. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. I thought after last night . . .\u201d</p><p>What? That she would want some time alone? No, that wasn\u2019t quite true. Perhaps he was the one who needed the solitude. And what did that say about him?</p><p>\u201cDid I disgust you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>And he was so startled that he halted and looked at her. Why ever would she think he was disgusted by her? To even ask revealed a tender spot in her soul. \u201cNo. No, my heart. You could never disgust me if you tried for a thousand years.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows were slightly knit as she searched his face. She seemed to be watching to see if he lied.</p><p>He bent toward her and murmured, \u201cYou intrigue me, you tempt me, you inflame me, but disgust? Never, sweet wife, never.\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath, and when she spoke, her voice was low. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what you expected, though.\u201d</p><p>He thought of her assured and controlled as she\u2019d taken his cock into her hand last night. The feel of her cool fingers, the sight of her intent face, had nearly made him spill right then and there.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, just a little hoarsely. \u201cNot what I expected. Melisande\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shot blasted from across the park. Jasper instinctively pulled Melisande into his arms. Mouse began barking hysterically. They could hear shouting and the high whinnying of a horse, but whatever was happening was hidden by a copse of trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Melisande asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jasper muttered.</p><p>A hatless gentleman on a big black horse galloped into view, coming from the sounds of the commotion.</p><p>Jasper put Melisande behind him. \u201cOy! You there! What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>The man yanked on his horse, pulling it into a half rear. [o ap&gt;&lt; \u201cI\u2019m after a doctor. I haven\u2019t the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs someone shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA murder attempt,\u201d the man cried as he spurred his horse. \u201cSomeone\u2019s tried to kill Lord Hasselthorpe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBUT WHY WOULD someone shoot at Lord Hasselthorpe?\u201d Melisande asked later that night. Vale had bundled her into the carriage and ordered her home before going to the scene of the assassination attempt. He\u2019d been away until after dinner, and this was the first she\u2019d been able to question him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered. He had come to her rooms, but now he paced as if he\u2019d been caged. \u201cPerhaps it was some kind of accident. An idiot practice shooting without a proper straw target to catch the bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Hyde Park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Vale\u2019s voice was overloud, and he looked at her in apology. \u201cForgive me, my lady wife. But if it was an assassin, he was a damn bad shot. Hasselthorpe was merely winged on the arm. He should make a full recovery. I saw plenty of similar wounds in the war, and they were hardly worth noting as long as infection didn\u2019t set in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad the hurt is so slight, then,\u201d Melisande said. She sat on one of the low armchairs before the fire\u2014the one they\u2019d made love in the night before, in fact\u2014and watched him. \u201cYou hardly ever talk about the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d he replied vaguely. He was standing by her dresser, poking his finger in a bowl of hairpins. He wore a red and black banyan over his breeches and shirt. \u201cNot much to tell, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? You were in the army for six years, though, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven years,\u201d he muttered. He moved to her wardrobe, which he flung open and peered at as if he\u2019d find the hidden secrets of the cosmos amongst her gowns.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you join?\u201d</p><p>He turned and stared at her blindly for a moment.</p><p>Then he blinked and laughed. \u201cI joined the army to learn how to be a man. Or at least that was my father\u2019s purpose. He thought me too lazy, too effete. And since there wasn\u2019t any use for me at home\u201d\u2014he shrugged carelessly\u2014\u201cwhy not buy a commission for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your best friend, Reynaud St. Aubyn, bought a commission at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. We were terribly excited to join the 28th Regiment of Foot. May it rest in peace.\u201d He closed the wardrobe doors and went to brood at the window.</p><p>Perhaps she should leave it be. Stop poking at him, let his secrets lie buried. But some part of her wouldn\u2019t let go. Every bit of his life was fascinating to her, and this bit that he kept hidden even more so than the others. Sighing, she rose from the armchair. She wore a heavy satin wrap over her chemise, and she slipped out of the wrap now, carefully laying it on the chair.</p><p>\u201cDid you like army life?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>She could see his reflection watching her in the black glass of the window. \u201cSome of it. Men complain [. Mh=\" of the ghastly food, the marches, the living in tents. But it can be a lark at times. Sitting by a campfire, trying to eat boiled peasemeal and bacon.\u201d</p><p>She drew off her chemise as she listened, and he abruptly stopped talking. Nude, she walked toward him and laid her hands on his back. His muscles were rock-hard, as if he\u2019d turned to granite.</p><p>\u201cAnd the battles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike being in hell,\u201d he whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smoothed her hands down his broad back, feeling the valley of his spine, the muscles on either side. Like being in hell. She ached for the part of him that had been in hell. \u201cWere you in many battles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d He sighed and lowered his head as she dug her thumbs into the muscles above his hips.</p><p>She tapped his shoulder. \u201cTake this off.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged out of his banyan and shirt, but when he made to turn around, she firmly pushed him back. She pressed her thumbs in hard, small circles on either side of his spine. He groaned and his head fell forward again as he braced his hands on either side of the windowsill.</p> <p>\u201cYou were at Quebec,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThat was the only real battle. The rest were skirmishes. Some lasted only minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Spinner\u2019s Falls?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders hunched as if she\u2019d hit him, but he didn\u2019t say a word. She knew that Spinner\u2019s Falls had been a massacre. She\u2019d comforted Emeline when word finally came back that Reynaud had not survived his capture there. She should push\u2014this was obviously his weak point. But she couldn\u2019t be so ruthless. She hated the thought of hurting him anew.</p><p>Instead, she took his hand and led him to her bed. He stood silently, passively, as she stripped him of his remaining clothes\u2014although his cock was far from passive. Then she pushed him onto the bed and climbed in beside him. She propped herself up on an elbow next to him and drew her free hand down over his chest. She felt grateful that she had this man, at least for this time, for herself. Here, now, she could do with him as she wished.</p> <p>It was a gift. A glorious gift.</p><p>So she leaned down and trailed soft, wet kisses along his side, licking the ridge of his ribs, nipping at the jut of his hip bone. Above her, he rumbled something, a warning perhaps, or maybe encouragement. She wasn\u2019t sure, and she didn\u2019t care. In front of her was her goal: his penis, bold and thick and hard. She touched it with just a fingertip, running along its length. Then she leaned down and softly, gently, kissed him on the weeping eye.</p><p>His hips arched, and he grabbed her hair, pulling her face up. \u201cDon\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>There were beads of sweat on his upper lip, and his eyes were wild and sorrowful.</p><p>Deserve was an interesting choice of word, and she stored it away so that she could bring it out and examine it later.</p><p>so \"3\"&gt;Right now, though, she deliberately licked her lips, tasting his seed, and said, \u201cI want to.\u201d She wanted to bring him peace if she could.</p> <p>His grip relaxed, perhaps in surprise, but she took advantage by dipping her head and taking his cock into her mouth. Then his hands tightened again, but she hardly thought it was to stop her now.</p><p>She sucked on the tip, a salty plum in her mouth, and ran her hand dreamily down the length. She hadn\u2019t a lot of practice at this, and if there was a proper way of doing it, she wasn\u2019t aware, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind. He muttered something unintelligible and bucked his hips. She smiled secretly and let his cock pull out of her mouth with a soft pop. She tested her teeth against the meaty head, stroking faster below. There was no give in his shaft. He was hard and ready and\u2014</p><p>He jackknifed up and flipped her beneath him. And then he was looming large and menacing over her, his face dark as he growled, \u201cDo you think me a plaything, my lady?\u201d</p><p>She opened her legs wide, planted her feet, and arched her hips off the bed. She rubbed her sex against his length, watching as his eyelids fell in reaction.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPerhaps your cock is my favorite toy. Perhaps I want my toy in my\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he thrust fast and hard, making her lose her words on a gasp of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWanton,\u201d he gritted. \u201cMy wanton.\u201d</p><p>And she could only laugh in sheer erotic frenzy. She bucked her hips up, making him thrust harder just to stay on top. She laughed aloud as she rotated and ground against him, the sweat from his exertions dripping onto her bare breasts. He gripped her hips and held her firmly still as he thudded into her, galloping at an impossible pace. Stars lit behind her open eyes, and she threw her head back and gasped in ecstasy. She held on to his slippery shoulders, feeling the heat spread from her center, conscious dimly that she still laughed aloud even as she crested in glory.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he shuddered in her arms, swearing steadily under his breath, that her vision cleared and she saw that above her his face was a mask of tragedy.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>All of the suitors set off after the ring of bronze, and Princess Surcease sighed and went back into the castle. But Jack found a quiet corner and opened his little tin snuffbox. And what should be inside but exactly what he needed: a suit of armor made of night and wind and the sharpest sword in the world. Jack put the suit on his stumpy body and grasped the sword. Then whoosh! Whist! he stood before a lake. Jack was just wondering if this was the right lake, when an enormous serpent rose up out of the water. What a mighty battle commenced! The serpent was very large and Jack very small, but he did have the sharpest sword in the world, and that suit certainly helped. In the end, the serpent lay dead and the ring lay in Jack\u2019s hand. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>He\u2019d apparently married a wanton, Ja ^CK</p><p>Of course, all that wonderfulness didn\u2019t quite explain why he was riding away from his town house this morning, having once again eaten breakfast without his wife. This came perilously close to cowardice. But while his body was enthralled by her sensuality, his intellect coldly wondered where she\u2019d gained her knowledge. She must\u2019ve had at least one lover\u2014possibly more\u2014and he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to examine that thought too closely. The image of another man teaching her. Showing her how to take a cock into her sweet, warm mouth . . .</p><p>He growled. A passing chimney sweep shot him a startled glance and shied away.</p><p>Jasper pushed the thought from his mind. He hunched his shoulders and drew up his collar against the misty drizzle. The good weather had finally broken, and London was a gray, gloomy world this morning. His mind drifted back to last night. He remembered his wife reflected in the black window as she drew her chemise from her tall, slender body. She\u2019d looked pale and otherworldly, her light brown hair swirling about her hips.</p><p>She probably thought him a coward or, worse, an imbecile. He\u2019d left her after they\u2019d made love, without so much as a good night, and spent the night on his pallet. He was an ass. But those eyes, watching him as she kissed his chest, watching him as she asked about Spinner\u2019s Falls. God. She\u2019d had no idea what she\u2019d married. Perhaps it was best that he\u2019d left so ungraciously. Better not to give her hope of something more when he didn\u2019t have it in him to be anything more.</p><p>And now he didn\u2019t even make sense in his own mind. He looked up to see Matthew Horn\u2019s town house, glad that he could escape these maudlin musings.</p><p>Jasper dismounted Belle and handed the reins to a boy, then leapt up the front steps. A minute later, he was prowling Horn\u2019s library, waiting for him to come down from wherever he was.</p><p>He\u2019d just bent to peer at a large and dusty volume when Horn\u2019s voice came from the door. \u201cLooking for some light reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering why anyone would want a history of copper mining.\u201d Jasper straightened and grinned.</p><p>Horn made a wry face. \u201cMy pater\u2019s. Not that it did him any good. The mine he picked to invest in failed.\u201d He strolled into the room and flung himself into a large chair, looping his leg over the arm. \u201cThe Horns are not exactly known for their financial sense.\u201d</p><p>Jasper grimaced sympathetically. \u201cBad luck, that.\u201d</p><p>Horn shrugged. \u201cWant some tea? Seems early for whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d Jasper wandered to a framed map of the world and tried to make out where Italy was.</p><p>\u201cCome about Spinner\u2019s Falls again, have you?\u201d Horn asked.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d Jasper agreed without turning. Was it possible Italy wasn\u2019t on the map at all? \u201cHave you heard about what happened to Hasselthorpe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot in Hyde Park. They\u2019re calling it an assassination attempt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And right after Hasselthorpe agreed to think about helping me.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief silence, broken by Horn\u2019s incredulous laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t think the two are related?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shrugged. He wasn\u2019t sure, of course, but the whole thing was a very strange coincidence.</p><p>\u201cI still think you ought let Spinner\u2019s Falls go,\u201d Horn said quietly.</p><p>Jasper didn\u2019t reply. If he was capable of letting this go, he would.</p><p>Horn sighed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Jasper turned and glanced at Horn. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Horn waved a vague hand. \u201cHere and there. What I don\u2019t understand is why someone would betray the regiment. What would be the point? Especially if it was one of us who was captured. Seems like a good way to get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper blew out a breath. \u201cDon\u2019t think he meant to be captured\u2014the traitor, that is. Probably thought to lie low and avoid the fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery one of us that was captured fought and fought well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you\u2019re right.\u201d Jasper turned back to the map.</p><p>\u201cThen what possible reason to betray the regiment and get us all killed? I think you\u2019ve got hold of the wrong end of the stick, old man. There wasn\u2019t any traitor. Spinner\u2019s Falls was just bad luck, plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Jasper leaned so close to the map that his nose nearly touched the parchment. \u201cBut I can think of one very good reason someone might betray us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney.\u201d Jasper gave up on the map entirely. \u201cThe French had made it known that they\u2019d pay good money for information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spy?\u201d Matthew\u2019s dark eyebrows shot up. He didn\u2019t look particularly convinced.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I and anyone else who was there would tear the bloody bastard limb from limb, that\u2019s why,\u201d Matthew replied. He jumped up from his chair as if he couldn\u2019t stay still anymore.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to make sure no one found out,\u201d Jasper said softly.</p><p>Matthew was looking out the window now and merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLook, I have no more love of the idea than you,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cBut if we were betrayed, if they all died from one man\u2019s greed, if we marched through that forest and endured . . .\u201d He stopped, unable to say the rest.</p><p>Jasper closed his eyes, but in the blackness, he still saw the glowing stick pressing into flesh, still smelled the stench of burned human skin. He opened his eyes. Matthew was watching him without expression.</p><p>\u201cWe need\u2014I need\u2014to find him and bring him to justice. Make him pay for his sins,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Hasselthorpe? Have you seen him since the shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe refuses to see me. I sent a message this morning asking for an interview, and he sent it back saying he intends to retire to his country estate to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Jasper brooded over the map again.</p><p>\u201cYou need to speak to Alistair Munroe,\u201d Horn said from behind him.</p><p>Jasper turned. \u201cYou think he\u2019s the traitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Matthew shook his head. \u201cBut he was there. He might remember something we haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried writing him.\u201d Jasper grimaced in frustration. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t write back.\u201d</p><p>Matthew looked at him steadily. \u201cThen you\u2019ll just have to travel to Scotland, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>MELISANDE SAW HER husband for the first time that day at dinner. She\u2019d actually begun to wonder if he was avoiding her, if something was the matter, but he seemed perfectly normal now as he forked up peas and joked with the footmen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Vale asked her carelessly.</p><p>Really, he could be a most aggravating man at times. \u201cI took luncheon with your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d He gestured to the footman for more wine.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. She served stuffed artichokes and cold sliced ham.\u201d</p> <p>He shuddered. \u201cArtichokes. I never know how to eat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scrape the leaf against your teeth. Quite easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leaves. Who thinks to eat leaves?\u201d he asked, apparently rhetorically. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Probably some woman discovered artichokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Romans ate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Roman woman, then. She probably served up a plate of leaves to her husband and said, \u2018Here you are, dear, eat hearty.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Melisande found herself smiling at Vale\u2019s depiction of the fictional Roman wife and her unfortunate husband. \u201cIn any case, the artichokes your mother served were very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Vale grunted skeptically. \u201cI expect she told you all about my misspent youth.\u201d</p><p>Melisande ate a pea. \u201cYou expect correctly.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cAnything particularly egregious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently you spat up a lot as a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m over that,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you had a flirtatio cad oven with a milkmaid at the age of sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten that,\u201d Vale exclaimed. \u201cLovely girl. Agnes, or was it Alice? Perhaps Arabella\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Arabella,\u201d Melisande murmured.</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cShe had lovely peaches-and-cream skin and the biggest . . .\u201d He suddenly coughed.</p><p>\u201cFeet?\u201d Melisande asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cAmazing, really. Her feet.\u201d His eyes gleamed wickedly at her.</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Melisande said, but she had to repress a smile. \u201cAnd what about your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well.\u201d Jasper stuck a large piece of beef in his mouth and chewed vigorously before swallowing. \u201cI went \u2019round to Matthew Horn\u2019s house. Remember him? Fellow from my mother\u2019s garden party?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe it, but he has a map of the world that doesn\u2019t have Italy on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you weren\u2019t looking in the right spot,\u201d she said kindly.</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d He shook his head and drank some wine. \u201cIt\u2019s this side of Russia and above Africa. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d\u2019ve noticed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the map was made by someone who disliked Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d He seemed much struck by the thought. \u201cJust decided to do away with Italy altogether?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat an idea! I wouldn\u2019t have had to study Latin all those years if Italy had disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you already have, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a better man for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Jasper sounded unsure.</p><p>Melisande ate some boiled carrots. They were quite good. Cook had added something sweet\u2014honey, perhaps. She\u2019d have to remember to compliment the little woman. \u201cAnd did you discuss anything more with Mr. Horn besides his defective map?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we talked about a fellow we know in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Vale was drinking more wine, and it was hard to read his expression. Melisande\u2019s interest sharpened. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Alistair Munroe. He was attached to my regiment, but he wasn\u2019t a soldier. He was sent by the crown to record animals and plants in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He sounds like a fascinating man.\u201d</p><p>Vale frowned. \u201cHe is if you like talking about ferns for hours at a time.\u201d</p><p>Melisande sipped her wine. \u201cI quite like ferns.\u201d</p><p>Vale frowned harder. \u201cIn any case, I\u2019m thinking of making a trip up to jolly old Scotland to see him.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence as Melisande con c Meto templated her cooling peas and carrots. Was he running from her? She\u2019d so enjoyed living in his house and knowing he was nearby. Even if he was away for large parts of the day or stayed out until all hours of the night, she knew he\u2019d come home eventually. Just being in the same house as he soothed her soul. Now she wouldn\u2019t have even that.</p><p>Vale cleared his throat. \u201cThing is, he lives north of Edinburgh. It\u2019s a ways away, a trip of a week or more on bad roads in a carriage. There\u2019ll be drafty inns and bad food and the possibility of highwaymen\u2014probably be an awful trip altogether.\u201d</p><p>He had transferred his scowl to his plate. He jabbed at his beef with the tines of his fork.</p><p>Melisande was silent, no longer eating because her throat seemed to have closed. He was going to see a man, whom, by his own admission, he didn\u2019t particularly like or know well. Why?</p><p>\u201cBut, despite all that, I wonder if you\u2019d like to accompany me, my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>She was so wrapped up in her own thoughts that for a minute his words didn\u2019t make sense. She looked at him to find that he was watching her intently, his eyes bright blue-green. A blessed relief began spreading through her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you leave?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something important to discuss with Munroe. Something that can\u2019t wait.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cYou can take Mouse. We\u2019ll have to bring his leash, of course, and make sure he doesn\u2019t scare the horses at inns. It really won\u2019t be comfortable, and you might be terribly bored, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Melisande smiled and resumed eating. \u201cI\u2019d like to come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHEY\u2019RE TRAVELING TO Scotland,\u201d Bernie the footman said as he brought the dish of peas back into the kitchen.</p><p>Sally Suchlike nearly dropped her spoon into her bowl of soup. Scotland? That heathen land? They said the men grew beards so fierce you could hardly see their eyes. And it was a well-known fact that the Scots didn\u2019t bathe.</p><p>Cook was obviously having similar thoughts. \u201cAnd them only newly married,\u201d she lamented as she set dishes of lemon curd tart on a tray. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, truly it is.\u201d</p><p>She gestured for Bernie to take the tray in and then stopped him with a hand on his arm. \u201cHave they said how long they\u2019ll be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only now told my lady, but it\u2019d have to be weeks, won\u2019t it?\u201d The footman shrugged, nearly upsetting the tray on his shoulder. \u201cMonths, even. An\u2019 they leave right away. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>One of the scullery maids burst into tears as Bernie left the kitchen.</p><p>Sally tried to swallow, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any spit left in her mouth. She\u2019d have to travel with Lady Vale to Scotland. That was what lady\u2019 cwasut s maids did. Suddenly her new position, with the lovely increase in wages\u2014enough even to set some by\u2014didn\u2019t seem so grand. Sally shuddered. Scotland was the edge of the world.</p><p>\u201cHere now, there\u2019s no need to carry on like this.\u201d Mr. Pynch\u2019s deep voice came from beside the fireplace where he was smoking his nightly pipe.</p><p>At first Sally thought he was admonishing her, but he was clearly addressing Bitsy, the scullery maid.</p><p>\u201cScotland isn\u2019t as bad as all that,\u201d the valet said.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to Scotland, then, Mr. Pynch?\u201d Sally asked. Perhaps if he\u2019d journeyed there and back and survived, it wouldn\u2019t be so terrible.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Pynch said, dashing her hopes. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known Scotsmen in the army, and they\u2019re just the same as us, saving for the fact that they speak funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Sally looked down at her beef soup, made from the bones left over from the roast Cook had prepared for their master and mistress. It was a very good soup. Sally had been enjoying it until just a couple of minutes ago. But now her stomach made a little unpleasant turn at the sight of the grease floating on top. Knowing a Scotsman and traveling to Scotland were two entirely different things, and Sally was almost angry with Mr. Pynch for not knowing the difference. His Scotsmen were probably tamed from their time in the army. There was no way to know what a Scotsman was like on his home ground, so to speak. Perhaps they had a liking for short blond girls from London. Perhaps she\u2019d be kidnapped from her bed and used in horrible ways\u2014or worse.</p><p>\u201cNow, see here, my girl.\u201d Mr. Pynch\u2019s voice was very near.</p><p>Sally looked up to find that the valet had taken the seat opposite her at the table. The kitchen servants had gone back to work while she brooded. Bitsy was snuffling over the pan of dishes she washed. No one paid any mind to the valet and the lady\u2019s maid at the far end of the long kitchen table.</p><p>Mr. Pynch\u2019s eyes were bright and intent on her. Sally had never noticed before what a lovely shade of green they were.</p><p>The valet put his elbows on the table, his long, white clay pipe in one hand. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear in Scotland. It\u2019s just a place like any other.\u201d</p><p>Sally stirred her spoon about in her bowl of cooling soup. \u201cI\u2019ve never been farther than Greenwich in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Where were you born then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven Dials,\u201d she said, and then peered up at him to see if he\u2019d sneer at the knowledge she\u2019d been raised in such a hellhole.</p><p>But he merely nodded his head and sucked on the end of his pipe, blowing fragrant smoke to the side so it wouldn\u2019t get in her eyes. \u201cAnd do you have family there still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my pa.\u201d She wrinkled her nose and confessed, \u201cLeastwise, he used to live there. I haven\u2019t seen him in years, so that might not be true anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad sort was your pa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad.\u201d She traced the rim of her soup bowl with a finger. \u201cHe didn\u2019t beat me much, and he fed me when he could. But I had to get out of there. It was like I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him to see if he understood.</p><p>He nodded, pulling on his pipe again. \u201cAnd your mam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDied when I was born.\u201d The soup smelled good again, and she took a spoonful. \u201cNo brothers or sisters either. Leastwise none that I know of.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and seemed quite content to watch her eat the soup as he smoked his pipe. Around them, the kitchen and downstairs servants scurried about, doing their jobs, but this was a time of rest for Sally and Mr. Pynch.</p><p>She ate half her soup and then looked up at him. \u201cWhere are you from, then, Mr. Pynch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a ways off. I was born in Cornwall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She stared curiously at him. Cornwall seemed nearly as foreign as Scotland. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have an accent.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy people are fisher folk. I got the wandering urge, and when the army men came to town with their drums and ribbons and flash uniforms, I took the king\u2019s shilling fast enough.\u201d One corner of his mouth curved in a funny sort of half-smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t take me long to find out there\u2019s more to His Majesty\u2019s army than pretty uniforms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>Sally looked down at her soup, trying to imagine big, bald Mr. Pynch as a lanky fifteen-year-old. She couldn\u2019t do it. He was too much a man now to have ever been a child. \u201cDo you still have family in Cornwall?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy mother and a half-dozen brothers and sisters. My father died when I was in the Colonies. Didn\u2019t know about it until I returned to England two years later. Mam said she paid for a letter to be written and sent to me, but I never got one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been sad, coming home to find your father dead for two years.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the way of the world, lass. Nothing a man can do but go on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d She frowned a little, thinking of wild highland Scotsmen with beards that covered their faces.</p><p>\u201cLass.\u201d Mr. Pynch had stretched out his arm and tapped her hand with one large, blunt-nailed finger. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anything to fear in Scotland. But if there is, I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>And Sally could only stare dumbly into Mr. Pynch\u2019s steady green eyes, the thought of him keeping her safe warming her belly.</p><p>WHEN HE STILL hadn\u2019t come to her rooms by midnight, Melisande went looking for Vale. Perhaps he\u2019d simply gone to his own bed, not deigning to visit her that night, but she didn\u2019t think so. She hadn\u2019t heard any voices from his room next door. How the man got enough sleep when he stayed up until all hours and then left the house before she rose was a curiosity. Perhaps he didn\u2019t need sleep at all.</p> <p>In any case, she was tired of waiting for him to come to her. So she left her room\u2014still in a shambles from Suchlike\u2019s hurried packing\u2014and went out in the hall to search for Jasper. He wasn\u2019t in the library or any of the sitting rooms, and finally she was forced to inquire of Oaks if he knew where her husband was. Then she hoped that her cheeks didn\u2019t flame in embarrassment when she learned that he\u2019d gone out without a word to her.</p><p>She felt like kicking something, but since gentlewomen did no such thing, she merely thanked Oaks and ascended the stairs again. Why was he doing this? Asking her to accompany him to Scotland, then avoiding her? Had he even thought about a days-long carriage ride with her? Or would he spend the journey atop the carriage with the luggage? It was so strange. First he would pursue her for days, and then he would suddenly disappear, just when she thought they were drawing closer.</p><p>Melisande exhaled heavily as she came to her own bedroom door, but then she hesitated. Vale\u2019s door was right next to hers. Really, the temptation was too great. She strode to her husband\u2019s door and opened it. The room was empty, although Mr. Pynch\u2019s work was obvious: Rows of shirts, waistcoats, and neck clothes were laid out on the bed in preparation for packing. Melisande shut the door gently behind her.</p><p>She wandered to the bed and touched a fingertip to the dark red coverlet. He would sprawl here at night, his long limbs spread wide. Did he sleep on his back, or on his belly, his tousled head half shoved beneath a pillow? Somehow she imagined him sleeping in the nude, although for all she knew, he had a drawerful of nightshirts. It was such an intimate thing, sleeping with another person. One\u2019s shields were all thrown down in sleep, leaving one vulnerable, almost childlike. She wished desperately that he would share her bed. Stay the night and let himself be at his most vulnerable with her.</p><p>She sighed and turned from the bed. On his dresser he had a framed miniature portrait of his mother. A few brown hairs were caught in the bristles of his brush. One was almost red. She took her handkerchief from her sleeve and carefully folded the hairs inside before tucking it away again.</p> <p>She went to the bedside table and glanced at the book sitting there\u2014a history of the English kings\u2014then went to the window and looked out. His view was nearly the same as hers: the back of the garden. She glanced around the room, frustrated. There were far more things lying about\u2014clothing, books, odd bits of string, a pinecone, broken pens, a penknife, and ink\u2014but nothing that told her very much about her husband. How silly to sneak in here, thinking she might find out more about Jasper. She shook her head at her own folly, and then her gaze fell on the dressing room door. A dressing room would hardly hold more intimate stuff than what she\u2019d seen, but she\u2019d already come this far.</p><p>Melisande turned the handle of the door. Inside was another dresser, various racks for holding clothes, a narrow cot, and in the corner, against the wall, a thin pallet and blanket. Melisande cocked her head. Odd. Why both a cot and a pallet? Mr. Pynch needed only one, surely. And why a pallet? Vale struck her as a generous employer. Why such a mean bed for his faithful valet?</p><p>She stepped into the narrow room, went around the cot, and bent to look at the pallet. A single candle stood nearby in a holder very much covered in old, burnt wax, and a book lay half under the carelessly tossed blanket. She looked from the pallet t cm t veo the cot. Actually, the cot didn\u2019t look as if anyone slept there at all\u2014the mattress was bare. Melisande pulled the blanket back from the pallet to read the title of the book. It was a book of poems by John Donne. She stared at it a moment, thinking what an odd choice of reading matter for a valet, when she noticed the hair on the pillow. It was dark brown, almost red.</p><p>Behind her, someone cleared his throat.</p><p>Melisande whirled and saw Mr. Pynch, his eyebrows raised. \u201cMay I help you find something, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Melisande hid trembling hands in her skirts, very glad that it wasn\u2019t Vale who\u2019d discovered her. Although being caught by the valet rummaging through her husband\u2019s things was embarrassing enough. She tilted her chin and sailed to the door of the bedroom.</p> <p>But then she hesitated and looked back at the valet. \u201cYou\u2019ve served my husband for many years, haven\u2019t you, Mr. Pynch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he always slept so little?\u201d</p><p>The big bald man picked up one of the neck cloths from the bed and carefully refolded it. \u201cAye, since I\u2019ve known him, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men don\u2019t need as much sleep,\u201d the valet said.</p><p>She only looked at him.</p><p>He replaced the neck cloth and finally looked at her. He sighed as if she\u2019d pressed him. \u201cSome soldiers don\u2019t sleep as well as they ought. Lord Vale . . . well, he likes company. Especially during the hours it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of the dark?\u201d</p><p>He straightened and his frown was quite ferocious. \u201cI received a ball to the leg in the war.\u201d</p><p>Melisande blinked, startled at the change of subject. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The valet waved away her sympathy. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Only bothers me when it rains sometimes. But when I got it, that ball took me down. We were in battle, and I was lying there, with a Frenchie standing over me about to stick me with his bayonet when Lord Vale came charging. There was a stand of Frenchies with rifles raised between him and me, but that didn\u2019t stop him. They fired on him, and how he didn\u2019t fall, I don\u2019t know, but he wore a grin the entire time. Cut them down, too, my lady. Wasn\u2019t one standing when he was done.\u201d</p><p>Melisande drew a shuddering breath. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided right then and there, my lady,\u201d Mr. Pynch said, \u201cthat I\u2019d follow Lord Vale into hell itself, should he tell me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me this, Mr. Pynch,\u201d Melisande said. She opened the door. \u201cPlease inform Lord Vale that I shall be ready to travel at eight o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch bowed. \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded and left, but she couldn\u2019t help a lingering thought. The entire time Mr. Pynch had told her his story, he\u2019d stood as che\u2019oddif guarding the little dressing room.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Now, when Jack got back to the castle, he did a very strange thing. He donned once again his fool\u2019s rags and went down to the castle\u2019s kitchens. The royal supper was being prepared, and there was a great deal of activity. The head cook shouted, the footmen ran back and forth, the scullery maids scrubbed dishes, and all the minor cooks chopped and stirred and baked. No one noticed as Jack crept to where a small boy stirred a soup pot over the fire.</p><p>\u201cHist,\u201d said Jack to the boy. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a silver coin if you\u2019ll let me stir the princess\u2019s soup.\u201d</p><p>Well, the boy liked this exchange very much. The minute his back was turned, Jack dropped the bronze ring into the soup. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>The carriage bumped over a great rut in the road and swayed. Melisande swayed with it, having learned on the first day of their journey that it was far easier to let herself move with the carriage rather than hold herself stiff against it. It was now the third day, and she was quite used to swaying. Her shoulder bumped gently against Suchlike, curled next to her and dozing. Mouse was on the seat on her other side, also asleep. Every once in a while, the dog let out a little snore.</p><p>Melisande looked out the window. They appeared to be in the middle of nowhere. Blue-green hills rolled away into the distance, demarcated by hedges and drystone walls. The light was beginning to fade.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we have stopped by now?\u201d she asked her husband.</p><p>Vale lounged on the opposite seat, his legs canted diagonally across the carriage so that his feet were almost touching hers. His eyes were shut, but he answered her immediately, confirming her suspicion that he hadn\u2019t been asleep at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re correct. We should\u2019ve stopped in Birkham, but the coachman says the inn was closed. He\u2019s taken us off the main road to find the next inn, but I suspect he may\u2019ve lost his way.\u201d</p><p>Vale opened one eye and peered out the window, not looking at all anxious that dark was falling and they appeared to be lost.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely gone off the main way,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the inn\u2019s in the middle of a cow pasture.\u201d</p><p>Melisande heaved a sigh and began to put away the fairy tale she\u2019d been translating. She was almost done now, the strange fairy tale unfolding beneath her pen. It was about a soldier who\u2019d been turned into a funny little man. A funny little man who was nevertheless very brave. He didn\u2019t seem a normal hero for a fairy tale, but then again, none of the fairy-tale heroes in Emeline\u2019s book were exactly normal. The translation would have to wait for tomorrow in any case. It was too dark to see properly now.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we turn back?\u201d she asked Vale as she closed her writing case. \u201cA derelict inn is better shelter th f=\"4an abandoned hills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent point, dear wife, but I\u2019m afraid it will be dark before we can return to Birkham anyway. Better to press on.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes again, which was very frustrating.</p><p>Melisande gazed out the window for a bit, worrying her lip. She glanced at her still-sleeping maid and lowered her voice. \u201cI promised Suchlike we wouldn\u2019t travel after dark. She\u2019s never left London before, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll learn lots on this trip,\u201d her husband said without opening his eyes. \u201cNever fear. The coachman and footmen are armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Melisande folded her arms. \u201cHow well do you know Mr. Munroe?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already spent the previous two days trying to find out what Vale needed to speak to the man about. He merely changed the subject when she asked him questions. Now she tried a different tack.</p><p>\u201cSir Alistair Munroe,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He must\u2019ve felt her exasperated look, because although his eyes never opened, he smiled. \u201cKnighted for service to the crown. He wrote a book describing the plants and animals of the New World. More than plants and animals, actually. Fishes and birds and insects as well. It\u2019s a massive, portfolio-sized thing, but the engravings are quite lovely. Hand-colored and based on his own sketches. It impressed King George enough that he had Munroe to tea\u2014or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>Melisande thought about this naturalist who\u2019d been to tea with the king. \u201cHe must\u2019ve spent many years in the Colonies to have enough material to write a book. Was he with your regiment the entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He moved around from regiment to regiment, according to where they were marching. He was only with the 28th three months or so,\u201d Vale said. \u201cHe joined us just before we marched to Quebec.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sleepy, which made Melisande suspicious. Twice now he\u2019d conveniently fallen asleep when she was questioning him.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to him when he was with your regiment? What is he like?\u201d</p><p>Vale switched his crossed legs without opening his eyes. \u201cOh, very Scots. Taciturn and not much for long speeches. He had a wicked sense of humor, though. I do remember that.

He had boxes and glass vials for various specimens, and different-sized presses for preserving leaves and flowers. He took it apart once, and you should\u2019ve seen the hardened soldiers, some who\u2019d been in the army decades and didn\u2019t turn a hair at anything, standing and gawking at his trunk like little boys at the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been nice,\u201d Melisande said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt was. It was.\u201d He sounded far away in the gathering darkness.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps he will show it to me when we visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d he said from the gloom on the other side of the carriage. \u201cIt was destroyed when we were attacked by the Indians. Smashed to bits, all his specimens dragged out and scattered, completely ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow awful! Poor man. It must\u2019ve been terrible when he saw what had been done to his collection.\u201d</p><p>There was silence from the other side of the carriage.</p><p>\u201cJasper?\u201d She wished she could see his face.</p> <p>\u201cHe never saw.\u201d Vale\u2019s voice came abruptly from the darkness. \u201cHis wounds . . . He never made it back to the scene of the massacre. I didn\u2019t either. I only heard what had happened to his trunk months later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Melisande gazed blindly out the black window. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what she apologized for\u2014the broken trunk, the lost artifacts, the massacre itself, or the fact that neither man survived entirely the same as before. \u201cWhat\u2019s he look like, Sir Alistair? Is he young? Old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit older than me, perhaps.\u201d Vale hesitated. \u201cYou should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she interrupted him, leaning forward. \u201cLook.\u201d She\u2019d thought she\u2019d seen movement outside the window.</p><p>A shot sounded, crashingly loud in the night air. Melisande flinched. Suchlike woke with a little scream, and Mouse jumped to his feet and barked.</p><p>A loud, hoarse voice came from without. \u201cStand and deliver!\u201d</p> <p>The carriage shuddered to a halt.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>JASPER HAD BEEN worried about this very thing since night had begun to fall. They were in prime territory for a highway robbery. He didn\u2019t much mind the loss of his purse, but he was damned if he\u2019d let anyone touch Melisande.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d she began, but he reached across and laid his hand gently over her mouth. She was a smart woman. She immediately held still. She drew Mouse into her lap and wrapped her hand around his muzzle.</p><p>The little lady\u2019s maid had her fist stuffed into her mouth, her eyes wide and round. She didn\u2019t make a sound, but Jasper pressed a finger across his own lips. Although he had no idea if the women could see him adequately in the dark carriage.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t the coachman tried to make a run for it? The answer came to Jasper even as he ran through his options. The coachman had already admitted he didn\u2019t know the terrain well. He\u2019d probably been afraid of overturning the carriage in the dark and killing them all.</p><p>\u201cCome out o\u2019 there,\u201d a second man called.</p><p>So there were at least two, probably more. He had two footmen and two coachmen, along with two men on horses, one of them Pynch. Six men in all. But how many robbers?</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019you hear me? Get out o\u2019 there!\u201d the second voice shouted. One would be holding a gun on the coachman to kee koacontp him from moving the carriage. Another would be covering the outriders. A third would be in charge of relieving them of any valuables\u2014that is, if there were only three. If there were more\u2014</p><p>\u201cDammit! Come out or I\u2019m coming in, and I\u2019ll be shooting when I do!\u201d</p><p>Melisande\u2019s maid moaned, low and fearful, Mouse struggled, but his dear wife held him firmly and was silent. A smart robber would start killing the servants outside one by one to force them to emerge. But this highwayman might just be stupid enough to\u2014</p><p>The carriage door was flung open, and a man holding a pistol leaned into the carriage. Jasper grabbed his gun arm and pulled hard. The gun went off, shattering the opposite carriage window. The maid screamed. The robber half fell into the carriage. Jasper twisted the pistol away from him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d he said to Melisande, and slammed the pistol grip down on the man\u2019s temple, shattering the bone. He did it quickly again, three more times, vicious and hard, just to make sure the man was dead, then dropped the pistol. He hated handling guns.</p><p>From outside came a shout and then a gunshot.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Get down,\u201d he ordered Melisande and the girl. A bullet could blow right through the wood of the carriage. She didn\u2019t protest and lay across her seat with the maid and the dog.</p><p>Running footsteps came nearer, and Jasper moved in front of the women, bracing himself.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Pynch\u2019s broad face peered into the carriage door. \u201cAre you safe, my lord? Are the women\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d Jasper turned to Melisande, running his hands over her face and hair in the dark. \u201cAre you all right, my dearest love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d She straightened immediately, her back as straight as ever, and a pang tore at his heart. If ever she were hurt, if ever he could not protect her . . .</p><p>The maid was trembling violently. Melisande let go of the dog and pulled the girl into her arms, patting her back comfortingly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Lord Vale and Mr. Pynch have kept us safe.\u201d</p><p>Mouse jumped to the floor of the carriage and growled at the dead robber.</p><p>Pynch cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019ve captured one of the highwaymen, my lord. The other galloped away.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked at him. Gunpowder blackened half of Pynch\u2019s face. Jasper grinned. His valet had always been an excellent shot.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get this one out of the carriage,\u201d he told Pynch. \u201cMelisande, please stay here until we are sure it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded bravely, her chin up. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>And even though Pynch and the maid were watching, Jasper couldn\u2019t help leaning over to kiss her hard. It had all happened so fast. If things had turned out a little differently, he might\u2019ve lost her.</p><p>Jasper scrambled from the carriage, eager to meet the man who\u2019d put his sweet wife in danger. First, though, he helped Pynch pull the kyncmbldead robber out of the carriage. He hoped Melisande hadn\u2019t looked too closely. He\u2019d crushed the robber\u2019s cheekbone and temple.</p><p>Mouse jumped down from the carriage.</p><p>Jasper straightened. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here, my lord.\u201d Pynch gestured to a tree by the side of the road where several footmen stood over a recumbent figure. Mouse trailed behind them, sniffing the ground.</p><p>Jasper nodded and asked as they walked to the group, \u201cAnyone shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob the footman has a graze on his arm,\u201d Pynch reported. \u201cNo one else was hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve checked?\u201d In the dark, with all the excitement, sometimes a man could be shot and not even know it.</p><p>But Pynch had been in the army as well. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded. \u201cGood man. Have a footman light some more lanterns. Light drives away all manner of vermin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Pynch headed back to the carriage.</p><p>\u201cAnd what have we here?\u201d Jasper asked as he came on the group of footmen.</p><p>\u201cOne of the robbers, my lord,\u201d Bob said.</p><p>He held a cloth against his upper right arm, but the pistol in his hand was steady and pointed at their prisoner. Pynch arrived with a lantern, and they all looked down at the robber. He wasn\u2019t much more than a child, a boy not yet twenty, his chest bleeding profusely. Mouse sniffed the boy, then lost interest and urinated on the tree.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still alive?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>\u201cJust barely,\u201d Pynch said impassively. It must\u2019ve been his shot that had brought the boy off his horse, but Pynch didn\u2019t show any pity.</p><p>Then again, this boy had held a gun on them. He could\u2019ve shot Melisande. A horrible image of Melisande lying where the boy was rose up in Jasper\u2019s mind. Melisande with her chest blown open. Melisande struggling to draw air into shattered lungs.</p><p>Jasper turned away. \u201cLeave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and saw Melisande, standing outside the carriage despite his explicit orders to stay inside.</p><p>\u201cMadam?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t back down, though his tone was chilly. \u201cHave him brought with us, Jasper.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, illuminated by lantern light, looking ethereal and fragile. Too fragile. He said gently, \u201cHe could\u2019ve killed you, my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She might look fragile, but her core was made of iron.</p><p>He nodded, his gaze still fixed on her. \u201cWrap him in a blanket, Pynch, and take him up on your horse with you.\u201d</p><p>Melisande frowned. \u201cThe carriage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have him near you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and must\u2019ve seen she wasn\u2019t getting her way in this. She nodded.</p><p>Jasper glanced at Pynch. \u201cYou can bandage his wound when we get to the inn. I don\u2019t like lingering in this spot any longer than we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Pynch said.</p><p>Then Jasper walked to his lady wife and took her arm, warm and alive beneath his fingers. He bent his head and murmured in her ear, \u201cI do this for you, my heart. Only for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her face a pale moon in the darkness. \u201cYou do it for yourself as well. It\u2019s not right to let him die alone, no matter what he did.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother arguing. Let her think he worried about such matters if she wished. He led her to their carriage and bundled her inside, closing the door. Even if the highwayman lived a few hours more, he could no longer hurt Melisande, and that was all that mattered in the end.</p><p>MELISANDE SIGHED WHEN the door closed to her inn room later that evening. Vale always acquired two rooms at the inns they stayed in, and tonight was no different. Despite the excitement of the near robbery, despite the dying robber\u2014who\u2019d been carried into a back room\u2014despite the fact that the little inn was nearly full, Melisande still found herself in a solitary room.</p><p>She wandered to the little fireplace, piled high with coal, thanks to a generous tip to the innkeeper\u2019s wife. The flames danced, but her fingers remained cold. Did the servants talk about their mistress and master taking separate rooms so soon after their marriage? Melisande felt vaguely ashamed, as if she\u2019d failed in some way as a wife. Mouse leapt onto the foot of the bed and turned about three times before lying down. He sighed.</p><p>At least Suchlike never mentioned the sleeping arrangements. The little maid dressed and undressed her with unfailing cheerfulness. Although she\u2019d been hard-pressed to smile this evening after their near robbery. She\u2019d still been shaking from the shock, and she\u2019d lost all her merry chatter. Melisande had taken pity on the girl and sent her down early to eat her supper.</p><p>Which left Melisande all alone. She hadn\u2019t much appetite for the dinner the round innkeeper\u2019s wife had served. The boiled chicken had looked delicious enough, but it was hard to eat knowing a young boy was dying in the back of the inn. She\u2019d excused herself early and come upstairs instead. Now she wished she\u2019d stayed in the dining room Vale had reserved for them. She shook her head. No use remaining awake. She couldn\u2019t go back down now that she\u2019d undressed, and that was that. Melisande pulled back the bedclothes from the sturdy inn bed, relieved to see they looked clean, and climbed in. She pulled the sheets to her nose and snuffed out the light. Then she watched the firelight flicker on the ceiling until her eyelids grew heavy.</p><p>Her thoughts floated and drifted. Vale\u2019s bright eyes and the look in them when he\u2019d savagely pulled the first highwayman into the carriage. Boiled chicken and the dumplings Cook had made when she was a child. How many more days they\u2019d spend traveling rutted roads in the swaying carriage. When they might cross in kmign sto Scotland. Her thoughts scattered, and she began to sink into sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she was conscious of a warmth against her back. Of strong arms and the brush of lips that tasted of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cJasper?\u201d she mumbled, still half dreaming.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>His mouth opened over hers, and he kissed her deeply, his tongue penetrating her mouth. She thought she tasted salt. She moaned, caught between waking and sleeping, all her defenses down and in shambles. She felt him lift her chemise and pull it from her body. His hands explored her breasts, stroking tenderly, then pinched her nipples almost to the point of pain.</p> <p>\u201cJasper,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>She ran her palms over his back. He was nude, his skin so hot it almost burned. His muscles shifted under her hands as he lay atop her, his weight settling between her spread thighs.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>She felt the nudge as he found her center and thrust inside.</p><p>Her body was soft, yielding from sleep and his hands, but she wasn\u2019t quite ready. He shifted back and rocked slowly, gently, each small thrust stretching her and pushing him deeper inside. He hooked his hands under her knees and lifted them up so he was cradled between her thighs. And then he kissed her, brushing his palms lightly over her exposed nipples. Tantalizing her and tormenting her at the same time.</p> <p>She tried to arch up, to make him touch her more firmly, but she hadn\u2019t the leverage or the strength. He was in control, and he would make love to her in the manner that he desired. All she could do was submit.</p><p>So she tangled her hands in his hair and hung on, kissing him back, moving her mouth lushly, submissively under his.</p><p>He groaned. His hips worked a little faster now, his cock crammed all the way inside of her. She felt each thrust, each stretch of her feminine flesh as she received him again and again.</p><p>He broke the kiss and lifted his head away from her, his breath coming in loud, harsh pants. She didn\u2019t open her eyes; she didn\u2019t want to disrupt her dreamy state. Then she felt his fingers sliding down her side, twisting between their bodies. He searched and found her, his fingers strong and knowing. He pressed his thumb down on her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he whispered, his voice a rasp of desire. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes at last. He must\u2019ve brought a candle into the room, for muted light played along his side. His shoulders were wide and bunched with muscle, strands of hair clinging damply to his face, and his wild turquoise eyes stared into hers, compelling her.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he whispered again.</p><p>His thumb circled her, pressing with exquisite accuracy as his cock filled her. She was splayed before him, a prize all his own, and he kept whispering, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>How could she deny him? The pleasu kim?Comre was building inside, and she wanted to hide her face. He was in control in ways she hadn\u2019t let him be before. He would watch. He would know the secrets she kept hidden from him.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d He bent his head to lick her nipple.</p><p>She arched her head and wailed. He caught the sound in his mouth. Licked it up and swallowed it, a prize of this battle. He pressed down on her and held her as she came, jolting with each bolt of pleasure. He held her down with mouth and hips and that thumb, brushing lightly, sweetly, madly now. She\u2019d never experienced an orgasm like this one, nearly painful in its intensity. She opened her eyes, gasping, and saw he wasn\u2019t done. She\u2019d been reduced to shivering pleasure, and he\u2019d only started. He propped himself up on straight arms and watched her as he surged into her, hot and heavy and without mercy. His mouth was twisted, his eyes mad with lust and something else.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he ground out. \u201cGod. God. God!\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head, arching convulsively, and she saw him bare his teeth as his body jerked into hers. His seed flooded her, warm and alive. She felt a joy such as she\u2019d never felt before. She\u2019d given and she\u2019d received from him.</p><p>It was nearly holy.</p> <p>His head was tilted back above her, his arms still straight. She couldn\u2019t see his face because of his hair. A single drop of liquid fell to her left breast.</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d she whispered, and cradled his wet face. \u201cJasper.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out of her, the loss of his flesh almost a painful wrench, and climbed from the bed. He bent and scooped up his banyan and flung it on. \u201cThe robber boy died.\u201d</p><p>He left the room.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>That night, the royal court was abuzz with rumor. The serpent was dead and the bronze ring gone, but no one had come forward with the ring. Who was the brave man who had captured the ring?</p><p>Jack, as usual, stood beside the princess\u2019s chair at supper, and she gave him a very strange look when she sat down.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Jack,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhere have you been? Your hair is quite wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been to visit a wee silver fishy,\u201d Jack said, and turned a silly somersault.</p><p>The princess smiled and ate her soup, but what a surprise awaited her at the bottom of the bowl! There lay the bronze ring.</p><p>Well! That caused quite a stir, and the head cook was summoned at once. But although the poor man was questioned before the entire court, he had no knowledge of how the ring had got in Princess Surcease\u2019s soup. At last the king was forced to dismiss the cook, no wiser than before. ne o. . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>She must think him a ravening beast after the night before. It was not a happy thought to have over breakfast, and Jasper scowled at the eggs and bread the innkeeper\u2019s wife had provided. They were rather tasty, but the tea was weak and not of the best quality; besides, he would take the smallest reason to feel out of sorts this morning.</p><p>He peered over his teacup at his lady wife. She didn\u2019t look like a woman who had been ravished in the night. On the contrary, she appeared fresh and rested and with every hair in place, which for some reason irked him even more.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d he asked, possibly the most mundane of conversational openings.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d She fed a bit of bun to Mouse, who sat beneath the table. He knew this, although she neither moved nor changed expression. Indeed she continued to gaze steadily at him. It was something in the very steadiness of her gaze that let him know what she did.</p><p>\u201cWe shall enter Scotland today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be in Edinburgh by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and buttered a bun, his third. \u201cI have an aunt in Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do? You never said.\u201d She took a sip of tea.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a Scot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Her first husband was a Scot. I believe she is on husband number three at the moment.\u201d He laid his butter knife down on the plate. \u201cHer name is Mrs. Esther Whippering, and we will spend a night with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting on in years but sharp as a tack. Used to twist my ear rather painfully as a boy.\u201d</p><p>She paused over her teacup. \u201cWhy? What had you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all. She said it was good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt it was.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, about to defend his youthful honor, when he felt something cold and wet on the hand in his lap.</p><p>He\u2019d been reaching for the butter knife with his other hand, and he nearly dropped it again. \u201cMy God, what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect it\u2019s only Mouse,\u201d Melisande said serenely.</p><p>He peered under the table and saw two eyes gleaming back. They looked a little devilish in the dark. \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bun.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked at his wife, outraged. \u201cHe shan\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019ll only bother you until you give him some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no reason to reward bad behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Shall we have the innkeeper\u2019s wife pack a luncheon for us? She seems to be a good cook.\u201d</p><p>He felt another nudge against his leg. A warm weight settled on his foot. \u201cAn excellent idea. We may not be near an inn at luncheon time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and went to the door of the little private dining room to make arrangements.</p><p>Jasper shoved a piece of egg under the table when her back was turned. A wet tongue licked it from his fingers.</p><p>Melisande came back in the room and eyed him suspiciously but did not say a word.</p><p>Half an hour later, the horses were hitched, the lady\u2019s maid was perched beside the coachman for a change, Melisande and Mouse were in the carriage waiting, and Jasper was having a last conversation with the innkeeper. He thanked the man and leapt up the steps to his carriage, then knocked on the roof and sat.</p><p>Melisande looked up from her embroidery as the carriage jolted forward. \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>He glanced outside the window. Fog was rolling down the hills. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe innkeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thanked him for a perfectly lovely night without fleas.\u201d</p><p>She simply looked at him.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI gave him enough money to pay to bury the boy. And a bit more for his trouble. I thought you\u2019d want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He slumped in his seat and canted his legs to the side. \u201cYou have a soft heart, my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head decisively. \u201cNo, I have a just one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA just heart that gives succor to a boy who would\u2019ve shot you without a qualm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>He watched the hills. \u201cI know he set off last night with older men and a loaded gun. If he did not mean to use it, he should never have loaded it.\u201d</p><p>He felt her gaze. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you shoot last night?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe highwayman\u2019s pistol went off and used the shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pynch told me this morning that there are pistols beneath the seat.\u201d</p><p>Damn Pynch and his loose tongue. He glanced at Melisande. Her expression was curious rather than condemning.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI suppose I should show you so you can use them if need be. But for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t take one up unless you intend to use it, and always keep it pointed at the ground.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>He moved across to her seat an sto ut d pulled up the thin cushion from his own. Underneath was a compartment with a hinged lid. He lifted the lid to reveal a pair of pistols. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>She peered at them and Mouse jumped from the seat where he\u2019d been dozing to take a look as well.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Melisande said. She looked at him frankly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take them out last night?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shoved the dog gently aside before closing the compartment lid, replacing the cushion and sitting back down again. \u201cI didn\u2019t take them out because I have an unreasoning dislike of guns, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been a handicap during the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I shot a pistol or a rifle often enough when I was in the army. I\u2019m not a bad shot either. Or at least I wasn\u2019t\u2014haven\u2019t picked up a pistol since I returned to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you hate guns now?\u201d</p><p>He used his left thumb to rub hard at the palm of his right hand. \u201cI don\u2019t like the feel\u2014the weight maybe\u2014of a pistol in my hand.\u201d He looked across at her. \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten them out, though, if there was no other way. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve risked your life, my heart.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And that simple sentence filled him with a feeling he hadn\u2019t felt in some time\u2014happiness. He stared at her, so sure of his competence, so sure of his courage, and he thought, Please, Lord, let her never find out the truth.</p><p>SHE WISHED SHE could simply tell Vale that she didn\u2019t want to sleep apart from him, Melisande thought later that night. She stood in the courtyard of another inn\u2014this one fairly big\u2014and watched as the hostlers unhitched the horses and Vale talked to the innkeeper. He was procuring a room for the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her room.</p><p>It seemed the inn was nearly full, and there was only one room left, but instead of sharing it with her, Vale intended to sleep in the common room. Lord only knew what the innkeeper made of that. She sighed and looked to where a footman was leading Mouse on a leash. Or, rather, Mouse was leading the footman, straining forward on the leash. He dragged the poor man to a hitching post, lifted his leg against it, and began dragging to the next post.</p><p>\u201cReady, my sweet?\u201d</p><p>Melisande looked up to find that while she had been puzzling out their marriage, Vale had finished his transaction with the innkeeper.</p> <p>She nodded and took his arm. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouse is going to wear out that footman\u2019s arm,\u201d Vale commented as they strode inside. \u201cDo you know that they toss dice to see who will take him for his nightly walks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe winner walks him?\u201d she asked as they entered the inn\u2019s main building.</p><p>\u201cNo, the loser,\u201d he replied, then frowned.</p><p>A shout of boisterous laughter had come from the common room. The inn was ancient, wit ss aeigh huge blackened beams holding the low ceiling aloft. To the left was the big common room with battered round tables and a roaring fire, though it was the height of summer. Every table was crowded with travelers\u2014mostly men\u2014drinking ale and eating their suppers.</p> <p>\u201cThrough here,\u201d Vale said, and guided her to the right into a small back room. This was their private dining room, already laid with sturdy earthenware dishes and a loaf of what looked like fresh brown bread.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Melisande murmured as he held a chair for her. She sat just as the footman brought in Mouse. The terrier immediately trotted over and stood against her for a pat. \u201cAnd how are you, Sir Mouse? Did you have a nice constitutional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly got a rat, \u2019e did, my lady,\u201d the footman said. \u201cIn the stables. Fast little dog.\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled at the terrier and ruffled his ears. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>The innkeeper hurried in with a bottle of wine, a girl followed behind with a mutton stew, and all was chaos in the little dining room for a bit. Five minutes passed before Vale and she were alone again.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he began to say, but was interrupted by a particularly loud yell from the common room.</p> <p>Vale frowned at the door. They were sheltered in their private room, but the constant buzz of noise could still be heard.</p><p>He looked across the table at her, his brows drawn over his blue-green eyes. \u201cYou must lock the door and stay in your room tonight. I don\u2019t like this crowd.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded. She always locked the door if she could or stood a chair against it. Anyway, Vale was usually right in the room next door.</p><p>\u201cYour room wasn\u2019t locked last night.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he was remembering their heated lovemaking. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lock on the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have one of the footmen sleep outside your room tonight.\u201d</p><p>They finished the meal in companionable silence after that. It was well past ten by the time Melisande got to her room with Mouse. She found Suchlike yawning as she laid out a fresh chemise. The room was small but neat, with a bed, a table, and some chairs by the fireplace. Someone had even hung two tiny paintings of horses on the wall by the door.</p><p>\u201cHow was your dinner?\u201d Melisande asked the maid. She went to the window and found her room overlooked the stable yard.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very good, my lady,\u201d Suchlike replied. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never liked mutton much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Melisande began picking at the laces of her gown.</p><p>\u201cLet me do that, my lady,\u201d Suchlike said, and bustled over. \u201cNo, give me a nice bit o\u2019 beef if it\u2019s good, and I\u2019m quite happy. Now, Mr. Pynch declares that fish is his favorite thing to eat. Can you fancy that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are many people who like fish,\u201d Melisande said diplomatically. She shrugged off the bodice.</p><p>y pight=\"0%\" width=\"4%\"&gt;Suchlike looked skeptical. \u201cYes, my lady. Mr. Pynch says it\u2019s on account of him being born by the sea, liking fish, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pynch was born by the sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. In Cornwall. Such a long ways away and him not even talking strange like.\u201d</p><p>Melisande studied her lady\u2019s maid as she removed the rest of her clothing. She would\u2019ve thought the valet too old and dour for Suchlike, but the maid seemed to like chattering about him. She only hoped Mr. Pynch wasn\u2019t trifling with her maid\u2019s affections. She made a mental note to speak about the matter with Vale in the morning.</p><p>\u201cThere, my lady,\u201d Suchlike exclaimed as she flung the chemise over Melisande\u2019s head. \u201cYou look very pretty in that. The lace becomes you. Now, I\u2019ve put a warming pan in the bed and brought up a pitcher of water. There\u2019s some wine on the table and glasses, too, should you care for a drink before bed. Will you want your hair braided tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Melisande said. \u201cI\u2019ll brush it out myself. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The maid bobbed a curtsy and went to the door.</p><p>Melisande remembered something. \u201cOh, and Suchlike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure that you sleep where our men can hear you. Lord Vale doesn\u2019t like the crowd in the common room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pynch didn\u2019t like their looks either,\u201d the maid replied. \u201cHe said he\u2019d keep a sharp eye on me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Melisande\u2019s heart warmed toward the stoic valet. At least he was protective of Suchlike. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Night, my lady. Sleep well.\u201d And Suchlike left the room.</p><p>Melisande poured herself a little wine from the decanter on the table and took a sip. It certainly wasn\u2019t of the quality that Vale kept in his cellars, but it was pleasantly tart. She took the pins from her hair and laid them neatly on the table.</p><p>She let down her hair and combed it out. Suddenly, there was a crash from below. She went to the door to listen, her brush still in her hand, but after a minute of raised voices, everything seemed to settle back down. Melisande finished brushing her hair, drank the wine in her glass, and climbed into bed.</p><p>She lay thinking for a bit on whether Vale would come to her rooms tonight. He\u2019d have to ask the innkeeper for the key to her room. She\u2019d been sure to lock the door tonight after Suchlike took her leave.</p><p>She must\u2019ve slept then, because she dreamed of Jasper in battle, cannon fire all around him, while he laughed and refused to take up his gun. In her dream, she called to him, imploring him to defend himself. Tears ran down her face. Then she woke to the sound of shouting and blows against her door. She sat up just as her door burst open and four drunken louts spilled into the room.</p><p>Melisande stared in shocked horror. Mouse leapt from her bed and began barking.</p><p>\u201c sontor.She\u2019s a pretty bit o\u2019 rough,\u201d one said, and then a whirlwind caught him from behind.</p><p>Vale was on the man, hitting him savagely and silently. He was barefoot and wearing only his breeches. He took the man by the hair and slammed his face into the floorboards. Blood splattered.</p><p>Two of the drunkards blinked at the sudden violence, but the third swung forward. Before he could reach Vale, he was grabbed from behind by Mr. Pynch and hauled into the hallway. A thud shook the wall, and one of the small horse paintings fell. Vale rose from the still man on the floor and advanced on the other two men. Melisande bit back a cry. They might be drunk, but it was two against one. Mr. Pynch still fought the other man in the hall.</p><p>One tried to smile. \u201cJess a bit o\u2019 fun.\u201d</p><p>Vale hit him in the face. The man spun from the force of the blow and went down like a felled tree. Turning to the last man, who was trying to back away, Vale took him by the coat, turned him about, and ran him headfirst into the wall. The other horse painting fell. Mouse attacked the frame.</p><p>Mr. Pynch appeared in the doorway.</p><p>Vale looked up from where he stood panting over the last fallen man. \u201cEverything settled out there?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch nodded. His left eye was reddened and beginning to swell. \u201cI\u2019ve roused the footmen. They\u2019ll spend the rest of the night in the corridor to prevent further incidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bob?\u201d Vale demanded. \u201cHe was supposed to be outside my wife\u2019s door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out what happened,\u201d Mr. Pynch said.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Vale snapped. \u201cTell the others to get this rubbish out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Pynch disappeared back into the hallway.</p><p>Vale finally looked at Melisande. His face was savage, a cut on his cheek leaking blood. \u201cAre you all right, my lady wife?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>But he turned and slammed his fist into the wall. \u201cI promised you this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit!\u201d He kicked one of the fallen louts.</p><p>\u201cJasper\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch returned at that moment with the other menservants. They dragged the louts from the room, none of the men daring to even glance at her. Melisande still sat up in her bed, the sheets drawn to her chin. Bob appeared, white-faced and stricken and trying to explain that he\u2019d been ill. Vale turned his back on the footman and clenched his fists. She saw Mr. Pynch jerk his chin to the footman, silently telling him to leave the room. Poor Bob slunk away again.</p><p>And then her room was clear. The servants left and only Vale remained, pacing the room like a caged lion. Mouse gave a last bark at the door and jumped on the bed to receive his praise. Melisande stroked his soft, smooth ears as she watched her husband shove a chair against the door. The frame sor.e hwas splintered near the lock and wouldn\u2019t close properly.</p><p>Melisande watched him for a moment, then sighed and climbed from the bed. She padded barefoot to the table, poured a glass of wine, and held it out to him.</p><p>He came and took the glass from her hand without a word and tossed back half the wine.</p><p>She wanted to tell him it wasn\u2019t his fault. That he\u2019d had the foresight to post a guard and when that had failed, he\u2019d arrived in time. But she knew that nothing she said would stop him from berating himself. Perhaps in the morning she could talk about it, but not now.</p><p>After a while, he swallowed the rest of the wine and put the glass carefully down as if it might shatter. \u201cGo back to bed, dearest heart. I\u2019ll stay here with you the remainder of the night.\u201d</p><p>He settled in one of the chairs by the fire as she got back into bed. It was only a straight-backed wooden chair, which couldn\u2019t be terribly comfortable, but he stretched out his long legs and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>Melisande watched him sadly for a while, wishing he would sleep with her, and then she closed her eyes. She knew she wouldn\u2019t sleep again tonight, but if she lay awake, it would worry him, so she feigned slumber. After a bit, she heard a low murmur at the door and the scrape of a chair. Vale moved about nearly silently, and then all was quiet again.</p><p>Melisande cracked her eyelids. Her husband lay in a corner on a kind of pallet. Very similar, in fact, to the one that had been in his dressing room. He was on his side, his back to the wall. She watched him for a bit until his breathing grew slow and even. Then she waited some more.</p><p>When she could wait no longer, she crept from the bed and tiptoed to the pallet. She stood for a moment, watching him sleep on his crude bed; then she stepped over him. She\u2019d meant to squeeze by him and ease down between him and the wall, but the moment she set her foot by him, his hand shot out and grabbed her ankle.</p><p>Vale looked up at her, his blue-green eyes nearly black in the darkness. \u201cGo back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Very carefully, she knelt beside him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He released her ankle. \u201cMelisande\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ignored his pleading tone, lifting the blanket covering him and lying down behind his back.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHush.\u201d She lay facing his strong, broad back. Slowly she smoothed her hand over his rigid side and inched forward until she hugged against him. She inhaled his scent, rising with the heat of his body. He was warm and comforting, and she gave a little sigh, her face nuzzling his wide shoulders. He\u2019d been stiff at first, but now he relaxed, as if conceding the moment to her. She smiled. All her life she\u2019d slept alone. Now she did not.</p><p>Finally, she was home.</p><p>JASPER WOKE TO feminine hands sliding down his back, and his first emotion was shame. Shame that she knew he slept on the floor like a beggar. Shame that he couldn\u2019t sleep in a bed like other men. Sha soths sme that she knew his secret. Then her hands moved lower, and lust uncurled in his belly.</p><p>He opened his eyes and found it still dark, the fire having died down. Normally he would light a candle, but at the moment, the dark didn\u2019t bother him. Her hand crept around his side to clasp his cock, and he groaned. To feel those cool, slim fingers curiously exploring his heat was the stuff that men dreamed about late at night when they were far from home. She fingered the head of his cock and then wrapped her hand about the shaft, slowly sliding up and down. His balls were drawn up hard and tight; he could feel the press of her small, lovely breasts against his back, and it was more than he could take this early in the morning.</p> <p>He turned over. \u201cClimb atop me.\u201d</p><p>Her hair was down, waving about her face, and in the dim glow of the fireplace, she looked like some fey creature come to lure him away from his mortal existence. She sat up and swung a long slender leg over his hips. Then she sat straight and tall and so prim on top of his throbbing prick.</p><p>\u201cTake me inside, my lady wife,\u201d he whispered. \u201cPut me in your pretty cunny.\u201d</p><p>He thought he saw her frown in the dark, as if disapproving of an inappropriate subject at tea. She might look prim and proper when at tea in the afternoon, but at night and with him she was a wanton creature.</p><p>\u201cRide me, my heart,\u201d he urged. \u201cRide me until you weep on my prick. Ride me until I fill you with my seed.\u201d</p> <p>She gasped then and rose. He could feel her hands about him as she sank down, and it was all he could do not to cry out. Tight wet feminine heat. Holding him. Yielding to him. He arched up and at the same time grabbed her buttocks to pull her firmly against him.</p><p>She placed her hands on his chest and slid against him, her back straight, her long hair brushing his face. She rode him, biting her lip, grinding her pelvis against his. He waited, holding back, watching her expression. Her eyes were closed, her lovely face tipped back. He moved his hand to palm her breast, and she arched her back. He pinched that pretty little nipple, torturing that bit of flesh until she gasped. And then he flicked it lightly.</p><p>\u201cJasper,\u201d she panted. \u201cJasper . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said lightly, innocently, though his face shone with sweat.</p> <p>She jolted against him, swiveling her hips to punish him, and for a moment he lost all coherent thought.</p><p>Then she said, \u201cNot like that. You know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head gently and flicked her nipple again. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to say it, my heart.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed.</p><p>He should\u2019ve taken pity, but alas he was a wicked carnal man, and he wanted to hear those sweet, prim lips utter the words. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, touch my pussy!\u201d</p><p>And he felt the first spurt, just at the words. He gasped and thumbed her wildly rocking cunny, feeling his hard flesh working in and out of hers, and it was too much.</p><p>He arched up off the floor and caught her mouth to his to muffle his yell. And he came, exploding into her, showering her with his soul.</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The next day, the king announced the second trial: to bring back a silver ring that was hidden atop a mountain, which was guarded by a troll. Once again, Jack waited until everyone left, and then he opened his little tin snuffbox. Out came the suit of night and wind and the sharpest sword in the world. Jack put on the suit and took up the sword and then whoosh! Whist! there he was, quick as you please, in front of the nasty troll and his blade. Well, this battle took a little longer than the first, but in the end, the result was the same. Jack had the silver ring. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>When Melisande awoke the next morning, Vale was already gone from the room. She brushed her hand over his pillow. It was still warm, and she could see the indent where his head had been. She was alone, just like all the other mornings of her short marriage, but this time it was different. She\u2019d lain in his arms last night. She\u2019d listened to his breathing, heard the slow thump of his heartbeat, been warmed by his hot, bare skin.</p><p>She lay a moment smiling before rising and calling for Suchlike. Half an hour later, she was downstairs, ready for breakfast, but her husband was not to be found.</p><p>\u201cLord Vale went riding, my lady,\u201d a sheepish footman said. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be back when \u2019twas time to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Melisande said, and went into the little dining room to break her fast. It was no good chasing him. Besides, he\u2019d have to come back eventually.</p><p>But Vale chose to ride his horse beside the carriage that day, and she swayed inside with just Suchlike for company.</p><p>They made Edinburgh by late afternoon and pulled up beside Vale\u2019s aunt\u2019s stylish town house just after five in the evening. Vale opened the door to the carriage, and Melisande only had time to place her hand in his before his aunt was welcoming them. Mrs. Whippering was a small, stout lady wearing a sunny yellow dress. She had rosy cheeks, a perpetual smile, and a rather loud voice, which she kept constantly in use.</p><p>\u201cThis is Melisande, my lady wife,\u201d Vale said to his aunt when she paused for breath in her effusive welcome.</p><p>\u201cSo happy to meet you, my dear,\u201d Mrs. Whippering yodeled. \u201cDo call me Aunt Esther.\u201d</p><p>So Melisande did.</p><p>Aunt Esther led them into her house, which had apparently been redecorated on the occasion of her marrying her third husband. \u201cNew man, new house,\u201d she said merrily to Melisande.</p><p>Jasper just grinned.</p><p>It was a lovely house. High on one of Edinburgh\u2019s many hills, it was of Whitestone and had clean, classical lines. Inside, Aunt Esther favored white marble and a checkered black and white floor.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d she called, bustling down the hall. \u201cMr. Whippering is so looking forward to meeting both of you.\u201d</p><p>She led them to a red sitting room with paintings of enormous baskets of fruit bracketing a black enamel and gilt fireplace. A man so tall and thin he looked like a knobby walking stick sat on a settee. He had a muffin halfway to his mouth when they walked in.</p><p>Aunt Esther flew at him in a flurry of flapping yellow skirts. \u201cNot the muffins, Mr. Whippering! You know they are not good for your digestion.\u201d</p><p>The poor man gave up his muffin and stood to be introduced. He was even taller than Vale, his coat hanging on him in folds. But he had a very sweet smile as he peered at them over half-moon glasses.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Horatio Whippering, my husband,\u201d Aunt Esther announced proudly.</p><p>Mr. Whippering bowed to Vale and took Melisande\u2019s hand, twinkling up at her roguishly.</p><p>The introductions made, Aunt Esther plopped herself down on the settee. \u201cSit down, sit down, and tell me all about your trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were attacked by highwaymen,\u201d Vale said obligingly.</p><p>Melisande arched an eyebrow at him and he winked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Aunt Esther\u2019s eyes rounded, and she turned to her spouse. \u201cDid you hear that, Mr. Whippering? Highwaymen attacking my nephew and his wife. I never heard the like.\u201d She shook her head and poured tea. \u201cWell, I expect you frightened them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll by myself.\u201d Vale smiled modestly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have such a strong, brave husband,\u201d Aunt Esther told Melisande.</p><p>Melisande smiled and avoided Jasper\u2019s gaze for fear she might laugh.</p><p>\u201cI think they should be hung, really I do,\u201d the little woman continued. She passed a cup of tea to Vale and Melisande and one to her husband, admonishing him, \u201cMind you don\u2019t add cream. Remember what it does to your digestion, dear.\u201d Then she sat back with a plate full of muffins on her lap and announced, \u201cI must take issue with you, dear nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, dear aunt?\u201d Vale asked. He\u2019d chosen the largest muffin, and now he bit into it, spilling crumbs down his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhy, this hasty marriage. There\u2019s no reason for such haste unless\u201d\u2014she peered at them sharply\u2014\u201cthere is a reason?\u201d</p><p>Melisande blinked and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo? Well, then, why the rush? Why, I\u2019d hardly got the announcement that you had changed fianc\u00e9es and in the very next post\u2014it was the very next post, wasn\u2019t it, Mr. Whippering?\u201d she appealed to her spouse. He nodded, obviously well used to his part in her monologues. \u201cI thought so,\u201d Aunt Esther continued. \u201cAs I say, the ve {ay, Hery next post, a letter came from your mother writing that you\u2019d already married. Why, I hadn\u2019t even time to think of a suitable wedding present, let alone make plans to travel to London, and what I want to know is why marry so fast? Mr. Whippering courted me for three years, did you not, Mr. Whippering?\u201d</p><p>A dutiful nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd even then I made him wait nine months for a proper engagement before we were wed. I can\u2019t think why you should marry in such a hurry.\u201d She stopped to inhale and drink some tea, frowning ferociously at her nephew.</p><p>\u201cBut, Aunt Esther, I had to wed Melisande as soon as humanly possible,\u201d Vale said, all wounded innocence. \u201cI was afraid she might call it off. She was surrounded by suitors, and I had to beat them off with a stick. Once I had her pledge, I got her to the altar as swiftly as possible.\u201d</p><p>He finished this outrageous pack of lies by smiling innocently at his aunt.</p><p>The lady clapped her hands delightedly. \u201cAnd so you should\u2019ve! Well done! I\u2019m glad you caught such a fine lady to make your wife. She looks like she has a level head on her shoulders\u2014that should balance your foolery.\u201d</p><p>Vale clasped his chest and swooned in his chair dramatically. \u201cYou wound me, dear lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish,\u201d said his aunt. \u201cYou are a silly fool, but then most men are when it comes to women, even my dear Mr. Whippering.\u201d</p><p>They all looked at Mr. Whippering, who tried his best to appear suitably scampish. He was somewhat hampered by the teacup balanced on his knobby knees.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wish you both a long and happy marriage,\u201d Aunt Esther declared, popping a bite of muffin into her mouth. \u201cAnd a fruitful one.\u201d</p><p>Melisande swallowed at the allusion to babies and looked blindly down at her cup of tea. The thought of holding a small bit of her and Jasper, of stroking baby-fine reddish brown hair, sent a bolt of painful yearning through her. Oh, how wonderful it would be to have a baby!</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aunt,\u201d Vale was saying gravely. \u201cI shall endeavor to father at least a dozen or so offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you jest with me, but family is most important. Most important. Mr. Whippering and I have discussed this on numerous occasions, and we both agree that children settle a young man. And you, dear nephew, could do with a bit of settling. Why, I remember the time\u2014\u201d Aunt Esther cut herself off with a start and a squeak as she stared at the mantel clock. \u201cMr. Whippering! Look at the time. Look at the time! Why didn\u2019t you tell me it was so late, you horrid man?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Whippering looked startled.</p><p>Aunt Esther rocked violently, trying to get up from the settee. She was hampered by her voluminous skirts, her teacup, and her plate of muffins. \u201cWe have guests for supper tonight, and I must get ready. Oh, do help me!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Whippering stood and pulled his wife from the settee.</p><p>She bounced up and ran to ring for the maid. \u201cWe\u2019re to have Sir Angus, and he\u2019s a terrible stickler, but don\u2019t {leront let that bother you,\u201d she confided to Melisande. \u201cHe tells the most delicious stories after he\u2019s had his second glass of wine. Now, I\u2019ll have Meg show you to your room and let you wash up, if you desire, but be sure to come down by seven o\u2019clock, for Sir Angus is sure to be on the doorstep at exactly that time. Then we shall have to somehow make conversation with him while we wait for everyone else to arrive. Oh, I\u2019ve invited some lovely people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She clapped her hands like an excited little girl, and Mr. Whippering beamed down at her fondly. Melisande set aside her plate and rose, but Aunt Esther was listing her guests on her fingers.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Flowers\u2014I\u2019ve seated you next to Mr. Flowers because he\u2019s always quite kind and knows when to agree with a lady. Miss Charlotte Stewart, who has the best gossip. Captain Pickering and his wife\u2014he used to be in the navy, you know, and has seen the strangest things, and\u2014oh! Here\u2019s Meg.\u201d</p><p>A maid, presumably Meg, had entered the room and curtsied.</p><p>Aunt Esther flew to her. \u201cShow my nephew and his wife to their room\u2014the blue room, not the green. The green might be bigger, but the blue is ever so much more warm. There\u2019s a draft in the green,\u201d she confided to Melisande. \u201cNow don\u2019t forget: seven of the clock.\u201d</p> <p>Vale, who had been sitting all this while, complacently munching muffins, finally rose. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Aunt. We\u2019ll be down precisely at seven and with our best bows and buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d his aunt exclaimed.</p><p>Melisande smiled, for it seemed quite useless to try and say anything, and began to follow the maid from the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I forgot,\u201d Aunt Esther called. \u201cOne other couple will be there as well.\u201d</p><p>Both Melisande and Vale turned politely to hear the name of these new guests.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Timothy Holden and his wife, Lady Caroline.\u201d Aunt Esther beamed. \u201cThey used to live in London before they moved to Edinburgh, and I thought they might be a treat for the both of you. Mr. Holden is quite a dashing gentleman. Maybe you even know him?\u201d</p><p>And for the life of her, Melisande didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>SOMETHING WAS WRONG with Melisande, Jasper thought later that night. She sat on the farther end of the long supper table from him, between the kind Mr. Flowers and the punctilious Sir Angus, the latter already on his third glass of tongue-loosening wine. Melisande wore a deep brown dress with small green flowers and leaves embroidered down the bodice and around the sleeves. She looked quite lovely, her pale oval face serene, her light brown hair softly pulled back. Jasper doubted anyone else in the room noted her unease save he.</p><p>He sipped his wine and considered his lady wife, smiling vaguely at something Mrs. Flowers leaned close to say. Perhaps the company of newly met people intimidated Melisande. He knew she was a shy creature, as all the fey were wont to be. She didn\u2019t like crowds, didn\u2019t like long social events. It was opposite to Jasper\u2019s own nature, but he understood this about her, even if he could never feel that way himself. He was used to her stiff reticence when they went out.</p><p>neight=\"0%\" width=\"4%\"&gt;But this unease was more than that. Something was wrong, and it bothered him that he didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>It was a pleasant gathering. Aunt Esther\u2019s cook was very good, and the supper was plain but enjoyable. The narrow dining room was intimately lit. The footmen were generous with the wine bottles.Miss Stewart was to his right. She was a woman of mature years, with powdered and rouged cheeks and an enormous gray-powdered wig. She leaned toward Jasper, and he caught the strong scent of patchouli.</p> <p>\u201cI hear you\u2019ve just come from London, what?\u201d the lady said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d Jasper replied. \u201cOver hill and over dale we\u2019ve ridden, just to visit sunny Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you didn\u2019t come in winter,\u201d she retorted somewhat obscurely. \u201cTravel\u2019s dreadful after the first snowfall, though the city\u2019s pretty enough\u2014all the snow cloaking the dirt and soot. Have you seen the castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should, you should.\u201d Miss Stewart nodded vigorously, making the wattles beneath her chin shake. \u201cMagnificent. Not many English appreciate the beauty of Scotland.\u201d</p><p>She fixed him with a gimlet eye.</p><p>Jasper hastily swallowed a bite of the very fine lamb his aunt had served. \u201cOh, quite. My lady wife and I have been stunned by the countryside thus far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you should be in my opinion.\u201d She sawed at her lamb. \u201cNow, the Holdens moved here from London some eight or ten years ago, and they haven\u2019t regretted it for a day. Have you, Mr. Holden?\u201d she appealed to the gentleman sitting across the table from her.</p> <p>Timothy Holden was strikingly handsome if one liked men with soft cheeks and red lips, which apparently most women did, judging from the feminine glances aimed his way. He wore a snowy white wig and a red velvet coat, worked in gold and green embroidery at the sleeves.</p><p>At Miss Stewart\u2019s question, Holden inclined his head and said, \u201cMy wife and I enjoy Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down the table, but oddly it wasn\u2019t his own wife he looked at but rather Jasper\u2019s.</p><p>Jasper sipped his wine, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThe society here is quite superior,\u201d Lady Caroline chimed in.</p><p>She looked to be a good deal older than her handsome husband and was titled to boot. There must lie a tale. She had blond hair so light it was nearly white, and pale pinkish skin that made her as nearly monochromatic as paper. Only her light blue eyes gave her any color, poor woman, and they looked rimmed in red against her colorless skin, giving her the appearance of a white rabbit.</p><p>\u201cThe garden is lovely this time of year,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps you and Lady Vale will honor us by coming to tea during your visit?\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jasper saw Melisande go still. She was so motionless he wondered if she breathed.</p><p>He smiled po {\"&gt;Hionlitely. \u201cI\u2019m devastated to decline your kind offer. I\u2019m afraid we stay only the night in Edinburgh. I have business with a friend who lives north of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes? Who is that?\u201d Miss Stewart inquired.</p><p>Melisande had relaxed again, so Jasper turned his attention to his neighbor. \u201cSir Alistair Munroe. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>Miss Stewart shook her head decisively. \u201cKnow of him, of course, but never met the man, more\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wonderful book he\u2019s written,\u201d Sir Angus rumbled from the far end of the table. \u201cSimply marvelous. Filled with all manner of birds, animals, fishes, and insects. Most instructional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut have you ever met the man?\u201d Aunt Esther demanded from the foot of the table.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Mrs. Whippering sat back triumphantly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know a single person who has\u2014save for you, dear nephew, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen him in years, have you?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shook his head somberly. It was his turn to stare at the table and twist his wineglass.</p><p>\u201cWell, how do we know he\u2019s even still alive?\u201d Aunt Esther asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard he sends letters to the university,\u201d Mrs. Flowers ventured from his left. \u201cI have an uncle who lectures there, and he says Sir Alistair is very well respected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMunroe is one of Scotland\u2019s great intellectuals,\u201d Sir Angus said.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Aunt Esther said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he doesn\u2019t show his face here in town. I know that people have invited him to dinners and balls, and he always declines. What is he hiding, I ask you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScars,\u201d Sir Angus rumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, but surely that\u2019s just a rumor,\u201d Lady Caroline said.</p><p>Mrs. Flowers leaned forward, putting her ample bosom perilously near the gravy on her plate. \u201cI\u2019ve heard his face is so terribly scarred from the war in America that he has to wear a mask so that people don\u2019t faint in horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppycock!\u201d Miss Stewart snorted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Mrs. Flowers defended herself. \u201cMy sister\u2019s neighbor\u2019s daughter caught a glimpse of Sir Alistair leaving the theater two years ago and swooned. Afterward she took to bed with a delirious fever and wasn\u2019t well for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds a very silly girl,\u201d Miss Stewart retorted, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure I believe a word of it.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Flowers drew herself up, obviously offended.</p><p>Aunt Esther intervened. \u201cWell, my nephew ought to know whether or not Sir Alistair is horribly scarred. He served with the man, after all. Jasper?\u201d</p><p>Jasper felt his fingers begin to shake\u2014an awful physical symptom of the rotting malaise within himself. He let go of his wineglass before he knocked it ove {kno shr and hastily hid his hand beneath the tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cJasper?\u201d his aunt repeated.</p><p>Damn it, they were all looking at him now. His throat was dry, but he couldn\u2019t raise his glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true. Sir Alistair Munroe is scarred.\u201d</p><p>BY THE TIME Jasper helped see off his aunt\u2019s guests, he was bone-tired. Melisande had excused herself from the company shortly after supper. He paused outside the door to the bedroom Aunt Esther had given them. Melisande was probably abed. He twisted the doorknob gently so as to not awaken her. But when he entered the room, he saw that she wasn\u2019t asleep. Instead, she was making a pallet on the floor against the far wall. He halted because he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or swear.</p><p>She looked up and saw him. \u201cCan you hand me the blanket from the bed?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, not trusting his voice, and went to the bed to pull off the blanket. What must she think of him? He crossed to the fire and handed the blanket to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She bent and began tucking it about a pile of linens to make a rough mattress.</p><p>Did she worry that she\u2019d married a madman? He looked away. The room wasn\u2019t big, but it was cozy. The walls were a gray-blue, the floor covered by a faded brown and rose patterned rug. He went to the window and pulled back the curtain to look out, but the night was so dark, he couldn\u2019t pick anything out. He let the curtain fall. Suchlike must have been and gone. Melisande had already undressed. She wore a pretty lace-trimmed shift and her wrapper.</p><p>He took off his coat and began unbuttoning his waistcoat. \u201cLovely dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Charlotte was most amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his neck cloth and then held the strip of material in his fingers, staring down at it blindly. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the army, I think.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d He tilted his chin toward the pallet, not meeting her eyes. \u201cWe all have quirks, the men who came back from war. Some start violently at loud noises. Some can\u2019t stand the sight of blood. Some have nightmares that wake them in the dark of night. And some\u201d\u2014he took a deep breath, closing his eyes\u2014\u201csome cannot bear to sleep in the open. Some fear attack in the night when they sleep and cannot . . . cannot help themselves. They must sleep with their back against the wall and with a lit candle so that they can see the attackers when they come.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a compulsion, I\u2019m afraid. They simply cannot help themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her eyes were gentle, as if she hadn\u2019t just heard that her husband was a lunatic. She bent and continued putting together the pallet. She seemed as if she really did understand. But how could she? How could she accept that her husband was only half a man {nlyt. ? He couldn\u2019t accept it himself.</p><p>He poured some wine from a decanter on a table. He stood drinking it and gazing sightlessly into the fire for some time before he remembered what he\u2019d been thinking about when he came to their room.</p><p>Jasper set his empty wineglass down and began unbuttoning his waistcoat. \u201cYou\u2019ll think me fanciful, but for a moment when we were first introduced to the Holdens, I thought Timothy Holden looked like he recognized you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>He tossed his waistcoat to a chair and looked over at Melisande. She was plumping the bedding rather overhard. \u201cMy lady wife?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She straightened and looked at him, her chin up, her back stiff, as if she faced a firing squad. \u201cI was engaged to him.\u201d</p><p>He simply looked at her. He\u2019d known there was something\u2014someone\u2014but she\u2019d never mentioned an engagement before. Stupid, of him, really. And now that he knew . . . He realized he felt a rising swell of jealousy. She\u2019d set out to marry another man\u2014Timothy Holden\u2014once upon a time. Had she loved pretty Timothy Holden with his red lips?</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked at him a moment, then bent to finish putting together the pallet. \u201cIt was over ten years ago. I was only eighteen.\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head. She hadn\u2019t answered the question. \u201cWhere did you meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a dinner party like tonight\u2019s.\u201d She picked up a pillow and smoothed the cover. \u201cHe sat beside me and was so kind. He didn\u2019t turn away, as most gentlemen did back then, when I didn\u2019t immediately fall into conversation with him.\u201d</p><p>Jasper pulled his shirt over his head. He had been one of those ungallant gentlemen, no doubt.</p><p>Melisande laid the pillow down on the pallet. \u201cHe took me for rides in the park, danced with me at balls, all the things a gentleman does when he courts a lady. He wooed me for several months, and then he asked my father for my hand in marriage. Naturally, Father said yes.\u201d</p><p>He sat to shed his hose and shoes. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you married to him?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cHe proposed in October, and we planned to be married in June.\u201d</p><p>Jasper winced. They had been married in June. He went to her and gently helped her out of her wrapper. Then he took her hand and lay down on the pallet with her. She shifted until her head was on his shoulder. He stroked his fingers idly through her long hair. Funny how much more comfortable a pallet could be with her in it.</p><p>\u201cI had shopped for a trousseau,\u201d she said quietly, her breath brushing his bare chest. \u201cSent out invitations, planned the wedding day. Then one day, Timothy came to me and told me he loved another lady. Naturally, I let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Jasper growled.</p><p>Holden was a filthy ass. To lead on a young, gentle girl and then leave her nearly at the altar was the work of a swine. He stroked {e. s ahis sweet wife\u2019s hair as if soothing her for hurts over a decade old and thought about their marriage and their marriage bed.</p><p>At last he sighed. \u201cHe was your lover.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t bother phrasing it as a question. Still, he was almost surprised when she didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cYes, for a while.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Her tone was too flat. He stirred uneasily. \u201cHe didn\u2019t force you, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr threaten you in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was gentle.\u201d</p><p>Jasper closed his eyes. God, he hated this. His hand had stopped moving in her hair, and he was conscious that he was gripping a lock.</p><p>He exhaled and carefully unfisted his hand. \u201cThen what is it? There\u2019s something more that you\u2019re not telling me, my heart.\u201d</p> <p>She was silent so long that he began to think he\u2019d imagined it in a jealous haze. Perhaps there was nothing else.</p><p>But in the end, she sighed, a lost, lonely sound, and said, \u201cI found out I was increasing, shortly after he broke the engagement.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>When Jack returned with the silver ring, he paused only to change into his rags, and then he nipped down to the royal kitchens. The same small boy was stirring the princess\u2019s soup. Jack once again asked him if he might buy a turn at the spoon. Plop! went the silver ring, and Jack was away before the head cook could spy him. He hurried up the stairs and to his princess\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWhy, where have you been all day, Jack?\u201d Princess Surcease asked when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cHere and there, thither and yon, beautiful lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what have you done to your poor arm?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked down and saw that he had a cut from the troll\u2019s blade. \u201cOh, Princess, I did wrestle a monstrous pill bug in your honor today.\u201d</p><p>And Jack capered about until the entire court roared with laughter. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Melisande felt Vale\u2019s fingers pause in her hair. Would he repudiate her now? Get up and walk away? Or would he simply pretend he hadn\u2019t heard her self-damning words and never speak of it again? She held her breath, waiting.</p><p>But he merely ran his fingers through her hair and said, \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>So she closed her eyes and did, remembering that time so long ago now, and the pain that had nearly stopped her heart in her breast. \u201cI knew at once what it was when I became sick in the mornings. I\u2019ve heard of ladies being confused and waiting months to tell because they were not sure, but I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you frightened?\u201d His deep voice was even, and it was hard to tell what he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cNo. Well,\u201d she amended, \u201cperhaps when I first realized my condition. But very soon after that, I knew that I wanted my baby. That no matter what, he would be a joy to me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see his face, but she watched his chest rise and fall beneath her hand. There were curling hairs in the hollow of his breastbone. She threaded her forefinger idly through them and let herself remember a bit of that joy. So strong. So fleeting.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I told no one, not even Emeline. I think I was afraid of what they would make me do. That they would take the baby from me.\u201d She took a steadying breath, determined to tell him all now, in case she couldn\u2019t work up the courage to talk about this again. \u201cI had a plan, you see. I would go to live with my elder brother, Ernest, until I\u2019d begun to show, and then I would retire to a cottage in the country with my old nanny. I would have the baby, and we would raise him together, my nanny and I. It was a silly, childish plan, but at the time I thought it might work. Or maybe it was simply my desperate wishful thinking.\u201d</p><p>She felt the slide of hot tears and knew he must feel their dampness on his chest. Her voice was growing choked. But still he stroked her hair gently, and she found his hand soothing.</p><p>She swallowed and finished her sad story. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t been long with my brother Ernest when I woke in the middle of the night with blood on my thighs. I bled for five days, very heavily, and after that it was gone. My baby was dead.\u201d</p><p>Melisande stopped because her throat had swelled with emotions and she could no longer talk. She closed her eyes and let the tears overflow, running down her temple and onto his chest. She sobbed once and then no more. She simply lay there and trembled with her grief. This was an old wound, but one that appeared fresh and new at odd moments, catching her off guard with its sharp pain. She\u2019d held the possibility of life once, but that life had been taken away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Vale rumbled beneath her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you lost your baby.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak. She could only nod.</p><p>He tilted her head up so he could see her face. His turquoise eyes were intense. \u201cI will give you a baby, my dearest heart. As many babies as you wish, I swear it on my honor.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in wonder. She wasn\u2019t ashamed of what had happened\u2014of who she was\u2014but she\u2019d expected anger, not sympathy, from him.</p><p>He kissed her, his lips moving gently over hers, and it was like a pledge between them, sacred and right. Vale pulled the coverlet over them, carefully tucking it along her side, and hugged her closer. \u201cGo to sleep, my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>His gruff words and tender hands comforted her. Melisande closed her eyes, the last of her tears finally stopping, and listened to the beat of Jasper\u2019s heart under her ear. It was steady and strong, and she drifted into sleep on its rhythm.</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING dawned sullenly, the skies gray with a drizzling rain. Aunt Esther sent them off with a hearty breakfast and much calling and waving good-bye. When at last they turned a corner and Aunt Esther\u2019s town house was out of sight, Melisande turned from the window and looked at Vale.</p><p>\u201cWhen will we arrive at Sir Alistair\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, I think, if we travel well,\u201d Vale replied.</p><p>His legs were canted across the carriage floor as usual, and his body lounged bonelessly on the seat, but his wide mouth was turned down at one corner in a small frown. What did he think of her? He hadn\u2019t treated her any differently this morning as they\u2019d risen, dressed, and eaten, but her confession last night must\u2019ve come as a shock. A man didn\u2019t expect his maiden bride to have taken a lover once upon a time and, what\u2019s more, to have been impregnated by that lover.</p><p>Melisande glanced away from Vale and stared blindly out the window. Vale had received the revelation well enough, but when he had time to think about it, would it bother him? Would the knowledge that she hadn\u2019t been a virgin on their wedding night begin to fester within him? Would he turn against her? She didn\u2019t know, and with a troubled mind, she watched the highland hills roll by.</p><p>They stopped for a late luncheon by a wide, clear stream and ate the cold ham, bread, cheese, and wine that Aunt Esther\u2019s cook had packed for them. Mouse ran about and barked at some nearby highland cows\u2014shaggy things with hair in their eyes\u2014until Vale shouted at him to stop. Then the terrier came over and lay down to gnaw on a ham bone.</p><p>They traveled all that afternoon, and by the time night began to fall, Melisande could see that Vale was restless.</p><p>\u201cHave we lost our way?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe coachman assured me he knew where we were when last we stopped,\u201d Vale replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to see Sir Alistair before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They rode another half hour or so, Suchlike dozing beside Melisande. The road was obviously rutted and poorly maintained, for the carriage rocked and jounced. Finally, just as the last light faded, they heard a shout from one of the men. Melisande peered out the window and thought she saw the dim outlines of a huge building.</p><p>\u201cDoes your friend live in a castle?\u201d</p><p>Vale was peering now too. \u201cIt would appear so.\u201d</p><p>The carriage slowly turned into a narrow drive, and then they were bouncing toward the manor. Suchlike woke with a gasp. Melisande couldn\u2019t see a light in the building anywhere.</p><p>\u201cSir Alistair does know we\u2019re coming, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote him,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>Melisande stared suspiciously at her husband. \u201cDid he reply?\u201d</p><p>But Vale pretended not to hear her, and then they\u2019d rolled to a stop in front of the massive building. There was a shout outside and some scrambling, and after a pause, the carriage door opened.</p><p>Mr. Pynch held a lantern high, the light casting ominous shadows across his gloomy face. \u201cNo one answers the door, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we shall just have to knock louder,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>He jumped from the carriage and turned to help Melisande out. Suchlike climbed carefully down, and Mouse scrambled out and ran to some bushes to relieve himself. The night was very dark indeed, and a cold wind was whistling across the drive, causing Melisande to shiver.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Vale reached back inside the carriage and took out a cloak from under her seat. He wrapped it around her shoulders and then offered her his arm. \u201cShall we, my lady wife?\u201d</p><p>She took his arm and leaned close to whisper, \u201cJasper, what shall we do if Sir Alistair isn\u2019t at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, someone will be about, never fear.\u201d</p><p>He led her up wide, stone steps so old they had a worn dip in the middle where countless feet had trod before. The door was a massive thing at least ten feet high and bound with great iron hinges.</p><p>Vale pounded his fist on the door. \u201cOy! Open up! There\u2019s travelers without who want a hot fire and a soft bed. Oy! Munroe! Come and let us in!\u201d</p><p>He kept up this racket for a good five minutes or more and then suddenly stopped, his fist still raised in midair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melisande looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>And then she heard. From deep inside the house there came a dull scraping, as if some subterranean creature had stirred.</p><p>Vale slammed his fist into the door, making Melisande start. \u201cOy! Come and let us in!\u201d</p> <p>A bolt shot back with a thump, and the door slowly creaked open. A short little man stood in the doorway. He was rather stout, and his graying ginger hair sprang out on either side of his head like the down on a dandelion. The top of his head was completely bald. He wore a long nightshirt and boots, and he scowled up at them.</p><p>\u201cWot?\u201d</p><p>Vale smiled charmingly. \u201cI am Viscount Vale, and this is my lady wife. We\u2019ve come to stay with your master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you ain\u2019t,\u201d the creature said, and began to swing shut the door.</p><p>Vale put out a hand and stopped the door. \u201cYes, we are.\u201d</p> <p>The little man strained against the door, trying to close it, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cNo one\u2019s tol\u2019 me about no visitors. We ain\u2019t got the rooms cleaned nor victuals stocked in. You\u2019ll just have to go away again.\u201d</p><p>By this time, Vale had lost his smile. \u201cLet us in and we\u2019ll settle the accommodations later.\u201d</p><p>The little man opened his mouth, obviously quite prepared to do further battle, but at that moment, Mouse finally rejoined them. The terrier took one look a Sir Alistair\u2019s servant and decided he was the enemy. He barked at the man so vigorously that all four legs bounced off the ground. The ginger-haired little man gave a high-pitched squeal and jumped back. That was all Vale needed. He slammed open the door and crowded in with Mr. Pynch by his side.</p><p>\u201cStay by the carriage until we\u2019re ready,\u201d Melisande instructed Suchlike, and then she entered the castle more sedately behind the men.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! You can\u2019t! You can\u2019t!\u201d the little man was shrieking.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Sir Alistair?\u201d Vale demanded.</p> <p>\u201cOut! He\u2019s gone out riding and might not be back for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rides in the dark?\u201d Melisande asked, startled. The countryside they\u2019d been driving through was rugged, rocky, and hilly. She wouldn\u2019t have thought it safe to ride about alone and at night.</p><p>But the little man was scurrying ahead of them, down a wide hallway. They followed and stopped when he flung open a door. \u201cYou can wait in here, if you like. It makes no difference to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave, but Vale caught him by the collar. \u201cWait.\u201d Vale looked at Melisande. \u201cCan you stay here with Mouse while Pynch and I find bedrooms and some food?\u201d</p><p>The room was dark and not at all welcoming, but Melisande lifted her chin. \u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave, my sweet wife.\u201d Jasper brushed his lips across her cheek. \u201cPynch, light some candles for her ladyship, and then we\u2019ll have this fine fellow give us a tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Mr. Pynch lit four candles\u2014all the room held\u2014from his lantern and the men left.</p><p>Melisande listened to their retreating footsteps and then shivered and looked around her. She was in a kind of sitting room, but it wasn\u2019t very pleasant. Here and there were groupings of chairs\u2014very old and very ugly. The carved wood ceiling was terribly high, and the candlelight didn\u2019t entirely pierce the dark overhead. Melisande thought she saw wisps of old spiderwebs hanging down. The walls were also of dark, carved wood and had been decorated by stuffed animal heads\u2014several moth-eaten deer, a badger, and a fox. Their glass eyes were eerie in the gloom.</p> <p>Shaking herself, she walked determinedly to the great gray stone fireplace at the room\u2019s far end. It was obviously very old\u2014probably older than all the carved wood paneling\u2014and entirely black inside. She found a box by the side containing a few sticks and one log, which she carefully placed inside the fireplace, trying not to think of spiders. Mouse came over to see what she was about, but he soon wandered off again to investigate the shadows.</p><p>Melisande stood and brushed off her hands. She searched the mantelpiece and finally found a jar of dusty tapers. She lit one from a candle and held it to the sticks, but the sticks wouldn\u2019t catch, and the taper soon burned down. Melisande reached for \u0192de ofanother taper and was just about to light it when Mouse barked.</p><p>She started and turned. A man stood behind her, tall and dark and lean, his shoulder-length hair hanging tangled about his face. He was looking at Mouse, standing at his feet, but at Melisande\u2019s movement, he turned his head to her. The left side of his face was twisted with scars, lit awfully by the flickering candles, and the eye socket on that side was sunken and empty.</p><p>Melisande dropped the taper.</p><p>MUNROE\u2019S MANSERVANT WAS telling them that he hadn\u2019t any clean linens in the entire manor, and Jasper was about to shake the man in frustration when he heard Mouse bark. He looked at Pynch, and without a word, they turned and ran back down the dark, twisting stairs. Jasper cursed. He should never have left Melisande alone.</p><p>Outside the sitting room, Jasper paused to approach silently. Mouse hadn\u2019t barked again since that first time. Jasper peered in the room. Melisande stood at the far end, her back to the fireplace. Mouse was in front of her, legs stiff, but he was silent. And facing both of them was a big man in leather gaiters and an old hunting coat.</p><p>Jasper stiffened.</p><p>Munroe turned and Jasper couldn\u2019t help but flinch. When last he\u2019d seen the man, his wounds were raw and bleeding. Time had healed the wounds that covered the left side of his face, scarred them over, but it hadn\u2019t made them any prettier.</p><p>\u201cRenshaw,\u201d Munroe rasped. His voice had always been husky, but after Spinner\u2019s Falls, it had taken on a broken quality, as if damaged by his screams. \u201cBut you\u2019re Vale now, aren\u2019t you? Lord Vale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jasper moved into the room. \u201cThis is my lady wife, Melisande.\u201d</p><p>Munroe nodded, though he didn\u2019t turn back around to acknowledge her. \u201cI believe I wrote you not to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI received no missive,\u201d Jasper said honestly.</p><p>\u201cSome might take that as an unwelcoming sign,\u201d Munroe said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWould they?\u201d Jasper took a deep breath to control the anger surging in his breast. He owed Munroe much\u2014things he could never repay\u2014but this involved Munroe too. \u201cBut, then, the matter I come on is most pressing. We need to talk about Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>Munroe\u2019s head reared back as if he\u2019d been hit in the face. He stared at Jasper, his light hazel eye hooded and unreadable.</p><p>Finally he nodded once. \u201cVery well. But it\u2019s late, and your lady is no doubt tired. Wiggins will show you some rooms. I do not promise comfort, but they can be made warm. In the morning we will talk. Then you can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have your word?\u201d Jasper asked. He wouldn\u2019t put it past Munroe to simply disappear and stay away until they were gone.</p><p>The side of Munroe\u2019s mouth kicked up. \u201cMy word. I will talk to you on the morrow.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded. \u201cI am grateful.\u201d</p><p>Munroe shrugged and walked out of the room. Th\u0192of \"3\"e little red-haired man\u2014presumably Wiggins\u2014had been lurking about the doorway, and now he said grudgingly, \u201cI \u2019spose I can make th\u2019 fire in your rooms.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left without another word.</p><p>Jasper blew out a breath and looked at Pynch. \u201cCan you look to settling the other servants? See if there\u2019s anything to eat in the kitchens and find them rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Pynch said, and departed.</p><p>And that left Jasper with his lady wife. He turned reluctantly to look at her. She still stood in front of the fireplace. Any other woman might be in hysterics by now. Not Melisande.</p><p>She stared back at him levelly and said, \u201cWhat happened at Spinner\u2019s Falls?\u201d</p><p>SALLY SUCHLIKE CAREFULLY spread the hot coals with a poker and then hung a kettle from the big hook in the fireplace. It was a huge fireplace, the biggest Sally had ever seen. Big enough for a grown man to walk into and stand upright. What anyone wanted with such a big fireplace, she didn\u2019t know. It was harder to work with than a nice, normal-sized one.</p><p>The water in her kettle soon began to steam, and she dropped in the jointed rabbit Mr. Pynch had found in the pantry. A lady\u2019s maid was a superior servant, and it wasn\u2019t part of her duties to cook, but there wasn\u2019t anyone else about to prepare their supper. No doubt Mr. Pynch knew how to make a rabbit stew\u2014and a better one than she was attempting\u2014but he was busy finding rooms for their mistress and master.</p><p>Sally threw some chopped carrots into the kettle. They were a little withered, but they\u2019d have to do. She added some little round onions and stirred the whole thing. It looked a bit of a mess at the moment, but maybe it\u2019d perk up once it had stewed a bit. She sighed and sat in a nearby chair, wrapping her shawl tightly about her shoulders. The fact was, she didn\u2019t know much about cooking. When she\u2019d been a scullery maid, she\u2019d mostly washed dishes and cleaned. Mr. Pynch had given her the rabbit, carrots, and onions and told her to boil them, so she did. They\u2019d had no help from that nasty red-haired man, Wiggins. He reminded Sally of a troll from a fairy tale, he did. And he\u2019d disappeared the minute Mr. Pynch\u2019s back was turned, leaving the Renshaw servants to stumble about in an unfamiliar house.</p><p>Sally got up and peered into the simmering pot. Perhaps she ought to add something else. Salt! That was it. Mr. Pynch would think her a ninny if she didn\u2019t know enough to salt a stew. She went to a big cupboard standing in the corner and began to rummage. It was nearly empty, but she did manage to find the salt and some flour.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she was trying to knead a bowl of flour, salt, butter, and water, when Mr. Pynch walked into the kitchens. He set down his lantern and came to where she was battling the dough, then stood silently at her elbow looking into the bowl.</p><p>She glared up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s dumplings for the stew. I tried to do it like I\u2019ve seen Cook do, but I don\u2019t know if I have, and for all I know, it may taste just like glue. I\u2019m not a cook, you know. I\u2019m a lady\u2019s maid, and I\u2019m not expected to know how to cook. You\u2019ll just have to be content with what I can make, and if it turns out terrible, I don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not c\u0192=\"3canomplaining,\u201d Mr. Pynch said mildly.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I like dumplings.\u201d</p><p>Sally blew a lock of hair out of her eyes, feeling suddenly shy. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, and those look perfectly fine. Shall I carry the bowl to the hearth so you can drop them into the stew?\u201d</p><p>Sally straightened her shoulders and nodded. She rubbed her hands to get most of the dough off, and Mr. Pynch picked up the big crockery bowl. Together they went to the fireplace, where he held the bowl while she carefully dropped spoonfuls of dough into the stew. She covered the kettle with an iron lid so the dumplings would steam and turned to Mr. Pynch. She was conscious that her face was sweaty from the heat of the fire. Strands of her hair had come down and were sticking to her face, but she looked him in the eye and said, \u201cThere. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch leaned close and said, \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed her.</p><p>MELISANDE PILED BLANKETS on the floor and watched her husband pace the room. He was agitated tonight, as if at any moment his control would break and he\u2019d leave the room and run. Was that what Sir Alistair had been doing, riding so late and in the dark? Was he trying to outrun demons as well?</p><p>Yet Vale stayed, and she was grateful for that. He hadn\u2019t answered her question about Spinner\u2019s Falls yet. He drank from a glass of whiskey and paced the room, but he stayed with her. There had to be some comfort in that.</p><p>\u201cIt was after Quebec, you see,\u201d he said suddenly. Facing the window, he might not have even been talking to her, save for the fact that she was the only other person in the room. \u201cIt was September, and we\u2019d been ordered to Fort Edward to spend the winter. We\u2019d already lost over one hundred men in the battle and left another three dozen behind because they were too wounded to march. We were decimated but thought the worst was over. We\u2019d won the battle \u2014Quebec had fallen to us\u2014and it was only a matter of time before the French would be forced to surrender entirely and the war would be ours. The tide had turned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused to gulp from the whiskey and said softly, \u201cWe were so hopeful. If the war ended soon, we could go home. That\u2019s all we wanted: to go home to our families. To rest a bit after battle.\u201d</p><p>Melisande tucked a sheet about the blankets. It was a bit musty from the press where it\u2019d been stored, but it would have to do. As she worked, she thought of a younger Jasper, marching with his men through an autumn forest half a world away. He would\u2019ve been elated after a battle won. Happy at the prospect of going home soon.</p><p>\u201cWe were marching down a narrow trail, with rugged hills on one side and a river on the other that ran along a cliff face. The men were only two abreast. Reynaud had just ridden up to me and said he thought we were too strung out; the tail of the marching column was half a mile back. We decided to inform Colonel Darby, to request that we slow the head to let the tail catch up, when they struck.\u201d</p><p>His tone was flat, and Melisande sat back on her heels to watch him as he spoke. He still faced \u0192He hethe window, his back broad and straight. She wished she could go to him, wrap her arms about him and hold him close, but it might interrupt the flow of his words. And she sensed that, like lancing an infected wound, he needed to let the festering corruption drain away.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think in battle,\u201d he said, his tone almost musing. \u201cInstinct and emotion take over. Horror at seeing Johnny Smith shot with an arrow. Rage at the Indians screaming and running at your men. Killing your men. Fear when your horse is shot from beneath you. The surge of panic when you know you must jump clear or be trapped underneath the beast, helpless to a war axe.\u201d</p><p>He sipped at his drink while Melisande tried to understand his words. They made her heart beat faster, as if she felt the same urgent panic he had experienced so long ago.</p><p>\u201cWe fought well, I think,\u201d Vale said. \u201cAt least others have told me so. I can\u2019t evaluate the battle. There\u2019s only the men around you, the little piece of soil that you defend. Lieutenant Clemmons fell and Lieutenant Knight, but it wasn\u2019t until I saw Darby, our commander, dragged from his horse that it occurred to me that we were losing. That we would all be killed.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, but the sound was dry and brittle, not at all like his usual laugh. \u201cThat was when I should\u2019ve felt fear, but oddly I didn\u2019t. I stood in a sea of fallen bodies and swung my sword. And I killed a few of those savage warriors; yes, I did, but not enough. Not enough.\u201d</p><p>Melisande felt tears prick her eyes at the sad weariness of his voice.</p> <p>\u201cIn the end, my last man fell and they overwhelmed me. I went down with a blow to the head. Fell on top of Tommy Pace\u2019s body, in fact.\u201d He turned from the window and crossed to a table where the decanter of whiskey stood. He filled his glass and drank. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t kill me. They should\u2019ve; they\u2019d killed nearly everyone else. But when my wits returned to me, I was roped by the neck to Matthew Horn and Nate Growe. I looked around and saw that Reynaud was part of their booty as well. You won\u2019t believe how relieved I was. Reynaud at least had lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Melisande whispered.</p><p>He looked at her, and she wondered if he\u2019d forgotten she was in the room. \u201cThey marched us through the woods for days. Days and days with little water and no food, and some of us were wounded. Matthew Horn had taken a ball to the fleshy part of his upper arm during the battle. When John Cooper could no longer walk because of his wounds, they led him into the woods and killed him. After that, whenever Matthew stumbled, I leaned my shoulder into his back, urging him on. I couldn\u2019t afford to lose another soldier. Couldn\u2019t afford to lose another man.\u201d</p><p>She gasped at the horror. \u201cWere you wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wore a horrible half-smile on his face. \u201cSave for that bump on the head, I was perfectly fine. We marched until we reached an Indian village in French-held territory.\u201d</p><p>He drank more of his whiskey, nearly emptying the glass, and closed his eyes.</p> <p>Melisande knew, though, that this wasn\u2019t the end of the tale. Something had caused the horrific scars on Sir Alistair\u2019s face. She took a deep breath, bracing herself, and said, \u201cWhat happened at the camp?\u201d&lt;\u0192 atf t/font&gt;</p><p>\u201cThey have a thing called a gauntlet, a pretty way to welcome captives of war to the camp. The Indians line up, men and women, in two long lines. They run the prisoners, one by one, between the lines. As the prisoners run, the Indians hit them with heavy sticks and kick them too. If the man falls, he is sometimes beaten to death. But none of us fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWe did at the time. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and drank more whiskey. He sat slumped into a chair, his words slurring a bit now.</p><p>\u201cJasper?\u201d Perhaps it would be best to go no further. Melisande was afraid of what would come next. He\u2019d already endured so much, and it was late and he was tired. \u201cJasper?\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t seem to hear her. He stared into his whiskey glass, as if bemused. \u201cAnd then came their real fun. They took away Reynaud, and they tied Munroe and Horn to stakes. They took burning sticks and they . . . they . . .\u201d</p><p>He was breathing hard. He closed his eyes and swallowed, and still he couldn\u2019t seem to get the words out.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t, oh, don\u2019t,\u201d Melisande whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, puzzled and sad and tragic. \u201cThey tortured them. Burned them. The sticks were red-hot, and the women wielded them\u2014the women! And then Munroe\u2019s eye. God! That was the worst. I screamed at them to stop, and they spit at me and cut off the men\u2019s fingers. I knew then to be silent, no matter what they did, because crying out, showing any emotion, only made it worse. And I tried, Melisande, I tried, but the screams and the blood . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear, oh, my dear.\u201d Melisande had moved to him. She bent and held him in her arms, his face against her breast. And she couldn\u2019t hold back her tears now. She sobbed for him.</p><p>\u201cThe second day, they brought us to the other side of the camp,\u201d Vale whispered against her breast. \u201cThey were burning Reynaud there. He was crucified and on fire. I think he was dead already, because he didn\u2019t move, and I thanked God again. I thanked God that my dearest friend was dead and could no longer feel the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Melisande whispered. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t stop. \u201cAnd when the fire had died out, they took us back to the other side of camp and went on with it. Munroe\u2019s face and Horn\u2019s chest. On and on and on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were saved in the end, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked desperately. He had to leave these dreadful images and go on to the hopeful part. He\u2019d survived. He had lived.</p><p>\u201cAfter two weeks. I\u2019m told Corporal Hartley led back a rescue party and ransomed us, but I don\u2019t really remember. I was in a daze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in despair and wounded.\u201d Melisande tried to comfort him. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>He pulled violently out of her arms. \u201cNo! No, I was perfectly well, entirely intact.\u201d</p><p>She stared\u0192=\"3ent. \u201cBut the torture . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He ripped open his shirt and revealed his broad chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me, my sweet wife. Is there a scar on any part of my body?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped, puzzled, to his unmarked chest. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they didn\u2019t touch me. In all those days of torturing the others, they never laid a hand on me.\u201d</p><p>Dear God. Melisande stared at his chest. For a man like Vale, being the one left unscarred would be worse than bearing the wounds.</p><p>She took a deep breath and asked the question he so obviously expected. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was the witness, the most senior officer after they\u2019d killed Reynaud, the only other captain. They made me watch, and if I so much as flinched at what they did, they cut deeper, dug the burning brand in harder.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and smiled awfully, the demons shining from his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? They tortured the others while I sat and watched.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Princess Surcease ate her soup, and what should be at the bottom of the bowl but the silver ring? Well, the king roared for the head cook, and the poor man was again dragged before the court. But no matter how they questioned him, he swore up, down, and sideways that he did not know how the ring had come to be in the princess\u2019s soup. In the end, the king had to send him back to the kitchens again. All the people of the court leaned their heads close and wondered who had won the silver ring.</p><p>But Princess Surcease was silent. She merely stared thoughtfully at her fool. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>Melisande woke the next morning to the sound of Mouse scratching at the door. She turned and looked at Vale. He lay with one arm flung over his head, the covers half off his long form. In the last couple nights, she\u2019d discovered that he was a restless sleeper. He often draped an arm or leg over her in his sleep, and sometimes she would wake with his face buried in her neck. More than once he\u2019d rolled over, taking all the covers with him. She didn\u2019t mind. It was well worth the cost of lost blankets to sleep with him.</p><p>But after last night\u2019s harrowing confession, he needed more rest. Melisande carefully slipped from the covers and got up. She found a simple bodice and skirt to put on, wrapped a cloak about herself, and left the room quietly with Mouse. They pattered down the stairs and made their way through the dark hallways to the kitchens.</p><p>Melisande paused. The kitchen had a vast, wide-arched ceiling, plastered and painted with flaking whitewash. It looked terribly old. In the corner, she saw that two pallets had been laid out. Suchlike was fast asleep on one, and Mr. Pynch raised his head from the other. Melisande nodded silently at the valet before slipping out the kitchen door.</p><p>Outside, Mouse ran delightedl\u2020ntly in circles before stopping to do his business. There was a long, sloping lawn here, uncut and wild, and farther on, terraced gardens that must once have been magnificent. Melisande began strolling in that direction. It was a lovely day, the bright morning sun just beginning to blow off the low mist from green hills. Melisande stopped and looked back at the castle. In the daylight, it wasn\u2019t so frightening. Of weathered pale pink stone, it rose up to crumbling stepped gables, and chimneys stuck out here and there. Round turreted towers projected from all four corners, making the whole look solid and ancient. She couldn\u2019t help but think the castle must be cold in winter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s half a millennium old,\u201d a deep rasping voice came from behind her.</p><p>Melisande looked around just as Mouse raced up and began barking.</p><p>Sir Alistair stood with a dog so tall its head was above his waist. The animal\u2019s fur was a shaggy gray. Mouse stood in front of it and barked frantically. The big dog didn\u2019t move. It simply looked down its long nose at Mouse as if wondering what manner of dog this little yapping thing was.</p><p>Sir Alistair frowned at the terrier a moment. This morning, his hair was brushed and clubbed back, and he\u2019d covered his damaged eye with a black eye patch.</p><p>\u201cWhisht, laddie,\u201d he drawled in a broad Scots brogue, \u201cdinna fasht yourself.\u201d</p><p>He hunkered down and held out his fist to Mouse, who trotted over and sniffed. Melisande saw with a little tremor of horror that Sir Alistair\u2019s right hand was missing the forefinger and little finger.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a brave wee lad,\u201d Sir Alistair said. \u201cWhat do you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouse.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stood, looking away, down the sloping lawn. His big dog sighed and lay down by his feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you last night, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. From this side, with his scars nearly concealed, he could\u2019ve been handsome. His nose was straight and arrogant, his chin firm and not a little stubborn. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. I was merely startled at your sudden appearance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his face fully toward her as if daring her to flinch. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin up, refusing to give ground. \u201cJasper thinks you blame him for those scars. Do you?\u201d</p><p>She held her breath at her own bluntness. She\u2019d never have been able to confront him if it had been only for herself. But she needed to know if this man was going to hurt Jasper more.</p><p>He held her gaze, perhaps startled himself at her candor. She\u2019d wager that not many dared mention his scars to him.</p> <p>Finally he looked away again, to the broken, ruined gardens. \u201cIf you wish, I\u2019ll talk to your husband about my scars, my lady.\u201d</p><p>JASPER AWOKE ALONE, his arms empty. After only a few nights, it was already a strange feeling. A wrong feeling. He should have his sweet wife by his side, her soft curves next to his harder body, the scent of her hair and her skin surrounding him. Sleeping with her was \u2039g w shlike a reviving elixir\u2014he no longer tossed and turned the night away. Dammit! Where had she got to?</p><p>He got up and dressed hurriedly, swearing over the buttons on his shirt. He left off a neck cloth altogether and threw on a coat before leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cMelisande!\u201d he called like a lack-wit in the hall. The castle was so big, she wouldn\u2019t hear him unless she was nearby. He called anyway. \u201cMelisande!\u201d</p><p>Downstairs, he made his way to the kitchen. Pynch was there, stirring the fire. Behind him, Melisande\u2019s little maid slept on a pallet. Jasper raised his brows. There were two pallets, but still. Pynch merely nodded silently at the back door.</p> <p>Jasper went outside and had to squint against the sunshine. Then he saw Melisande. She was standing talking to Munroe, and just the sight gave him a twinge of jealousy. Munroe might be a scarred recluse, but he used to have a way with women. And Melisande was standing too close to the man.</p><p>Jasper strode toward them. Mouse caught sight of him and announced his presence by barking once and running toward him.</p><p>Munroe turned. \u201cUp at last, Renshaw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Vale now,\u201d Jasper growled. He put his arm around Melisande\u2019s waist.</p><p>Munroe followed the movement, and his brow arched over his eye patch. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you broken your fast, my lady wife?\u201d Jasper bent toward Melisande.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, my lord. Shall I see what there is in the kitchens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent Wiggins to a nearby farm for some bread and eggs this morning,\u201d Munroe muttered. His cheeks were a little red, as if his lack of hospitality might finally be embarrassing him. He said gruffly, \u201cAfter breakfast, I can show you both the top of the tower. The view is marvelous from there.\u201d</p><p>Jasper felt a shudder run through his wife\u2019s frame and remembered how she clutched the side of his tall phaeton. \u201cPerhaps another time.\u201d</p><p>Melisande cleared her throat and pulled gently away from Jasper. \u201cIf you gentlemen will excuse me, I\u2019d like to see if there are any scraps for Mouse in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Jasper had no choice but to bow as his lady wife nodded and walked toward the castle.</p><p>Munroe stared after her thoughtfully. \u201cYour wife is a charming lady. Intelligent too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d Jasper concurred. \u201cShe does not like heights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Munroe turned to look at Jasper speculatively. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought her your type.\u201d</p> <p>Jasper scowled. \u201cYou have no notion of my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed I do. Six years ago, it ran to big-titted females of low intelligence and lower morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was six years ago. Many things have changed since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they have,\u201d Mu\u2039 thThanroe said. He began strolling toward some overgrown terraces, and Jasper fell in beside him. \u201cYou\u2019ve become a viscount, St. Aubyn is dead, and I have lost half my face, which, by the way, I don\u2019t blame you for.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stopped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Munroe halted as well and turned to face him. He gestured toward the eye patch. \u201cThis. I don\u2019t blame you for it, never have.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked away. \u201cHow can you not blame me? They cut your eye out when I broke.\u201d When he\u2019d groaned in horror at what was being done to his fellow captives.</p><p>Munroe was silent for a moment. Jasper couldn\u2019t bear to look at him. The Scot had been a handsome man once. And though taciturn, he\u2019d never before been a recluse. He used to sit by the fire with the other men and laugh at their coarse jokes. Did Munroe even smile anymore?</p><p>Finally, the other man spoke. \u201cWe were in hell then, weren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Jasper clenched his jaw and nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut they were human, you know, not demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Munroe\u2019s head was back, his one good eye closed. He looked like he was enjoying the breeze. \u201cThe Wyandot Indians who tortured us. They were human. Not animals, not savages, just humans. And it was their choice to put out my eye, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t groaned\u2014\u201d</p><p>Munroe sighed. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t made a sound, they would\u2019ve put it out anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stared.</p><p>The other man nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve studied it since. It\u2019s their way of dealing with prisoners of war. They torture them.\u201d The unscarred corner of his mouth twisted up, though he looked far from amused. \u201cJust as we hang small boys by the neck for picking a grown man\u2019s pocket. It\u2019s simply their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can look at it so dispassionately,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel anger?\u201d</p><p>Munroe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained to observe. In any case, I do not blame you. Your wife was quite adamant that I should tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we must add loyal and fierce to your wife\u2019s list of virtues. Can\u2019t think how you found her.\u201d</p><p>Jasper grunted.</p><p>\u201cA rake like you doesn\u2019t deserve her, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t deserve her doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t fight to keep her.\u201d</p><p>Munroe nodded. \u201cWise of you.\u201d</p><p>As one, they began walking again. There was a bit of silence that Jasper found oddly companionable. Munroe had never exactly been a friend\u2014their interests were too different; their personalities tended to clash. But he\u2019d been there. He\u2019d known the men who were now dead, he\u2019d marched through those hellish woods with a rope about his\u2039 roeir neck, and he\u2019d been the one tortured at the hands of their enemy. There was nothing to explain to him, nothing to hide. He had been there and he knew.</p><p>They reached the terrace\u2019s second level, where Munroe stopped and stared at the view. In the distance was a river, to the right a copse. It was beautiful country. The deerhound that had been following them sighed and lay down beside Munroe.</p><p>\u201cWas that what you came for?\u201d Munroe asked idly. \u201cTo seek my forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jasper said, then hesitated, thinking about his confession to Melisande last night. \u201cWell, perhaps. But it isn\u2019t the only reason.\u201d</p><p>Munroe looked at him. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>So Jasper told him. About Samuel Hartley and the damning letter. About Dick Thornton laughing in Newgate Prison. About Thornton\u2019s accusation that the traitor was one of the men captured. And finally about Lord Hasselthorpe\u2019s near assassination just after Jasper had talked to him.</p><p>Munroe listened to the whole story silently and attentively, and at the end, he shook his head and said, \u201cPure nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that there was a traitor and that we were betrayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that I believe readily enough. How else to explain why such a large party of Wyandot Indian warriors were waiting to ambush us on that trail? No, what I don\u2019t believe is that the traitor was one of the men captured. Which of us could do that? Do you think it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jasper said, and it was true. He\u2019d never thought that Munroe was the traitor.</p><p>\u201cThat leaves you, Horn, and Growe, unless you think one of the dead men did it. Can you imagine any of them, dead or alive, betraying us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But dammit.\u201d Jasper tilted his face toward the sun. \u201cSomeone betrayed us. Someone told the French and their Indian allies that we would be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but you only have the word of a half-mad murderer that it was one of the captives. Give it up, man. Thornton was toying with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give it up,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cCan\u2019t give it up, can\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>Munroe sighed. \u201cLook at it from another angle. Why would any of us do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetray us all, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that. There must be a reason. Sympathy for the French cause?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shook his head.</p><p>\u201cReynaud St. Aubyn did have a French mother,\u201d Munroe said dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. Reynaud\u2019s dead. He was killed almost as soon as we made that wretched village. Besides, he was a loyal Englishman and the best man I ever knew.\u201d</p><p>Munroe held up a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the one pursuing this, not I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am and I can think of another reason for betrayal\u2014money.\u201d Jas\u2039yalhisper turned and looked significantly at the castle. He didn\u2019t truly think Munroe a traitor, but the allegation against Reynaud had irked him.</p><p>Munroe followed his gaze and laughed, his voice rusty with disuse. \u201cThink you if I\u2019d sold us all to the French that my castle would be in such disrepair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have the money tucked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat money I have I\u2019ve inherited or made. It\u2019s my own. If someone did it for money, they were probably in debt or richer for it now. How are your finances? You used to like the cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Hartley and I\u2019ll tell you\u2014I paid off the gambling debts I had back then long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy inheritance. And my lawyers have the papers to prove it, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>Munroe shrugged and began walking again. \u201cHave you looked into Horn\u2019s finances?\u201d</p><p>Jasper fell in beside him. \u201cHe lives with his mother in a town house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were rumors that his father had lost money in a stock scheme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jasper looked at the other man. \u201cThe town house is in Lincoln Inns Field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn expensive part of London for a man with no inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the money to tour Italy and Greece,\u201d Jasper mused.</p><p>\u201cAnd France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jasper stopped.</p><p>It took a moment for Munroe to realize he\u2019d paused. He turned from several paces ahead. \u201cMatthew Horn was in Paris this last fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know this?\u201d</p><p>Munroe cocked his head, turning his good eye toward Jasper. \u201cI may be a recluse, but I\u2019m in correspondence with naturalists in England and the Continent. I received a letter from a French botanist this winter. In it he described a dinner party he went to in Paris. It was attended by a young Englishman called Horn who had been in the Colonies. I think this must be our Matthew Horn, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Jasper shook his head. \u201cWhat would he be doing in Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing the sights?\u201d</p><p>Jasper arched a brow. \u201cWhen we are enemies with the French?\u201d</p><p>Munroe shrugged. \u201cSome would see my correspondence with my French colleague as subversive.\u201d</p><p>Jasper sighed, feeling weary. \u201cIt\u2019s a mare\u2019s nest. I know I\u2019m chasing possibilities that are vague at best, but I can\u2019t forget the massacre. Can you?\u201d</p><p>Munroe smiled bitterly. \u201cWith the memories engraved on my face? No, I can never forget.\u201d</p><p>Jasper tilted his face to the breeze. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come visit us, my lady wife and me, in London?\u201d\u2039Lon\"&gt;&lt; </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChildren cry when they see me, Vale.\u201d Munroe stated it as an unemotional fact.</p><p>\u201cDo you even go to Edinburgh now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I go nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve imprisoned yourself in your castle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make it sound like a tragedy on the stage.\u201d Munroe\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not. I\u2019ve accepted my fate. I have my books, my studies, and my writing. I am . . . content.\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked at the other man skeptically. Content to live in a big drafty castle with only a dog and a surly manservant for company?</p><p>Munroe must\u2019ve known that Jasper would argue the point. He turned back toward the mansion. \u201cCome. We haven\u2019t broken our fast, and no doubt your wife waits for you inside.\u201d</p><p>He strode ahead.</p><p>Jasper cursed and followed. Munroe wasn\u2019t ready to leave his safe nest, and until the stubborn Scot was ready, there was no use arguing. Jasper only hoped that Munroe would budge in this lifetime.</p> <p>\u201cTHAT MAN IS sorely in need of a housekeeper,\u201d Melisande said as their carriage drove away from Sir Alistair\u2019s castle. Suchlike\u2019s head was already nodding in the corner.</p><p>Vale shot an amused look at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t approve of his linens, my heart?\u201d</p><p>She pinched her lips together. \u201cThe musty linens, the dust on every surface, the nearly empty larder, and that horrible, horrible manservant. No, I certainly did not approve.\u201d</p><p>Vale laughed. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll stay on clean sheets tonight. Aunt Esther said she was eager to see us on our return trip. I think she wants to hear gossip about Munroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>Melisande took out her embroidery and sorted through her silks, looking for a shade of lemon yellow. She thought she must have a few strands left, and it was the perfect shade to highlight the lion\u2019s mane.</p> <p>She glanced at Suchlike to make sure the maid was asleep. \u201cDid Sir Alistair tell you what you wanted to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d He stared out the window, and she waited, carefully threading her needle. \u201cSomeone betrayed us at Spinner\u2019s Falls, and I\u2019ve been trying to discover the man.\u201d</p><p>She frowned a little as she placed the first stitch\u2014no small feat in a bumping carriage. \u201cDid you think Sir Alistair was the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I thought he might help me figure out who was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The words should\u2019ve held disappointment, but Jasper seemed cheerful enough. Melisande smiled to herself as she worked the lion\u2019s mane. Perhaps Sir Alistair had given him some peace.</p><p>\u201cBlancmange,\u201d she sai\u2039man lid a few minutes later.</p> <p>He looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou once asked me what my favorite food is. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s blancmange. We had it every year at Christmas when I was a girl. Cook colored it pink and decorated it with almonds. I was the youngest, so I had the smallest dish, but it was wonderfully creamy and delicious. I looked forward to it every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can have pink blancmange every night for supper,\u201d Vale said.</p><p>Melisande shook her head, trying not to smile at his impulsive offer. \u201cNo, that would spoil the specialness of it. Only at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>A happy thrill went through her to be planning a Christmas with him. There would be many Christmases with him, she thought. She couldn\u2019t think of a more wonderful prospect.</p><p>\u201cOnly at Christmas, then,\u201d Vale was saying across from her. He was solemn, as if settling a business contract. \u201cBut I insist that you have an entire bowl for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and found herself smiling. \u201cWhat would I do with a whole bowl of blancmange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could make a pig of yourself,\u201d he said, perfectly seriously. \u201cEat the entire thing at once if you like. Or you can hoard it, just looking at it and thinking how good it will be, how creamy and sweet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can eat but one spoonful every evening. One spoonful, and me sitting across the table looking on with envy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you have your own bowl of blancmange as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s why yours will be so special.\u201d He leaned back in his seat and folded his arms across his chest, looking well pleased with himself. \u201cYes, indeed. I pledge an entire bowl of pink blancmange to you every Christmas. Never let it be said that I am not a generous husband.\u201d</p><p>Melisande rolled her eyes at his foolery, but she smiled as well. She was looking forward to her first Christmas with Jasper.</p><p>They made good time that day and were at Aunt Esther\u2019s house well before supper time.</p><p>In fact, as their carriage rolled to a stop in front of the Edinburgh town house, Aunt Esther was seeing off another couple she\u2019d no doubt had for tea. It took a moment to recognize Timothy and his wife. Melisande watched him, her first love. There had been a time when the mere sight of his handsome face had made her catch her breath. It had taken her years to recover from losing Timothy. Now the pain of his loss was muted and somehow apart from her, as if the broken engagement had happened to some other young, naive girl. She looked at him, and all she could think was, Thank goodness. Thank goodness she\u2019d escaped marrying him.</p><p>Beside her, Vale muttered something under his breath, and then he was bounding from the carriage.</p><p>\u201cAunt Esther!\u201d he cried, seemingly oblivious to the o\u2039ivi bother couple. He strode toward her, and somehow, someway, bumped against Timothy Holden. The shorter man staggered, and Vale went to help him. But Vale must\u2019ve knocked against Timothy again, because he landed on his rear in the muddy street.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Melisande muttered to no one in particular, and scrambled from the carriage before her husband killed her former lover with his \u201ckindness.\u201d Mouse jumped down as well and ran to bark at the fallen man.</p><p>Before she could get there, Vale had offered his hand to help Timothy up. Timothy, the blind idiot, took it, and Melisande nearly covered her eyes. Vale pulled a trifle too hard, and Timothy popped off the ground like a cork and staggered against Vale. Vale leaned his head close to the other man, and Timothy\u2019s face suddenly went an ashy gray. He leapt back from Vale and, declining any further help, hurried his wife into their carriage.</p><p>Mouse gave one last self-satisfied bark, happy to have chased him off.</p><p>Vale bent and petted the dog, muttering something to Mouse that made his tail wag.</p><p>Melisande breathed a sigh of relief and strolled to the two males. \u201cWhat did you say to Timothy?\u201d</p><p>Vale straightened and turned entirely too-innocent eyes on her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right, but it wasn\u2019t much. I requested that he not visit my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRequested?\u201d</p><p>A satisfied smile was playing about his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be seeing Mr. Timothy Holden or his wife here again.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, secretly pleased at his concern for her feelings. \u201cWas that entirely necessary?\u201d</p><p>He took her arm and replied softly, \u201cOh, yes, my heart, oh, yes.\u201d</p><p>Then he was leading her toward Aunt Esther and calling, \u201cWe have returned, Aunt, and we bring news of the reclusive Sir Alistair!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The next day, the king announced a final trial. A golden ring was hidden in a cavern deep underground and guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. Well, Jack put on his suit of night and wind and took up the sharpest sword in the world, and soon enough he stood at the entrance to the cavern. The dragon came roaring out, and Jack had quite a battle, I can tell you, for the dragon was very big. Back and forth they fought, all through the day. It was almost nightfall when the dragon finally lay dead and Jack held the golden ring in his hand. . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>A week later, Melisande walked in Hyde Park with Mouse. They\u2019d arrived back in London only the night before. The journey from Scotland had been uneventful\u2014saving for a horrible meal of cabbage and beef on the third day. Last night, Melisande had made a pallet in a corner of her room, and Vale had slept with her there all night. It was an odd a\ufffdabbrrangement, she knew, but she was so glad to have him with her, sleeping next to her, that she didn\u2019t care. If she had to make her bed on the floor for the rest of her life, it would be fine with her. Suchlike had given the pallet a curious glance but hadn\u2019t said anything. Perhaps Mr. Pynch had informed her of Lord Vale\u2019s strange sleeping habits.</p><p>The wind fluttered her skirts as she walked. Vale had gone to speak with Mr. Horn this morning, probably about Spinner\u2019s Falls. Melisande frowned a little at the thought. She\u2019d hoped that after talking to Sir Alistair, he\u2019d give up the chase, perhaps find some peace. But he was just as intent as ever. Most of the ride back to London he\u2019d theorized and plotted and told and retold her his ideas of who the traitor might be. Melisande had sat and worked her embroidery, but inside, her heart was sinking. What was the likelihood that Vale could discover the man after all these years? And if he couldn\u2019t find the traitor, what then? Would he spend the rest of his life in a fruitless search?</p><p>A shout interrupted her gloomy thoughts. She looked up in time to see Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s little boy, Jamie, embracing Mouse. The dog licked the child\u2019s face enthusiastically. Evidently he remembered Jamie. His sister carefully bent to pat Mouse\u2019s head as well.</p><p>\u201cGood day,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam called. She had been standing a little apart from her children. Now she strolled over. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>They stood side by side, watching the children and the dog for a bit.</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam heaved a sigh. \u201cI ought to get Jamie a dog. He begs for one most piteously. But His Grace can\u2019t abide animals. They make him sneeze, and he says they\u2019re dirty.\u201d</p><p>Melisande was a little surprised at the casual mention of the other woman\u2019s protector, but she tried to hide it. \u201cDogs are rather dirty sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I expect so, but then so are boys.\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam wrinkled her nose, which only made her lovely face more adorable. \u201cAnd, really, it\u2019s not as if he visits us very much anymore. Hardly once a month in the last year. I expect he has gotten himself another woman, like an Ottoman sultan. They keep ladies like sheep in a herd\u2014the Ottomans, I mean. I believe they call it a harem.\u201d</p><p>Melisande could feel herself blushing, and she looked down at her toes.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said. \u201cI\u2019ve embarrassed you, haven\u2019t I? I\u2019m always saying the wrong thing, especially when I\u2019m nervous. His Grace used to say that I should always keep my lips firmly together, because it spoiled the illusion when I opened them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat illusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf perfection.\u201d</p><p>Melisande blinked. \u201cWhat an awful thing to say.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam cocked her head to the side, as if considering. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, I think. I was very much in awe of him when we first met. But then I was very young too. Only seventeen.\u201d</p><p>Melisande truly wished she could ask the other woman how she had beco\u201cow seme the Duke of Lister\u2019s mistress, but she was afraid of the answer.</p><p>Instead, she said, \u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam laughed. She had a lovely, light laugh, but it was tinged with sadness. \u201cDoes one love the sun? It\u2019s there, and it provides us with heat and light, but can one truly love it?\u201d</p><p>Melisande was silent because any answer she gave would only add to the other woman\u2019s sadness.</p><p>\u201cI think one must be equals to love,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam mused. \u201cEqual on some fundamental level. I don\u2019t mean in wealth or even status. I know of women who truly love their protectors and men who love the women they keep. But they are equal on a . . . a spiritual level, if you see what I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think I do,\u201d Melisande said slowly. \u201cIf the man or the woman holds all the emotional power, then they cannot truly love. I suppose one must lay oneself open to love. Let oneself be vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that, but I think you must be right. Love is essentially a surrender.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt would take courage to surrender like that.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded, looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a very courageous woman,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said softly. \u201cIn a way, every choice I\u2019ve made in life has been out of fear.\u201d</p> <p>Melisande looked at her curiously. \u201cSome would say that the life you\u2019ve chosen takes a great deal of courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know me.\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam shook her head. \u201cTo be guided by fear isn\u2019t the life that I wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam nodded. \u201cI wish I was able to change.\u201d</p><p>As do I, Melisande thought. For a moment, they shared an odd rapport, just the two of them, respectable lady and kept mistress.</p> <p>Then Jamie gave a shout, and they both looked over. He appeared to have fallen in some mud.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam murmured. \u201cI had better take him home. I don\u2019t know what my maid will say when she sees his clothes.\u201d</p><p>She clapped her hands and called briskly to the children. They looked disappointed but began slowly walking over.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said.</p><p>Melisande raised her eyebrows. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor talking with me. I enjoyed our conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Melisande suddenly wondered how often Mrs. Fitzwilliam got to talk with other ladies. She was a kept woman and therefore beyond the pale with respectable ladies, but she was also the mistress of a duke, which would place her far above most anyone else. She stood in a rarefied and lonely sphere.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it too,\u201d Melisande said impulsively. \u201cI wish we might talk more.\u201d</p><p>&lt;\u201c%\" 4%\"font size=\"3\"&gt;Mrs. Fitzwilliam smiled tremulously. \u201cPerhaps we shall.\u201d</p><p>Then she was gathering her children and bidding farewell, and Melisande was left with Mouse. She turned back the way she\u2019d come. A carriage waited for her, and a footman trailed her discreetly behind. She thought about what she\u2019d said to Mrs. Fitzwilliam, that true love demanded vulnerability. And she wondered if she had the courage to make herself that vulnerable once again.</p><p>\u201cWAS MUNROE ABLE to provide you with any new ideas of who the traitor could be?\u201d Matthew Horn asked Jasper later that afternoon.</p><p>Jasper shrugged. They were riding through Hyde Park again, and he was restless. He wanted to nudge Belle into a gallop, ride until both he and the mare were sweating. He felt near the breaking point. As if he couldn\u2019t push forward with his life until he found the traitor and moved on. God, how he wanted to move on.</p><p>Perhaps that was why his voice was sharp when he said, \u201cMunroe said I should look at the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe man who betrayed us was probably working for the French. Either he did so for political reasons or he was paid. Munroe pointed out I should look into the finances of the men who were captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would take money and then go through the hell of being captured?\u201d</p><p>Jasper shrugged. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t intend to get caught. Maybe something went wrong with his plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Horn shook his head. \u201cNo. This is ridiculous. If there was a French traitor, he\u2019d make sure he wasn\u2019t near Spinner\u2019s Falls when the Indians ambushed us. He\u2019d pretend illness or fall behind or simply desert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he couldn\u2019t? What if he was an officer? See here, only the officers knew where we marched\u2014\u201d</p><p>Horn snorted. \u201cThere were rumors among the men. You know how well secrets are kept in the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cBut if he was an officer, he would\u2019ve had a hard time getting away. We\u2019d already been decimated at Quebec, remember. Officers were in short supply.\u201d</p><p>Horn pulled his horse to a halt. \u201cSo you will investigate the finances of every man who was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr will you just investigate the finances of the captives?\u201d</p><p>Jasper looked at Horn. \u201cMunroe told me something else as well.\u201d</p><p>Horn blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also said you were in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he has a French friend who wrote that he met a man named Horn at a dinner party in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous,\u201d Matthew exclaimed. His face had reddened, and his mouth was a grim horizontal line. \u201cHorn is not such an uncommon name. It was another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you weren\u2019t in Paris this last fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Horn\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cNo, I was not in Paris. I toured Italy and Greece, as I\u2019ve already told you.\u201d</p><p>Jasper was silent.</p><p>Horn gripped his reins and leaned forward in the saddle, his body stiff with anger. \u201cAre you questioning my honor, my very loyalty to my country? How dare you, sir? How dare you? Were you any other man, I would call you out this very minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew . . . ,\u201d Jasper began, but Horn wheeled his horse and cantered off.</p><p>Jasper watched him go. He\u2019d insulted a man he\u2019d considered a friend. Jasper rode back to his town house, grimly pondering what made him insult a man who\u2019d never done him any harm. Horn was right: Munroe\u2019s friend could very well be mistaken as to who he\u2019d seen in Paris.</p><p>He reached home, his thoughts conflicted, and found that Melisande was still out, a fact that turned his mood even more black. He\u2019d been looking forward to seeing her, he realized, and discussing the disastrous ride with Matthew Horn. He bit back a curse and stalked to his study.</p><p>He\u2019d only time to pour himself a splash of brandy before Pynch knocked on the door and entered.</p><p>Jasper turned and scowled at his valet. \u201cDid you find your man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord,\u201d Pynch said as he advanced into the room. \u201cMr. Horn\u2019s butler was indeed the brother of a fellow soldier I served with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, my lord. Today is his half day off, and I met him in a tavern. I stood him several drinks as we reminisced about his brother. The man died at Quebec.\u201d</p><p>Jasper nodded. Many had died at Quebec.</p><p>\u201cAfter the fourth drink, Mr. Horn\u2019s butler became loquacious, my lord, and I was able to turn the conversation to his master.\u201d</p><p>Jasper gulped the brandy, no longer sure he wanted to hear what Pynch had to say. But he\u2019d started these events in motion, had sent Pynch on the hunt as soon as they\u2019d returned to London. It seemed cowardly to balk now.</p><p>He looked at Pynch, his loyal servant who\u2019d nursed him through the worst of the drunken stupors and nightmares. Pynch had always served him well. He was a good man.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>His valet looked at him, his green eyes steady and a little sad. \u201cThe butler said the Horn finances were quite distressed on Mr. Matthew Horn\u2019s father\u2019s death. His mother was forced to relieve most of the servants. There were whispers that she\u2019d have to sell the town house. And then Mr. Horn returned from the war in the Colonies. The servants were rehired, a new carriage was bought, and Mrs. Horn wore new gowns\u2014the first in six years.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stared blindly into his empty glass. This wasn\u2019t what he wanted. This wasn\u2019t the relief he\u2019d sought. \u201cWhen did Mr. Horn\u2019s father die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe summer of 1758,\u201d Pynch said.</p><p>The summer before Quebec fell. The summer before Spinner\u2019s Falls.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jasper said.</p><p>Pynch hesitated. \u201cThere is always the possibility of an inheritance or some other perfectly innocent source of money.\u201d</p><p>Jasper arched a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cAn inheritance the servants never heard about?\u201d That was very unlikely. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Pynch bowed and left the room.</p><p>Jasper topped off his glass of brandy and went to stare into the fire. Was this what he wanted? If Horn was the traitor, could he really turn him in to the authorities? He closed his eyes and sipped the brandy. He\u2019d put these events in motion, and he was no longer sure he had any control over them.</p><p>When he looked up again, Melisande was standing in the doorway.</p><p>Jasper drained his glass. \u201cMy lovely wife. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took a walk in Hyde Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d He crossed to the decanter and poured himself more brandy. \u201cOut meeting demimondaines again?\u201d</p><p>Melisande\u2019s face grew cool. \u201cPerhaps I should leave you by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d He smiled at her and raised his glass. \u201cYou know how I hate being alone. Besides, we must celebrate. I am close to accusing an old friend of treason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAu contraire. I am ecstatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJasper . . .\u201d She looked at her hands, clasped at her waist, as she gathered her words. \u201cYou seem obsessed with this hunt. With what happened at Spinner\u2019s Falls. I worry that the hunt is harming you. Would it not be better to . . . to leave it be?\u201d</p><p>He sipped the brandy, watching her. \u201cWhy would I do that? You know what happened at Spinner\u2019s Falls. You know what this means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you seem caught by what happened, unable to move beyond it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched my best friend die.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know. And perhaps now you should let your best friend go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it were me, if I\u2019d been the one to die there, Reynaud would never rest until he found the traitor.\u201d</p><p>She watched him silently, her tilted cat eyes mysterious, unfathomable.</p><p>His lip curled as he drank the rest of the brandy. \u201cReynaud wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReynaud is dead.\u201d</p><p>His entire body stilled, and he slowly raised his eyes.</p><p>Her chin was tilted up, her mouth firm and almost stern. She\u201cmosowl looked as if she could face down an entire hoard of screaming Indians.</p><p>\u201cReynaud is dead,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd besides, you are not him.\u201d</p><p>MELISANDE BRUSHED OUT her hair that night and thought about her husband. Vale had left his study without another word this afternoon after they\u2019d argued. She stood up from her dressing table and roamed the room. The pallet was ready for their bed, and the decanter of wine on the side table had been newly filled. All was in readiness for her husband. Yet he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>It was past ten o\u2019clock, and he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>He\u2019d shared supper with her. Surely he hadn\u2019t gone out again afterward without telling her? That had been his habit in the first days of their marriage, but things had changed since then. Hadn\u2019t they?</p><p>Melisande drew her wrap about herself and made up her mind. If he wouldn\u2019t come to her, then she\u2019d go to him. She crossed with determined steps to the door leading into his rooms and twisted the handle.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Melisande stared at the door handle dumbly for a moment, not quite believing what she\u2019d felt. The door was locked. She blinked, but then pulled herself together. Perhaps it had been mistakenly locked. After all, she didn\u2019t usually go from her rooms to his. Normally it was the other way around. Melisande went out into the hall and walked to Vale\u2019s door. She tried the handle and found that it, too, was locked. Well, this was silly. She rapped on the door and waited. And waited. Then rapped again.</p><p>It was perhaps five minutes before the truth dawned on her: he wasn\u2019t going to let her in.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>It was late by the time Jack hurried back to the castle. He barely had time to put away his suit and armor before rushing to the kitchens and bribing the little kitchen boy once again. Then he ran to the royal banquet room where the court had already sat down to eat their supper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy, Jack,\u201d said the princess when she saw him, \u201cwherever have you been, and what is that burn upon your leg?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked down and saw that the dragon had wounded him with its fire.

She pursed her lips when she saw the empty breakfast room. Was he avoiding her? She\u2019d been blunt the day before\u2014perhaps too blunt. He\u2019d loved Reynaud, she knew, and it took time to recover from such a grievous loss. But it had been seven years. Couldn\u2019t he see that his hunt for the Spinner\u2019s Falls traitor had enveloped his life? A\u2013timnd didn\u2019t she as his wife have the right to point this out to him? Surely she was supposed to help him find happiness\u2014or at least contentment\u2014in life. After all the years she\u2019d loved him, after they\u2019d come so far in their marriage, it wasn\u2019t fair for him to pull away from her now. Didn\u2019t he owe her at least the politeness of listening to her?</p><p>After a simple breakfast of buns and hot chocolate, Melisande decided she couldn\u2019t bear rattling about the big town house by herself. She patted her hip for Mouse and went with him to the front hall.</p><p>\u201cI am taking Mouse for a walk,\u201d she informed Oaks.</p><p>\u201cVery well, my lady.\u201d The butler snapped his fingers for a footman to accompany her.</p><p>Melisande pressed her lips together. She\u2019d much rather take her walk alone, but that simply wasn\u2019t an option. She nodded to Oaks as he held the big door for her. Outside, the sun had hidden behind a bank of clouds, making the morning so dark it was like evening. But that wasn\u2019t what made her halt in her tracks. At the bottom of her front steps stood Mrs. Fitzwilliam and her two children, and Mrs. Fitzwilliam was carrying two soft bags.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>Mouse ran down the steps to greet the children.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said. She sounded distracted, and her eyes glittered as if from tears hardly held in check. \u201cI . . . I shouldn\u2019t bother you. I am so sorry. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go, but Melisande ran down the steps. \u201cPlease stay. Won\u2019t you come in and have a dish of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A tear escaped and ran down the lady\u2019s cheek. She swiped at it with the back of her hand like a little girl. \u201cOh. You must think me a wigeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Melisande linked her arm with the other woman\u2019s. \u201cI believe my cook is baking scones today. Please come in.\u201d</p> <p>The children looked eager at the mention of scones, and that seemed to decide Mrs. Fitzwilliam. She nodded and let Melisande lead her inside. Melisande chose a small room at the back of the house that had French doors leading into the garden.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said when they\u2019d sat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you must think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have company,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>A maid came in with a tray of scones and tea. Melisande thanked and dismissed her.</p><p>Then she looked at Jamie and Abigail. \u201cWould you like to take your scones into the garden with Mouse?\u201d</p><p>The children jumped up with alacrity. They contained themselves until they were outside, and then Jamie gave a whoop and ran down the path.</p><p>Melisande smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re lovely children.\u201d</p><p>She poured a dish of tea and handed it to Mrs. Fitzwilliam.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam took a sip. It seemed to steady her. She looked up and met Melisan\u203aand hede\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve left His Grace.\u201d</p><p>Melisande had poured herself some tea as well. Now she lowered the cup from her lips. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cast me off,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d How awful to be \u201ccast off\u201d like a worn shirt.</p><p>The other lady shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time\u2014or even the second. His Grace gets into tempers. He\u2019ll stomp about and yell, and then he\u2019ll say that he no longer wants me and I\u2019m to leave his house. He never hurts me; I don\u2019t want you to think that. He just . . . carries on.\u201d</p><p>Melisande sipped her tea, wondering if telling someone they weren\u2019t wanted anymore wasn\u2019t in some ways worse than hurting them physically. \u201cAnd this time?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam squared her shoulders. \u201cThis time I decided to take him at his word. I left.\u201d</p><p>Melisande nodded once. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam swallowed. \u201cHe will want me back. I know he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said before that you thought it possible he had taken a new mistress,\u201d Melisande said in an even voice.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m almost sure of it. But that doesn\u2019t matter. His Grace does not like letting go of what he considers his. He keeps things\u2014people\u2014whether or not he wants them, simply because they are his.\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam looked out the window as she said this, and Melisande followed her gaze.</p><p>Outside the children played with Mouse.</p><p>Shew drew in a breath, finally understanding Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s real fear. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>The other lady watched her children, a private deep love in her eyes that made Melisande feel like an intruder.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care for them, not really. And he\u2019s not good for the children. I must get them away. I simply must.\u201d Her gaze turned to Melisande. \u201cI have money, but he will track me. I may\u2019ve even been followed here. I need a place far away. Somewhere he won\u2019t think to look. I thought perhaps Ireland or even France. Except I don\u2019t speak French, and I know no one in Ireland.\u201d</p><p>Melisande got up and rummaged in a desk in the far corner of the room. \u201cWould you be willing to work?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fitzwilliam\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOf course. But I don\u2019t know what I could do. My penmanship is very fine, but no family will hire me on as a governess when I have the children with me. And besides, as I said, I know no French.\u201d</p><p>Melisande found some paper, a pen, and ink. She sat down at the desk with a determined smile. \u201cDo you think you could keep house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA housekeeper?\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam got up and wandered over. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about keeping a house. I\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Melisande finished writing her note and rang for a footman. \u201cThe person I have in mind will be quite lucky to have you, and you needn\u2019t take the position long\u2014just until the duke loses your trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>One of the footmen entered the room, and Melisande crossed to him with the folded and sealed note. \u201cTake this to the dowager viscountess. Tell her it\u2019s urgent and I would very much appreciate her help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d He bowed and left.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to become the dowager Viscountess Vale\u2019s housekeeper?\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam sounded appalled. \u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Melisande took the other lady\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ve asked to borrow her carriage. You said you might have been followed. The carriage will go \u2019round back and wait at the end of the mews. We\u2019ll smuggle you and the children in disguised as servants. Your watchers won\u2019t be expecting you to take Lady Vale\u2019s carriage. Trust me, Mrs. Fitzwilliam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please call me Helen,\u201d Mrs. Fitzwilliam said absently. \u201cI wish . . . I wish there was some way I could show my thanks.\u201d</p><p>Melisande thought a moment before asking, \u201cYou said your hand was very fine, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is a small thing you can do for me, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Melisande rose and went to the dresser again, pulling out a drawer and taking out a flat box. She brought it back to where Helen sat. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished translating a children\u2019s book for a friend, but my handwriting is deplorable. Could you copy it out fresh for me so that I can have it bound into a book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, certainly.\u201d Helen took the box and smoothed her fingers over the top. \u201cBut . . . but where are you sending me? Where are my children and I going?\u201d</p><p>Melisande smiled slowly, because she really was rather pleased with herself. \u201cScotland.\u201d</p><p>MELISANDE WAS GONE when Jasper returned that afternoon. Inexplicably this irritated him. He\u2019d been avoiding his lady wife for nearly a full day, and now that he wanted to see her, she wasn\u2019t here. Fickle woman.</p><p>He ignored the voice in his head that said he was being an ass and climbed the stairs to his rooms. He paused outside his own door and then looked down the hall to hers. On impulse, he entered her room. Nearly a month ago, he\u2019d come here for answers to who his wife was and had gone away no wiser. Now he\u2019d traveled with her to Scotland, learned she\u2019d had a lover and been with child, made love to her thoroughly and wonderfully, and still\u2014still\u2014he felt that she held something back from him. God! He didn\u2019t even know, after all this time, why she had married him.</p><p>Jasper prowled the room. He\u2019d been ridiculously vain when she\u2019d first presented him with her proposal of marriage. He\u2019d assumed\u2014if he\u2019d thought about it at all\u2014that she hadn\u2019t other choices. That she was on the shelf and had no suitors. That he was her last chance at marriage. But now, after living with her, bantering with her, making love to her, Jasper knew that his first vague thoughts were terribly off the mark. She was a quick-witted, intelligent woman. A woman who flamed to life in bed. The kind of woman a man could spend his entire life looking for and never find. But if he did find her . . . then he would make sure he held her and kept her close and happy.</p><p>g fght=\"0%\" width=\"4%\"&gt;Melisande had had choices. The question was, why had she chosen him?</p><p>Jasper found himself in front of her chest of drawers. He stared at them a moment and then bent and pulled out the bottom drawer to find the little tin snuffbox. He straightened with it in his hand. Inside was the same little china dog and the silver button, but the pressed violet was missing. He stirred the items with his finger. Other things had been added to the little cache in place of the violet: a tiny sprig and a few hairs curled together. He picked up the sprig and looked at it. The leaves were narrow, almost needlelike, and small lavender flowers climbed the stem. It was a sprig of heather. From Scotland. And the hair looked like it might very well be his own.</p><p>He was frowning down at the snuffbox when behind him the door opened.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother trying to hide what he\u2019d found. In a strange way, he welcomed this confrontation.</p><p>He turned to face Melisande. \u201cMy lady wife.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door gently behind her and looked from his face to her treasure box. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to discover something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you married me.\u201d</p><p>VALE STOOD BEFORE Melisande with her most intimate secrets in his hand and asked her the stupidest question she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>She blinked and because she couldn\u2019t quite credit him with such idiocy, said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He prowled toward her, the snuffbox still in his long, bony fingers. His curling mahogany hair was pulled back in a queue that was coming undone; his face was lined and sad, pouches beneath his eyes testament to his sleepless nights. His wide shoulders were covered in a brown and red coat with a stain on the elbow, and his shoes were scuffed. She had never felt so angry at another person and at the same time been aware of how beautiful he was to her.</p><p>How perfect in all his imperfections.</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you married me, my one and only heart,\u201d he said, his complete attention on her.</p><p>\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head at her tone and her words, as if his curiosity was aroused more than his anger. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps you were dropped on your head as a child,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cOr mayhap madness runs in your family.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, still advancing toward her. \u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your stupidity is all your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m any more dim-witted than other males.\u201d He was right in front of her now, leaning into her face, too close, too personal.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said as she shoved against him violently, \u201cyou are.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge an inch, damn him. He simply pocketed her\u2014her!\u2014snuffbox and tangled the fingers of one hand roughly in her hair. He pulled her head back and placed his mouth, open and wet, against her throat.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he growled, and she felt the vibration of his voice against her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most stupid, lack-witted\u201d\u2014she shoved again and when he still didn\u2019t move, balled her fists and hit his chest and arms\u2014\u201cimbecilic man in the history of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he sighed against her throat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to mind or even feel her blows. He tore away the bit of lace at her neckline and lowered his mouth to the upper slopes of her breasts. \u201cTell me why, my sweet wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have watched you,\u201d she panted, \u201cfor years. I\u2019ve seen you look at women\u2014vapid, pretty women. I\u2019ve seen you choose which ones you wanted. I\u2019ve seen you stalk them, woo them, and seduce them. And I\u2019ve seen when you grew tired of them, when your eyes would start to wander again.\u201d</p><p>He tore at the laces to her bodice, loosening and pulling aside the fabric of her dress and stays until he reached her bare nipple. He palmed one breast and drew the other into his mouth, sucking strongly.</p><p>She cried out.</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and felt her mouth twist in a grimace of rage. Of pain. \u201cI saw you. I saw you take them aside, saw you whisper in their ear. Saw when you left with a particular woman and knew that you were taking her away to bed her.\u201d</p><p>Her whole face was contorted, tears streaming down, scalding her cheeks, and still he looked at her. His expression was intent, his hands gentle as he thumbed her nipples.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want his gentleness. The dam had broke, and all the emotion she\u2019d suppressed for years was pouring forth. She held his shoulders, used them as leverage to reach up and bite him on the ear. He jerked his head back and, in a swift movement, swept her off her feet. She screamed, long and loud, as he threw her over his shoulder and bore her to the bed. He let her fall there, the impact cutting off her scream. He was upon her before she could move, his legs over hers, her wrists caught in one strong hand.</p><p>A pounding came at the door.</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d he shouted, his eyes never leaving her face.</p><p>\u201cMy lord! My lady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one opens that door, do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit! Leave us alone!\u201d</p> <p>They both listened as the footman\u2019s steps left. Then Jasper leaned down and licked her neck. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She arched up, but his legs held her down, and she couldn\u2019t get purchase. \u201cAll those years . . .\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his neck clo\u203aff anth and tied her wrists to the bed rails over her head. \u201cAll those years, what? Tell me, Melisande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you,\u201d she panted. She looked over her head and yanked on the neck cloth. It didn\u2019t give. \u201cI watched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop struggling,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt yourself, sweet lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt!\u201d She laughed and it had an hysterical edge.</p><p>He took a knife from his pocket and began cutting away her clothes, each rip a sensuous tug against her oversensitive skin. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bedded them, woman after woman.\u201d She remembered the jealousy, the deep, cutting pain. He pulled the bodice entirely off her. \u201cSo many I couldn\u2019t even keep track. Could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He wrenched off her skirts and threw them to the floor. Taking off her shoes, he tossed them away as well. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember their names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d She was naked now, save for her stockings and garters. Her hands were bound above her, but her legs were free. She kicked at him and hit his thigh.</p><p>He fell on her heavily, his hips across hers. His mouth was on her breast again, his hand combing through the curls at the top of her thighs. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched you for years,\u201d she whispered. The tears were drying on her cheeks, and heat was building within her. If he would just touch her. Touch her there. \u201cI watched you and you never saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you now,\u201d he said, licking around a nipple. He trailed his tongue across her breast and to the other breast, circling the nipple there. Delicately. Tenderly.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it now.\u201d He tested her flesh with his teeth.</p><p>Pleasure mixed with pain shot through her, straight from her nipple to where his hand still played. She arched, silently begging, and he relented, sucking the nipple strongly into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d She swallowed, trying to focus her thoughts. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know I existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now.\u201d</p><p>And he slid down her body, spreading her knees and draping her calves over his shoulders.</p><p>She bucked, trying to dislodge him, but she couldn\u2019t budge him any more now than she could before.</p><p>He lowered his head and licked her sex.</p><p>Her belly contracted in shock, her bound hands fisted, and then she closed her eyes and simply felt. The wet stroke of his tongue, the fingers of one hand flexing on her hip bone, the other petting her mound. He licked and licked again, each stroke slow and intimate. Each stroke hitting her clitoris. She flexed her fingers, feeling the tension build. He moved his hands, spreading her folds, opening her and making her vulnerable.</p><p>She bit her lip, waiting, waiting.</p><p>And then he set his mouth directly on her bud and sucked. Nibbling, dragging, pulling on that bit of flesh until she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and broke. She arched, thrusting her pelvis into his face, feeling the heat flashing through her, hearing the pound of her heartbeat. He still licked and sucked, his hands heavy, holding her down. Another wave hit and she moaned, the sound loud in the quiet room. Some other time she might care, might feel embarrassed at the erotic sounds she was making, but right now . . .</p><p>Oh, God. Right now, she was a creature of pleasure.</p><p>He thrust two fingers into her, still gently licking with devastating accuracy, and she trembled. Her whole body tightened, arching, her muscles tensing, waiting. She couldn\u2019t. She was too weak, too spent.</p><p>And then he moved his fingers within her and sucked again on her flesh. The muscles inside her contracted and released. She came, shaking with the force of her orgasm, shuddering and gasping. White heat spread from her center in a widening pool of pleasure. She went limp with warm relief.</p><p>She felt him move. Opening her eyes lazily, she found him lowering her legs. She let them lie on the bed, her thighs spread wide and wanton. He stared at her exposed center as he stood and removed his clothes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t unbed the women I fucked before I knew you. Knew who you were.\u201d</p><p>His eyes raised to hers, and the blue of them was so bright it nearly illuminated the room. \u201cBut I tell you now that I will never bed another woman besides you in my lifetime. You are all I want. You are all I see now.\u201d</p><p>He stepped from his breeches, and she saw that he was erect, his penis standing to his navel in primitive masculine pride. He climbed onto the bed and prowled up her body, straight-armed. His planted fists made the muscles in his shoulders and arms flex and bunch.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cUntie me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said calmly, though his voice was a rasp. He bent and scraped his teeth over her throat.</p><p>She shivered in erotic anticipation.</p><p>He kicked her legs farther apart and lowered his hips, his penis firmly on top of her oversensitive folds.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet,\u201d he growled. \u201cWet and waiting for me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d He slid his enormous head through her flesh. \u201cTell me, Melisande.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d He bumped his hips against her, and the shaft of his cock slid through her folds, setting all her nerves alight.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m wet for you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She tried to m\u203a&gt;Sh%\" ove, tried to arch her hips into his, but he was too heavy, his position too firm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make love to you now,\u201d he whispered roughly against her neck. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my prick in your cunny and it will be just you and me, Melisande. All those others, all those memories, they don\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes fully at this statement and watched him. He was above her, his chest sheened with sweat. It had taken a toll on him as well, holding back, and that fact made her smile.</p><p>He looked into her eyes. \u201cBut I still need something from you.\u201d</p><p>He moved his hips, and the head of his cock slid back until it just kissed her entrance.</p><p>She swallowed, nearly mindless with lust. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the truth.\u201d</p><p>He shoved and his penis began to enter her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you the truth.\u201d</p><p>He left her and she nearly wept.</p><p>He pressed his penis against her clitoris again and bore down. His arms were straight on either side of her, his upper body held apart from her straining one. \u201cNot all of it. Not the whole truth. I want you. I want your secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no more secrets,\u201d she whispered. Her arms were shaking, still drawn over her head, and she knew her nipples were hard points between them.</p><p>He drew back and shoved his entire length inside her. She hissed. So full, so complete. It was nearly heaven.</p><p>But he stopped and held himself still. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She locked her legs about him, holding his thickness within her. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at her and pulled his hips back quite deliberately. Even with her legs around him, he withdrew easily. \u201cDo you want this? Do you want my cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She was past pride, past deception. She needed his flesh within her. She was half mad with wanting.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me why you married me.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>A corner of his mouth twitched, though a bead of sweat ran down the side of his face. He couldn\u2019t hold out much longer either, and she knew it.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019ll make love to you, my sweet, my lady wife.\u201d</p><p>And he slammed his entire, thick length into her. He pounded into her wildly, completely out of control. She was past caring. Her head arched back, her eyes closed. She felt his hard body take its pleasure of hers. He leaned down and licked her shaking breasts, and she saw stars, imploding behind her eyelids, sparkling through her limbs. She gasped, and his tongue invaded her mouth. His body shook as his penis plunged into her again and again.</p><p>He stopped suddenly, and she opened her\u203a shis eyes. His head was thrown back, his eyes blind, pleasure convulsing his face.</p><p>\u201cMelisande!\u201d he cried.</p><p>His head thumped to the pillow beside hers, his lungs sucking air. He was heavy and hard, and her arms were still drawn over her head. It didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d gladly suffocate here underneath him. She turned her face toward him and licked the ear she\u2019d earlier bloodied, and she finally said it. She gave him what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019ve always loved you.

There was a coldness in the pallet where before Melisande\u2019s warmth had been against his side. The scent of oranges lingered faintly, but she was no longer in the room. He sighed, feeling the ache of muscles used until exhaustion. She had worn him out, but in the end, he\u2019d heard what he wanted to know. She loved him.</p><p>Melisande loved him.</p><p>He opened his eyes on the thought. He probably didn\u2019t deserve her love. She was an intelligent, sensitive, beautiful woman, and he was a man who had watched his best friend burn to death. In some ways, he bore scars deeper than the men who had been physically tortured. His scars were on his soul, and they still seeped blood now and again. He was hardly a worthy object of any woman\u2019s love, let alone Melisande\u2019s. And what was worse\u2014what made him tru\ufffdsouly a cad\u2014was that he had no intention of ever letting her go. He might not be entirely worthy of her love, but he would hold it close until the day he died. He\u2019d not let her change her mind. Melisande\u2019s love was a healing salve, a balm upon his scars, and he would treasure it for the rest of his life.</p><p>The thoughts made him restless, and he rolled to his feet. He didn\u2019t bother ringing for Pynch but washed and got dressed by himself. He ran down the stairs, where he found out from Oaks that Melisande had gone to visit his mother and wouldn\u2019t be back for an hour or more.</p><p>Jasper felt a vague disappointment, mingled with relief. The discovery of her love for him was very fresh\u2014it was almost too sensitive to bear touch. He wandered into the breakfast room and picked up a bun, biting into it absentmindedly. But he was too restless to sit and eat. His limbs felt as if bees had entered his blood and buzzed through his veins.</p><p>He finished the roll in two more bites and strode to the front of the house. Melisande might not be back for several hours, and he couldn\u2019t simply sit and wait. Besides, there was a chore he needed to get through, and he might as well do it now. He should finish this thing with Matthew. And if it was another dead end, as he suspected, well then maybe his lady wife was right.</p> <p>Maybe it was time to let Spinner\u2019s Falls go and let Reynaud rest in peace.</p><p>\u201cAsk Pynch to come here, please,\u201d Jasper said to Oaks. \u201cAnd have two horses brought \u2019round.\u201d</p><p>He paced the hall as he waited.</p><p>Pynch appeared from the back of the house. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Matthew Horn,\u201d Jasper said. He gestured for Pynch to follow as he strode out the doors. \u201cI want you to accompany me in case of . . .\u201d He waved his hand vaguely.</p><p>The valet understood. \u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The two men mounted the waiting horses, and Jasper nudged his bay into a trot. The day was a grim gray. Low clouds hung overhead, threatening rain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d he muttered as he rode. \u201cHorn is a gentleman from a good family, and I consider him a friend. If our suspicions are correct . . .\u201d He trailed off, shaking his head. \u201cIt will be bad. Very bad.\u201d</p> <p>Pynch didn\u2019t answer, and they rode the remainder of the way in silence. Jasper did not relish this task, but it must be done. If Horn was the traitor, he must be brought to some kind of justice.</p><p>A half hour later, Jasper pulled his horse to a halt in front of Matthew Horn\u2019s town house. He looked at the old bricks and thought of the family that had lived here for generations. Horn\u2019s mother was an invalid, confined to this house now. God, this was a nasty business. Jasper sighed and dismounted his horse, then climbed the steps grimly. He knocked at the door and waited, conscious that Pynch stood on a step just below him.</p><p>There was a long pause. The house was still, no sound coming from within. Jasper took a step back, glancing up at the windows above. Nothing stirred. He frowned and knocked again, more forcefully this time. Where were the servants? Had Horn told them not to let him in?</p><p>He was raising his hand to pound once more when the door creaked open. A harried-looking young footman looked out.</p><p>\u201cIs your master at home?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe so, sir.\u201d</p><p>Jasper cocked his head. \u201cThen will you let us in so I may see him?\u201d</p><p>The footman flushed. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d He held the door wide. \u201cIf you\u2019ll wait in the library, sir, I\u2019ll fetch Mr. Horn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jasper entered the room with Pynch and looked about.</p><p>Everything was the same as the last time he\u2019d visited Matthew. A clock ticked on the mantelpiece, and from the street came the muted sounds of carriages. Jasper strolled to the map that was missing Italy to examine it while they waited. The map hung beside two large wing chairs and a table in a corner. As he neared, he heard a sort of whimper. Pynch started toward him even as Jasper leaned over a chair to look in the corner.</p><p>Two people were on the floor behind the chairs, a woman cradling a man in her lap. She rocked back and forth steadily, a whispered whimper coming from her lips. The man\u2019s coat was fouled with blood, and a dagger still protruded from his chest. He was quite obviously dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened here?\u201d Jasper asked.</p><p>The woman raised her eyes. She was pretty, her eyes a lovely blue, but her face was bone-white, her lips colorless.</p><p>\u201cHe said we would have a fortune,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough money to go to the country and open a tavern of our own. He said that he\u2019d marry me and we would be rich.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her eyes again, quietly rocking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the butler, my lord,\u201d Pynch said from behind him. \u201cMr. Horn\u2019s butler\u2014the one I talked to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPynch, go get help,\u201d Jasper ordered. \u201cAnd see that Horn is all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d The woman laughed as Pynch ran from the room. \u201cHe was the one who did this. Stabbed my man and shoved him back here like so much rubbish.\u201d</p><p>Jasper stared blankly at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy man found a letter,\u201d the woman whispered. \u201cA letter to a French gentleman. My man said Mr. Horn sold secrets to the French during the war in the Colonies. He said we would make a fortune selling the letter back to the master. And then we could open a tavern in the country.\u201d</p><p>Jasper squatted by her. \u201cHe tried to blackmail Horn?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019d be rich, he said. I hid behind the curtain when he asked to talk to Mr. Horn. To tell him about the letter. But Mr. Horn . . .\u201d</p><p>Her words trailed into a low keening.</p><p>\u201cMatthew did this?\u201d Jasper finally grasped the full horror. The butler\u2019s head lolled on his bloody chest.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Pynch said from behind him.</p><p>Jasper looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other servants say Mr. Horn is nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went looking for the letter,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>Jasper frowned at her. \u201cI thought your man, the butler, had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay.\u201d The woman shook her head. \u201cHe was too smart to have it on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master won\u2019t find it,\u201d the woman said dreamily. \u201cI hid it well. I sent it to my sister in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cWhere is your sister? She might be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t look there,\u201d the woman whispered. \u201cMy man never spoke her name. He only said who had told him to look through the papers in Mr. Horn\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jasper whispered in dawning horror.</p><p>The woman looked up and smiled sweetly. \u201cMr. Pynch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, Mr. Horn knows I am your valet.\u201d Pynch was white as a sheet. \u201cIf he knows that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jasper was already scrambling to his feet, racing desperately for the door, but he still heard the rest of Pynch\u2019s sentence.</p><p>\u201c\u2014then he will think that you have the letter.\u201d</p><p>The letter. The letter he didn\u2019t have. The letter Matthew would naturally think was in his house. His house where his darling wife had no doubt returned by this time. Alone and unprotected and thinking Matthew was his friend.</p><p>Dear God in heaven. Melisande.</p><p>\u201cMY MOTHER IS an invalid,\u201d Matthew Horn said to Melisande, and she nodded because she didn\u2019t know what else to do. \u201cShe cannot be moved at all, let alone flee to France.\u201d</p><p>Melisande swallowed and said carefully, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>But that was the wrong thing to say. Mr. Horn jerked the pistol he held against her side and Melisande flinched. She really couldn\u2019t help it. She\u2019d never liked guns\u2014hated the loud explosion when they fired\u2014and her flesh cringed at the thought of a ball tearing through her. It would hurt. A lot. She was a coward, she knew, but she simply couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She was terrified.</p><p>Mr. Horn had been a little strange when he\u2019d come to the door. He\u2019d seemed agitated. When he\u2019d been shown into her sitting room, she\u2019d wondered whether he might\u2019ve been drinking, even though it was still not noon.</p><p>Then he\u2019d demanded to see Vale, and when she\u2019d told him that her husband was not at home, he\u2019d insisted on her showing him Vale\u2019s study. She hadn\u2019t liked that, but by then she\u2019d begun to suspect something was wrong. When he\u2019d rummaged in Jasper\u2019s desk, she\u2019d started for the door intending to summon Oaks and have Mr. Horn forcibly rem\u00a3rn eguoved. Which was when the man had pulled the pistol from his pocket. It was only then, while staring at the big pistol in his hand, that she\u2019d seen the dark stain on his sleeve. As he moved more papers with that hand, she noticed that his sleeve left a dark red smear behind.</p><p>It was as if he\u2019d dipped his coat sleeve in blood.</p><p>Melisande shuddered and tried to calm her wild thoughts. She didn\u2019t know if the stain was blood, so it was no use becoming hysterical over what might be a misunderstanding on her part. Soon Vale would be home, and he would take care of things. Except he didn\u2019t know Mr. Horn had a pistol. He might come in the door and be taken completely unawares. Mr. Horn\u2019s mania seemed focused on Jasper. What if he intended to hurt him?</p><p>Melisande took a breath. \u201cWhat is it you look for?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Horn knocked all the papers from the desk. They fell in a scattered heap, some of the smaller papers fluttering like landing birds. \u201cA letter. My letter. Vale stole it from me. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed closer to her, the gun between them, and caught her face in his left hand, squeezing painfully. His eyes sparkled with tears. \u201cHe\u2019s a thief and a blackmailer. I thought he was my friend. I thought . . .\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut and then opened them to glare at her and say fiercely, \u201cI\u2019ll not be ruined by him, do you hear? Tell me where the paper is, where he might\u2019ve hid it, or I\u2019ll feel no sorrow in killing you.\u201d</p><p>Melisande trembled. He was going to kill her. She had no illusions that she would live through this. But if Jasper came home now, he might be killed as well. That realization marshaled her thoughts. The farther Mr. Horn was from the front door, the more time Vale would have to realize the danger when he returned home.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cHis bedroom. I . . . I think in his bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Mr. Horn grasped her by the back of the neck and shoved her into the hall ahead of him. The pistol was still pressed to her side. The hall seemed deserted, and Melisande gave a prayer of thanks. She didn\u2019t know how Mr. Horn would react to a servant. He might very well shoot anyone he saw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They climbed the steps in tandem, his hand pinching the back of her neck painfully. At the top of the stairs, Melisande turned and her heart nearly stopped. Suchlike was just coming out of her room.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Suchlike said in a confused voice. She looked from Melisande to Mr. Horn.</p><p>Melisande spoke rapidly before her captor could speak. \u201cWhat are you doing here, girl? I told you to have my riding habit sponged and pressed by noon.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike\u2019s eyes widened. Melisande had never spoken to her so harshly before. And then things got worse. Behind the maid, Mouse poked his nose out of the room and scrambled into the hall. He raced toward Melisande and Mr. Horn, barking madly.</p> <p>Melisande felt Mr. Horn move as if to pull the pistol from her side. Mouse was at her feet now, and she acted quickly, kicking poor Mouse away. The dog yelped in pain and confusion and sprawled onto his back.</p><p>Melisande looked at Suchlike. \u201cTake this dog with you to the kitchens. Do it now. And make sure you ready my riding habit, or I\u2019ll dismiss you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Suchlike had never liked Mouse, but she scrambled forward and hastily scooped the terrier into her arms. She ran past Melisande and Mr. Horn, her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Melisande exhaled when the maid was out of sight.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Mr. Horn said. \u201cNow where is Vale\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p> <p>Melisande pointed to the room, and Mr. Horn dragged her toward it. She had another leap of fear as he opened the door. What if Mr. Pynch was inside? She had no idea where the manservant was.</p><p>But the room was empty.</p><p>Mr. Horn hauled her toward the dresser and began throwing Vale\u2019s neatly folded neck cloths to the ground.</p><p>\u201cHe was there when they tortured me. They tied him to a stake and held his head so he had to watch. I almost felt more sorry for him than for me.\u201d He stopped suddenly and inhaled. \u201cI can still see those blue eyes of his filling with grief while they burned my chest. He knows what it was like. He knows what they did to me. He knows it took the British army two hellish weeks to deign to ransom us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blame Jasper for your wounds,\u201d Melisande whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a witless fool,\u201d he snapped. \u201cVale could no more help what was done to him than we could help what was done to us. What I blame him for is his betrayal. He of all people should understand why I did what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Having emptied the chest of drawers, he dragged her to the wardrobe. \u201cHe knows what it was like. He was there. How dare he judge me? How dare he?\u201d</p><p>Melisande saw that his eyes were ice-cold and determined, and the sight froze her with terror. Mr. Horn was cornered, and it was only a matter of time until he found that she\u2019d lied.</p><p>BY THE TIME Jasper made it home, his heart was nearly pounding through his chest with fear. He flung his horse\u2019s reins to a boy and leapt the steps without waiting for Pynch. He threw open his front doors and went in, only to skid to a stop.</p><p>Melisande\u2019s maid was clutching Mouse and weeping in the hall. Surrounding her were Oaks and two footmen.</p><p>Oaks turned at Jasper\u2019s entrance, his face drawn and lined. \u201cMy lord! We think Lady Vale is in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Jasper demanded.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d the maid gasped. Mouse wriggled hard in her arms, trying to get down. \u201cThere\u2019s a man with her, and oh, my lord, I think he has a gun.\u201d</p><p>Jasper\u2019s blood froze in his veins, painful ice crystallizing. No. Christ, no.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you see them, Sally?\u201d Pynch said from beside Jasper.</p><p>\u201cAt the top of the stairs,\u201d Suchlike said. \u201cOutside your rooms, my lord\u00a3 rode .\u201d</p><p>Mouse finally gave such a desperate lurch that she gasped and dropped him to the floor. The dog ran to Jasper and barked once before scampering toward the stairs. He jumped to the first step and barked again.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Jasper said to the servants. \u201cIf he sees too many . . .\u201d He trailed off, not wanting to say aloud the awful possibility.</p><p>He started for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Pynch called.</p><p>Jasper looked over his shoulder.</p><p>The valet was proffering two pistols. Pynch met his eyes. He knew damn well how Jasper felt about guns. Still, he held them out. \u201cDon\u2019t go up unarmed.\u201d</p><p>Jasper snatched the weapons without a word and whirled to the stairs. Mouse barked and ran up the stairs ahead of him, panting with excitement. They made the first landing and continued to the second story, where the master bedrooms were. Jasper paused on the top step to listen. Mouse stood by his ankle, patiently watching him. Jasper could hear the maid, still sobbing faintly down below, and the murmur of a deeper voice, probably Pynch comforting her. Other than that, all was silent. He refused to think what the silence might mean.</p><p>He crept to his door on the balls of his feet, Mouse silently trailing him. The door was partly open, and he crouched so as to make himself less of a target as he pushed it open.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Jasper took a breath and looked at the dog. Mouse was watching him, completely uninterested in what might be in the room. Jasper swore under his breath and entered the room. Matthew had obviously been here. Jasper\u2019s clothes were on the floor, his linens ripped from the bed he never used. He crossed and looked in the small dressing room, but although it had been torn apart, no one was there now. When he came back into his bedroom, Mouse was sniffing at one of the pillows on the floor. Jasper looked and nearly fell to his knees.</p><p>The pillow had a small streak of blood.</p><p>He closed his eyes. No. No, she wasn\u2019t hurt; she wasn\u2019t dead. He couldn\u2019t believe otherwise\u2014and remain sane. He opened his eyes and lifted the pistols to the ready. Then he went through the rest of the rooms on that floor. After fifteen minutes, he was panting and desperate. Mouse had followed him to each room, sniffing under the beds and in the corners, but he\u2019d not seemed that interested in any of them.</p><p>Jasper mounted the stairs to the next floor, where the servants\u2019 bedrooms were, under the eaves. There was no reason for Matthew to have taken Melisande up here. Perhaps he\u2019d gone down the back way and escaped past the footmen in the kitchen. But if so, someone should\u2019ve heard him. There should\u2019ve been an outcry. Dammit! Where was Horn? Where had he taken Melisande?</p><p>They\u2019d just made the uppermost floor when Mouse suddenly stiffened and barked. He raced to the end of the narrow, uncarpeted hallway and scratched at a door. Jasper followed the dog and carefully opened the door. A flight of wooden stairs led to the roof. There was a narrow parapet up there, but it was mostly ornamental, and Jasper had never been up there himself.</p><p>Mouse shouldered past him and raced up the steep stairs, his little muscled body jumping from step to step. He reached the top and stuck his nose to the crack of a small half-door, whining.</p><p>Jasper gripped his pistols and mounted the stairs quietly. At the top, he nudged aside the little dog with his boot and stared down at him sternly.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Mouse laid back his ears in submission but didn\u2019t sit.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Jasper commanded. \u201cOr so help me, I\u2019ll lock you in one of the rooms.\u201d</p><p>The dog had no way of understanding the words, but he certainly understood the tone. He tucked his rump down and sat. Jasper turned to the door. He opened it and slipped out.</p><p>The skies had fulfilled the promise of rain. It dripped down, cold, gray, and dispirited on his roof. The door was only meant to provide access to the roof for repairs and cleaning. In front of it was a small square of level tiles, barely wide enough for a man to stand on, while all around was the slope of the roof. Jasper slowly straightened, feeling the wind blow raindrops against his neck. He faced the back garden. To his left was empty roof, to his right more empty roof. Jasper peered over the spine of the rooftop.</p><p>Dear God. Matthew held Melisande bent over the low stone parapet in front of the house. The parapet barely came to knee height and would in no way prevent her from falling. Only Matthew\u2019s arm kept her from smashing her brains against the cobblestones far below. Jasper remembered her fear of heights and knew his darling wife must be completely terrified.</p><p>\u201cNo farther!\u201d Matthew cried. He wore neither hat nor wig, and the rain had darkened and flattened his short reddish-blond hair to his skull. His blue eyes glittered with desperation. \u201cNo farther or I drop her over the edge!\u201d</p><p>Jasper met Melisande\u2019s beautiful brown eyes. Her hair had come partially down, and long wet strands clung to her cheeks. Her hands clutched at Matthew\u2019s arm, for she had no other purchase. She looked back at him and a horrible thing happened.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>Sweet, brave girl. Jasper averted his eyes and stared at Matthew. He raised the pistol in his right hand and held it steady. \u201cDrop her and I\u2019ll blow your goddamned head off.\u201d</p><p>Matthew chuckled softly, and Melisande wobbled in his grasp. \u201cBack away, Vale. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Matthew stared back stonily. \u201cYou\u2019ve destroyed me. I have no life left, no future, no hope. I cannot flee to France without my mother, and if I stay, they\u2019ll hang me for selling secrets to the French. My mother will be disgraced; the crown will take all my assets and throw her into the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this suicide, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Melisande go,\u201d Jasper said evenly. \u201cShe had nothing to do with what\u2019s happened. I\u2019ll put down my pistol if you let her \u00a3if =\"0go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Melisande cried, but neither man paid her any heed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost my life,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I destroy your life as you\u2019ve destroyed mine?\u201d</p><p>He twisted a bit, and Jasper threw himself at the ridge of the roof. \u201cDon\u2019t! I\u2019ll give you the letter.\u201d</p><p>Matthew hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ve looked. You don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in my house. I have it hidden elsewhere.\u201d All lies, of course, but Jasper put all the sincerity at his command into his voice. If he could just buy some time and get Melisande off the parapet.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Matthew looked warily hopeful.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jasper had slowly straddled the roof, and now he brought his other leg over as well, crouching at the top. Melisande and Matthew were only ten feet or so away. \u201cBack away from the edge and I\u2019ll bring it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We stay here until you bring the letter.\u201d</p><p>Matthew sounded reasonable, but he\u2019d already killed one person today. Jasper couldn\u2019t leave him alone with Melisande.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the letter,\u201d Jasper bargained. He inched forward again. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the letter and forget the whole thing. Just let me have my wife first. She means more to me than any revenge for Spinner\u2019s Falls.\u201d</p><p>Matthew started shaking, and Jasper rose in fear. Was the man having some kind of fit?</p><p>But dry laughter spilled from Matthew\u2019s throat. \u201cSpinner\u2019s Falls? Oh, God, do you think me the Spinner\u2019s Falls traitor? All this and you don\u2019t even know, do you? I never betrayed us at Spinner\u2019s Falls. It was afterward\u2014after the British army left us to be tortured for two damned weeks\u2014that I sold secrets to the French. Why shouldn\u2019t I? I had my loyalty carved out of my chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you shot Hasselthorpe, you must have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot I, Vale. Someone else shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I know? Hasselthorpe obviously knows something about Spinner\u2019s Falls that someone doesn\u2019t want him to tell.\u201d</p><p>Jasper blinked raindrops from his eyes. \u201cThen you had nothing to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Vale,\u201d Matthew whispered, despair in his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve destroyed my life. I believed that you were the only one who understood me. Why have you betrayed me? Why?\u201d</p><p>And Jasper watched with horror as Matthew raised his pistol and aimed it at Melisande\u2019s head. He was too far away. He\u2019d never get to her in time. Christ. He had no choice. Jasper fired his own pistol and shot Matthew\u2019s hand. He saw Melisande flinch as blood splattered her hair. Saw Matthew drop the pistol with a shout of pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saw Matthew shove Melisande over the edge of the parapet.</p><p>Jasper fired the second pistol, and Matthew\u2019s head jerked violently\u00a3erkf t back. Then Jasper was scrambling on the slippery tiles, a scream filling his head. He shoved Matthew\u2019s corpse to the side and looked over the parapet, expecting to see Melisande\u2019s body broken below. Instead, he saw her face, three feet down, looking back up at him.</p><p>He gasped and the screaming stopped. Only then did he realize that the sound had been real and that he\u2019d been the one making it. He stretched his hand down. She was grasping an ornamental ridge of stone.</p><p>\u201cTake my hand,\u201d he rasped, his throat raw.</p> <p>She blinked, looking dazed. He remembered that day, so long ago, in front of Lady Eddings\u2019s town house just before they were married. She\u2019d refused his hand to help her down from his carriage.</p><p>He leaned farther out. \u201cMelisande. Trust me. Take my hand now.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, her precious lips parting, and let go of the ledge with one hand. He lunged and grasped her wrist. Then he leaned backward and used his weight to haul her up and to safety.</p><p>She came over the parapet and fell limply into his arms. He wrapped his body about hers and held her. Simply held her, inhaling the scent of oranges in her hair, feeling her breath on his cheek. It was a while before he realized that he was shaking.</p><p>Finally, she stirred. \u201cI thought you hated guns.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled back and looked at her face. She had a bruise on one cheek, and there was gore splattered in her hair, but she was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He had to clear his throat before he spoke. \u201cI do hate guns. I loathe them desperately.\u201d</p><p>Her lovely brows knit. \u201cThen how . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that? I would crawl through the flames of hell on my knees for you. Firing a goddamn gun is nothing compared to you, my dearest wife.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her face, watching her eyes widen, and he bent to kiss her, repeating as he did, \u201cI love you, Melisande.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p> <p>So the little kitchen boy was brought trembling before the king. It wasn\u2019t long before he confessed. Three times, Jack, the princess\u2019s fool, had paid him to have a turn at stirring the pot of soup\u2014the last time this very night. Well! The courtiers gasped, Princess Surcease looked thoughtful, and the king roared with rage. The guards dragged Jack to kneel before the king, and one placed a sword against the fool\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d cried the king. \u201cSpeak and tell us from whom you stole the rings!\u201d For naturally no one believed the short, twisted fool could\u2019ve won the rings himself. \u201cSpeak! Or I will have your head cut from your body!\u201d . . .</p><p>\u2014from LAUGHING JACK</p><p>One month later . . .</p><p>Sally Suchlike hesitated outside her mistress\u2019s bedroom. It was late morning, but still one never knew, and she\u2019d hate to go in if her mistress was not alone. She twisted her hands and stared at the little statue of the nasty goat man and the naked lady while she tried to decide, but of course the statue made her mind drift. The goat man did look so like Mr. Pynch and she wondered, as always, if his rather gigantic\u2014</p><p>A man cleared his throat directly behind her.</p><p>Sally shrieked and whirled around. Mr. Pynch was standing so close she could feel the heat of his chest.</p><p>The valet raised one eyebrow slowly, which made him look more like the goat man than ever. \u201cWhat are you doing, loitering in the hallway, Miss Suchlike?\u201d</p> <p>She tossed her head. \u201cI was thinking on whether I should go into the mistress\u2019s room or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She pretended shock. \u201cShe might not be alone, that\u2019s why not.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch lifted his upper lip in a faint sneer. \u201cI find that hard to believe. Lord Vale always sleeps alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Sally put her hands on her hips, feeling excitement heat her lower belly. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just go and see if your master is in his bed alone, because I wager he\u2019s not in his room at all.\u201d</p><p>The valet didn\u2019t deign to reply. He just gave her a glance that swept her from head to toe and entered Lord Vale\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Sally blew out a breath and fanned her cheeks, trying to cool down as she waited.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have long. Mr. Pynch reemerged from the master\u2019s bedroom and closed the door quietly behind him. He stalked to where she stood and loomed over her until Sally backed against the wall.</p><p>Then Mr. Pynch lowered his head to breathe into her ear, \u201cThe room is empty. Do you accept the usual forfeit?\u201d</p><p>Sally gulped, because her stays seemed a mite too tight. \u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch swooped down and captured her lips with his own.</p><p>The silence in the hallway was broken only by Mr. Pynch\u2019s deepened breathing and Sally\u2019s sigh.</p><p>Then Mr. Pynch lifted his head. \u201cWhy do you find that statue so fascinating? Every time I catch you in the hall, you\u2019re staring at it.\u201d</p><p>Sally blushed because Mr. Pynch was nibbling along her neck. \u201cI think it looks like you. The little goat man.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch raised his head and glanced over his shoulder. Then he looked back at Sally, one brow raised regally. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Sally said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been wondering . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He nibbled at her shoulder, which made it rather hard to concentrate.</p><p>Sally tried valiantly anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering if you\u2019re like the little goat man all over.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pynch stilled against her shoulder, and for a moment, Sally thought that perhaps she\u2019d been too impertinent.</p><p>Then he raised his head, and she saw the gleam in his eye. \u201cWhy, Miss Suchlike, I\u2019d be happy to help answer your questions, but I think there is one thing we must do first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>His face lost all trace of teasing. He suddenly became quite serious, his blue eyes gazing down at her almost hesitantly.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI believe you must marry me, Miss Suchlike, in order for us to continue this discussion.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back a little and stared up at him, completely at a loss for words.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you were too old for me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that I was too young to know my own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that I ought to be looking at other men. Men more my own age, like that footman Sprat.\u201d</p><p>His scowl became thunderous. \u201cI don\u2019t remember telling you to look at young Sprat. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>It had nearly broken her heart when he\u2019d said those words, for she didn\u2019t want to look at any other man but him. The only thing that had saved her, in fact, was that he\u2019d kept creeping up behind her in the mornings and losing his silly wager. Mr. Pynch didn\u2019t seem able to stop himself from their flirtation, and she certainly couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he growled now.</p><p>She beamed up at him.</p><p>He stared at her a moment and then shook his head as if to clear it. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell what?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWill you marry me, Sally Suchlike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sally carefully smoothed her skirt, because of course she wanted to marry Mr. Pynch. But she was a levelheaded girl, and she needed to make absolutely sure. Marriage, after all, was a very big step. \u201cWhy do you want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>His expression was enough to send most girls into flight, but Sally had been studying Mr. Pynch and his expressions for some time now, and she knew she was quite safe with him. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019ve kissed you every day in this hallway for the past fortnight or more. And even though you are too young and much too pretty for me, and you\u2019ll no doubt regret sooner or later being tied to an ugly bastard like me, I still want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, and if Mr. Pynch had had hair, he might\u2019ve pulled it out in frustration. \u201cBecause I love you, you silly lass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Sally purred, and wrapped her arms about his thick neck. \u201cThen I\u2019ll marry you. But you\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>At that point, Sally was interrupted by the valet kissing her quite firmly and enthusiastically, so it was some time before he raised his head and said, \u201cHow am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>Sally laughed up into Mr. Pynch\u2019s lovely, scowling face. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong that I\u2019ll regret marrying you. I\u2019ll never regret marrying you, because I love you as well.\u201d</p><p>Which only earned her another enthusiastic kiss.</p><p>MELISANDE STRETCHED LUXURIOUSLY and rolled against her husband. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIndeed it is,\u201d he said. His voice was lazy, with just a hint of exhaustion.</p><p>She hid a smile against his shoulder. He\u2019d nearly worn himself out, making slow love to her. He did seem to like waking her in the mornings.</p><p>A scratch and a whine came from her dressing room.</p><p>Melisande poked Vale in the ribs. \u201cYou need to let him out now.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMust I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll only scratch more, and then he\u2019ll start barking, and Sprat will come to the door and ask if he should take Mouse out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, such a large ruckus for such a small dog,\u201d Vale muttered, but he rose from their pallet and padded nude across the floor.</p><p>Melisande watched him under lowered eyelids. He really did have the most beautiful bottom. She smiled, wondering what he\u2019d think if she said so.</p><p>Jasper opened the door to the dressing room. Mouse trotted busily out with a bone in his mouth. He jumped on the pallet and turned about three times before settling and gnawing his prize. Their pallet had expanded in the last month with the addition of a thin mattress and lots of pillows. Melisande had had the bed removed from her room altogether, and now the pallet took up pride of place against the wall between the windows. At night, with only a candle for light, she imagined that she lay in some Ottoman palace.</p><p>\u201cThat dog ought to have his own bed,\u201d Vale muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe does have his own bed,\u201d Melisande pointed out. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t sleep in it.\u201d</p><p>Vale scowled down at the dog. Of course, he had been the one to give Mouse the bone, so no one in the room took the scowl very seriously.</p><p>\u201cBe glad he no longer sleeps under the covers,\u201d Melisande said.</p><p>\u201cI am glad. I hope never to find a cold nose against my arse again.\u201d He turned his scowl on her. \u201cAnd what are you smirking about, my lady wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, this is not a smirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d He began to prowl toward her, all lean muscle and intent, interested male. \u201cThen how would you characterize your expression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m admiring the view,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He made a detour to where he\u2019d carelessly flung his coat the night before. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like me to perform a gavotte?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, watching as he dug in the pocket of his coat. \u201cI might like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you, you insatiable baggage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d She stretched a bit on the pallet, letting her nipples pop from the coverlet. \u201cBut I can be satiated, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d he muttered. His eyes were on her nipples, and he seemed a bit distracted. \u201cI\u2019ve tried and tried and still you\u2019re eager. You wear a man out.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved at his plaintive tone, and she glanced significantly at his cock, standing proud and erect now. \u201cYou don\u2019t look worn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he said conversationally. \u201cYou look at me and I become embarrassingly attentive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held out her arms. \u201cCome here, you silly man.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and knelt by her side.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you there?\u201d she asked, because he held one hand behind his back.</p><p>His grin faded as he lay down beside her, propping himself on his elbow. \u201cI\u2019ve something for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her brows knit. He hadn\u2019t given her anything since the garnet earrings.</p><p>He took his hand out from behind his back and turned it over. In his palm lay a small tin snuffbox. It looked a little like the snuffbox she kept her treasures in, except this box was obviously new.</p><p>She raised her brows in question and looked from his palm to his face.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>She took it from his palm and was surprised at how heavy the little box was. She glanced again at his face. He was watching her with bright turquoise eyes.</p> <p>She opened the box.</p><p>And gasped. The outside of the snuffbox might be plain tin, not ornamented at all, but the inside was glowing gold, set with precious gems. Pearls and rubies, diamonds and emeralds, sapphires and amethysts, jewels she didn\u2019t even know the names of. They all sparkled from inside the box, nearly covering the yellow gold with a rainbow of color.</p><p>She looked up at Jasper, tears in her eyes. \u201cWhy? What does it mean?\u201d</p><p>He took the hand holding the box and turned it over, brushing his lips against her knuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the gorgeous, sparkling box. \u201c\u00abpargaiWhat?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, his head still bent. \u201cWhen I first met you, I was a fool. And I was a fool for years before that. I saw only the tin you hid behind. I was too vain, too asinine, too foolish to look beyond and see your beauty, my sweet wife.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his beautiful turquoise eyes, and she saw that they were adoring. \u201cI want you to understand that I see you now. I\u2019ve basked in the wonder of your beauty, and I\u2019m never letting you go. I love you with all my battered soul.\u201d</p><p>Melisande looked one last time at the treasure box. It was exquisitely lovely. This was how Jasper saw her, and it rather awed her. She closed the lid carefully and set the box aside, knowing it was the most precious, the most perfect gift he could ever give her.</p><p>Then she pulled her husband down into her arms and said the only thing she could. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>And she kissed him.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The sword pressed very tightly against Jack\u2019s throat, but still he spoke up bravely.</p><p>\u201cI would tell you who won the rings, my liege,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, alas, you would not believe me in any case.\u201d</p><p>The king bellowed, but Jack raised his voice to be heard over the royal rage. \u201cBesides, it does not matter who won the rings. What matters is who holds them now.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, the king was silent and every eye in the royal banquet hall turned to Princess Surcease. She seemed as surprised as any when she reached into the little jeweled bag that hung from her kirtle and drew out the bronze ring and the silver ring. She placed them with the gold ring already on her palm, and then all three lay together.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Surcease has the rings,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd it seems to me that gives her the right to pick her own husband.\u201d</p><p>Well, the king hemmed and the king hawed, but in the end he had to admit that Jack did have a point.</p><p>\u201cWho will you choose to wed, my daughter?\u201d the king asked. \u201cThere are men here from all corners of the world. Rich men, brave men, men so handsome the ladies swoon when they ride by. Now tell me, which of them will be your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Princess Surcease smiled, helped Jack to stand on his stumpy legs, and said, \u201cI will wed Jack the Fool and no other, for he may be a fool, but he makes me laugh and I love him.\u201d</p><p>And then before the stunned eyes of the entire court and her royal father, she bent and kissed Jack the Fool, right on his long, curved nose.</p><p>What a strange thing happened then! For Jack began to grow, his legs and arms lengthened and thickened, and his nose and chin receded into their normal proportions. When it was all over, Jack was himself again, tall and strong, and since he wore the wonderful suit of night and wind and carried the sharpest blade in all the world, well, you can imagine, he was a very fine sight indeed.</p><p>But poor Princess Surcease did not like this handsome stranger who stood so tall before her. She wept and cried, \u201cOh, where is my Jack? Oh, where is my sweet fool?\u201d</p><p>Jack knelt before the princess and took her little hands between his big ones. He leaned his head close to hers and whispered so only she could hear, \u201cI am your sweet fool, my beautiful princess. I am the man who danced and sang to make you laugh. I love you, and I would gladly take on that twisted, horrible form again, if only to see you smile.\u201d</p><p>And at these words, the princess did smile and she kissed him. For although Jack\u2019s form had changed so much she no longer recognized him, his voice had not. It was the voice of Jack the Fool, the man she loved.</p><p>The man she\u2019d chosen to marry. </p> </body></html>"]
