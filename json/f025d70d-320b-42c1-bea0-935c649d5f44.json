He\u2019d amassed a fortune and countless connections during his lifetime, most of which were steeped in murky shades of gray. The men directly employed by Lattimer were absolute in their loyalty\u2014he would tolerate no less\u2014but he never allowed himself to fully trust anyone.</p><p>Some jobs ... Some jobs demanded personal satisfaction. This one was a matter of honor. Others might argue that Marcus had none. By their definition, they\u2019d be right. But he was bound by a fierce loyal code. His honor was what mattered.</p><p>Allen Cross was an arrogant, coattail-riding asshole. The world would be a better place without his kind of filth, and Marcus was determined that the task would be completed this day.</p> <p>Marcus attached the silencer and tucked the gun into the waist of his slacks. Drawing the Armani suit coat closed, he left the confines of his car and instructed his driver to wait. He walked at an unhurried pace toward the entrance of the high-rise that housed Cross Enterprises. Around him the city lights twinkled in the darkening of dusk, and headlights from passing cars bounced along the alleyways.</p><p>The streets were mostly empty and the building barren of the weekday horde of employees who scurried in and out with regularity. He paused a short distance from the entrance and checked his watch. The security guard that manned the front entrance on the weekends was a family guy and, like most family guys, had a moderate amount of debt and stretched his budget from payday to payday.</p><p>After tonight, the guard wouldn\u2019t have the financial worries of others in his class. Marcus had seen to that. Right now, the guard would take a strategic break from his post, and at the same moment, the surveillance cameras would go down.</p><p>Money bought many things. Loyalty. Disloyalty. A blind eye. A moment\u2019s distraction. Fifteen minutes was all Marcus needed to rid the world of Allen Cross.</p><p>Cross was a creature of habit. He came into his offices every Saturday after seven and remained until nine P.M., when his car service collected him and drove him to the same restaurant ten blocks away. He liked the few hours of solitude to go over paperwork\u2014but what he perhaps liked the most was the freedom to victimize a helpless woman with impunity.</p> <p>Marcus\u2019s jaw tightened in fury. Predictability killed a man. As Cross was about to find out.</p><p>Marcus rode the elevator to the twenty-first floor and stepped onto the cheap, fake Italian marble flooring, his shoes issuing a faint echo as he walked through the empty reception area.</p><p>The door to Cross\u2019s office was ajar, and a faint light shone through the crack. Marcus pushed at the door and let it slide soundlessly open. Cross was behind his desk, kicked back in his chair, a glass of wine in one hand as he read a sheaf of papers with the other.</p><p>Marcus watched, content to wait for his prey to become aware he was hunted.</p><p>After a moment, Cross set his glass down and leaned forward. He halted in mid-motion, and his head snapped up, his gaze locked on Marcus. Cross\u2019s eyes widened in alarm and then he recovered, a sneer rolling over his lips.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and what the hell are you doing in my office?\u201d</p> <p>Marcus strolled forward, his expression purposely bland as he loosened his coat. Cross rose, his hand inching toward the intercom on his desk.</p><p>\u201cGet out or I\u2019ll summon security.\u201d</p><p>Marcus smiled. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find him unavailable.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of unease skittered across Cross\u2019s face when Marcus continued to smile. Marcus pulled out the gun, enjoying the slide of the stock over his palm. He thumbed the safety, and leveled the barrel at Cross\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer to die sitting or standing?\u201d</p><p>Cross blanched, and he staggered, his hands slapping the polished mahogany of his executive desk. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cMoney? I have money. Just tell me how much. Anything. I\u2019ll give you anything.\u201d</p><p>A sneer twisted Marcus\u2019s lips. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t afford my shoes.\u201d</p><p>His finger tightened on the trigger, and he watched the awareness in Cross\u2019s eyes, the panicked realization that he was going to die.</p> <p>Cross lunged sideways, and the sound of the bullet smacking into his chest resonated through the spacious office. Cross hit the floor, his arm outstretched in desperation. Blood seeped through the white silk shirt, growing as he gasped for breath.</p><p>As much as Marcus wanted to watch the life slowly fade from the bastard\u2019s eyes, he had to finish this now. He raised the gun and aimed between Cross\u2019s eyes. He saw the finality, the gray acceptance of death in his victim\u2019s gaze. He pulled the trigger and then turned away, satisfied that justice had been served.</p><p>THE cab pulled to an abrupt halt outside the building where Sarah Daniels had worked for a period of six months. She hadn\u2019t been back in a year. The mere thought of walking into Cross Enterprises made her physically ill.</p><p>She flung a twenty at the cabbie and ignored his offer to give her change. Clumsily opening the door, she bolted from the cab and entered the high-rise at a dead run.</p><p>The lobby was empty. Not even the security guard was at his post. Was she too late? What would she have even said to the man? That her brother was here to kill Stanley Cross?</p><p>She bolted toward the elevator and pounded on the up button, praying it would be here. She heaved a sigh of relief and threw herself through the doors as they slid open.</p><p>She jammed her thumb on the button for the twenty-first floor and then hit the close door button repeatedly.</p><p>Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.</p><p>She had to be on time. She wouldn\u2019t let Marcus go through with it.</p><p>Stupid. So stupid.</p><p>She should have known. She\u2019d seen the rage in Marcus\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d been way too quiet. Too collected as he\u2019d calmly told her that he was taking her away. She hadn\u2019t argued. She\u2019d allowed him to make all the plans. All the decisions. She hadn\u2019t even known where they were going, only that Marcus\u2019s private jet was fueled and waiting for them.</p><p>Finally the elevator doors slid open, and she rushed into the reception area and turned in the direction of Allen\u2019s office. She saw Allen\u2019s door wide open, saw Marcus\u2019s profile and then watched as Marcus tucked the gun back into his waistband.</p><p>Her horrified gaze tracked downward to see Allen Cross lying on the floor, blood staining his pristine white shirt.</p><p>Her hand flew to her mouth and she backed hastily away.</p><p>Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.</p><p>She was too late. She hadn\u2019t gotten here in time.</p><p>Allen was dead. Marcus had killed him.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>Nausea welled in her throat. She nearly tripped on her feet as she steadily backpedaled. She had to get away. The police would be here soon. Wouldn\u2019t they? Surely someone couldn\u2019t just walk off the streets and kill someone in an office building.</p><p>She turned and ran back toward the elevator, praying it was still there. She knew that at least two were taken out of service on the weekends, but that left two working on this side of the building.</p><p>She jabbed at the down button with her thumb and held her breath, prepared to make a run for the stairs if she had to. The door slid open and she fell over herself getting in. She punched the button for the ground floor and turned just as the doors started to close, only to find herself staring at Marcus\u2019s frozen expression several feet away.</p><p>\u201cSarah\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doors closed, cutting him off. The elevator descended, sending Sarah\u2019s stomach into even more turmoil.</p><p>She simply couldn\u2019t process what she\u2019d just witnessed. Marcus had killed Allen Cross. She couldn\u2019t even muster any regret. Only fear. Fear for Marcus. How could he think he could get away with something so bold?</p><p>The elevator came to a stop and she shoved at the doors, trying to make them open quicker. She pitched headlong into the lobby, stumbling to gain her footing. Just as she righted herself, a hand curled around her arm and yanked her upright.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She gasped and stared into the eyes of evil.</p><p>Stanley Cross, Allen\u2019s brother, gripped her arm until she cried out in pain. His eyes sparked fury, but more than that, they warned her of just what kind of man he was. She knew all too well.</p><p>A sob welled in her throat as she faced down the man who was in her nightmares for the last year. She hadn\u2019t seen him since that night in Allen\u2019s office when he and Allen had forever changed the course of her life.</p><p>She hated them both more than she ever imagined being able to hate another human being.</p><p>Fear paralyzed her for what seemed an interminable amount of time. Her throat closed in and the ball in her stomach knotted painfully until it was all she could do not to vomit all over Stanley\u2019s shoes.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question,\u201d Stanley snapped. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, he\u2019d find Allen\u2019s body and think she murdered him. Or worse, he\u2019d see Marcus and then Marcus would go to jail. Stanley could place them both at the scene. Even if she wasn\u2019t herself accused of the crime, she could be forced to testify against Marcus.</p><p>Something snapped inside her. Rage mounted and swirled like a tornado. She thrust her knee into his groin, balled her fist and swung as hard as she could just as he howled in pain and doubled over.</p><p>Her fist met his jaw and he went sprawling.</p><p>As he started to scramble up, she ran for the entrance, burst into the night and bolted toward the street. She saw an off-duty cab rounding the corner and she ran in front of it, her arm held up to stop him. The cab screeched to a halt a mere inch from her knee. The driver threw his fist out the window, and obscenities blistered the air.</p><p>Ignoring his outrage, Sarah yanked open the back door and crawled in, slamming the door behind her. \u201cDrive!\u201d</p><p>The cabbie gave her a disgruntled look in the rearview mirror, then accelerated sharply, muttering about crazy women as he swerved through traffic. \u201cLady, I was not in service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while. Just drive!\u201d</p><p>He heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>She slammed her eyes shut for a moment as she sought to regain her bearings. Where could she go?</p><p>Think. God. What did one do in a situation like this?</p><p>She stared down at the purse slung over her neck. She had some cash, her passport, a credit card, her driver\u2019s license. She couldn\u2019t go back to her apartment, could she?</p><p>Stanley would have found his brother\u2019s body by now. He\u2019d probably already called the police.</p><p>Think, Sarah, think!</p><p>\u201cAirport,\u201d she managed to get out.</p><p>Her cell phone rang, startling her. She rummaged in her purse and turned it over to check the LCD. Marcus.</p><p>Tears burned her eyelids. Her brother. The one person in the world who loved her. He was all she had and now he\u2019d killed for her.</p><p>She opened the phone and put it to her ear.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d Marcus barked before she could even get a greeting out.</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d she croaked out in a cracked and scratchy voice.</p><p>\u201cSarah, honey, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t ... we can\u2019t ... I have to stay away. I need to go away.\u201d</p><p>She was babbling, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSarah, stop. Listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She cut him off, her voice firmer now. \u201cI have to go. Don\u2019t you see? They\u2019ll know. They\u2019ll know I saw you. They have surveillance in that building. All they have to do is play the security tape back and they\u2019ll know we were both there. You have to get out of here, Marcus. Go. I\u2019m going too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, goddamn it, listen to me!\u201d</p><p>She closed the phone and turned it off so he couldn\u2019t call back. She leaned her head back against the seat and closed her eyes.</p><p>She had no idea where she was going or what she\u2019d do when she got there, but she couldn\u2019t stay here. She could never come back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Marcus. It should have been me who killed him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>GARRETT Kelly came awake with a start, his muscles tense, sweat beading his brow. His breaths came in rapid, harsh huffs. For a moment he lay there, his unfocused gaze sliding across the window to the darkness beyond.</p><p>Explosions echoed in his ears. The staccato of gunfire made him flinch, and the smell of blood and burning flesh assaulted his nostrils, making them flare as his breaths tore from his lungs.</p><p>God.</p><p>He shook his head and raised his hand to scrub the sleep from his eyes. His shoulder protested, and he snarled with impatience at the ache, which still nagged. He rolled and sat up in bed, planting his feet on the floor. He stayed there, head hanging toward his knees, sucking in air like some pantywaist in basic training about to puke his guts up after a twomile run.</p><p>It pissed him off when past memories ambushed him. He\u2019d gone a long time without the images that interrupted his sleep. For some reason, after taking a bullet for his sister-in-law, he\u2019d had a harder time sleeping. His consciousness seemed more vulnerable to things he\u2019d shut out.</p><p>He cast a sideways glance at the clock. He wouldn\u2019t be going back to sleep and everyone would be up in an hour anyway. Maybe a run would clear his head and get his blood flowing again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a sigh, he hit the shower and turned it cold to shake the cobwebs and the lingering smell of blood. After he was dried off and dressed, he walked quietly down the hall and out the front door.</p><p>It was still dark when he started off down the winding road that paralleled the lake. He ran farther this morning, pushing himself beyond his normal routine. He could still hear the explosions and still hear his teammates. He closed his eyes and increased his pace until his lungs screamed and his side ached.</p><p>It was over. A lifetime ago. He needed to get over it. He had gotten over it. All this R and R was for the birds. It had only served to make him lazy and idle. Fuck it. He wanted back in. A mission. Something besides all this goddamn free time.</p><p>By the time he returned to the house, he was sucking serious wind. The sky had lightened to shades of lavender and a diamond-sized star hung stubbornly over the lake, blanketed in the soft hues of dawn. He stood on the dock staring over the water\u2014smooth, not a single ripple disturbing the surface\u2014and breathed the clean, unspoiled air.</p> <p>He let the peace of home and the lake he loved envelop him until all the noises of the past dulled and receded.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>SWEAT beaded Garrett\u2019s brow as he completed his last pull-up. He held himself, chin hovering above the bar, until his muscles rolled and contorted and his shoulder burned. His lips thinned and nostrils flared. When his arms began shaking, he dropped to the floor and palmed the scar on his shoulder.</p><p>Impatient with the twinge of discomfort that still plagued him, he dropped down and began a series of push-ups. He forced everything from his mind but the goal of complete recovery\u2014a process that had already taken too long for his liking.</p><p>After yesterday morning\u2019s run and a full day of PT, he\u2019d slept marginally better last night than he had the night before. But he still couldn\u2019t rid himself of the lingering images of his dreams. Dreams that hadn\u2019t haunted him in some time but now seemed determined to shove themselves back to the forefront of his consciousness.</p> <p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>Garrett extended his arms to hold his position and turned to see his brother Donovan standing in the doorway to the basement.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell are you interrupting my workout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResnick\u2019s paying us a visit. Should be here in the next few.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sighed and hopped to his feet. He rose and picked up the towel he\u2019d tossed on the couch and wiped the sweat from his face. \u201cWhat the hell does he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say. But you know he wouldn\u2019t come out here unless he wanted something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone use the goddamn phone anymore?\u201d</p><p>Donovan chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll be over in the war room. A word of warning. Sophie\u2019s on a tear in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Garrett groaned. His very pregnant sister-in-law had been nesting furiously in the last week. She\u2019d already cleaned the house top to bottom, and her next project was cooking enough food to outlast Armageddon.</p><p>Since marrying Sam, she\u2019d bullied everyone into family time. They were her family now\u2014as she liked to constantly remind them\u2014and they would eat as a family, which meant everyone at the table, all accounted for, on time. The only excuse for missing a meal was hospitalization.</p><p>Garrett and his brothers indulged her because family was the one thing she\u2019d always lacked. At first she\u2019d been overwhelmed and cautious with the very large Kelly family, but then she embraced them all and took to her new life like a duck to water.</p><p>As he climbed the stairs from the basement, he rolled his shoulder, testing the wound. It had been months since he left the hospital, and it still wasn\u2019t healed to his satisfaction. He had residual soreness when he worked out, but if he went more than a day without pushing the exercises, it got stiff.</p><p>He was still rotating his arm when he got into the living room. Sophie looked up from the stove and frowned. \u201cIs your shoulder still bothering you?\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for his answer, she hurried around the corner\u2014as fast as a woman in her condition could\u2014and stood in front of him. Her belly protruded, nearly bumping into his hip. She looked about thirteen months\u2019 pregnant\u2014not that he\u2019d tell her that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Soph,\u201d he said good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been working out again. Should you be pushing yourself so hard?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and dropped a kiss on her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s never going to get to one hundred percent unless I strengthen it.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes clouded and she briefly looked away. He sighed. She was the reason he\u2019d taken the bullet, and she was also the only one determined not to forget that fact. He tugged at her hair just to annoy her, and when she looked back at him, he scowled.</p><p>Her sadness lasted all of two seconds. Her shoulders started shaking and her lips split into a wide smile. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, putting her hands up as she backed away. \u201cI\u2019ll stop the guilt and the mother hen act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, save it for the kiddo.\u201d</p><p>She walked back into the kitchen and he followed, sniffing the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you cooking? It smells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the question is, what am I not cooking.\u201d She gestured at the table, which had food scattered over the entire surface. It looked like a mad chef had butchered a cow and an entire garden. \u201cI\u2019m making lasagna to freeze, chicken and dumplings, a few casseroles and a gumbo. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his stomach. \u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>She checked her watch. \u201cLunch will be on the table in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me wait an hour?\u201d he asked in horror.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cIf I let you eat then Donovan and Sam would want to eat and then there\u2019d be no one to have lunch with when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel, cruel woman,\u201d Garrett complained. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Sam puts up with you.\u201d</p><p>Her look said she wasn\u2019t impressed with his whining.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Sam, where is he?\u201d</p><p>Sophie peered over the pot and sniffed. \u201cHe went over to the office with Donovan. They had some calls to make. Sam said the contractors were supposed to break ground on the helipad at the compound today.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shook his head at her insistence on calling it the \u201coffice.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m headed over to the war room now. What are we having for lunch? Do I get to pick since I\u2019m injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh now you want to be all pitiful,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI suppose. What would you like?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll take chicken and dumplings. Good comfort food for someone in my condition.\u201d</p><p>He turned to go but swiped a bite of the chicken she\u2019d deboned and left in a flurry of threats to kick his ass.</p><p>Chuckling, he crossed the driveway to the building on the lot adjacent to the house. It had a stark look, completely in contrast to the homey log cabin that he and his brothers lived in, nestled on the banks of Kentucky Lake. It was square and imposing looking with grey cement-steel reinforced walls, no windows and a security system\u2014thanks to Donovan\u2019s technical expertise\u2014the CIA couldn\u2019t get into. Which was funny, considering the CIA would be arriving any moment now.</p><p>He punched in the access code and entered when the door slid open. Donovan was sitting in front of Hoss, the computer\u2014the love of his life\u2014and Sam was standing behind Donovan, reading off the screen.</p><p>He\u2019d actually miss this place when construction was complete on the KGI compound he and his brothers had designed. They all liked to give Sam shit about his paranoia, but the truth was Garrett thought it was a damn good idea. He wanted his family protected. Especially after all that had happened in the months before, when his mom had been abducted.</p><p>If moving KGI to a secure, state-of-the-art facility would ensure that all the Kellys would be better protected, then Garrett was ready to make the move yesterday. The problem was, such a massive undertaking was going to take time. It would be months before everything would be complete.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up Resnick\u2019s ass?\u201d he asked as he ambled over to his brothers.</p><p>Sam turned. \u201cDunno. He called, said he was about twenty minutes out. He sounded agitated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen doesn\u2019t he sound agitated? He\u2019s an uptight son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Donovan turned in his chair, looked at Sam and then both burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Garrett demanded.</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cHello, pot. Calling kettle uptight?\u201d</p><p>Garrett flipped up his middle finger as he turned away and plopped onto the couch. Whatever Resnick wanted, it couldn\u2019t be good. The last time they\u2019d seen him in person was when all the shit went down with Sophie. He\u2019d been quiet since. Just the way Garrett liked him. Trouble always followed in Resnick\u2019s wake.</p><p>Sam followed and slouched on the other end of the couch. \u201cMom is having a party for Rusty, and she\u2019s made it clear the entire family is to attend.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the party for? Her staying out of trouble for a month?\u201d</p><p>Donovan snorted and resumed typing on his keyboard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to celebrate the start of her senior year in school. And you have to hand it to the twerp, she\u2019s done well since Mom took her in hand and made her sit her ass in class.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grunted. Okay, yeah, the girl their mom had taken in\u2014another of the strays Marlene Kelly was so famous for\u2014had shaped up despite having a piss-poor attitude and a mouth to match. But Garrett wasn\u2019t into being all congratulatory for doing what she should be doing anyway, which was take responsibility and act like an adult.</p><p>\u201cJesus, they\u2019ll probably be buying her a car next,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cAlready did,\u201d Donovan called out.</p><p>At that Sam\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cThey did? When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Mom earlier and she said Dad was out car shopping. It\u2019s supposed to be a surprise for this party they\u2019re throwing,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>Sam closed his eyes and Garrett shook his head. \u201cChrist. That\u2019s just what we need. A crazy-ass teenager with her own car. I hope to hell they insure her out the yin yang. She\u2019ll get into a wreck and Mom and Dad will be sued and living on the streets in a month\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always count on you to find the bright side in everything,\u201d Sam said dryly.</p><p>Silence fell and Garrett leaned his head back, closing his eyes. Between the haphazard sleep and two days of extended workouts, he was wiped.</p><p>\u201cYou sleeping okay?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>Garrett opened his eyes and turned his head to see his brother watching him with a thoughtful expression. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie said you\u2019ve been up a lot.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scowled. Definite drawback to living in a damn commune. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t up going to the bathroom fourteen times a night, she wouldn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Sam chuckled but then he sobered. \u201cStuff bothering you, man?\u201d</p><p>Garrett shoved impatiently at his hair, which needed a good clipping. Right now it stuck out on his head like some beach bum-surfer wannabe. \u201cI\u2019m good, okay?\u201d</p><p>The last thing he wanted was to rehash the past. It was bad enough his brothers had to pick up the pieces and nurse his ass back to health when his mission had gone to shit six years ago. He didn\u2019t want to be babysat again just because he was having a few bad dreams.</p><p>\u201cSophie said the contractors were breaking ground on the helipad today.\u201d</p><p>Sam nodded. \u201cI plan to go over after we meet with Resnick. Take a look around and see how the rest is coming along. I have Sophie studying house plans. She can\u2019t decide how many bedrooms we need because, as much as she wants more children, she swears this one may be an only child.\u201d</p><p>Garrett chuckled. \u201cEthan said Rachel\u2019s already decided on their house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what about you?\u201d</p><p>Garrett frowned. A house? Hell, he hadn\u2019t given it much thought. He\u2019d lived with his brothers for so long that the idea of having his own place hadn\u2019t really sunk it. But it would be nice. Yeah, he needed to start giving it some thought.</p><p>The beep of the intercom prevented his response.</p><p>Donovan rose from his chair at the computer. \u201cLooks like Resnick is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up,\u201d Sam said when Garrett remained on the couch. \u201cI\u2019ll show him in.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned. \u201cThanks. I was comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Sam shot him a look and went to let their visitor in.</p><p>A few moments later, Sam returned with Resnick in tow. Typically, Resnick had one hand in his hair and the other piddling with the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. He took quick, short steps and his gaze constantly moved from side to side. Yep, he was a nervous, high-strung son of a bitch.</p><p>Garrett raised an eyebrow in Resnick\u2019s direction. \u201cNice to see you, Adam. To what do we owe this unexpected pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Resnick fixed Garrett with his stare and pulled the cigarette from his mouth, holding it between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cLattimer\u2019s finally fucked up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment Garrett stared at the other man, his mind completely blank. Gunfire echoed through his ears, and the acrid smell of blood filled his nostrils. He was taken back six years. To a place and time when his team had been set-up by the very man they\u2019d been sent to save.</p><p>Rage seared through his veins despite his attempt to keep cool and not let the others know just how affected he was by the mere mention of Marcus Lattimer\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cGet to the point,\u201d Sam cut in. \u201cWhy are you here and what\u2019s Lattimer fucking up got to do with us?\u201d</p><p>Resnick\u2019s gaze never left Garrett. He knew. It pissed Garrett off that Resnick knew just what buttons to push and how to exploit his weakness.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the best opportunity we\u2019re ever likely to get to take Lattimer down. I need you for the job,\u201d he said to Garrett.</p><p>Donovan rose from his seat and came to stand to the side of the couch where Garrett sat. \u201cGarrett\u2019s out of commission right now. Find someone else.\u201d</p><p>Garrett held up his hand. Donovan meant well, and for that, Garrett couldn\u2019t get pissed. Sam was already frowning, fully prepared to get the corncob wedged farther up his ass.</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d Garrett said shortly. \u201cThe abbreviated version, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no abbreviated version of Marcus Lattimer,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you all the shit he\u2019s involved in. Or what he\u2019s done in the past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you damn well don\u2019t need to tell me. He\u2019s a goddamn traitor and the son of a bitch doesn\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal for me too,\u201d Resnick said softly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not right for the job. You are.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s interest was solidly piqued. He had no doubt that over the years, Lattimer had pissed off a lot of people and betrayed just as many. It didn\u2019t surprise him that the CIA had a major hard-on for him, but for Garrett, nothing else mattered but the faces of the men he\u2019d lost on the day his team went in to rescue Lattimer.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I right for the job? You still haven\u2019t told me how Lattimer fucked up.\u201d</p><p>Resnick shoved the cigarette back into his mouth and ran his hand repeatedly through his hair until it looked like he\u2019d stuck a finger in a light socket.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago, he walked into a high-rise office building in Boston. Fifteen minutes later he walked out and Allen Cross was discovered shot to death in his office. Metro surveillance captured Lattimer entering the building and fifteen minutes later leaving the same way he came in. We don\u2019t have inside surveillance because the system was conveniently down as soon as Lattimer walked in. As an added convenience, the security guard who was on duty that night has disappeared. With his entire family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, pretty damn convenient,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big fuckup for a man like Lattimer,\u201d Sam said. \u201cWhat made Allen Cross so special that Lattimer would do the job himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t know,\u201d Resnick admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to connect the dots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where do I come in?\u201d Garrett asked.</p><p>Resnick fidgeted with his cigarette and Garrett was tempted to tell him to just light the damn thing and get it over with. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t already smoke like a chimney.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that. Sarah Daniels, who had a prior working relationship with Allen Cross, entered the building in an agitated state not long after Lattimer went in. She ran out just a few minutes later looking like Satan himself was after her. To add to an already fucked up situation, Stanley Cross was caught on surveillance entering the building not long before Sarah ran out. He\u2019s the one who reported the murder after he found his brother\u2019s body. But he denies seeing either Sarah or Lattimer.\u201d</p><p>Garrett made a sound of disbelief. Marcus nodded. \u201cYeah. I figure Lattimer got to him and he\u2019s scared shitless to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink she witnessed Lattimer killing Cross?\u201d Donovan asked.</p> <p>Resnick inhaled and blew out his breath around the cigarette. \u201cI think that not only did she see it go down, but I think she knew it was going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, you lost me there,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a stretch to make.\u201d</p><p>Resnick held up his hand. \u201cSarah Daniels is a dot we haven\u2019t been able to connect until now. Not only did she know the victim, but we believe that she has a relationship with Lattimer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of relationship?\u201d Sam prompted. \u201cYou\u2019re saying Sarah worked for Cross, was involved romantically with Lattimer and Lattimer shoots her boss?\u201d</p><p>Resnick shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s Lattimer\u2019s half sister.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sat forward on the couch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any family. Hell, he killed his own father and then took over the old man\u2019s business. His mother died when he was a child and he didn\u2019t have any other siblings. I should know. I\u2019ve looked for a way to get to that bastard for years. Even Van hasn\u2019t come up with anything and there\u2019s not much he can\u2019t find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had someone undercover in Lattimer\u2019s organization,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cWe were this close to bringing Lattimer down when he got suspicious and my guy disappeared. I want Lattimer for this. I want him bad. Before he disappeared, my agent relayed information about Sarah. And here\u2019s the thing. Resnick cares about her. He\u2019s extremely protective of her. He\u2019s gone to great lengths to keep his relationship to her secret because he doesn\u2019t want his shit touching her. Remarkable, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019d have laid odds the bastard didn\u2019t have a heart or a conscience.</p><p>\u201cWe were moving in on Sarah and setting up surveillance. I was in the process of getting wiretaps for her phone when this thing with Cross went down. We were in the same goddamn city as the bastard and he slipped through our fingers.\u201d</p><p>Garrett rubbed absently at his shoulder as he let Resnick\u2019s words sink in. Lattimer had a weakness. Weaknesses could be exploited.</p><p>\u201cI want in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a fucking minute, Garrett,\u201d Sam said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the job is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Whatever it is, I want in.\u201d</p><p>Donovan frowned and shook his head \u201cYou\u2019re not ready to go back into action yet, man. This isn\u2019t some pansy-ass cake job we\u2019re talking, not to mention this is way too personal for you.\u201d</p><p>Resnick cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s actually perfect for him. It\u2019s why I came. It\u2019s true I know how much you hate the bastard, Garrett, and I\u2019m certainly not above using that to my advantage. But your injury provides the perfect cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the point,\u201d Garrett snapped.</p><p>\u201cSarah disappeared after she ran from the building where Cross was killed. It took us a while to find her. She used her real name to hop a flight to Miami but it got a little murky after that. Took some digging, but we found a pilot who took her to Isle de Bijoux. She paid via a wire transfer and used a fake name. Marcus is obviously funding her. She\u2019s currently holed up in a cottage on a remote section of the beach.\u201d</p><p>Donovan crossed his arms over his chest and sat on the arm of the couch next to Garrett. \u201cI can already tell I don\u2019t like where this is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t you sending one of your men in?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cIsle de Bijoux is small, not a lot of tourists. I need someone who\u2019d blend. Someone with a reason for being there. Plus Garrett\u2019s motivated. He hates Lattimer\u2019s guts. And I wanted to give him the opportunity to take him down,\u201d he added in an even voice.</p><p>\u201cBlend? You think he\u2019d blend?\u201d Donovan asked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cHe already looks like shit. He needs a shave and a haircut. He\u2019s recovering from an injury. You\u2019d take the beach cottage down from Sarah\u2019s. Do a little fishing. Hang out on the beach. Get some rest. It\u2019d be a mini vacation and all you have to do is keep an eye on Sarah Daniels until Lattimer shows up.\u201d</p><p>Garrett stood and began to pace back and forth in front of the couch. His shoulder was aching, but he\u2019d be damned if he gave in to the urge to rub it. Sam and Donovan would be on him about taking it easy, and the last thing he wanted to do right now was take it easy. He was damned tired of being laid up like some invalid. He was itching to get back in the game. Go to work. Even if it was some cake babysitting job. That wasn\u2019t what appealed. Beach and sun and sand did nothing for him. But the opportunity to nail Lattimer? He didn\u2019t give a shit if it meant him going to Bumfuck Africa.</p><p>He paused in mid-pace and turned his stare on Resick. \u201cYou\u2019re so sure he\u2019s going to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019ll show. Sarah\u2019s too important to him. She\u2019s the only damn thing he seems to care about in the world. If he doesn\u2019t show, he\u2019ll eventually get her to come to him. Either way, if you\u2019re on her tail, we nail him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. I go to this island and I keep an eye on her. Wait for Lattimer to show his hand and nail his ass to the wall.\u201d</p><p>Resnick blew out his breath. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t care if you sleep with her or play priest to her nun. I just need you close enough that you know when she so much as takes a piss. I want to know if Lattimer contacts her or she contacts him. And another thing, Garrett. I don\u2019t want you to lose your goddamn head over this. Do it right. Don\u2019t try to be a hero. If Lattimer shows, don\u2019t try anything stupid. We want him alive.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat kind of backup will he have if things go to shit? I don\u2019t like the idea of sending one man in on any job, no matter how simple it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe full power of my resources,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cWhatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Garrett glanced first at Sam, who didn\u2019t look thrilled, and then to Donovan who simply looked worried. Then he looked back at Resnick. \u201cDo you have a file on Sarah? Photos? Age? Habits?\u201d</p><p>Resnick\u2019s eye twitched and he reached for his cigarette again. \u201cOf course.\u201d He reached into his suit and pulled out a folder. He thrust it at Garrett who took it and flipped it open. Paper clipped to the first page was a photo.</p><p>Sarah was beautiful. Not classical and elegant like Rachel or cute and sweet looking like Sophie, but a quiet beauty that didn\u2019t jump off the page at you but rather settled in nice and comfortably.</p><p>She had long chestnut hair, a light dusting of freckles over her nose and deep green eyes. She wasn\u2019t smiling in the picture but he\u2019d bet his last dollar that when she did smile, it lit up her entire face.</p><p>He thumbed through her information, glancing at her job. She was an administrative assistant. She\u2019d taken the job as Allen Cross\u2019s executive assistant eighteen months prior. That had only lasted six months. She hadn\u2019t taken a job since. He raised an eyebrow at that. Maybe her brother was footing her bills.</p><p>She lived in Boston but had been born and raised in Alabama. No siblings\u2014officially. No parents. According to her records, she\u2019d been raised in foster care for most of her childhood. He frowned. If she was Lattimer\u2019s half sister, then why the hell had she been raised in foster care when he\u2019d grown up with a silver spoon?</p><p>She had an apartment in a modest area of Boston. Lived alone. She had acquaintances, but no apparent close friends. She seemed to have lost touch with people she\u2019d formerly hung out with after she\u2019d quit her job with Cross.</p><p>He traced the outline of her face on the picture. So she was a loner. Probably what she was used to. In another life, Garrett imagined he was a hermit, and if his overbearing family would allow it, he\u2019d be a total cave dweller now.</p><p>Garrett rubbed his neck and then glanced back at Resnick. \u201cYou aren\u2019t holding out any other information from me, are you? This is it? I stick to Sarah Daniels and nail Lattimer when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a nutshell, yeah. Think of it as paid vacation. With a pretty woman at that.\u201d</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath. \u201cOkay, when do you want me down there?\u201d</p><p>Resnick shot him a rueful glance. \u201cTry yesterday.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>PARADISE had become hell. Despite the beauty of her surroundings, Sarah Daniels spent every minute of every day looking over her shoulder and waiting. Waiting to be discovered. After her arrival on the island, she\u2019d spent the entire first week holed up in the tiny cottage she\u2019d rented, barely able to sleep for fear of discovery.</p><p>Marcus had always been determined to take care of her. It frustrated him that she wouldn\u2019t accept his lavish gifts, his money or his offer to buy her a house complete with staff to see to her every need. What he had done was set up a bank account and deposited sums at intervals until a hefty balance had accumulated. As much as she\u2019d been determined not to draw on those reserves, she was grateful now that he\u2019d done it.</p><p>She\u2019d use the money to protect him, just as he\u2019d protected her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Demons past and present haunted her dreams until she was exhausted and worn thin. On the eighth day of her self-imposed solitude, she\u2019d risen at dawn and watched the first fingers of the sun spread over the deep blue water. Watched as the waves gently foamed onto the sand, reaching and then retreating.</p><p>Drawn to the peace it seemingly offered, she\u2019d walked barefoot onto the sand and stood at the water\u2019s edge, face turned up into the sun. Here, her past didn\u2019t matter. It was a chance to be reborn. She just had to take it. She had to believe in it.</p><p>Though the sun warmed her skin, she was still cold on the inside. She was in survival mode. Everything was locked down. She didn\u2019t feel. She couldn\u2019t feel.</p><p>Gradually she ventured out to buy groceries, figuring she\u2019d gain more suspicion by never leaving her cottage than if she mingled with the locals. The island was a fascinating mix of cultures, and people from all over the globe seemed to have traveled to this place for a new beginning.</p> <p>Tourists hadn\u2019t yet found the island. It was inhabited largely by year-rounders, corporate people who\u2019d left the rat race, artists seeking inspiration and loners like herself who sought refuge in a sparsely populated island where everyone pretty much kept to themselves.</p><p>Today she left her cottage wearing a tank top and casual trousers. Flip-flops and slides were the shoes of choice and she\u2019d purchased a few pair days earlier in her attempt to blend in with the local scenery. Her destination was the coffee shop perched haphazardly on a beach overlook a mile from the cottage. It was a popular haunt. The coffee was good and they served a variety of sandwiches and croissants. It also had free Wi-Fi.</p><p>She tucked her laptop into her bag and then felt inside the pocket of her pants for the paper with the instructions on how to check the email account she communicated with Marcus from. Even though it had been her and Marcus\u2019s primary method of communication for a few years now, she hadn\u2019t yet committed the intricate steps to memory. Marcus had despaired of her, exasperated by the fact she made lists and notes for everything. He preached to her about paper trails, but she\u2019d never considered his grumblings. Never considered that she\u2019d be in a position to actually worry about such a thing.</p><p>She\u2019d made a mistake already. She\u2019d used her real name. Her passport. Like an idiot. She\u2019d left Boston in such a rush that she hadn\u2019t really thought about the potential pitfalls of the very thing Marcus feared. A paper trail. Even her destination hadn\u2019t been planned. At the ticket counter in the airport, she\u2019d plunked down her credit card and asked for the first available flight out of Boston. It just happened to be going to Miami. On the plane, she\u2019d sat by an elderly couple whose final destination was Isle de Bijoux. It sounded perfect. By the time she landed in Miami, she\u2019d had time to actually think about what she was doing, so from there, she chartered a private Cessna to the island, used a fake name and paid via wire transfer from the account Marcus has set up for her. The pilot probably thought she was a drug dealer, but he hadn\u2019t turned down the money she offered.</p><p>Then she\u2019d booked another commercial flight to Los Angeles, though if anyone really looked hard, they\u2019d know she never got on that flight. And it wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d made it difficult for anyone to track her to Miami. Still, she felt some sense of satisfaction that with as little experience as she had with subterfuge, she\u2019d managed to get to the island and not stick out like a sore thumb. But the stress of not knowing if she was being hunted\u2014by the authorities or Stanley Cross\u2014had worn away at her already frayed mental state.</p> <p>So one of the first things she\u2019d done was to weigh her options and plan an escape route. It amused her that she was acting like a character in some ridiculous spy movie. She\u2019d flown here, and flying back out in a hurry simply wasn\u2019t an option. If she ever had to bolt, her best avenue of escape would be by sea.</p><p>Instead of looking up the two larger charter services, she\u2019d instead opted for a small, hole-in-the wall, one-boat operation that looked as though it was usually passed over for the two other services. She gave the owner a ridiculous story about how she was an author doing research and writing a crime novel and that she wanted to arrange for him to be on call to pick her up on the western tip of the island and take her to the neighboring island.</p><p>To his further amusement, she made him do a test run. He probably couldn\u2019t care less about why she was acting so ridiculous as long as she paid him, and she made sure it was worth his while, but she remained in character, even bringing a notebook where she pretended to take copious notes while they rode the two hours to the next island.</p><p>To her delight, there were a few charter services to choose from there, but she nearly did a victory dance when she found out that one of them made routine flights to Mexico to deliver goods to a retail store. After again spinning a yarn about researching a thriller, she convinced the pilot to allow her to hitch a ride when she got ready. She didn\u2019t bother to tell him that she preferred never to be ready, but at least she had a viable and somewhat secure escape route from her island should the need arise.</p><p>All the way back to the island aboard the small boat, she\u2019d patted herself on the back and asserted that while she was a decided amateur at matters of deception, she wasn\u2019t a complete idiot. Then she\u2019d spent an afternoon in the coffee shop researching her options in Mexico.</p><p>She\u2019d come a long way from the spineless coward she\u2019d been after Allen Cross raped her. So she\u2019d changed one hiding place for another, but she was far more in control of her destiny here than she\u2019d been in Boston. And she wasn\u2019t about to let go of the reins again.</p> <p>After three weeks on the island, she settled into a routine, but she didn\u2019t dare let her guard down. Mistakes could get her killed. Only a fool became complacent. But she did allow herself a few simple pleasures. Such as coffee at the shop in town and occasional trips to the market to see what struck her fancy.</p><p>She barely remembered the walk to the coffee shop, so deep was her concentration on her circumstances. She stayed on the narrow beach path rather than take the winding, pothole-riddled main road that that ended just a few hundred yards beyond her cottage. When she reached the crumbling stone steps that led up to the ramshackle hut, she paused to look around. Satisfied that nothing seemed amiss, she hurried up the path to the rear entrance of the shop.</p><p>Once inside, the aroma of coffee surrounded her and filled her nostrils. She breathed in and then took a seat in the far corner, where her back was to the wall. Marie, the regular waitress with a soft French accent brought her a cup of the local brew, offered a smile and then faded away as quickly as she\u2019d come.</p><p>Sarah liked that. Loved that everyone didn\u2019t want to be her friend, find out her life\u2019s story or pry into her circumstances. She opened her laptop after savoring the first sips of her coffee, then carefully pulled out the folded-up instructions.</p><p>She glanced up to make sure no one was nearby and then quickly went through the series of steps to access the secure server. She held her breath waiting for the page to load and then she saw that she had not one but several messages. Nearly a dozen. All from Marcus. Most saying the same thing with little variation.</p><p>Damn it, Sarah, where are you?</p><p>Sarah, contact me immediately. I\u2019ll come for you.</p><p>I\u2019m worried. You shouldn\u2019t have gone off on your own. Tell me where you are.</p> <p>And then the last.</p><p>Sarah, I\u2019m sorry you had to see that. I didn\u2019t want you anywhere near. It had to be done. I don\u2019t regret it. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid of me. Never of me. People will be looking for you. Because of me. I need you to tell me where you are so I can make arrangements.</p><p>With shaking fingers she typed a response to the last email.</p><p>I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m safe. It\u2019s better if you don\u2019t know where I am. I don\u2019t want to be used against you. I\u2019m not afraid of you. I\u2019m afraid for you. You\u2019re the only one who\u2019s ever stood up for me. It\u2019s time I stood up for myself. I promise to contact you if I need you. Let me know when things are safe for you.</p><p>Then she hurriedly shut the laptop. She closed her eyes against the ache in her throat. There was so many \u201cif only\u201ds. They ran through her mind like an out-of-control merry-go-round. But it was time to put the \u201cif only\u201ds behind her. Move forward. New life. New resolve.</p><p>A sound jerked her from sleep. Sarah came fully awake, sitting up in bed, hands shaking and nausea welling in her stomach. For a moment she was paralyzed with fear, and then she realized the room was steeped in darkness. Her gaze swung frantically to the lamp she always left on. She rolled, reaching for it and nearly knocking it off the nightstand in her haste to turn it back on. She twisted the knob but nothing happened. Had the bulb burned out? It had to have gone off after she\u2019d fallen asleep. Her shoulder brushed against the book she\u2019d been reading, and she shoved it under her pillow.</p><p>She listened, straining for the sound. Had she imagined it?</p><p>She swung her legs over the side of the bed, her bare feet hitting the old wooden floor. It creaked in protest when she rose and she reached down for the only means of self-defense she had\u2014an old pipe she\u2019d found lying outside the cottage.</p><p>Her fingers curled around it and she pulled it up to her chest as she peered through her open doorway into the hall. Her vision blurred and her head swam before she realized she was holding her breath. She let it out slow but it stuttered across her lips and she clamped then shut so she didn\u2019t make any sound.</p><p>She crept down the hall, so terrified and yet determined not to be a powerless victim again. If only she could have that moment back. She\u2019d replayed it so many times in her mind. She could have fought harder. She could have defended herself better. But no matter how many times she went back, the result was always the same. She\u2019d failed.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t fail again.</p><p>With renewed determination and courage, she gripped the pipe and increased her pace down the hall. At the end, she hesitated, surveying the small living room. The night-light plugged into the wall cast a glow over the area, and nothing looked out of place.</p><p>A faint rustle from the kitchen sent her pulse soaring. She leaned against the wall and pondered her options. She could run out the front door, but to where? The beach? She was a mile from town and at least two hundred yards from the closest cottage, which was currently vacant.</p><p>Still, outside was away from whatever was in her kitchen, and avoidance was always preferable to confrontation.</p><p>She swallowed, closed her eyes and then reopened them, her sights on the front door. There were two dead bolts, a chain and the regular lock to contend with. She\u2019d need to be fast because as soon as she started fumbling with the door, the intruder would be alerted.</p><p>Before she could overthink it, she lunged for the front door, her fingers reaching for the first dead bolt. She had it undone, when she heard a very distinct meow.</p><p>She froze. A cat?</p><p>She whirled around to see a scruffy calico cat standing in the doorway to the kitchen. The cat looked at her, then meowed again and proceeded to pad across the floor to rub against Sarah\u2019s leg.</p><p>Her relief was so staggering that she sagged to the floor still clutching the pipe. She leaned her head forward onto her knees, eyes closed and laughed. She laughed until tears ran down her cheeks and then she gave up and sobbed.</p><p>Warm fur rubbed against her arm and the low rumble of a purr reached her ears. She raised her head to see the cat up on its hind legs, paws on her thigh as she rubbed her head against Sarah\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death,\u201d Sarah said hoarsely. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>The cat meowed and dipped her head, obviously wanting Sarah to pet her. Sarah laid the pipe on the floor and reached to scratch the cat\u2019s ears. The cat responded with an even louder purr and a ripply sound of pleasure. She began kneading Sarah\u2019s arm and Sarah gently removed the claws from her skin.</p><p>Pitifully grateful for the affection of the cat, she gathered the animal closer, putting her against her chest. The cat nudged at Sarah\u2019s chin and repeatedly bumped her head over Sarah\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? Is that what you were doing in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Had she been so lost in her thoughts when she\u2019d returned from town that she hadn\u2019t seen the cat come in? Or had she left the door ajar earlier? The thought worried her. She was going to have to be more careful. She couldn\u2019t afford any lapse in attention.</p><p>The cat responded with more purring and Sarah smiled as she wiped the tears from her cheek. Gathering the cat under one arm, she got to her feet and walked into the kitchen. She flipped on the light and grimaced. The cat had knocked a glass off the counter and it lay in pieces on the floor, the edges gleaming in the light.</p><p>Sarah sighed and put the cat up on the counter so she wouldn\u2019t cut her paws. \u201cYou were a very naughty cat,\u201d she chided. \u201cStay there while I clean the mess up and I\u2019ll find you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>The cat settled on its haunches and began licking her paw and wiping it over her jowls. Sarah collected the dustpan and the broom from the pantry and cleaned up the shards. Afterward she perused the contents of the small refrigerator and decided that leftover chicken breast was the most suitable meal until she could buy dry food from the market. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cat tried to stick her nose in the chicken multiple times as Sarah sliced it into bite-sized pieces. She pushed at the cat\u2019s head to ward it off but it only purred and rubbed against her palm. With a laugh, Sarah piled the chicken onto a saucer and set it in front of the cat.</p><p>She leaned tiredly against the counter, watching as the poor animal devoured the meal like it was her last. Unable to resist, she slid her hand over the cat\u2019s fur, petting as the cat continued to scarf down the bites.</p><p>Every once in a while the cat would pick her head up and give Sarah sweet eyes and Sarah smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t look or act like you have a home, sweetie. Do you want to stay with me?\u201d In truth, the idea of having a pet here appealed. It made the cottage less intimidating and the idea that she wasn\u2019t alone\u2014even with just a cat for company\u2014was a huge relief.</p><p>After the last bite was demolished, the cat licked the saucer and then looked up at Sarah and meowed. Sarah scooped her off the counter and headed for the bedroom. Tomorrow, in addition to food, she\u2019d need litter and a pan. For tonight, she\u2019d just have to hope the cat could hold it until morning, because she was closing her bedroom door and locking it.</p> <p>Even though her fears had been unfounded, she was still jittery from the scare, and she wanted to feel as safe as possible. She dropped the cat onto the bed and then crawled on the mattress to get under the covers.</p><p>To her surprise, the cat padded up to her head, pawed at the covers until Sarah pulled them back and then snuggled down just under the sheet at Sarah\u2019s side. Sarah lay there, the cat vibrating against her side and smiled. It was a nice feeling. Very nice. She and the cat would get along just fine. Sarah would fill a need for the cat by offering food and shelter and the cat would provide some much-needed sanity for Sarah.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>GARRETT lugged his two bags through the door of the cottage and grimly surveyed the surroundings. When he\u2019d imagined a beachfront house with great views and just steps from the water, he\u2019d envisioned something a little more modern. Flat-screen TV, front porch with a hammock, fully stocked kitchen and maybe a hot tub that overlooked the beach.</p><p>What he\u2019d got was a ramshackle cottage that looked like it didn\u2019t survive the last hurricane season, with a dilapidated front porch and sagging steps. The inside smelled like his grandmother\u2019s house. Musty and old. The furniture was threadbare and at least thirty years old. The kitchen had been designed in the sixties and had appliances to match. Worse, there wasn\u2019t a TV at all, and his hopes for a hot tub went down the toilet.</p> <p>With a shrug, he dropped his bags and began opening windows to air the rooms out. He\u2019d certainly had worse accommodations during his years in the Marines.</p><p>He peeked out his bedroom window down the beach to where Sarah\u2019s cottage stood in the distance. It wasn\u2019t optimal. He\u2019d prefer closer proximity to the woman he was supposed to shadow, but the houses were sparse along this stretch of the shore.</p><p>The first order of business was a trip into town for food. He planned to take the path down the beach that went directly in front of her house. He didn\u2019t want to be too obvious right off the bat and force a meeting, but if she happened to be out and around when he passed, it was as good an opportunity as any to meet his new neighbor.</p><p>As he went back out the front door and stood on the tilted porch to look out over the ocean, he realized this wasn\u2019t going to be as bad as he imagined. As much as he protested the need for any recovery time, a few weeks on a beach to exercise, eat good food and not trip over all the people who currently inhabited his house sounded pretty damn good. If it put him back to one hundred percent so he could go back to work, he\u2019d take the downtime.</p><p>He felt a little ridiculous in beach khaki shorts, muscle shirt and flip-flops, but with the hint of scruff on his jaw and the fact he hadn\u2019t cut his hair on his usual schedule, he passed for a man only concerned with kicking back and relaxing.</p><p>The sun beat down on him and warmed his shoulders as he set off down the worn path toward Sarah\u2019s cottage. He flexed his arm and was happy to note that his shoulder was limber and not stiff despite the long time he\u2019d spent traveling and cooped up in a way-too-small seat. Puddle jumpers weren\u2019t built for men his size, and they were damn claustrophobic to boot.</p> <p>Sand got between his toes and between the bottoms of his feet and the flip-flops. Worthless shoes. He stopped periodically to shake the sand from them and then continued on down the beach.</p><p>He was careful not to show any undue curiosity as he neared Sarah\u2019s cottage, though he memorized every detail of the place from his periphery. Like his accommodations, it had seen its better days, although hers had underwent fresh paint recently. Still, it would take nothing to get inside. A good kick to the door\u2014or hell, even the walls\u2014and it would probably knock right down.</p><p>He continued past, wondering if she was unconcerned as she appeared. Simply using a fake name to rent a beach house didn\u2019t guarantee anonymity. Her trail was sloppy all the way from Boston. She\u2019d done a better job of covering her tracks once she reached Miami, but it still wasn\u2019t clean. Resnick had been able to find her. Garrett supposed he couldn\u2019t fault her, though. It wasn\u2019t like people got lessons in school on how to be a fugitive. Not that she was classified as a fugitive, but she may as well be. There were certainly enough people interested in her whereabouts.</p><p>The closer he got to town, the higher the dunes on his left stacked up. There were a few shoddily fashioned walkways up over the dune to turnouts on the road. Public access to the beach, but he hadn\u2019t come across a single beachgoer on his walk into town.</p><p>The sand ran smack into a rock outcropping, and cut into the stones were steps leading up to a coffee shack. He climbed but circled around the front to cross the cobblestone street to where the market was located. Outside the front were stands of fresh fruits and vegetables. He bypassed those for now and went inside to find the essentials. Red meat.</p><p>He soon learned that to the locals, \u201cmeat\u201d meant fish or other seafood. He grumbled through the selection of ground meat and winced at only finding two steaks. He bought up all the pork chops and put a healthy dent in the chicken breasts. He wasn\u2019t a fish person. Oh, he\u2019d put a hook in one, but eating them didn\u2019t appeal. Not enough substance.</p><p>Which reminded him, he really needed to check out the local bait shop, pick up a surf casting rod so he could spend some time fishing. It would give him a good excuse to be on the beach, where he could watch Sarah\u2019s cottage and get an idea of her routine.</p><p>At least the locals appreciated beer. There was a ton of variety, and well, when it came to beer, he wasn\u2019t picky. He picked up several six-packs, tossed them in the cart and headed down the aisles to see what else he needed to feed himself for the next while.</p> <p>Eggs, stuff for his protein shakes. Then he frowned. What were the odds of his cottage having a blender? He was lucky to have a few pots and pans to cook in. Cheese, bread, mayo, mustard and ketchup. Definitely ketchup. What meal was complete without it?</p><p>He smiled at the memory of his mother grumbling about his need to pour ketchup on everything.</p><p>When he finally rolled the cart to the front of the store, he was treated to several curious stares. It was then he realized that most everyone else had a basket with maybe one day\u2019s worth of food. It took a while to check out since there was only one clerk, and the line piled up behind him as everyone waited for all his groceries to be tallied.</p><p>A young guy who looked to be in his teens approached Garrett as he finished paying.</p><p>\u201cYou want I deliver the groceries to where you stay? I can get my friends to help. We work cheap.\u201d</p><p>Garrett eyed the eager kid. \u201cHow cheap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty euros apiece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t born yesterday,\u201d Garrett said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll give you twenty American and you split it with your friends.\u201d</p><p>The kid beamed at him. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Garrett pulled out his wallet. \u201cI\u2019m the last cottage down the beach from the coffee shack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know it. I\u2019ll bring them down and leave them on your porch. Don\u2019t be long. You wouldn\u2019t want your meat to spoil.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t want his food to spoil. Who knew how long it took the grocery to restock their non-fish meat items.</p><p>Since the kid was taking the groceries, Garrett ambled down to one of the shops that boasted fishing supplies. He walked in to see the shopkeeper sitting behind the register with his feet propped up on the counter. He had a floppy hat pulled low over his eyes, and it looked like he was taking a nap. Garrett was nearly by him when the guy tipped up the brim, gave him a cursory onceover and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to look around. If you need any help, just holler.\u201d</p><p>Garrett was surprised to hear an American drawl. Not just American, but clearly southern. \u201cGot a recommendation for something to do a little surf fishing with?\u201d</p><p>The shop owner slid his feet off the counter and they landed with a clunk on the floor. He pushed back the hat and sized up Garrett more fully. Then he grunted. \u201cMilitary, though probably not for a few years. Injury to your shoulder. Recent. Looking for some R and R and don\u2019t much like other people. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Garrett raised an eyebrow, immediately suspicious.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I read people. Nothing much else to do around here when what little tourist season we have is over.\u201d He stuck out his hand to Garrett. \u201cRob Garner. Retired army. Opened up shop here five years ago. Doesn\u2019t take much to live here and the scenery\u2019s good. I got in at a good time. In a few years, the rest of the world will catch on to what we have here and the property values will soar. Then I can sell and live high on the hog.\u201d</p><p>Garrett returned his hand shake. \u201cGarrett Kelly. Marine Corps. And yeah, here for some R and R and no, I don\u2019t like people much.\u201d</p><p>Rob laughed and clapped his hands together. \u201cI don\u2019t have much use for them myself. Now, if you want to do some surf fishing, I\u2019d suggest a casting rod that you can get out there a ways with. Then you can slip it into the holder, kick back with a beer and wait for the fish to bite. All the casting and reeling those bass fishermen do is for idiots. Fishing\u2019s supposed to be relaxing.\u201d</p><p>Garrett cracked a smile. \u201cFuckin\u2019 A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll get you what you need. For bait you can use shad or shrimp. Cut bait is good too.\u201d</p><p>Garrett watched as Rob pulled down about a twelve-foot rod, handed it to Garrett and then went down another aisle to get hooks, surf weights and liters. A few moments later, he piled everything onto the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re all set. I\u2019ll ring you up and you can be fishing this afternoon if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I might do that. Got the beer already. Maybe I\u2019ll grill some steak and have dinner on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Rob nodded. \u201cYep, that sounds like a pretty good damn day to me. Enjoy it. If there\u2019s anything else you need, don\u2019t hesitate to come back in.\u201d</p><p>Garrett broke down the rod to make it more manageable to carry, then collected the bag with all the other supplies. With a nod, he headed back outside.</p><p>Hopefully the kid had delivered the groceries while Garrett was in the bait shop. Breakfast had consisted of a dry bagel on the plane, and his stomach was doing some serious protesting. A steak and a little fishing sounded next to heaven.</p><p>He glanced over to the market to see a woman step out, bag clutched close to her chest. She glanced furtively left and right and then strode toward the coffee shack. His pulse picked up. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, he\u2019d just gotten his first real-life glimpse of Sarah Daniels.</p><p>On impulse, he crossed the street toward the coffee shack. He\u2019d intended to take the main road back, but carrying the fishing pole and supplies, he had a ready excuse to take the beach path.</p><p>When he rounded the corner of the shack, he saw her head bob down the stone steps leading to the beach. He waited a moment to give her a bigger head start and then took out after her.</p><p>At first she didn\u2019t realize he was following her. Which further cemented his opinion that she was hopelessly na\u00efve. When she did look over her shoulder, her eyes flared in alarm. Then she made a concerted effort to shield her reaction. She even offered a semblance of a smile as she took in the fishing gear he carried before turning around and increasing her pace.</p><p>Twice more she turned just enough that she could see him and each time she sped up. By the time she reached her cottage, he could tell she was alarmed by the fact he still trailed her. She hurried up her steps, and in her haste to open the door, she dropped one of the bags she carried.</p><p>She yanked the door open then turned so she could see him while she picked up her things. Her gaze never left him as she shoved the items back into her bag. Garrett found himself strangely transfixed and unable to look away. The pictures hadn\u2019t done her justice, nor had they captured the haunted, frightened eyes rimmed with shadows. She looked infinitely fragile, scared out of her mind, but he also saw something else. Maybe it was the way she tried not to look scared or maybe it was subtle stiffening of her shoulders and the rebellious twist to her lips. She was a fighter, not the timid mouse he\u2019d imagined. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Awareness prickled over his skin and tightened the hairs at his nape. He rubbed the back of his neck in an attempt to dispel the momentary discomfort. His reaction irritated and intrigued him all at the same time.</p><p>He offered a friendly wave and continued on his way, though he found it hard to drag his gaze away from her. He didn\u2019t want her to feel threatened by him, because he planned to see a lot more of her.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>SARAH watched from between the slats of her wooden blinds as the man jogged down the beach. Every so often he\u2019d stop, drop down and do a series of push-ups. Sweat gleamed in the sunlight and she could see the strain on his face as he pushed himself harder.</p> <p>Ever since she\u2019d freaked out two days ago when she\u2019d realized he was following her, she paid careful attention to her new neighbor. Granted, her imagination had run wild, but she didn\u2019t get down on herself for being careful.</p><p>He was a big man. Beautiful. She chided herself for her fanciful thoughts, but the man was beautiful. He was solidly built, lean and muscled with no amount of spare flesh anywhere that she could see. His black hair was mussed on top, as if he\u2019d outgrown a more severe military cut. Judging by the amount of time he spent working out and the way he\u2019d roll his shoulder with a grimace, she figured he\u2019d been injured. Maybe he was on leave or maybe he\u2019d been discharged after his injury.</p><p>Or maybe she was just trying to convince herself that her new neighbor wasn\u2019t a threat to her.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let the slat fall. Not everyone was the enemy. The problem was figuring out who wasn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t have the luxury of differentiating.</p><p>It relieved her that she felt the stirrings of interest\u2014feminine interest\u2014in this man. That she could look and appreciate and even wonder about him made her want to do a fist pump in the air. Up yours, Allen Cross. You haven\u2019t won. You didn\u2019t destroy me.</p> <p>A plaintive meow broke her from her thoughts and she turned to see the cat sitting on the countertop, eyeing her expectantly. Sarah smiled and walked over to rub her hand over the cat\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I need to name you. I can\u2019t continue calling you Cat, can I?\u201d</p><p>The cat blinked and let out a purr, then walked over to the cabinet where Sarah kept the cat food. She reared up on her hind legs and pawed at the door. Sarah chuckled and went to oblige the hungry animal.</p><p>Her new neighbor had already established a routine. She felt like some stalker watching his every movement. Part of it was her wariness, but the other part was curiosity. There wasn\u2019t much else to do out here but watch the water. There wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic down this way because of the smaller number of houses, most of which were rentals. He was the only other person she saw on her end of the beach with any regularity, and she found herself fascinated by him.</p><p>He was up early in the mornings, jogging, sometimes running. Then he\u2019d disappear into his cottage only to reappear later with his fishing gear. He\u2019d set up, wade out into the surf to cast his line and then wade back and position his pole in the holder. Then he\u2019d kick back in a rickety-looking lawn chair, ice chest on the ground next to him and wait.</p><p>She had to admire his patience. He\u2019d sit for long periods of time until the rod tip bent, when he\u2019d leap up to set the hook and begin reeling in. Most of the fish were smaller, but she\u2019d stood in her window watching for a solid half hour watching him wrestle a huge catch to the shores.</p> <p>He\u2019d unhook it, admire it, hold it up in the sun and then wade out to free it again. Then he\u2019d begin the process all over again.</p><p>She envied his freedom. The complete lack of care. He didn\u2019t look as though he had a worry in the world other than enjoying his quiet day in the sun. She poured the cat food into the bowl and set it on the floor, then stood back as the kitty began devouring it like it was a piece of prime steak.</p><p>\u201cPatches,\u201d she decided. \u201cNot terribly original. I\u2019m sure there are thousands of other calicos out there with the same exact name, but I bet you\u2019re the only one on this island.\u201d</p><p>Patches didn\u2019t look up from her food.</p><p>Sarah went back to the window to see if she could catch another glimpse of her neighbor. To her surprise, he\u2019d changed into a pair of swim trunks and was now standing at the water\u2019s edge. The waves foamed and covered his feet as he stared over the horizon.</p><p>He raised his arms and then began a series of motions that looked to her like a martial arts workout. Maybe Tai Chi? She watched, absorbed by the sensuality of his movements. She might have expected a man of his size to be clumsy, but he moved with a grace that surprised her.</p><p>Lyrical. He moved in harmony with the water, as though he blocked out everything but the beauty immediately surrounding him. She was, in that moment, insanely jealous of the peace that surrounded him like an aura.</p><p>She stared unabashedly as he went through the motions. At one point he turned, and she could swear he saw her watching him, but she shook off the notion. She was staring through an opening no bigger than an inch and he was at least fifty yards away. Maybe farther.</p> <p>Still, it was enough to pull her away from the window. She needed something else to focus on. The isolation was driving her insane. Her gaze snagged on her laptop bag.</p><p>The waiting was making her crazy. Maybe she could check out the little bookstore in the town square. She\u2019d even seen a section in the market where they rented DVDs. She hadn\u2019t even turned on the television to see if it or the DVD player worked but movies would be a welcome distraction.</p><p>And she totally needed to get out of this cottage before she lost her mind.</p><p>She grabbed her bag, made sure the cat was nowhere near the door and let herself out. As she descended the steps to the beach, she looked to her right to see her neighbor swimming at a fast stroke away from shore. She stood and watched for a moment until he got so far away she could no longer see him and then she headed down the beach in the opposite direction.</p><p>Her first stop was at the coffee shack, where she set up in her usual corner, accepted a cup of the local brew from Marie and then she went through the steps to check her email. As suspected, she had no new messages. It was tempting to search the local news in Boston but she was too paranoid. The last thing she wanted was to tip off anyone as to her location. And who knew what could be accomplished on the Internet?</p><p>Yes, she was paranoid, but she could live with that. It might just save her life. It didn\u2019t help that she was a complete idiot about technology.</p><p>Her instinct was to hurry through her coffee, go to the bookshop and rush back to her cottage. But she tempered that urge and remained to sip at her coffee and watch the goings on in the little caf\u00e9, such as they were. She hated the idea of going back to the cottage, where she\u2019d once again be alone. She hated being alone. She was a people person. She liked being around people even if she didn\u2019t interact with them much, loved the big city with all the flashes of color and culture.</p><p>She glanced out the front window to watch the passersby and speculate on their circumstances, where they came from, where they were going. When the waitress came to offer her a refill, she smiled and accepted, determined to stay and enjoy her break from isolation.</p><p>After the second cup, she was jittery from the double jolt of caffeine and anxious to be off. She slid out of her chair, careful to tuck her laptop into her bag and then exited the front of the shop to cross the street to the bookstore. It was two doors down from the market with only a fishing supply shop to separate them.</p><p>When she entered, she was instantly assailed by the smell of old books. She sniffed appreciatively and went to the shelves to browse the selection. An older lady with a warm smile waved from her chair behind the register and Sarah offered a brief acknowledgment before turning back to the shelf in front of her.</p><p>It was easy to get lost in books. It was more than an hour later when she realized how long she\u2019d been there picking over the titles. She looked ruefully at the dozen or so books she\u2019d stacked to the side and decided it was enough for now. It would give her a good excuse to return when she\u2019d finished them.</p><p>She hauled her loot to the register and plunked them down in front of the woman.</p><p>\u201cHi there, you like to read, I see,\u201d the woman said cheerfully. \u201cMost folks who come through here just pick up one or two. Beach reads they call them. If you ask me, any book is good for the beach.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled. \u201cI do enjoy books. I don\u2019t think these will last me long, but they\u2019re all I can carry with me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Martine,\u201d the woman said, extending her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Sarah, it\u2019s very nice to meet another book lover. When you\u2019re done with these, you can bring them back in. I\u2019ll give you credit toward more book purchases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I will.\u201d</p><p>Martine rang up the books and Sarah paid her in cash. Then Martine placed the books in a plastic grocery store bag and handed it over to Sarah. Sarah juggled her laptop bag, hauling it farther over her shoulder, and took the sack from the shop owner. With a wave, she headed back outside.</p><p>Just the little bit of human interaction warmed Sarah on the inside. She needed this. Needed to connect to other people, even in a superficial way. Head down, she turned the corner of the bookshop into the small alley that separated the store from its neighbor. The DVD rental place was behind the market. She\u2019d make a quick stop, pick up a few movies and then she\u2019d be set for entertainment for the next several days. Between the times she spent watching her neighbor, that is.</p><p>She was so absorbed in her thoughts that she didn\u2019t see the person in front of her until she ran smack into the man. She bounced off as adrenaline spiked in her veins. Stupid, stupid, stupid!</p><p>Before she could react, the dull gleam of a knife flashed in her face and the strap from her bag carrying her laptop nearly wrenched her shoulder from its socket. She dropped the bag of books and grabbed the strap before her assailant could wrest it free.</p><p>She pulled and stumbled back, and came face to face with a grubby-looking man who looked to be in his early twenties. He was unwashed and unshaven and her nostrils flared at the overwhelming smell of body odor.</p><p>\u201cGive me the bag,\u201d he ordered in clipped English.</p><p>He gripped her hair and yanked, pulling her closer to him\u2014and to the knife he held barely an inch in front of her nose.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lose her laptop. Her whole life was in that laptop. Panic and hysteria rose and slammed through her veins with the force of a cement truck.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The exclamation rose in her throat and was forced out before she could think better of it.</p><p>The hand tightened in her hair and then she was slammed against the outside wall of the shop with enough force to knock the breath from her and make her eyes water. The man grabbed clumsily for her bag, and the knife wavered in her vision. Taking advantage of his lapse, she grabbed his wrist and knocked the knife from his hand.</p><p>And suddenly she was free. She stood against the wall, shaking violently, not comprehending what had just happened. She watched in disbelief as her neighbor, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, let out a snarl of rage as he smashed his fist into the face of her attacker.</p><p>The noise attracted onlookers. Several gathered at the end of the alley and a moment later, the constable ran down to intervene. It was over almost as soon as it began. Her attacker lay bleeding on the ground, begging pitifully for mercy. Her neighbor hauled him up and shoved him in the direction of the approaching constable. Then he turned to Sarah, concern etched on his brow.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He moved closer and gripped her shoulders. She flinched and tried to move away, but he held tight as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She shook her head and to her consternation, her teeth started to clink together like ice tumbling into a glass.</p><p>He touched her cheek, then pushed back the hair that had fallen over her eyes. She glanced away to see the constable putting her attacker in handcuffs. \u201cHe had a knife.\u201d She pointed to the ground, where it had fallen.</p><p>Her neighbor bent and retrieved the knife, holding it up as he inspected it in the sunlight. Then he frowned and handed it over to the constable.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far this time, Didier,\u201d the constable snapped at her attacker.</p><p>Sarah frowned and pushed herself around her neighbor. \u201cWhat do you mean? Do you know this man?\u201d</p><p>The constable sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s a troublemaker. I\u2019ve picked him up a few times, but he\u2019s never resorted to violence. He\u2019s a petty thief.\u201d</p><p>Heat suffused her cheeks. \u201cHe threatened me! I hope you\u2019ll keep him locked up this time so he doesn\u2019t terrorize others.\u201d</p><p>The constable\u2019s brows drew together as if he had no liking for her telling him how to perform his duties.</p><p>\u201cHe pulled a knife on the lady,\u201d her neighbor said in a dangerous voice. \u201cIf you won\u2019t deal with the matter, I\u2019ll report this matter to your superiors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course the matter will be dealt with,\u201d the constable huffed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to jail. He\u2019ll be summoned to appear before the judge.\u201d He looked to both Sarah and her neighbor. \u201cI\u2019ll need the both of you to come with me and give a proper report.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pulse at the base of her neck pounded viciously. Report the crime. What she hadn\u2019t, in her cowardice and shame, done before. She so indignantly informed the constable that she didn\u2019t want this man to be free to terrorize others, and yet she\u2019d done just that when she\u2019d refused to report the crime against her so many months ago.</p><p>She eyed her attacker bleakly, shame crowding her mind, pushing her fear and anger and everything else solidly aside. She was a hypocrite. And a coward. She didn\u2019t deserve justice because she\u2019d never sought it for herself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid,\u201d her neighbor murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she took a step back and found herself pinned against the wall again. She stared warily at the big man who\u2019d come to her rescue, hating the inadvertent fear that raced up her spine.</p> <p>He stood there waiting, not making a move toward her, almost as if he knew how badly he scared her. He watched calmly, waiting, his gaze drifting over her face, taking in every detail. It unnerved her and exposed her vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll come to the station straightaway,\u201d the constable urged as he pushed Didier down the alleyway in cuffs. \u201cI\u2019ll need to log a full report so the proper charges can be pressed.\u201d</p><p>Sarah swallowed the nausea that welled in her throat. Regret burned in her chest over past mistakes. But she wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again. She was through being a victim. She wanted control back, and she was tired of living in fear.</p><p>Her neighbor held out his hand, palm up, his expression devoid of any emotion. It was though he wanted to appear as nonthreatening as possible; and the thing of it was, she wanted to take his hand. She wanted to lean on someone else, just for a few minutes. She wanted it more than anything.</p><p>She wiped her hand over her mouth to disguise the tremble and then averted her gaze. \u201cWe should go,\u201d she said without taking his hand. She started after the constable, leaving her rescuer to follow.</p> <p>He fell into step behind her, but he kept at least a foot between them. Still, he loomed over her, blocking the sun as they stepped onto the street. She quickened her pace, unsettled by him, and why, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>When they reached the small station at the far end of the town square, her neighbor held the door open and ushered her inside. There was no air-conditioning and it was a good twenty degrees hotter inside the boxlike building. None of the windows were open to allow the sea breeze in, and she glanced nervously back toward the door. She couldn\u2019t remain in this airless place for more than a few minutes. She\u2019d go nuts.</p><p>A younger officer sat at a desk idly flipping through paperwork. He looked up when she and her neighbor entered.</p><p>\u201cComment puis-je vous aider, madame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish please,\u201d she said. \u201cParlez-vous Anglais?\u201d</p><p>The officer nodded. \u201cBut of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to give the constable our statement,\u201d her neighbor said.</p><p>\u201cAh, very good. If you\u2019ll have a seat, he\u2019ll be with you momentarily.\u201d</p><p>Sarah nodded and sank onto one of the metal chairs, relieved to be off her feet. She stiffened when her neighbor sat next to her, their legs grazing as he shifted to get comfortable.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sarah,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cPretty name. Very classic. I like non-frou-frou names.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and smiled. He smiled back and she found herself mesmerized by his deep blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He cocked his head. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re neighbors,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>He smiled again. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to take my bag. I couldn\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>The words came pouring out and she winced at how defensive and silly she sounded. She hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not worth your life,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. Everything is in that bag. I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t lose it. Especially not to some bullying jackass.\u201d</p><p>Garrett chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced you even needed my help. You had him disarmed before I got to you.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI was scared out of my mind. I\u2019m so grateful you were there.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cYou were swimming when I left the cottage. How did you get into town so fast?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow and amusement gleamed in his eyes. \u201cKeeping tabs on me?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and looked down. \u201cI saw you exercising. When I left, you were in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came into town after my swim. I\u2019d only just arrived when I heard the commotion in the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have excellent timing,\u201d she said ruefully.</p><p>The constable strode into the tiny waiting room and gestured for Sarah and Garrett to follow him back. Sarah rose and nervously ran her palms down her sides. It occurred to her that as angry as she was, and as much as she wanted the asshole to pay for his crime, it was stupid of her to draw attention to herself. Even dumber to go on record where her name and information would be a matter of public record.</p><p>The problem was, she hadn\u2019t thought. She\u2019d reacted. She\u2019d allowed emotion to overshadow common sense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to press charges.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the constable\u2019s open mouth and Garrett\u2019s frown, she bolted from the station, cursing herself with every step. The door banged closed behind her as she hurried onto the street. Garrett caught up to her before she\u2019d even made it a block. Though he didn\u2019t touch her, he stepped in front of her, effectively halting her in her tracks.</p><p>A scowl darkened his face. \u201cHey, what happened back there?\u201d</p><p>She tried to step around him but he blocked her escape. \u201cNothing, okay? I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to just let him get away with that?\u201d Garrett demanded.</p><p>She blew out her breath as rage curdled her veins. \u201cLook, my preference would be to let the little bastard rot, but I can\u2019t afford to draw attention to myself.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. Damn it, but she was a walking disaster today. Nothing was coming out right. She may as well have told him everything about her situation. She\u2019d already slipped up and told him her first name. But that was okay. Sarah was a common enough name, and her neighbor didn\u2019t strike her as the type to get chatty with the locals.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get that.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s deep voice washed over her, soothing her fraught nerves. To her surprise, there was no reprimand in his voice. Just an intimate gentleness that made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I walk you home?\u201d he offered. \u201cSince I\u2019m going the same way and all.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a moment, lips pursed in concentration. Then she realized how ridiculous she was being. They were going the same way. They\u2019d end up walking together whether he was officially escorting her or not.</p><p>She relaxed and offered the most convincing smile she could muster. \u201cI\u2019d like that. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>GARRETT kept pace with Sarah as they hit the center of town square. \u201cWant to take the beach path back?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned toward the coffee shack, leaving him to follow. He kept just a step behind her, taking the opportunity to study her up close. She\u2019d been scared out of her mind when he\u2019d pulled the asshole off her in the alley. She was still scared. She put on a brave front, but she was pale as death and her fingers shook uncontrollably.</p><p>He needed to get on the sat phone and talk to Resnick asap, but his first priority was making sure she was safe. More than that, he wanted to give her a chance to calm down and rid herself of the haunted look.</p><p>Something had happened to her beyond the day\u2019s events. He knew that look. He\u2019d seen it in his sister-in-law\u2019s eyes more times than he cared to remember. Sarah had flinched when he\u2019d touched her in the alley and she\u2019d made it a point to keep her distance at every opportunity. Someone had hurt her.</p><p>All he knew was that she had barriers around her like most people wore clothes. She had a don\u2019t- touch-me air that enveloped her and reflected in her frightened gaze.</p><p>Even though Sarah hadn\u2019t pressed charges, and he understood why, he had no intention of allowing the little bastard to get away with what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d let Resnick deal with the asshole.</p><p>They walked in silence and he didn\u2019t attempt to break it. He wanted to come off as concerned but not intrusive. Gaining her trust was going to be more difficult than he\u2019d thought, and he had to tread lightly or risk scaring her away.</p><p>When they reached her cottage, she took a step toward her porch but then stopped and turned around to face him. He sensed that it took a lot of courage to stand there in front of him. She looked as though she wanted nothing more than to run for her cottage and bar the door. But she stood there, bottom lip pinched between her teeth and she leveled her gaze directly at him, her light green eyes catching the light and warming.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI know you think I\u2019m nuts, but thank you for everything you did and for walking me home. And ... for not forcing the issue back there.\u201d</p><p>He offered a casual smile and shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter to him one iota what she decided. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Glad I was in the right place at the right time.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting her to feel awkward, he broke away first and headed toward his own cottage. Right place right time. He nearly snorted at how easily that fabrication had fallen off his lips. He\u2019d tagged her as soon as she left her cottage. It had only taken him twenty minutes to return to his place, change and head into town after her.</p><p>He let himself into the house and went immediately for the sat phone. He called Resnick first and relayed the events along with the name of the constable and Sarah\u2019s attacker. In half an hour, Resnick would know his dick size and the last time he took a shit. If there was anything Garrett needed to do, Resnick would tag him later.</p><p>His next call was to Sam, and he waited impatiently for his brother to answer.</p><p>\u201cHow goes the babysitting?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a hello works,\u201d Garrett said sourly.</p><p>\u201cBut not nearly as fun. What\u2019s up? Everything okay in paradise?\u201d</p><p>Garrett rummaged in the fridge with one hand and pulled out a beer before diving back in for sandwich fixings. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad. Got some fishing in. Been working out, doing some swimming. Not a bad vacation.\u201d</p><p>Sam muttered something indecipherable, and Garrett grinned, knowing it would irritate Sam that Garrett was on a tropical island while Sam was stuck home on pins and needles waiting for his daughter to be born.</p><p>\u201cHey, is Van back from his gig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this morning,\u201d Sam replied. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him up. I need him to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t it wait? He\u2019s on day four of no rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t wait,\u201d Garrett said impatiently. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have called if it could wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpatient bastard,\u201d Sam grumbled. \u201cIf you get me into trouble with my wife for this, I\u2019ll kick your ass. She\u2019s ruthless right now.\u201d</p><p>Garrett chuckled. \u201cStill hasn\u2019t dropped the kid, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. If she doesn\u2019t pop soon, I\u2019m seriously contemplating moving out.\u201d</p><p>Garrett rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you say that shit. You\u2019re full of crap and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, I\u2019ll wake Van up.\u201d</p><p>Garrett heard muffled voices and one distinct groan. He grinned. Donovan did love his sleep and he wouldn\u2019t appreciate being pulled out of bed. But Garrett didn\u2019t want to wait another twenty-four hours to find out what his brother needed while Donovan caught up on his beauty rest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d Donovan\u2019s bleary voice bled over the line.</p><p>\u201cHello to you too. I need you to run something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis couldn\u2019t wait a few goddamn hours?\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s eyebrows went up. Cranky son of a bitch. He really must have missed some serious sleep to be this grouchy.</p><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell hell,\u201d Donovan muttered. \u201cGive me a sec to get to Hoss.\u201d</p><p>Garrett waited patiently, drumming his fingers on the counter by the can of beer. Deciding to utilize the time wisely, he propped the phone between his shoulder and ear and set about fixing a couple of sandwiches to go with the beer.</p><p>A few minutes later, Donovan\u2019s irritable grunt sounded. \u201cWhat the hell is so important that you couldn\u2019t wait for me to catch a few hours\u2019 sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to dig up some info on Sarah Daniels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I already gave you her file. I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>Garrett stuffed a bite of the sandwich into his mouth and then mumbled around it. \u201cNo, no, I need you to dig deeper. I think I\u2019m missing something here. I want you to check on any police reports that might have her name in it. Hospital records. Anything that suggests she was a victim.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a long pause. \u201cVictim of what, Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I need you to find out. That file Resnick gave us just gave info on her as it related to Lattimer and the guy he supposedly killed. I need to know more about Sarah herself and what makes her tick. She\u2019s skittish as hell, and she was attacked today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Donovan cut in. \u201cIs everything okay there? Do you need us?\u201d</p><p>Garrett chugged down a swallow of beer. \u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle. Some asshole tried to nab her bag. But she fell apart. I mean, not that it wouldn\u2019t be normal for her to be scared to death, but it was eerie. And then we get to the constable\u2019s office and suddenly she changes her mind, says she doesn\u2019t want to press charges and walks out. Part of it is I think she realized at the last minute that she would draw unwanted attention to herself, but I also think something else is going on here and I want to know what. I\u2019m going to need all the ammo I can get, because she\u2019s going to be a hard nut to crack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see what I can dig up. You want me to call you when I\u2019m done or you want to call me back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in an hour or so,\u201d Garrett replied.</p><p>Donovan snorted. \u201cThat confident I can find what you want by then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the geek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mr. Geek to you, and you can kiss my ass.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett made a smooching noise through the phone and then hung up. He finished the half-eaten sandwich and chugged the last of his beer before ambling over to his window to peer down the beach at Sarah\u2019s cottage.</p><p>He frowned and leaned closer when he saw her sitting on her steps, head down. She looked utterly defeated, her shoulders slumped, the ends of her hair lifting and blowing this way and that in the steady ocean breeze. Had she ever gone into her cottage?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what bothered him about her. It could be she was sitting out, enjoying the day, but after what had happened earlier, he couldn\u2019t quite believe that. He\u2019d expected he wouldn\u2019t see her again for a while and that she\u2019d hole up in her cottage.</p><p>She moved but it was only to bury her face in her hands and then her fingers slid over her forehead and into her hair. Hell. She was crying.</p><p>His stomach tightened and he turned away, unsettled by her obvious distress. This was a prime opportunity to go over and be sensitive or whatever it was women liked for men to be. But he\u2019d rather go another round with the shithead Didier than face a woman\u2019s tears.</p><p>He sighed and blew out his breath. He was going to have to go over there. If she did hole up, he probably wouldn\u2019t see her for days. And he couldn\u2019t very keep an eye on her if she wasn\u2019t in sight.</p> <p>Vacation or not, he\u2019d prefer to be knee-deep in a jungle viewing the world through his scope. At least he knew what the hell to do in those kinds of situations. Shoot first, no questions later. That was easy. Figuring out how to gain the trust of a woman scared shitless? Yeah, he was fucked.</p><p>Chocolate. Weren\u2019t women supposed to be rabid predators of chocolate? He\u2019d waved a chocolate bar in front of Sophie\u2019s nose more than once and been forgiven for all manner of transgressions.</p><p>He went into the bedroom and dug into his pack. There were plenty of protein bars but he always had a stash of the good stuff. Chocolate caramel bar. No, he wouldn\u2019t sacrifice that for the cause. He opted for the plain milk chocolate and tossed the pack back onto his bed.</p><p>Feeling like a genius, he headed out to the beach and glanced in Sarah\u2019s direction again. She hadn\u2019t moved so he set off at a brisk pace. He wanted to get as close as he could with his chocolate before she bolted inside.</p><p>He was just a few yards away when she looked up and saw him. She reached for the bag at her feet and wrapped her hands around the strap like she thought he was going to make a grab for it.</p><p>He was wrong. She hadn\u2019t been crying. She was, however, upset. Her face was raw and her eyes glittered with ... grief? Slowly she released her grip on her bag. She rubbed her face and hastily shoved her hair back, then put her hands down on the steps like she was bracing herself for attack. Hell, he couldn\u2019t blame her after the morning she\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said casually. \u201cI saw you were still out. I brought you a present. My sisters-in-law inform me that a woman can refuse no man bearing chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in confusion as he held out the chocolate bar. She glanced up at him then back at the candy, clearly baffled. Then her face crumbled and she dropped her head again.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t go in,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>Taking the chance that she wouldn\u2019t kill herself backing away from him, he eased onto the step beside her. \u201cYour cottage?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her hair falling forward again to partially obscure her face. His fingers were up to brush it away before he got ahold of himself. He dropped his hand back to his lap and stared over the water.</p><p>Casually he extended the candy bar sideways so it crossed her vision. After a hesitation, she took it and held it, her finger stroking over the aluminum wrapping. He felt like a man trying to tame a wild animal with a food offering.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my cottage,\u201d she finally said. \u201cOh God, I feel so stupid. I stood there in front of the door and couldn\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her head dipped lower, and she gripped the candy bar with enough force that coupled with the hot sun, she was going to have a handful of chocolate syrup.</p><p>\u201cFear,\u201d she said in an aching voice. \u201cGod, I hate it. I feel so ... powerless.\u201d She turned her head, her eyes blazing as she sought his gaze. \u201cDo you have any idea what that feels like?\u201d Then she gave a derisive laugh and looked away again. \u201cProbably not. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019ve ever been scared of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrying women scare me,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLucky for you I used up all my tears months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of things scare me. Pregnant women scare me.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him again, her lips twitching. Some of the wildness had faced from her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m getting the impression that women, in any form, scare you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re the more violent species. And unpredictable. I\u2019d rather take on a wild boar. You can\u2019t shoot women.\u201d</p><p>This time her laugh came from deep within. It was full and throaty and so fucking beautiful that he simply stared at her, gutshot over his reaction.</p><p>\u201cOkay, be serious. Aren\u2019t you ever afraid of anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of times,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cEven when what you\u2019re afraid of defies all logic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially then. It\u2019s been my experience that fear doesn\u2019t have a set of parameters. We can\u2019t turn it off just by realizing we shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a rueful twist to her lips.</p><p>\u201cTell you what. Why don\u2019t you let me go into your cottage first. I\u2019ll check it out. You stay on the porch. I\u2019ll kick the shit out of any bogeymen and then you can come in.\u201d</p><p>Her head swung up again and the relief in her eyes staggered him. Shit, she\u2019d really been scared. Her fingers were curled into tight fists in her lap, so tight that her knuckles were white. He took in the dampness on her forehead and at her hairline. No, not just scared. Terrified.</p><p>Unable to resist, he reached with a tentative hand to touch her shoulder. Though she didn\u2019t outright flinch away as she had before, she tensed and trembled underneath his fingers. Not wanting to cause her more stress, he pulled quickly away. He rose and then reached a hand down to help her up. He stood there, waiting for her to accept the gesture, allowing her to touch him on her own terms.</p><p>Finally she reached up and slid her damp palm over his. She wrapped her other hand in the strap of her bag and hauled it to her shoulder. He curled his fingers around hers and pulled as she got up from the steps.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders lifted and then sagged as she breathed out. \u201cThank you. I know this is stupid. Irrational even. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said, cutting her off in mid babble. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid and it\u2019s not irrational. You had a hell of a scare earlier. Now, wait here while I go in.\u201d</p><p>He started for the door when suddenly she bounded up the step after him.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to tell you about the cat,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cDon\u2019t let her out, I mean watch out for her. Her name is Patches.\u201d She broke off then took a step back and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m babbling again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to reassure her. \u201cI\u2019ll look out for Patches and make sure the bogeyman didn\u2019t get her either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the key. You\u2019ll need the key.\u201d She hastily dug into her bag, her face drawn into a frustrated frown. Finally she pulled out a key ring that sported three keys and thrust it in his direction. \u201cYou\u2019ll need them all. I mean, there are two dead bolts and the regular lock.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t say anything as he turned to the door. She was careful. He\u2019d give her that.</p><p>After a few moments of figuring out which key went where, he pushed open the door and stepped inside. Patches meowed from her position on the couch and then laid her ears flat when she figured out Garrett was a stranger.</p><p>Garrett glanced around, noting the bareness of the room. It wasn\u2019t much more updated than his own, though he did note she\u2019d gotten the better draw. And she had a TV. Silence blanketed the house. Only the sounds of his footsteps echoed as he made his way down the hallway to the bedroom. He peeked in the bathroom, surprised that it wasn\u2019t littered with girly paraphernalia. Then he entered the bedroom, taking note of the pristinely made bed and the fact that wasn\u2019t so much as a shoe on the floor.</p><p>Neat freak. God save him.</p><p>Nothing out of place. In fact, nothing was in place. He glanced at the still-packed suitcase to the side of her bed. She was living out of her suitcase. Not even her toiletries were unpacked and in the bathroom.</p><p>She was prepared to run at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>If he thought she wasn\u2019t fully aware of the situation she was in, he was wrong. Resnick was wrong. This was a woman who knew full well that her time could be limited. She lived and breathed fear, waiting each minute for her world to upend.</p><p>Christ, that was no way to live.</p><p>Anger boiled up in his throat until the taste of acid was strong on his tongue. And frustration. He was intensely frustrated by not knowing everything. Resnick hadn\u2019t done his job worth shit, because Garrett was faced with a woman with secrets. And he needed to know every damn piece of her past if he was going to figure out the best way to handle Sarah.</p><p>If she\u2019d witnessed a murder, it wasn\u2019t all that had happened. Someone had hurt her or scared the hell out of her, and it enraged him. Yeah, she was a job and he took each and every job seriously. He took his duty damn seriously. But the surge of protectiveness he felt whenever he looked at this scared, fragile woman went beyond that of a job. And he was at a loss to explain it.</p><p>He turned and finished his sweep of the house. Though he noted the two dead bolts on the front door, the windows in the house were completely unsecure. It would be a cakewalk to get through any of them, although he did notice that she\u2019d moved the dresser directly in front of the window in the bedroom. It blocked any and all view, but then she wasn\u2019t here for the scenery.</p><p>He walked back outside, where Sarah stood clutching her bag like a lifeline. \u201cAll clear.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders drooped and relief washed over her face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He waited for the inevitable dismissal. For her to walk past him, go inside and close the door behind her. But she just stood there, staring at the entrance like she was trying to gather the courage to take that first step.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said gently, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze swung to him and she blinked, almost as if she\u2019d forgotten his presence.</p><p>\u201cI stocked up on groceries after I got here. I think I wiped out most of the meat from the market. Why don\u2019t I head over, get all the fixings then come back and grill us a steak. You like beer? I have a good stock of that.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised by his offer and equally unsure of what to say. She frowned and then pressed her lips together. She glanced down the beach at his house then back to him as she battled her indecision.</p><p>\u201cThought it might be good to have company until you\u2019ve settled down from your fright. It\u2019ll make your cottage less scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. She took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. Thank you. A steak sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and careful not to crowd into her space, he descended the steps and started for his cottage. When he reached the beach, he turned to find her watching him.</p><p>\u201cGive me just a few minutes and I\u2019ll be back. You can wait out here for me if you prefer not to go in alone.\u201d</p><p>A smile crept over her mouth, lifting the corners until he saw the flash of her teeth. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>SARAH eased her bag onto the steps and then rubbed her hands up and down her arms to ward off the chill. The sun beat down on her but she still felt cold on the inside. She watched as Garrett sauntered down the beach, his pace unhurried.</p><p>He was a puzzle to her. He seemed so big and intense yet he was laid-back and ... casual. Easygoing. It didn\u2019t compute. He should terrify her, and in some ways he did. And yet the idea of him being in her cottage even for a little while sent waves of relief down her spine.</p><p>\u201cHe saved you, dumbass,\u201d she muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s the rescue syndrome. You feel safe because he saved your ass.\u201d</p> <p>And now she\u2019d invited him in. To her house. To a place she should feel safe. Idiot.</p><p>Her hands shook and nausea rose, sharp and overwhelming. She looked at the door to her cottage and then back down the beach where Garrett had disappeared. Then making a decision, she hurried up the steps, ducked into the cottage and closed the door behind her. She leaned heavily on it, her heart slamming against her chest like a fist.</p><p>She pried open one eye to see Patches on the couch watching her as she bathed a paw. Sarah walked over to the couch and collapsed beside the cat. Her bag hit the floor with a thump and she sat there, head turned up so she stared at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess, kitty. One big ball of mess. I can\u2019t live like this.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked her eyelids and she blinked, refusing to let even one fall. The time for crying was over. It didn\u2019t do anything other than bring back the feeling of abject helplessness.</p> <p>The knock on the door startled her. She shook her head at her idiocy. It was just Garrett. Garrett, who she was supposed to have waited for on the porch. Garrett, who she\u2019d agreed to have dinner with.</p><p>She sat there for a minute, indecision wracking her mind.</p><p>\u201cSarah, it\u2019s me, Garrett. Can you come grab one of these bags?\u201d</p><p>The request acted like a slap in the face. She lurched to her feet and hurried over to open the door, forgetting that she planned to hide in the house and ignore him when he came over. Yeah, that was mature.</p><p>She swung the door open to see him looming in the doorway, his arms full. She reached for the bag on top, which leaned precariously, and pulled it away. She stepped back but he didn\u2019t make a move to enter. He just looked at her while she fidgeted like a moron.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she invited, stepping back again.</p> <p>He smiled and walked past her. \u201cMind if I put these on your table?\u201d</p><p>She hurried around him to put her own bag down. \u201cNo, go right ahead. Whatever you need. The fridge is over there.\u201d She pointed at the obvious and then felt ridiculous. \u201cOf course it\u2019s there. Hard to miss.\u201d</p><p>Garrett plopped the stuff down on the table and then turned to her. His expression was serious but he didn\u2019t make a move toward her. \u201cRelax, Sarah. You don\u2019t have to be nervous. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with me being here, I can go. No problem.\u201d</p><p>Was this guy for real? He was so calm and ... unthreatening. Which, God, she needed. She couldn\u2019t do threatening right now. She needed something sturdy. Something to believe in even if just for the space of a dinner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d she said in a cracked voice. \u201cI want you to stay. That is, if you still want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is for you not to be afraid. I want you to feel safe.\u201d He took one step toward her but hesitated as if testing her willingness to let him close. Then he touched her jaw\u2014just a fingertip. But she felt it all the way to her soul. \u201cYou\u2019re safe with me, Sarah. I\u2019m not going to let anyone hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Coming from anyone else, the statement would be melodramatic and corny. But he didn\u2019t so much as blink when he made the declaration. He was dead serious, and the thing was, she totally believed him. She wanted to believe him.</p><p>She stood there, not flinching away from his touch. It was ... nice. Comforting on a deeper level she didn\u2019t quite understand. It had been a long time since she\u2019d taken so much pleasure in a man\u2019s touch. Just the simple gesture, the brush of his fingers. It touched something inside her that had been paralyzed with fear for so long.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she blurted. \u201cAre you real? Or did I conjure you up?\u201d</p><p>He looked startled by her question. He cocked his head to the side and then emitted a soft chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t know about me, but the food\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>She peered curiously at the bags on the counter. \u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d</p><p>He turned and open up one of the sacks and pulled out a package of steaks. \u201cI thought we\u2019d start with a little meat, progress to more meat and finish with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. More meat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m a growing boy. Need my protein.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and then frowned when her gaze lighted on his shoulder. \u201cHow did you hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one brow and leaned his hip against the counter.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cI watched you from the window. It seems to bother you when you\u2019re exercising.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a wry smile. \u201cYeah, I might have met with the wrong end of a bullet.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cIs either end of a bullet good?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he stared at her and then he threw his head back and laughed. \u201cOkay, you totally got me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say some bad people were trying to hurt someone I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd shot you in the process? You look military. Were you in the army?\u201d</p><p>He visibly shuddered. \u201cArmy? Hell no.\u201d</p><p>She studied him through narrow eyes. \u201cMarine? You used to be a Marine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Marine,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re still enlisted then? Are you on leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure do ask a lot of questions. I feel like I\u2019m playing volleyball.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cSorry. I get carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay. And no, I\u2019m not enlisted anymore. But we don\u2019t exactly call ourselves former Marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Once a Marine ...\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She pursed her lips, ready to ask another question then thought better of it. He smiled. \u201cYou can ask. I was only kidding about you asking so many questions. Well, not kidding, but I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully laid-back,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at her in astonishment and then laughed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh man, I gotta tell my brothers you said that. They\u2019d kill themselves laughing. They think I\u2019m the most uptight son of a bitch who ever lived.\u201d</p><p>Shock widened her eyes. \u201cReally? But you seem so easygoing. So ... calm.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand through his mussed hair and grinned ruefully. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the downtime. I haven\u2019t exactly taken any in ... well, forever. Kind of hard to be uptight when all you can see for miles is beach, water and blue skies.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her hands up her arms, drawn to the image he painted. Peace. That was the word that seemed to personify him. Longing welled like a giant wave, falling over her until it was all she could process. What would she do for peace? True peace. The kind that settled into your bones and invaded your veins until contentment ached bittersweet.</p><p>She\u2019d sell her soul to own even a little part of the peace that seemed to surround him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I envy you,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>Their gazes connected and his blue eyes flickered, just a hint of reaction in their depths. He didn\u2019t respond. Didn\u2019t offer some hokey sentiment. He just watched and studied her as if no words were needed because he understood. She shook her head to rid herself of the ridiculous thoughts dancing around in her head. How could he understand anything when he was a complete stranger?</p><p>She turned away, no longer able to look into his eyes, into so much warmth. He made her stupid. Completely and utterly stupid. He\u2019d get no free passes just because he saved her. Her gratitude? Yes. She was extremely grateful, and not just for rescuing her, but for going beyond that to make her feel safe.</p><p>Mentally, she put about six feet of distance between them. When she turned back around, her lips were set into a firm line. \u201cDo you want me to make a salad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Would ruin the whole effect. You can season the meat though, while I go out and fire up the grill.\u201d</p><p>Relieved to have something to do and that he was leaving the room for a bit, she nodded and went to retrieve spices from the small pantry. By the time she returned to the table, Garrett had disappeared out the front door. She heaved a sigh of relief and sagged against the counter.</p><p>Never before had she had such a confusing reaction to a man. Garrett terrified her and yet he made her feel as though nothing could hurt her as long as he was near. She feared allowing him too close, and yet she didn\u2019t want him to leave.</p><p>She smiled when she saw that in addition to the steaks, he\u2019d brought over chicken breasts and pork chops. He hadn\u2019t been kidding when he\u2019d suggested a three-course meat dinner. As much as he worked out and as muscled as he was, he probably had to consume a gazillion calories in a day. And lots and lots of protein.</p><p>She liberally seasoned the meat and then washed her hands in the sink. As she gazed out the window overlooking the porch, she saw the fire blazing in the small grill. Garrett stood watching the flames and when they finally died down, he closed the lid and started back toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cWant to sit out on the porch while the meat cooks?\u201d he asked when he returned to the kitchen.</p><p>The idea was instantly appealing. She\u2019d spent most of her time watching the ocean from the safety of her cottage. But sitting outside, smelling the air, feeling the ocean breeze on her face sounded wonderful. She wouldn\u2019t be vulnerable and alone. She had Garrett.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful.\u201d She even managed to smile as she said it.</p><p>Suddenly eager to be outside and enjoy an afternoon of freedom, she rummaged in the sack for the still-cold beer. She held up three bottles, all different, and raised a questioning eyebrow in his direction.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cPick one. I\u2019m not particular.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and put one down on the counter. The rest she shoved into her fridge for later. Garrett picked up the beer and returned her questioning look.</p><p>\u201cNot having one?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a beer person, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>There was a lot in that one little word and her gaze sharpened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ah. You look more like a wine person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side and studied her. \u201cYou have this refined, elegant look about you. I bet you enjoy classical music, going to the opera, fine wine and fancy food.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a snob?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise. \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t know you. Just a guess. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, yes and no. I do love classical music, but can honestly say I\u2019ve never been to an opera nor do I particularly desire to go. I do enjoy wine. White only. But as for food, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a burger-and-fry kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Garrett clutched his chest with his free hand and staggered back. \u201cBe still my beating heart. You\u2019re speaking my language. I make a mean hamburger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m elegant and refined? Is that a veiled insult?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo. I like elegant and refined. You look ... classic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell thank you. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was totally a compliment. You\u2019re a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated under his scrutiny and she looked away, suddenly self-conscious. She\u2019d all but fished for the compliment and now she was embarrassed by how obvious she\u2019d been.</p><p>Garrett reached around her for the platter of meat. \u201cCan you get the door? I wouldn\u2019t want to drop my beer.\u201d</p><p>Sarah chuckled. \u201cOh the horror.\u201d</p><p>She moved ahead of him to open the door and they both walked out onto the sun-warmed porch. It was an incredibly beautiful day. One she hadn\u2019t had the chance to fully appreciate once her trip into town ended in disaster. She perched on the steps while Garrett put the meat on to cook.</p><p>A few seconds later, he sat next to her, stretching his long, tanned legs down the steps. He took a long swallow of his beer and sighed.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much better than this.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to agree but couldn\u2019t really. In other circumstances, yeah, this was truly paradise. She made a sound that could be construed as agreement and he glanced sideways at her as he lowered his beer.</p><p>\u201cSo what were you in town for this morning? Did you need something? I can always run back in for you.\u201d</p><p>Surprised by his thoughtfulness, she shook her head. \u201cI went by the bookstore to pick up a few books. I dropped them when the idiot attacked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t even see them. I was too focused on you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.

If I ever get the courage to leave my cottage again.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to where her hand rested on top of the step and covered it lightly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>When he left his hand there, she edged it sideways until her hand came free. She brought it up to her lap and laced her fingers into a tight ball. She tried to imagine how she might have responded to Garrett a year ago. Would she have encouraged him? Would she have flirted and flashed him playful smiles?</p><p>It was hard to remember acting so freely with a man. For the past year, she\u2019d been consumed with self-preservation, and for her that meant avoidance. But avoidance hadn\u2019t done anything to stop the shame, the frequent anxiety attacks or the sleepless nights. There were days she couldn\u2019t remember what her life had been like before ...</p> <p>You can say it, Sarah. You were raped. You were violated. You were attacked by someone you trusted.</p><p>Her lips wouldn\u2019t form the syllables but it screamed through her head until she shook it from side to side to rid herself of the word, which was as brutal as the act.</p><p>And here she sat, next to a stranger. Someone she didn\u2019t know from Adam. Someone she didn\u2019t trust and knew nothing more than that he was here recovering from a bullet wound. If someone she had trusted could do something so horrible, how could she possibly believe that a complete stranger wouldn\u2019t do the same?</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>SENSING her tension, Garrett got up and needlessly went to turn the meat. He piddled at the grill longer than necessary and took the time to watch Sarah. He\u2019d made a mistake touching her, but found that he was unable to resist the urge to offer comfort. Comforting women was something entirely alien to him. That was something his brothers were far more adept at. He was lovey with Rachel\u2014okay, and now with Sophie. Maybe he wasn\u2019t a complete failure when it came to women, but it didn\u2019t mean he understood them either.</p> <p>What he did know of Sarah in turns pissed him off and made him hurt. There just wasn\u2019t an excuse for hurting a woman. Ever. It was the one thing designed to infuriate him above all else. And Sarah had been hurt. He knew it. He felt it. Saw it in her eyes every time she looked at him.</p><p>A normal guy would ask her questions. And he was supposed to be a normal guy. Most men would be curious about a woman like Sarah. They might even try to cozy up for a vacation fling. He blew out his breath, remembering that Resnick had all but suggested it. The problem was, he wasn\u2019t a normal guy. He was here on a job and he couldn\u2019t feign casual interest.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t supposed to know anything about Sarah, and a normal guy would be a little freaked out by her seemingly bizarre behavior. Garrett? He understood it. Only too well.</p><p>Still it might seem strange if he didn\u2019t try to pry a little.</p><p>He grunted under his breath. He hated this kind of shit. He didn\u2019t do undercover crap. That was more Sam\u2019s forte. He\u2019d much rather go in, blow the shit out of the bad guys then go home and have a beer.</p><p>Well, at least he had the beer covered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to grab another beer. You want anything?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him with those big eyes and his stomach tightened. Damn. He had to chill on this bizarre ... attraction. No matter what Resnick suggested, he wasn\u2019t going to try to get into a woman\u2019s pants just to get on her good side.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d she said.</p><p>He went inside and was greeted by Patches, who jumped onto the counter to watch as he pulled another beer from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cYou want some?\u201d he asked the cat.</p><p>She eyed him balefully then turned with a swish of her tail and proceeded to ignore him.</p><p>He shrugged. Typical female.</p><p>He walked back onto the porch and sat back down by Sarah. She didn\u2019t move away, which gave him an absurd thrill. He took a swig of his beer and stared out at the incoming waves.</p> <p>\u201cSo what brings you here? Vacation?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a startled look. Great. He\u2019d caught her off guard even though it was the most innocuous inquiry he could summon. Maybe she hadn\u2019t considered fielding such a question, but wasn\u2019t it something anyone would ask her? She wasn\u2019t going to blend in if she freaked every time someone got friendly with her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Vacation. Needed some time away.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI hear that. Where you from?\u201d</p><p>She was growing more uncomfortable with each passing second, but she managed to smile though it was so fake she could be one of those beauty pageant queens whom Donovan liked to watch on television.</p><p>\u201cAll over, actually. I moved a lot as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I lived in pretty much the same place my entire life. Except when I was in the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Where\u2019s home?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss the obvious way in which she turned the tables on him or her evident relief that she\u2019d avoided his original question. But he went with it. He could play the dumb tourist as well as anyone.</p><p>\u201cTennessee. Little town on Kentucky Lake. My entire family lives there.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt sounds nice. You have a big family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. There\u2019s my mom and dad. I have five brothers. I\u2019m second oldest. I also have two sisters-in-law, one of whom is ready to pop out a kid any day now. Then there are my mom\u2019s adopted chicks. Her most recent find is a surly-ass teenage girl who she\u2019s determined to keep on the straight and narrow. My brothers and I have given up and wished Ma luck.\u201d</p><p>Sarah chuckled. \u201cAren\u2019t all teenage girls surly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re all deranged, if you ask me.\u201d He glanced sideways at her. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>A slight grin flirted with the edges of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I was deranged at sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass. I meant what about your family?\u201d</p><p>Her expression became more pensive. \u201cI grew up in foster homes.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably. He already knew that but he wasn\u2019t supposed to and now he had to sit here and play dumb. He was dying to ask her about Lattimer, and why, if she was his sister and he was so protective of her, had she grown up without all the benefits he had? Instead he offered a lame reply that said he didn\u2019t really know what to say at all.</p><p>\u201cOuch. That had to be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad. But it did involve a lot of moving. Most placements were temporary until something more permanent came along. The problem was that the permanent situations never were ... permanent.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted in sympathy. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was abused. I had food and clothes. A place to live. There were a lot of children far less fortunate than I was. I don\u2019t spend my adult life lamenting my childhood. I had some good times.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that. He liked her attitude. Shit happens and you deal. Only second to the Kelly motto, in his mind. No one fucks with the Kellys.</p><p>\u201cSo how long are you here for?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Extended vacation then. Must have really needed this one. Stressful job?\u201d</p><p>Tension snaked across her face. \u201cI\u2019m sort of taking a breather right now. I\u2019m thinking of a career change. Maybe something a little less ... stressful, as you put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny ideas yet?\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully. \u201cNo. Not really. Maybe teaching. Something with kids. I\u2019m kind of tired of adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, and you think teaching\u2019s less stressful? My mom and my sister-in-law used to teach. I never figured out how they survived that with their sanity intact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re scared of children too?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cNot scared. Cautious. Maybe a little apprehensive. Okay, terrified. I mean, they\u2019re terrorists disguised as cute little people.\u201d</p><p>She laughed that full throaty laugh that sent a shiver up his spine. Damn but she was beautiful when she laughed. She lit up like a Christmas tree and her eyes sparkled. Too bad he wasn\u2019t a humorous guy. He\u2019d give anything to make her laugh again.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t that bad. They just need attention. And love. Just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone else doesn\u2019t puke on you. Or rub their snot on your shirt.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what antibacterial wipes are for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry full-body armor,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cA big muscled out guy like you, terrified of women and children. What a wimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He pressed the cold bottle against the bare skin of her leg and she yelped as she slid away. \u201cNo need to get personal.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again and God if he didn\u2019t get all gooey inside. She was right. He was a first-class pansy. He scowled and gave thanks his brothers weren\u2019t here to give him shit.</p><p>\u201cBetter check the steaks. It\u2019s a sin to burn good meat.\u201d</p><p>He hoisted himself to his feet and made it a point to \u201caccidentally\u201d get her with the cold bottle again. She giggled and pushed herself up as well. She followed him toward the grill and sniffed appreciatively when he propped open the lid.</p><p>\u201cSmells great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just needs another minute or two. Want to grab plates and eat out here?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over to the small patio table with the umbrella that tilted precariously to one side. \u201cYeah, that sounds great. I\u2019ll get the stuff and set the table.\u201d</p><p>They ate in companionable silence as dusk settled over the water. The skies faded from the brilliant blue of earlier, and shades of pink and gold spread like gossamer wings over the horizon. There was something to be said for this whole R and R thing. Not that he\u2019d ever admit it to his brothers. But damn if he wasn\u2019t enjoying himself. And the company.</p><p>When they pushed aside their plates, neither made a move to get up, and he was content to follow her lead. He settled back in his chair as the water turned dark with impending nightfall. The moon was barely visible as it crept over the horizon. It was nearly full and in two nights it would be, but it was still bright as it splashed across the surface of the ocean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept you far too long,\u201d Sarah said, breaking the silence. There was a note of discomfort in her voice, not that she\u2019d spent the time with him, but a hesitancy that signaled her regret for what she considered an inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cI had a good time. You\u2019re great company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d she said after a pause. \u201cI had a good time too.\u201d</p><p>The tone of her voice suggested that fact surprised her. And it probably did. Kind of tough to relax for a few hours when you\u2019re looking over your shoulder at every turn.</p><p>He rose and began collecting the plates, but she reached over and put her hand on his wrist. Cool soft fingers and yet they burned his skin like coals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cYou already did so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and released his wrist. He wanted to take her hand back so she kept touching him. He liked her hands. Small and so dainty and feminine. She had slender fingers with tapered nails. And the pads of her fingertips were smooth and infinitely soft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, and again, thank you for doing so much to make me feel better. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He wondered what she\u2019d do if he told her he wanted to kiss her. Not that he would. Tell her, that is. If he was going to kiss her, he\u2019d want her to have no warning. No time to think. But he didn\u2019t want to scare the hell out of her either. So he stood there, watching her mouth and wondering what she\u2019d taste like.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate, okay? I\u2019m just down the beach. And I mean anything. If you get scared, I\u2019ll come over. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment she simply stared at him, her heart in her eyes. They gleamed shiny in the soft moonlight and her lips were drawn almost as if she were in pain.</p><p>\u201cI stopped believing they made men like you,\u201d she said in a voice that made him ache. \u201cThank you for proving me wrong.\u201d</p><p>He almost went back and kissed her anyway. It was the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done, but he turned and walked down the beach to his cottage. He stopped midway to look back and she was still standing there, moon splashing silver on her skin.</p><p>He lifted his hand in a wave and then traveled the rest of the way in the dark.</p><p>When he entered his cottage, he groaned as he caught sight of the sat phone where he\u2019d left it on the kitchen counter. Donovan was going to kill him. Better to get it over with sooner rather than later, and he was eager to hear what his brother had dug up on Sarah Daniels.</p><p>He dialed the number and waited as it rang. A moment later, a decidedly feminine voice bled over the line.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie? What the hell are you doing answering this line?\u201d Garrett asked. \u201cEverything okay there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Garrett.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStill pregnant, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She made a sound that came out as a grunt. Maybe he should have just kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Van?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep at the computer,\u201d his sister-in-law said. \u201cEthan and Rachel came over after you called earlier so he never went back to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is Rachel doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be doing well. She and Ethan went swimming. Sam wouldn\u2019t let me go. He said if I started to drown there wasn\u2019t a life preserver that would fit around me.\u201d</p><p>Garrett snorted. \u201cWhat an asshole. Want me to kick his ass for you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and Garrett smiled. \u201cRachel kicked him for me. I couldn\u2019t lift my leg that high without falling over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take good care of yourself and my niece. I\u2019ll expect a phone call the minute you go into labor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think the entire world will know when the day finally comes,\u201d she said tiredly. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think even elephants are pregnant this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor sweetie. Make Sam give you a foot rub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonovan is stirring and I need to wipe up the drool off the desk. Do you want to speak to him?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. Take care, okay?\u201d</p><p>Muffled sounds came through the phone and then Donovan\u2019s irritated growl and Sophie\u2019s laughter.</p><p>\u201cFor someone who was in such a goddamn hurry, you took your sweet time calling back.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett winced. \u201cSorry, Van. Something came up. You got anything for me?\u201d</p><p>Donovan sighed. \u201cActually, no. I\u2019ve been on it all afternoon. If something happened to her, it\u2019s not on record anywhere. I have a contact in Boston who is doing some more digging for me. He\u2019ll poke around her neighbors, acquaintances and coworkers to see what he can come up with but we have to be careful because she has a lot of damn people looking for her.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sighed. No record. Meaning whatever had happened to her went unreported. He wanted to put his fist through the wall. Had she been in an abusive relationship? Was she a victim of random violence?</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor, Van. Look up any past relationships. Boyfriends, casual dates, whatever. I need some blanks filled. Resnick either didn\u2019t tell us the whole story or he doesn\u2019t know it himself, which is hard to believe since he\u2019s such a meticulous bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you really looking for, Garrett? Help me out here. I need to know what I\u2019m searching for.\u201d</p><p>Garrett rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cI think she was attacked. Maybe raped. I feel pretty sure it was by someone she trusted. So I don\u2019t know if she was abused, if some guy she was with beat the hell out of her or sexually assaulted her. There\u2019s something going on here beyond her witnessing someone being murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Donovan muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>All of the Kellys had a strong protective urge when it came to women and children, but Donovan especially had a soft spot a mile wide for women and children. A lot of times it was to his detriment because he simply couldn\u2019t turn down a job if a child or a woman was in jeopardy. He was putty in a woman\u2019s hands. He adored women and they adored him. Garrett teased him that it was the geek that appealed to the \u201cfairer sex.\u201d But the truth of the matter was, Donovan was extremely intelligent and he was good to his toes. Women sensed that and they flocked to him like flies.</p><p>He was quieter than his brothers. He wasn\u2019t as big and broad shouldered as the rest. Often he was most comfortable taking a backseat to everyone else. He stood on the fringes and watched. As a result, Donovan had more dirt on people than Garrett could imagine.</p><p>And there wasn\u2019t anyone else Garrett would rather have at his back.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, that bullshit Resnick spouted ... You can\u2019t go in like that if some son of a bitch hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Garrett controlled his irritation because he knew Donovan was doing what Donovan did best. Looking out for the woman. \u201cI know that, Van. Sarah ... She\u2019s vulnerable right now. She needs a friend. I intend to be that friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you need me, okay? I can be over there in a day. In the meantime, I\u2019ll do some more digging and let you know what I find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Van. Now go get some sleep. You sound like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned and cut the connection. He rubbed the back of his neck, fingers digging into the base of his skull. He was tired and right now a hot shower sounded better than sex. He needed to get to bed and get some rest because he had an early morning errand to run the next day. Preferably before Sarah had a chance to get up and around.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>SARAH opened her eyes to sunlight streaming through her window. She blinked the grogginess away and turned to look at the clock. Sure she hadn\u2019t seen the numbers correctly, she shoved to her elbow and squinted to get a better look. Ten A.M.? Holy cow.</p><p>Pathches jumped onto the bed and eyed her suspiciously. Usually Sarah was the first out of bed and the cat always protested being moved from her warm spot.</p><p>Sarah flopped back onto her pillow and stared up at the ceiling. The cat rubbed against her side and purred loudly. Sarah put her hand down to rub the animal\u2019s ears and received a delicate meow in thanks.</p><p>It was the most she\u2019d slept since arriving. Most nights she was lucky to get in a few hours. Her dreams haunted her, and at times she refused to close her eyes because she\u2019d do anything to keep the demons at bay.</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d managed not only an entire night\u2019s sleep, but she\u2019d slept well past daybreak into midmorning. She stretched and then cuddled deeper into her covers. It was then she realized that some of her sense of panic was gone. Anxiety had been ever present for months, so much so that she couldn\u2019t remember what her life had felt like without it. This morning she felt remarkably ... light.</p><p>She lay there for another half hour, simply enjoying the peace. The growl of her stomach finally forced her into the bathroom to take a quick shower. When she was done, she wrapped a towel around her head and headed into the kitchen.</p><p>She put on a pot of coffee to brew and stared out the window as it bubbled and hissed. The water was so blue it almost hurt her eyes to look at it. The sun bounced off the surface and reflected like a million tiny diamonds. There wasn\u2019t a single cloud in sight although the talk in town the day before had been a storm system expected through by the evening.</p><p>As the coffeemaker hissed its last, she removed the pot and poured a cupful of the savory brew. It was too perfect a morning to waste indoors. Sitting on her porch with a cup of coffee sounded heavenly, and maybe she\u2019d see Garrett.</p><p>Heat tingled her cheeks and she shook her head. She was acting like a giddy teenager crushing on her first boy. Still, she smiled as she opened her front door. Her gaze was drawn to the water and she nearly tripped over something in the doorway. She stumbled and her coffee sloshed over the rim. She righted herself, put down her coffee on the window ledge and then looked down to see a basket sitting on her porch.</p><p>Astonished, she knelt to find two bottles of white wine and the books that she\u2019d dropped in the alley when she\u2019d been attacked. She lovingly stroked the spines of the paperbacks and pulled them away so she could see each of the titles. There were even a few additions to the ones she\u2019d purchased. Next to the wine, were several chocolate bars and a folded note with her name on it.</p><p>Her chest was so tight and she was smiling so big her cheeks ached. With shaking fingers, she opened the note.</p><p>I\u2019m told no woman can resist wine, books and chocolate.</p><p>Enjoy your day.</p><p>\u2014G</p><p>She hugged the note to her and stared down at her goodies. He\u2019d gone and gotten her books! She was ridiculously touched by the notion of him making a special trip to retrieve her books and to buy her wine and chocolate.</p><p>Her eyes were suspiciously watery as she rose and hoisted the basket into her arms. Her coffee forgotten, she set the basket on the patio table and began going through the assortment of paperbacks. After settling on the one she wanted to read first, she hurried back inside to set the wine to chilling in the fridge. She added the chocolate so it wouldn\u2019t melt and then returned outside to her book.</p><p>After an hour, she went back inside to prepare lunch. The wine was cold and she poured a glass to have with her meal. She took her time, actually enjoying the food as the sun soaked into her skin. Today ... she was in no hurry today. The events of the previous day melted away and she savored the freedom to just ... enjoy.</p><p>She dozed off with a book propped on her chest, her feet resting in the chair opposite her. A fat raindrop hit her square in the forehead, startling her from her slumber. Her eyes flew open to find the sky vastly changed. Instead of the sheer blue canvas, angry thunderheads had rolled in, billowing in the sky like giant mushroom caps.</p><p>It was dark and shadows fell over the beach, turning the serene paradise into something sinister. The water rolled and frothy wave caps blew over the surface, rolling onto the beach and spreading over the sand.</p><p>She put her feet down and stretched her aching muscles. After collecting her wineglass and book, she retreated indoors. Disappointment nagged at her. She hadn\u2019t seen Garrett even once.</p><p>Garrett stood at his window and watched as Sarah went indoors. He\u2019d been on the verge of going over there himself to wake her before the storm kicked up too bad. She\u2019d been sleeping the entire afternoon, and he\u2019d watched over her from afar.</p><p>He\u2019s purposely stayed away today to give her time to process the evening they spent together. He wanted her trust and found that he was willing for things to progress as slowly as necessary to achieve that goal.</p><p>Lightning stabbed through the sky, flashing and illuminating the rolling sea. Thunder echoed in the distance. The storm was moving fast and getting closer with each passing second.</p><p>He turned away and let the curtain fall. He loved a good thunderstorm. It was a perfect evening to kick back with a beer and listen to the rain.</p><p>Soon the rain picked up and fell with steady rhythm. It beat against the tin roof of the cottage with a muted roar. Just the sound made him yawn; lethargy stole over him, turning his muscles to jelly.</p><p>He slouched on the sofa and kicked his legs up. Of course as soon as he got comfortable, the sat phone beeped. He raised his head and glared across the room to where it lay on the on the chair by the window.</p><p>Grumbling the entire way, he pushed himself up and went over to snag the phone.</p><p>\u201cThis better be good,\u201d he said as he sank back onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cThis coming from the asshole who woke me up twice?\u201d</p><p>Garrett chuckled. \u201cI was comfortable, man. Just laid down on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Donovan made a derisive noise before continuing. \u201cDo you want what I got or what?\u201d</p><p>Garrett sat up, suddenly very serious. His stomach knotted and he sucked in a deep breath. Yeah, he wanted to know but then again he wasn\u2019t sure he did. He sighed. \u201cYeah, hit me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah Daniels leads a very ordinary life, lives in a very ordinary apartment. No one has a single bad word to say about her. As far as I can tell there are no recent boyfriends. No medical records other than a few routine check-ups. I\u2019m trying to get the actual reports now but it\u2019ll take some time. She\u2019s been jobless for months. She has conservative spending habits but her bank account isn\u2019t hefty so she\u2019s getting support from somewhere. My bet is Lattimer. But in short, she\u2019s normal. She\u2019s disgustingly perfect.\u201d</p><p>No. Not perfect. Broken. And infinitely fragile.</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath. \u201cThen what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re misinterpreting things, Garrett. She witnessed a murder. She\u2019s either scared of her brother. Or she\u2019s trying to protect him. That\u2019s a lot of shit to deal with. Of course she\u2019s jumpy.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. Yeah, she was scared, and she was cautious, but there was more to it. Garrett wasn\u2019t wrong about this. He\u2019d touched her. He\u2019d felt her tension. Saw the grief and the pain in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wrong about this, Van.\u201d</p><p>Donovan sighed. \u201cThe thing is, if she was attacked but never reported it, she probably didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not even those closest to her. Unfortunately a lot of crimes against women go unreported.\u201d</p><p>Garrett cursed, knowing that Donovan was right. If Sarah had been hurt, there was a distinct possibility that the only person who knew anything of it ... was her. And the son of a bitch who attacked her.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cThis is complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep digging. If I come up with anything, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. How is Sophie doing? And have you talked to Rachel?\u201d</p><p>Donovan chuckled. \u201cTrust you to want to know about the women.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scowled. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to go by and see Rachel before I left. I just want to make sure she\u2019s doing okay. I worry about her. And Sophie. She looked about fourteen months\u2019 pregnant when I left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re on speakerphone,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>Garrett winced. \u201cOh fuck. She didn\u2019t hear that, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have just started crying, and Sam is threatening to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrying?\u201d Hell. He\u2019d need to send chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate. Pregnant women were demented.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m joking,\u201d Donovan said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel is doing fine. She\u2019s called at least once a day to ask if we\u2019ve heard from you.\u201d</p><p>Garrett went soft on the inside. He loved Rachel to pieces. Always had. The idea that she worried about him made him feel a little mushy.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sophie has slowed down, much to mine and Sam\u2019s relief. Today she spent on the couch with her feet propped up while Sam fussed over her. She\u2019s tired and I think if she doesn\u2019t deliver soon, Sam\u2019s going to have a kitten. He\u2019s already threatened to kick the doctor\u2019s ass if he doesn\u2019t induce her.\u201d</p> <p>As much as he dearly loved his sisters-in-law and his family, right now he was grateful to be away from Sam. The man was a bit touchy when it came to his wife and until she delivered safely, Sam was going to be a complete basket case.</p><p>\u201cHow is Dad? Is he taking it easy?\u201d</p><p>Donovan laughed. \u201cMom and Rusty are driving him insane. He\u2019s called over here at least twice a day, begging for one of us to go rescue him. They won\u2019t let him eat what he wants to eat. They won\u2019t let him work for more than a few hours at the hardware store.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned at the image of his burly father being bullied by the women in the family. That was the way it usually went. Marlene Kelly was ruthless when she put her mind to something. She kept her husband and all six of her sons on a straight line and it was pointless to resist.</p><p>Ever since his dad\u2019s heart attack months before, she\u2019d kept him on a tight leash and ruled with an iron fist.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Beavis and Butthead? They still off on some supersecret mission for Uncle Sam?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, about them.\u201d</p><p>A prickle of alarm shot up Garrett\u2019s spine. His youngest brothers were still active military, and he worried about them constantly. \u201cUh-oh. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing bad,\u201d Donovan hurried to say. \u201cJoe called Sam yesterday. Said he and Nathan weren\u2019t re-upping and wanted to know if they could work for KGI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh,\u201d Garrett said with a snort. Relief lessened the pressure in his chest. Not that KGI was a cakewalk. They handled their fair share of dangerous assignments, but he\u2019d much prefer to have all his brothers right in front of him where he could watch their backs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what Sam said. They\u2019re bugging out again in a week. Joe didn\u2019t say where, which bothers me. He usually at least has a location for me. Tells me it isn\u2019t good. But when this tour\u2019s up, they both want to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa will be beside herself,\u201d Garrett said dryly.</p><p>Donovan chuckled. \u201cAll her chicks in one spot for more than a week or so? That hasn\u2019t happened since Sam was a senior in high school. She\u2019ll drive us all insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Donovan agreed. \u201cIt will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay enough chitchat. I gotta go. I have a date with the couch,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cKiss the sisters-in-law for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flipping you the bird right now,\u201d Donovan grumbled.</p><p>Garrett grinned and tossed the sat phone onto the coffee table. The rain still beat the roof and flashes of lightning went off outside the windows like strobe lights. The rumble of thunder acted like a sedative, luring him into the promise of a nice long sleep.</p><p>He yawned. He should probably go to bed. But that would require moving.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>THE next morning, Sarah stood on her porch and stared over the debris-ridden beach and watched frothy waves foam onto the shore. Palm leaves, tree branches and an assortment of driftwood sprawled across the sand, remnants of last night\u2019s storm.</p><p>The skies were clear this morning and a light breeze lifted her hair and blew over her face as she stood gazing over the water. She was trying to work up the nerve to go back into town. Alone. Without asking for Garrett\u2019s help.</p><p>During the night as she lay listening to the wind and rain, she\u2019d decided she wanted to do something to repay his kindness and understanding. He\u2019d cooked her dinner and he\u2019d retrieved her books, not to mention gave her chocolate and wine. That deserved something in her mind, and she was through being a ninny around him.</p><p>If she was going to spend all this time laying low, she was at least going to enjoy herself.</p><p>Now she just had to conquer her fear of returning to town alone and she\u2019d be set. She took a deep breath and stepped onto the sand. Meat and beer were obviously the way to Garrett\u2019s heart, but she was going to throw in something sweet as well.</p><p>She lugged her laptop bag over her shoulder and started at a fast clip down the beach before she changed her mind. While she was in town, she\u2019d check her email and send Marcus reassurance so he didn\u2019t get edgy and come after her. Surely he realized the necessity for them to stay as far away from one another as possible.</p><p>As long as she kept quiet and away from Boston, everything would be fine. She\u2019d never risk running into Stanley Cross again. Allen was gone\u2014a fact she couldn\u2019t bring herself to feel any regret over. Just that Marcus had been the one to do the deed. She should have left Boston a long time ago, but she\u2019d stayed locked in her apartment, terrified to go out. Terrified to live.</p><p>Well, that was over. It was time to regain control of her life. Even if it was here on this island. It wasn\u2019t as if she wasn\u2019t used to being uprooted and having to adjust all over again. She\u2019d spent her life moving and adjusting.</p><p>She hit the caf\u00e9 first. Enjoyed a cup of coffee while she checked her email. Her heart sped up when she saw a new one from Marcus.</p><p>Let me know you\u2019re okay.</p><p>She typed a quick response assuring him she was fine. She even made her response a little wordier than she had in previous emails. She made it sound like she was taking an extended vacation. And maybe she was. Who was to say she wasn\u2019t?</p><p>After packing up her laptop, she drained the rest of her coffee and headed toward the market. Remembering Garrett\u2019s tastes, she chose a small brisket, large baking potatoes and all the fixings. She preferred salad with meat courses but Garrett obviously didn\u2019t waste stomach space on lighter fare like lettuce and tomatoes.</p><p>She studied the array of beer, frowning because she couldn\u2019t remember what kind Garrett had when he\u2019d come over. Deciding it didn\u2019t really matter, she chose three different brands and hauled them into her basket.</p><p>The small section that served as the bakery didn\u2019t have anything she thought Garrett would go for. It was all too froufrou and fruity, whereas she pictured him as more of a pure sugar guy.</p><p>Cake would have to do. She didn\u2019t have time to go all-out on something exotic and complicated. Not if she was going to invite him to dinner tonight.</p><p>She picked a mix and bought ready-made frosting even though she quivered at the sin of it all. Then she made her way to the check-out and paid for delivery of the heavy groceries to her cottage.</p><p>On her way home, she found herself humming. She actually stopped in the sand and grinned as she realized she had this ridiculous giddy thrill at the idea of seeing Garrett again. She hugged her arms and squeezed, so happy and grateful that the idea of having a man in her personal space didn\u2019t freak her out anymore.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if she considered herself miraculously cured. Obviously it couldn\u2019t be just any man. Garrett was different. He made her feel safe. And for the first time since her attack, she felt a stirring of interest in the opposite sex. For that alone, she\u2019d always be grateful.</p><p>She started back down the beach, a ridiculous smile plastered on her face. It was a good day. And it would only get better.</p><p>Two hours later, she stood on Garrett\u2019s porch and second-guessed her chirpy assertion that the day was so wonderful. Her hands were clammy, her mouth was dry and her heart was about to beat out of her chest.</p><p>Why was this so hard? She wasn\u2019t afraid of Garrett. She wasn\u2019t! It was though her psyche refused to cooperate and had hit the panic button in her brain. It was completely irrational, but then she\u2019d already acknowledged that fear was anything but rational.</p><p>More than a little pissed that panic was putting a serious damper on her good mood, she set her jaw and knocked briskly on the door. A moment later, Garrett opened the door and his eyes widened in surprise. That might have put her off but then he smiled broadly and she could see pleasure in his expression. Her heart jolted and did a funny flip.</p><p>He was only wearing swim trunks and she was afforded a prime, up-close view of his chest. The same chest she\u2019d drooled over from afar. He wasn\u2019t one of those polished, hairless, pretty boys with an even tan and skin as soft as hers. No, he was rugged, paler on his belly and chest than he was on his arms and face. And he was hairy. Not in a gross, man-wolf way. There was a smattering over his upper chest, enough to give him a rougher edge, and it tapered downward to a dark line to his navel and low enough to fire her imagination about what was beneath the band of those swim trunks.</p><p>Her face lit on fire and her cheeks were so tight, she thought she might explode. Whether from embarrassment or awareness, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Her gaze jerked up to the fresh scar on his shoulder. There were other scars. Much older. Some more faded than others. The one at his shoulder was still angry and puckered looking. He followed her stare and slid his palm over the scar.</p><p>She flushed guiltily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to stare. Well, I guess I did. I was curious. Sorry, though. Does it still hurt?\u201d And God, was she babbling. Like an idiot.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSome days more than others. Hey, I was about to go for a swim. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise and took a step back. \u201cSwimming?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered with amusement. \u201cYeah. You know, that thing you do in the ocean? In bathing suits usually, although I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. I mean, I came over to invite you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019d be happy to. But no reason we couldn\u2019t go for a swim first. Unless you\u2019re cooking a pig or something and have to start on it now.\u201d</p><p>He was totally ribbing her and she grinned as some of the panic melted away under the warmth of this smile. \u201cNo pig, but I did buy a fair piece of a cow.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his belly and sighed. \u201cYou do know how to tempt a man. So, how about that swim? I\u2019ll help cook after we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d she said with a shake of her head. \u201cYou did all the cooking last time. This time, you\u2019re going to sit on the deck with the beer I bought for you while I do all the cooking. I already baked a cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. You\u2019re spoiling me, woman.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks tightened again and the warmth spread into her chest. \u201cAnd yes, I think I would like to swim. I\u2019ll just go change and meet you back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll wait for you on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Sarah flew back to her cottage and rummaged through her things for the swimsuit she\u2019d purchased just a few days after arriving on the island. She hadn\u2019t used it yet. Not even once. But suddenly she was eager to feel the ocean.</p><p>It was a modest one-piece, and by modest, it covered everything. High-necked, broad shoulder straps and a skirt that fell midway to her knees. She felt like a granny, although she doubted many grandmothers wore suits this ugly.</p><p>Knowing she was about as attractive as a toad should have dimmed some of her enthusiasm, but she found she just didn\u2019t care. Garrett didn\u2019t seem to mind her odd behavior and her eccentricities. She was going to enjoy today if it killed her.</p><p>She mentally flipped Allen and Stanley Cross the bird as she trekked down the steps of her deck and onto the sun-warmed sand. Allen was already in hell, and Stanley could kiss her ass. If there was any justice in the world, he\u2019d join his brother there eventually.</p><p>As promised, Garrett waited in front of his cottage, a towel slung over his shoulder. She slowed as she approached and realized she\u2019d forgotten to bring one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d she said.</p><p>Garrett raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cI forgot a towel. I need to go back and get one.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo need. You can use one of mine. Let\u2019s hit the water.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to the ocean and the gorgeous canvas of blue that sparkled like a cascade of diamonds. \u201cIs it cold?\u201d</p><p>He gaped in exaggerated fashion. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know? You haven\u2019t been in yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warm. Feels pretty damn good. No crap on the bottom. Sand is smooth. No seaweed.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled up. \u201cWell, thank goodness there\u2019s no crap on the bottom. That would suck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He winked at her. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve waded through as much shit as I have, you tend to appreciate nice, clean water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast one in is a rotten egg,\u201d she yelled, just as she took off for the water.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you little!\u201d Garrett yelled. \u201cCheater!\u201d</p><p>She hit the water with a resounding splash. Garrett barged in behind her and promptly tipped her into the surf. She came up sputtering, hair in her face but grinning like an idiot.</p> <p>\u201cI won,\u201d she said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYou cheated.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and shoved at her bedraggled hair. \u201cAccording to my rules, I won.\u201d</p><p>Garrett laughed. \u201cI know better by now than to argue with a woman when it comes to rules.\u201d</p><p>She flopped back, rocking over the gentle swells as she stared up at the sky. \u201cYou were right. The water\u2019s great and no crap on the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>He turned over onto his back and spread out his arms as he floated lazily beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s good. I didn\u2019t think it would be. I was thoroughly prepared to hate it here.\u201d</p><p>Her brow scrunched up and she tried to glance over at him, but got a face full of water. \u201cWhy on earth did you come here then?\u201d</p><p>He went silent for a minute. \u201cLet\u2019s just say my family was leaning on me pretty heavily to take a vacation. They put me on a plane and here I am. I hate to admit it, but they were right. I needed the downtime. I feel almost a hundred percent again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>His fingers brushed hers as he stroked in the water. He snagged her finger, just one, but he held on, keeping that connection between them as they bobbed along with the waves. Here in a vast body of water, no one around for miles, she should have felt incredibly isolated and alone. She didn\u2019t. For the first time in a year, she felt a connection to another person. A man. It helped heal a little part of her soul. The part that wondered if she was doomed to forever lock herself away from other people.</p><p>After a while, Garrett tugged at her hand and pulled her closer. He flipped and treaded water beside her while she continued to float on her back. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p><p>She put her feet down and realized she couldn\u2019t touch bottom. She grabbed a hold of his arm and righted herself until she was keeping above the water along with him. \u201cYeah. Thanks. I am. It\u2019s ... peaceful out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty far from the shore now. Think you\u2019ll be able to make it back?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and gasped as she realized how far they\u2019d drifted from the beach. She swam decently enough, but that was a long way back.</p><p>He nudged her cheek with a wet knuckle. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about it. I didn\u2019t mention it to make you frown. All you have to do is hang on to my shoulder and float. I\u2019ll do all the work.\u201d</p><p>Just like he\u2019d been doing all along. Always helping her. Always shouldering the effort.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cGrab hold. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. Clearly you\u2019re in danger of starving to death with that body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like my body?\u201d</p><p>The devilish glint in his eyes was nearly her undoing. The man was incorrigible. And his family thought he was an \u201cuptight bastard?\u201d It didn\u2019t compute. Maybe his family didn\u2019t understand him, or maybe they were the uptight ones. She\u2019d never met a man as easygoing and understanding as Garrett.</p><p>She rolled her eyes at his fishing. \u201cYou know you have a great body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been checking me out,\u201d he said smugly.</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>He took her hand and slid it over a solid wall of muscle until her fingers were hooked over his shoulder. Damn but the man felt good.</p><p>\u201cHang on. Here we go.\u201d</p><p>With a kick he was off. She attempted to help for a while until she realized her flailing about was actually hindering him, not helping. So she concentrated on staying afloat and was content to go along for the ride.</p><p>When he had them close enough to the shore that he could stand, he stopped swimming and began wading forward while she still grasped his shoulder. He tentatively slid his fingers over the top of her hand and then reached back in a gesture for her to give him her other hand.</p><p>She kicked until she was behind him and no longer beside him and gave him her other hand. He pulled until her arms were looped around his neck and she was hugged up against his back. Then he continued forward, pulling them both effortlessly through the water.</p><p>The shallower the water got, the higher he rose from the water and the higher she had to reach. He stopped when he was a little over waist deep, patted her hands to show her she should still hold on and then he reached back to grasp her behind the knees. He hoisted her up and wrapped her legs around his waist and continued to forge ahead.</p><p>Okay, so she could totally stand right now, but she was enjoying the piggyback ride way too much to point out that she could make it on her own. She was wrapped around his hard body, and his big hands burned her thighs where he had hold above her knees.</p><p>He trudged out of the water and onto the sand, and still, he made no effort to put her down. He started down the beach toward her cottage. She rested her chin atop his head and sighed in contentment. She almost wished he\u2019d slow down just to make the ride last longer. But all too soon he reached her deck and he turned so he could deposit her on the bottom step.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. Now you don\u2019t have sand all over you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the sand caked on his feet and legs. \u201cWait right here. I\u2019ll get some water to rinse you off.\u201d</p><p>She hurried inside and filled a pitcher of water and then went back out where he was now sitting in one of the lawn chairs. He dutifully raised each foot for her to rinse and then plopped them back down onto the deck.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that discussion about towels, I left mine back on the beach,\u201d he said.</p><p>She blinked. A towel had been the last thing on her mind. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll run in and get us one. If you can wait just a few minutes, I\u2019ll go ahead and change before I come back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said lazily as he stretched his arms over his head like he was seeking the sun. He tucked his hands behind his head and closed his eyes, and for a long moment she was riveted to just how beautiful the man was. She was utterly fascinated by him. The idea that man with such hard edges and scarred body\u2014clearly the body of a warrior\u2014could also be so gentle and understanding simply astounded her.</p><p>Forcing herself away, she let herself into the house and hurried for her bedroom, where she stripped out of her suit. With a grimace, she glanced down to see that sand had accumulated in some interesting places.</p><p>She ducked into the bathroom, turned on the shower and stepped underneath the chilly spray. Shivering the whole time, she quickly rinsed the sand off and decided while she was at it, she\u2019d wash her hair.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later and feeling guilty for leaving Garrett for so long, she walked back onto the deck, towel in hand, to see him exactly as she\u2019d left him. Kicked back in the chair, head back, eyes closed and looking completely relaxed.</p><p>\u201cSorry I took so long,\u201d she said. \u201cI had sand everywhere so I showered.\u201d</p><p>He cracked one eye open and stared at her. \u201cYeah, sand in the sensitive parts is a bitch. It can cause some chafing issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ... do you want to use my shower? You probably have sand issues too.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah, I could use a quick rinse if you don\u2019t mind me staying in my swim trunks. Otherwise I can just run back over to my place and shower and change.\u201d</p><p>It made the most sense for him to just go home. It wasn\u2019t as if he were a long distance. But she hated the idea of him leaving. Even for just a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. You\u2019re welcome to my shower and towels. I only have girly soap. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just rinse if you can bear the smell,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to tell him he smelled so damn good that it would be a sin to use soap at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start dinner while you clean up.\u201d</p><p>He plopped his legs down and ambled into the cottage ahead of her. He disappeared into her bedroom and she went into the kitchen, so many butterflies scurrying around her belly she felt dizzy.</p><p>There was a man in her bedroom. In her bathroom. Taking a shower in her shower. Naked. Right now. She grinned. And she wasn\u2019t even running the other way, hyperventilating or otherwise freaking out. It was a start.</p><p>This might even constitute a date. An actual evening with a gorgeous specimen of a man.</p><p>She seasoned the brisket, washed the potatoes and put everything into the oven. Then she pulled out the three kinds of beer and her own bottle of wine and went out to the deck to wait for Garrett.</p><p>Just a few minutes later, he came out, barefooted and in his swim trunks and looking so delicious she wanted to lick him. He rubbed at his damp hair and then spotted the beer as he closed the glass door behind him.</p><p>\u201cOh hell, you didn\u2019t lie about the beer. I feel so honored that you bought it just for me.\u201d</p><p>She gestured toward the bottles. \u201cTake your pick. I had no idea what to get so I grabbed what I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks good to me. It\u2019s wet and cold. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>They sat enjoying the afternoon, her with her wine and him with his beer. The sun was settling over the western horizon, plunging the sky into vibrant shades of gold, pink and purple. The huge orange orb reflected and shimmered on the water, sending fingers of fire racing across the still ocean.</p><p>\u201cThis is my favorite time of day,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe sunsets are so beautiful here. They take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey remind me of home,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cMy brothers and I used to sit out on our back deck, drink a few beers after a long day and watch the sun go down over the lake. We haven\u2019t done that in a while. I\u2019m thinking when I get back home, we need to do it more often.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled. Then she remembered dinner. \u201cOh crap! I need to check the brisket!\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the house and was immediately surrounded by the scent of cooking meat. It smelled homey and delicious. More importantly, it didn\u2019t smell burnt. She took the casserole dish out of the oven and set it on the stovetop and then she reached in with an oven mitt and retrieved the two potatoes.</p><p>The brisket looked perfect. It needed to rest a few minutes so she put the potatoes on a platter along with butter, cheese and sour cream and carried it outside so Garrett could dress his potato while it was still hot.</p><p>Then she returned inside to prepare a small salad for herself, get more beer for Garrett and sliced the brisket and arranged it artfully on a chipped platter. Bumping the door open with her hip, she carried the food and drink outside and set everything on the table so they could eat.</p><p>\u201cIt smells wonderful,\u201d he said with an appreciative sniff.</p><p>\u201cWe need to eat quick or it\u2019ll cool too fast with all this breeze.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t ever dally when it comes to food.\u201d</p><p>She sat and they both dug in. Garrett put away a shocking amount of food, but then she\u2019d seen his exercise regime and it was clear he needed a lot of calories. By the time they\u2019d finished dinner, the sun was barely hanging in the distance and in the east, stars had begun popping in the darkening sky.</p><p>\u201cI have dessert,\u201d she said.</p><p>He visibly perked up at that.</p><p>\u201cChocolate cake. Chocolate frosting. I\u2019ll apologize in advance for the fact the frosting is store-bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not picky when it comes to sugar.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then hesitated. \u201cWould you ... Would you like to come inside and eat? The bugs will be bad if I turn on the outside light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She stood and began collecting the dishes. Garrett piled several up and followed her inside to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d she directed. \u201cI\u2019ll clean the mess later.\u201d</p><p>He settled his large frame on the other side of the bar and watched while she uncovered the cake and took out saucers. She cut a huge hunk for Garrett and a much smaller piece for herself and then slid his across the counter to him.</p><p>She opted to stand so they faced each other. In truth, she liked watching him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for today,\u201d she said.</p><p>He glanced up, his expression curious.</p><p>\u201cSwimming. I had fun. It was nice to just relax. The water is fantastic. Everything here is fantastic.\u201d</p><p>She tried hard to keep her tone light, speaking as anyone might on vacation, but she couldn\u2019t quite keep the wistful note from her voice. It was hard not to feel guilt or to allow herself to drop her guard even for a moment when the truth lingered so close to the surface. A man was dead and she was involved\u2014responsible\u2014even if she hadn\u2019t pulled the trigger herself.</p><p>Even now, there were probably any number of people looking for her. Marcus included, though she couldn\u2019t imagine him not being able to find her if he was set on it. She thought it likely he already knew of her whereabouts, but he was no fool. He had to know that it wasn\u2019t smart for her to be anywhere near him while Allen\u2019s murder was being investigated. His emails had gone from where the hell are you to asking her if she was okay. Yeah, he probably knew exactly where she was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stanley Cross was another matter. A shiver stole down her neck. He wasn\u2019t the type to sit idle and allow just the authorities to investigate his brother\u2019s death. He too would be looking for her and she was well aware of how ruthless he could be.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re thinking fantastic thoughts,\u201d Garrett broke in.</p><p>Startled, she settled her gaze back on him to see him watching her thoughtfully. \u201cSorry. Wandered off for a minute there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever it was, I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t a pleasant trip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what surprised her more. His blunt question or the fact that for a moment she had an overwhelming urge to unburden herself. She could just see the direction of that conversation. Garrett struck her as a black-and-white kind of guy. No shades of gray. And her entire situation was so murky that it would make swamp water look like the crystal Caribbean waters.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want to ruin what\u2019s been a perfect day,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>He stared intently into her eyes. \u201cEveryone needs somebody to talk to, Sarah. If you ever change your mind, I don\u2019t mind being that person.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, warmed to her toes by the sincerity in his tone. \u201cThank you, Garrett. You\u2019ve been so wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he countered. \u201cDinner was wonderful. Dessert was delicious. But the company was superb.\u201d</p><p>He rose as he said the last, and panic hit her. She nearly laughed. She wasn\u2019t panicking because he was here in her personal space. She was panicking because he was about to leave.</p><p>\u201cIt was the least I could do. You\u2019ve done so much for me, Garrett. I really can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAin\u2019t no thang. Maybe I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>It came out more as a question, and she realized he was leaving it up to her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. Maybe we could swim again.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the bar and cupped his hand over hers. Warm and slightly rough. The feel of his fingers over her skin was electric. Heat pooled in her belly and she was shocked by the instant reaction, that she was capable of responding. She wanted to run around the bar and hug him. She wanted to do a lot more than that, but she stood there, stock still, not wanting the moment to end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be around.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid away from hers and she curled her fingers, determined to keep the sensation alive for as long as possible. With a grin and a jaunty wave, he let himself out the door, leaving her in the kitchen to stare after him long after he\u2019d gone.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>THE next day another storm rolled in and by early afternoon, the skies were black and threatening and the wind blew in a ceaseless line from the water to shore. Sarah was vexed. She\u2019d woken up feeling alive and ready to roll. She\u2019d planned a trip into town for picnic supplies and then she was going to march over to Garrett\u2019s cottage and invite him to go swimming and have a late lunch.</p><p>Now she was stuck indoors watching it rain when she wanted to be outside. With Garrett.</p><p>Instead, she curled up with one of the books Garrett had bought her and she cracked open the last chocolate bar. Still, there was a niggling of hope that Garrett would pop over. At what point she\u2019d come to rely on his company, she wasn\u2019t sure, but he\u2019d crept in, slipped through her defenses and she found she quite liked it\u2014a lot. It was nice to have a friend. Someone she could let her guard down around even just for a little while.</p> <p>She ate some of the leftover brisket. Even cut a piece of the chocolate cake. Then she went back to her book, but unease had settled over her as the sky grew blacker and the wind blew harder. Eventually she gave up on trying to read when she figured out she\u2019d read the same page no less than a dozen times.</p><p>She walked back and forth between the front window, which overlooked the beach, and the side window, which afforded her a view of Garrett\u2019s cottage. Waves crashed on the beach with angry slaps and the water, which the day before had been aquamarine was now gray and ominous.</p><p>She was being fanciful and letting her anxiety have far too much control.</p><p>Then her lights flickered and her pulse ratcheted up about twenty beats per minute. She held her breath as the flickering stopped and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Her head pounded from all the stress. What she needed was some Tylenol and then she was going to bed and hoping for a better tomorrow. No reason she couldn\u2019t have that swim and picnic then.</p><p>She chased the medication down with a glass of water and then changed into her pajamas. Patches was waiting on the bed, having given up her perch beside Sarah on the couch at the first boom of thunder.</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d Sarah muttered as she crawled under the covers.</p><p>Patches gave her a bored look and began licking her paw.</p><p>\u201cThe least you could have done was keep me company.\u201d</p><p>Patches settled her chin flat on the mattress and closed her eyes to show Sarah how really impressed she was with her disdain. With a sigh, Sarah flipped off the lamp and snuggled under the sheets.</p><p>Sleep was a long time coming and when it did, it was fractured with images from the past blending with present circumstances. In her dream she was running and Stanley pursued her with a bloody knife. Even as she fought the dream, knowing it wasn\u2019t rational, she couldn\u2019t shake the veil of sleep so that the images would stop.</p><p>He called her name. It sounded like a crackly whisper. She frowned. He had a foreign accent. Stanley didn\u2019t have an accent.</p><p>She heard it again and this time her eyes flew open just as another boom of thunder exploded across the sky. She lay there, so still her chest barely rose and fell with her breaths. A creak sounded down the hall toward the kitchen.</p><p>She bolted from the covers, sending Patches scrambling from the bed. Oh God, oh God. How was she supposed to get out if someone was in her kitchen? Her gaze latched on to the rickety dresser she\u2019d shoved in front of the window. Not such a good idea in hindsight. Still, if she was quiet, she could push it aside enough that she could crawl out the window and run down to Garrett\u2019s cottage.</p><p>Who could possibly be after her? If it was the authorities, surely they wouldn\u2019t skulk around in her kitchen. They\u2019d bust in, arrest her and haul her away. But what if Stanley had sent someone after her?</p><p>The idea sent a chill snaking down her spine that nearly paralyzed her. She had to force herself to move, to overcome the panic spreading through her like a wildfire.</p><p>She inched the dresser away from the window, holding her breath and praying she wouldn\u2019t alert her intruder to the fact she was escaping.</p><p>The window slid upward with a groan. Sarah didn\u2019t wait to find out if her intruder had heard. She threw herself out the window and hit the ground below with a painful thud. She slipped in the mud as she struggled to her feet, put her hands down to catch herself and then threw herself forward again.</p><p>She hit the beach at a dead run, her feet bogging in the saturated sand. Rain beat down on her, slicking her hair and pajamas to her like a second skin. Her only thought was to get to Garrett.</p><p>A prickle of alarm went up Garrett\u2019s nape and tightened every hair on his head. His eyes flew open just seconds before his front door reverberated with fierce pounding. He came awake instantly, reached for the gun underneath the cushion and leapt to his feet.</p><p>He was halfway across the room when he heard Sarah\u2019s voice. \u201cGarrett!\u201d</p><p>He yanked open the door to see Sarah standing on his porch, soaked to the skin, her hair plastered to her face as water dripped from the ends. Before he could say or ask anything she launched herself at him.</p><p>She hit him square in the chest and he wrapped his arms around her to keep them both from going down. She shook violently against him and burrowed deeper as if seeking a way to bury herself completely in his protection. Her heart pounded against his chest, way too fast. As much as he wanted to stand there holding her, he had to find out what the hell had scared her so bad.</p><p>He maneuvered them inside and kicked the door shut behind her. Then he laid his gun down on the small table by the window and gently pried her away from his chest.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d He took her shoulders in his hands and forced her to look up at him. He couldn\u2019t tell if the wet was from the rain or her tears, but her eyes were huge and the pupils dilated. He touched her cheek and found her skin icy cold. She shivered underneath his touch and tried to push her way into his arms again. \u201cSarah,\u201d he said again. With more force this time. \u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>The blankness in her expression concerned him. The shaking hadn\u2019t stop and had in fact gotten worse as reaction seemed to settle in. She shook so hard that her knees buckled, and she would have gone down if he hadn\u2019t tightened his grip on her arms to keep her standing upright.</p><p>With a curse, he hauled her toward the couch and sat her down. He left her long enough to grab a blanket and then he wrapped it gently around her, gathering the ends under her chin so she would be warm.</p><p>Her lips quivered and she closed her eyes, her face crumpling. She lowered her head, and her shoulders hunched inward as if she was closing herself off from the world.</p><p>He sat beside her and pulled her into his arms, holding her against him so his warmth would bleed into her too-cold skin. Ignoring the fact that she was soaked, he tucked her head underneath his chin and smoothed a hand over her tangled, wet hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay now. I\u2019ve got you. I won\u2019t let anything hurt you. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled farther into his embrace, her arms leaving the confines of the blanket to clutch desperately at his waist. Finally he gave up on trying to keep her in one place and hauled her into his lap. He leaned back and reached with one arm to gather the blanket around the both of them.</p><p>Realizing he wasn\u2019t going to get a word out of her until some of the shock had receded, he concentrated instead on getting her warm and soothing some of the horrible fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he crooned as he stroked down her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. Take some deep breaths.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered against him and he tightened his hold until they were wound so tight around each other that his clothing soaked up all the wetness from hers.</p><p>Gradually her heartbeat slowed and he could no longer feel the erratic thump of her pulse. She raised her head, bumping his chin as she stared across the room at the table where his gun rested.</p><p>\u201cYou have a gun,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He winced. Trust her to notice that detail. She was probably one of those women who fainted at the sight of a weapon.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She raised herself off his chest to look into his eyes. \u201cCan I have it?\u201d</p><p>As what-the-fuck moments went, this one was one of the bigger ones. The thing was, she was dead serious. There was an earnestness to her gaze that said she really wanted him to give her his gun. Shit.</p><p>He touched her cheek and let his fingers trail down her jaw. He tugged at a wet strand that stubbornly clung to her skin and tucked it up over her ear. \u201cSarah, honey, tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and exhaled again. It came out as a staccato stuttering over her lips. \u201cSomeone was in my cottage. I heard him.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sat up, nearly upending her from his lap. He caught her arms and pulled her back against him, but he sat up straight, processing what she\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you get out? Did he hurt you? Tell me what happened. Everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI crawled out my window. I know I sound like the world\u2019s biggest coward, but all I could do was lie there, terrified. I had to make myself get up.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips across her hair in an unconscious gesture of comfort. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself, sweetheart. Fear can render even the most powerful person immobile. Now tell me the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pushed the dresser away from the window and crawled out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear the noise?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIn the kitchen. There was a creaking sound. Like maybe a cabinet opening. It was what woke me up. I thought I was dreaming it at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think maybe you were dreaming?\u201d</p><p>Her head popped back up and fire blazed in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy, Garrett. He was there. I heard him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. I believe you, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay there.\u201d It came out as a sob. \u201cOh God, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d She beat her fist against his chest and then her head fell forward onto his shoulder.</p><p>Garrett gathered her in his arms and rocked back and forth, murmuring soothing nonsense in her ear. She reminded him so much of Rachel, so broken and afraid. Sarah was teetering on the edge and he wondered if this would be the final straw in the tight grip she kept on her composure. Sooner or later she would break. No one could hold up under the strain for so long. Not with everything that had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay there,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou can stay here with me.\u201d</p><p>She went still against him and then she pushed herself away. It was then he knew she realized that she was close to him. Touching him. Allowing him to comfort her. Her initial terror had faded enough that the barriers had gone back up and she had returned to self-preservation mode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes became troubled and she edged backward, but for the first time, he forced the issue and kept a tight hold on her. He watched her closely for signs of true distress but what he saw was uncertainty. Not fear.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Sarah. I want you to stay here while I go check out things at your cottage.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head but he put a finger to her lips to staunch the denial.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want you to do is to take a hot shower while I\u2019m at your cottage. I\u2019ll bring back your things. You\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p> <p>She clutched at his hand, her cold fingers curling around his. \u201cGarrett, you can\u2019t! What if he\u2019s still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell he is.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her and set her over to the side and then he pulled the blanket up over her knees and tucked the ends around her neck.</p><p>\u201cPlease be careful,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my gun. I tend to shoot first and ask questions later. While I\u2019m gone I want you into a hot shower before you make yourself sick.\u201d He nudged her chin up with his fingers. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and he got up. She had more color in her cheeks now, and she seemed more cognizant of her surroundings. She\u2019d be fine while he checked things out. But he wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>\u201cWhen you go into the bathroom, I want you to lock the door. Don\u2019t come out until I get back and tell you it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again and he picked up his Glock as he headed toward the door. He turned as he stood in the open doorway and instilled enough force into his words that she\u2019d pay heed. \u201cGet on into the bathroom. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>SARAH pushed her face under the spray of the shower. Instead of going for hot and steaming, she\u2019d turned the cold on, determined to rid herself of the horrific fear that still crowded the edges of her mind. When she was no longer able to bear the icy water sluicing over her skin, she turned it to scalding hot.</p><p>She stood there, thawing out as steam rose in the tiny bathroom. She closed her eyes and let the spray cascade over her icy-cold skin, warming the blood that slugged through her veins. Was she going crazy? Had tonight been one big hallucination?</p> <p>No, there had been someone in her kitchen. In her house. She hadn\u2019t imagined it. She was too in tune with every sound her cottage made. She knew which boards creaked. Knew how the walls groaned when the wind blew too hard. The sounds she\u2019d heard had been an intruder and she\u2019d come awake instantly with the unshakable knowledge that she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>She stayed in the shower until she was completely waterlogged and sweat beaded her brow from the overwhelming heat. She was completely limber, and warmth had seeped deep to where the cold had captured her in its relentless grip.</p><p>She reached up to turn off the water and stood sucking in deep breaths for several seconds before she shoved the curtain aside and stepped onto a ratty mat. She grabbed one of the towels neatly folded on the shelf over the toilet and wrapped it around her. She took another and wound it tightly around her hair before unwrapping herself again to finish drying.</p><p>Remembering Garrett\u2019s instructions, she closed the lid to the commode and sank down and clutched the towel tightly around her. What was Garrett doing?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear it if something happened to him. What if she\u2019d sent him into a trap? What if whoever had been in her cottage was still there, waiting for her to return? If Garrett surprised him, Garrett could be hurt or killed. And she was stuck here. Alone.</p><p>She never should have let Garrett leave. They could have waited until morning when it was light and the storm had passed. Then she could go collect her things and get the hell out.</p><p>The time went by agonizingly slow. Unable to bear sitting, she stood and paced the impossibly small area. Two steps to the door. Two steps back to the toilet. Where was he?</p><p>She yanked the towel from her hair and ran her fingers through the damp strands, arranging it around her face. She still looked like a drowned, scared rat, but some of the wildness from her eyes had receded. Her pupils were normal size and color suffused her cheeks, probably thanks to the enormous heat from the shower.</p> <p>How long had it been? It seemed like an hour but maybe it had only been a few minutes. Still, she stayed where she\u2019d been told and kept the door locked. As much as not knowing frightened her, the idea of being vulnerable made her more so.</p><p>Her hair was nearly dry before she heard the footsteps down the hall. She held her breath and went completely still, her ears straining.</p><p>\u201cSarah, it\u2019s me, Garrett. I\u2019m back. You can open the door.\u201d</p><p>She deflated like a pricked balloon. For a moment she simply sat there, her relief so staggering she couldn\u2019t summon the energy to get up. Finally she stumbled to her feet and took the two steps to fumble with the lock on the bathroom door.</p><p>It swung open and Garrett stood there holding Patches. The cat was clearly not happy and was wet from the tip of her tail to her bedraggled ears. Garrett didn\u2019t look much better.</p><p>She whirled around and grabbed one of the dry towels and then took the cat from Garrett and held her close to her chest. Garrett extended his other hand, which held her bag. \u201cI packed your clothes. Get dressed and come into the kitchen. After I change, I\u2019ll get us something to eat and drink.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the bag at her feet and it was then she remembered she was only wearing a towel. And a very wet cat.</p><p>\u201cWant me to take Patches so you can dress?\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, she thrust the cat back at him, towel and all and held both arms over her chest so the other towel didn\u2019t slip. He backed out without a word and pulled the door shut behind him.</p><p>She hurriedly dressed, not paying attention to whether anything matched. She was anxious to hear what Garrett had found at her cottage. He hadn\u2019t seemed too ruffled so maybe her visitor was long gone.</p><p>She shoved everything back into her bag and hung the towels on the rack to dry. Not bothering with any of the toiletries Garrett had brought, she hurried out of the bathroom and back toward the living room.</p><p>Patches sat on the couch grooming herself, and Garrett was clanking around in the kitchen. She went in his direction, pausing in the doorway as she watched him pour two glasses of tea. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>He turned, tea in hand and extended it to her. She took the cold glass and cupped it between her hands as she sipped at the sweet brew.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cNothing? He was gone? I guess that\u2019s good. I worried about you going over there and surprising him,\u201d she babbled.</p><p>Garrett eyed her, a gleam of sympathy in his eyes. She didn\u2019t like that look. It was a precursor to something she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>She set her tea down on the counter and squared her shoulders. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Garrett grimaced and put a hand on her shoulder to guide her back into the living room. \u201cHoney, I didn\u2019t find any sign of an intruder.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around in agitation. \u201cWhat are you saying? Do you think I imagined it? You think I\u2019m crazy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cSit down and calm down.\u201d</p><p>Blinking at the force of his command, she unconsciously obeyed, sinking onto the couch beside Patches.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy, okay? All I\u2019m saying is that I couldn\u2019t find any sign that someone was in your cottage. But it\u2019s raining like a son of a bitch outside. Evidence could have washed away. I couldn\u2019t see very well, but I didn\u2019t find any sign that anyone had been inside your cottage. I\u2019ll be able to take a better look tomorrow. All I can tell you is that if there was someone there, he\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>Another crack of lightning flashed through the living room and the floor vibrated under Sarah\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine it. I couldn\u2019t have. Could I?\u201d Her voice cracked and the last word came out in a high, hysterical note.</p><p>Garrett sighed. He nudged her chin and stared into her eyes, the deep blue of his burning her with their intensity. \u201cListen to me, Sarah. I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t believe you. I\u2019m telling you what I found. Or didn\u2019t find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not your fault. God, I came over here like a lunatic. Woke you up. Made you go out in the rain to find some nonexistent intruder.\u201d She stood, knocking Garrett\u2019s hand from her face. \u201cI should go. Really. I\u2019ve put you through too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>She started to shove by him, but he caught her arm, his fingers curling gently into her flesh. He pulled her to him until she was shockingly close to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere. You\u2019re going to stay here with me.\u201d</p><p>She started to open her mouth, but to her shock, Garrett sealed his lips over hers.</p><p>It was electric, a jolt to her system that fried her entire nerve system. He curved his hand around her nape and dug his fingers into her hair as he held her in place. His mouth moved sensuously over hers, gentle, but so demanding that her knees shook under the power of his touch.</p><p>Never had she been kissed like this. It wasn\u2019t a touching of lips or a casual gesture of affection. It was carnal. Heated and possessive. He was placing a silent claim and it should have terrified her. She should be screaming the roof down but instead she stared dumbly at him as he drew away, his eyes gleaming in the soft light.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay,\u201d he said, his tone brooking no argument.</p><p>And she found herself nodding.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now that we have that out of the way, I\u2019ll go put some clean sheets on the bed for you.\u201d</p><p>She caught his arm, still so rattled she could barely process what she wanted to say. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll sleep here on the couch.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou can have the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett, no. Okay? I\u2019m fine. I swear it. There is no way you can fit onto this couch and you damn sure aren\u2019t sleeping on the floor. I can take the sofa.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an impatient look and then sighed. \u201cTell you what. We\u2019ll share the bed.\u201d</p><p>She found herself shaking her head before he could even get the words out. Panic raced up her spine. Chill bumps rose and fanned out, prickling over her skin like tiny razors.</p><p>He touched the side of her face. \u201cListen to me, Sarah. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. Okay? The bed is plenty big. We can put pillows between us. I\u2019ll stay on my side and you stay on yours. I don\u2019t want you in this front room alone, so we either both sleep in the bed, or if you insist on taking the couch, I\u2019ll have to camp out on the floor next to you.\u201d</p><p>She was being stupid. She knew it but couldn\u2019t fight the overwhelming fear that gripped her. It was irrational. It was blind. But when was fear ever sensible? She wanted to trust this man. That didn\u2019t make any sense either, but there it was. The problem was, it wasn\u2019t a matter of her deciding she trusted him or wanted to trust him and she could go on like a normal human being.</p><p>Her head didn\u2019t care what her heart said. Her head was telling her to stop being a twit and to wise up.</p><p>Garrett stared at her a long moment and then reached behind his back and pulled out the gun. He gripped the barrel and extended the stock toward her.</p><p>She stared at the gun and then raised her gaze to his, her brow furrowed with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep with this under your pillow. That way you\u2019ll be safe from me. I won\u2019t move the entire night. Not only am I used to sleeping in one position, but I damn sure don\u2019t want to risk scaring you and getting my balls blown off.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile but could only think how pitiful her life had gotten. The only way she could allow a man to sleep in the same bed with her was if he offered her a gun for self-protection?</p><p>She closed her eyes. Jesus. It made her angry. So damn angry.</p><p>Finally she shook her head.</p><p>Garrett\u2019s gaze softened as he tucked the gun back into his waistband. \u201cI swear to you that you have nothing to fear from me, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her acceptance of his vow and lowered herself back onto the couch. Patches quit grooming herself and came over to rub against Sarah\u2019s hand. She petted the cat, allowing the simple gesture to calm her fried nerves. And she tried not to think about the fact that she\u2019d be sleeping mere inches away from Garrett.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>PALE shades of dawn painted the room in gradually lightening shadows. Garrett lay on his side, his head propped in his hand as he stared over the barrier of pillows to where Sarah slept. She hadn\u2019t moved the entire night. He knew because he\u2019d slept lightly and he woke up regularly to check on her.</p><p>She was huddled on her side facing him, and she\u2019d inched as far to the edge of the bed as she could without falling off. Patches lay against her chest, curled into a ball of fur. At the moment, the cat was awake and batting lazily at the strands of Sarah\u2019s hair that fell over her shoulder.</p><p>Though Sarah was asleep, there was no peace to her expression. Her brow was wrinkled and her lips drawn into a tight line as if her jaw was clenched tight. Dark smudges lay underneath her eyes as though she hadn\u2019t rested in many nights. She probably hadn\u2019t. He was glad that she\u2019d slept soundly here. Maybe she felt safe with him. Or as safe as she could feel with a strange man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached over and touched her cheekbone with one finger and then softly traced a line downward to her jaw and then to her lips. Lips he\u2019d tasted the night before. She uttered a breathy sigh and her features relaxed, the tension easing from her face.</p><p>He was a dumbass to get all mushy about a woman who obviously had a great deal of baggage. There were so many reasons why he needed to treat this just like any other job. He had to be the world\u2019s biggest pussy for being so soft-hearted when it came to her. It was, unfortunately an affliction he seemed to have around women. Rachel. Then Sophie. And now Sarah. He hadn\u2019t even liked Sophie in the beginning, but that hadn\u2019t stopped him from taking a bullet for her. And now he\u2019d do damn near anything for his two sisters-in-law.</p><p>The difference here was that he hadn\u2019t ever wanted to kiss his sisters-in-law. Oh he was hugely protective of them. No doubt there. But with Sarah, it was different. And he didn\u2019t like it. Not even a little bit. But neither could he help the reaction to her.</p><p>It was as if he went on auto pilot around her. No matter what he thought, it all went out the window the moment he looked into her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cThis bullshit has to stop,\u201d he muttered. He was fast losing objectivity and worse, he was forgetting the task at hand. All he was supposed to do was keep her safe and wait for Lattimer to make his move.</p><p>The sun hadn\u2019t yet to creep over the horizon. Sarah would likely sleep awhile. It would give him a chance to go back over to her cottage and check things out. The copious downpour from the night before made it difficult to find outside evidence, but he was going to give the cottage a thorough checking-over now that it was getting light.</p><p>SARAH opened her eyes as soon as she heard the front door close. She scrambled out of bed and peeked out the window to see Garrett jog down the beach toward her cottage. She would have to move fast if she was going to get out before he came back.</p><p>She might very well be going crazy. Maybe there hadn\u2019t been anyone in her cottage, but she wasn\u2019t about to stick around on the off chance she was losing her marbles. She had an escape plan\u2014a darn good one for as little resources as she had. And it was time to ask Marcus for help, as much as the thought scared her.</p><p>She went to her bag and hauled out a change of clothing but dug deeper until her fingers glanced over the bulge in the inside pocket. She pulled out the pay-as-you-go cell phone she\u2019d only used once so far and punched in the number she\u2019d committed to memory.</p> <p>\u201cAllo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrederick, it\u2019s Sarah. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019accord.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the sound of amusement in his voice and hung up. Her heart beat so fast and hard that she couldn\u2019t squeeze in a breath. She closed her eyes to shake the light-headedness, and when she reopened them, the room spun at a dizzying speed.</p><p>\u201cGet it together,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>Her gaze snagged on the note that Garrett had left her. She paused and then went back to the bed where Patches lay purring. She picked up the piece of paper and scanned the uneven scrawl.</p> <p>Be back soon. Don\u2019t worry.</p><p>She blew out a long breath. There was a part of her that hated leaving. Maybe the entire night had been her imagination, but it had shaken her confidence enough that she knew she couldn\u2019t stay here. She was terrified to go back to her cottage, and she couldn\u2019t stay with Garrett forever. She didn\u2019t even know how long he was here for.</p><p>And if she hadn\u2019t imagined her intruder, she\u2019d only bring trouble, and with him recovering from a bullet wound, trouble was the last thing Garrett needed.</p><p>She picked up the pen on the nightstand and turned the paper over. She sighed. How to tell him everything she wanted to? That the days spent here on the island with him had saved her life. Well, if she survived her current problems, he\u2019d saved it. Okay, she was being way too melodramatic. A simple thanks would have to suffice. She scribbled a quick note and laid it back on the bed next to the cat. She rubbed Patches on the head and whispered good-bye before hurrying out the front door.</p><p>Once on the beach, she turned in the opposite direction of town. The path narrowed to nothing and the sand gave way to a rocky coastline the farther west she went. There were no houses on the westernmost point of the island. The beach was rugged and gave no opportunity for lounging.</p><p>By the time she reached the rendezvous point, she was winded and stood holding her side as she sucked in breaths. She scanned the water, looking for a boat, but all she saw were the waves crashing against the rock outcroppings.</p><p>Then a distant sound, like the wine of an engine, drifted to her on the breeze. It grew louder and louder until she saw what looked like an inflatable boat with an engine \u2019round the bend and zip between two outcroppings. It sped toward the beach and the pilot cut the engine just as the nose slid onto the sand.</p><p>She hurried forward, clutching her bag and the carryall with her laptop in it.</p> <p>Frederick waved to her and smiled. The man thought she was an idiot\u2014but an idiot who paid well nonetheless.</p><p>He held out his hand to help her into the boat. She climbed over, making sure she didn\u2019t drop her bags, and the pilot gestured for her to take a seat in the middle.</p><p>He backed away from the beach and executed a sharp turn just as a wave rolled in. He gunned it over the swell and sped away.</p><p>Sarah huddled in her seat, holding on to her bags as the craft bounced and swayed over the water. She looked back as the island got smaller and smaller in the distance. Her throat knotted and she rubbed to assuage the ache. It was silly to have regret over what she\u2019d left behind. There was nothing. She had no ties to the island. She\u2019d only been there a short time. But still, she couldn\u2019t shake the sense of sadness over leaving Garrett\u2014a man who had helped her when he didn\u2019t have to. A man who seemed to understand the demons she fought.</p><p>GARRETT left the constable\u2019s office in town and started to jog down the road back to his cottage. After closely scrutinizing the area around Sarah\u2019s cottage, he\u2019d discovered a few footprints that hadn\u2019t been washed out by the rain. He also found a window with muddy fingerprints.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time the night before because it was as dark as sin and he\u2019d been anxious to get back to Sarah, but there had been someone at her cottage and whoever it was hadn\u2019t been the least bit careful. Which to him meant it was likely someone local looking to score a little cash or whatever he could come across. But on the other hand, it could be someone else completely. Garrett couldn\u2019t afford to assume anything.</p><p>Sarah would just stay with him from now on. It\u2019d make Garrett\u2019s job a hell of a lot easier. Not to mention a good deal more pleasurable.</p><p>Several minutes later, he jogged up to his porch and opened the door. It was quiet inside, which meant Sarah probably hadn\u2019t rolled out of bed yet. It was still early and she needed her sleep. Still, he found himself quietly approaching the bedroom. He just wanted to check in on her. That was all. It wasn\u2019t like he wanted to watch her sleep. Never mind the fact he\u2019d spent a good portion of the early predawn hours doing just that.</p><p>When he pushed open the cracked door, he frowned when he saw the bed empty save for the cat, who was still curled into a ball next to the pillows. He pushed in farther. \u201cSarah?\u201d</p><p>Lying on the bed was the note he\u2019d left her, only it was folded out so that what he\u2019d written was on the outside. He picked it up and saw that on the inside she\u2019d written him a note.</p><p>Thank you for everything, Garrett. I have to go. Please take care of Patches for me.</p><p>His gaze flew to the spot on the floor where her bag had lain. Only now it was empty.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>He tossed the note aside and took off at a dead run. He checked the other rooms in the house just in case she hadn\u2019t left yet, but came up empty. He hit the porch and leaped off the steps, his gaze scanning the beach. She hadn\u2019t come into town on the main road. He would have seen her. And there were no footprints leading down the beach path.</p><p>But to the west ...</p><p>Small imprints in the still damp sand led away from the cottage toward the more remote edge of the island.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, son of a bitch,\u201d he cursed over and over as he took off.</p><p>Where the hell was she going? And how the hell could he protect her when she wasn\u2019t where he could see her at all times? Damn it. He\u2019d only just convinced her to stay in his cottage, a point he planned to press. He was going to make damn sure she stayed under his watchful eye. Yeah, that had worked just great. He\u2019d fucked up and left her alone, thinking she wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014run in the short time he\u2019d left her.</p><p>He\u2019d learned the hard way with Sophie that it never paid to underestimate a woman and fuck it all, he\u2019d done exactly that with Sarah. Again. Christ but he was the world\u2019s biggest idiot. Here he was, Mr. Bad-Ass Special Ops dude and he couldn\u2019t keep track of one defenseless female. When would he learn that women never stayed where you put them?</p><p>He followed the erratic footprints, losing them once or twice when the path became rockier. Several times he had to backtrack, and he overshot the last time. It wasn\u2019t until he climbed down to the beach over the outcroppings that he saw where her footprints picked back up. Only this time they didn\u2019t parallel the shore. They led directly into the surf, disappearing as the water rolled onto the beach.</p><p>He stood staring left and right but they ended here at the water\u2019s edge. Holy fuck. Someone had picked her up in a boat. It was the only explanation unless she\u2019d lost her ever-loving mind and walked into the water.</p><p>She may be a lot of things, but no fucking way had she committed suicide.</p><p>He glanced around again, but there was nothing to be seen. No houses. No people. She\u2019d picked the most remote spot possible to make her escape and that hadn\u2019t been dumb luck. She\u2019d planned her escape route, and the time in which she\u2019d pulled it off wasn\u2019t left to panic and last minute. She\u2019d planned for this eventuality.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d totally underestimated her and that pissed him off more than her flight. He felt like a first-class fool, and he hated feeling like a dumbass.</p><p>Christ, he\u2019d been handed this cake job, and he couldn\u2019t even manage to keep a defenseless, scared-out-of-her-mind woman in his sights. Yeah, nice. This was why he\u2019d gone into the military. None of the missions he\u2019d ever gone on had involved chasing a damn woman all over the world.</p><p>He turned and stalked back down the path he\u2019d come. She couldn\u2019t have gotten far, and hell, what was out there anyway? The only thing that made sense was that she\u2019d hopped to the next island. If he had any hope of catching her, he had to get there quick.</p><p>When he reached his cottage, he threw his crap into his bag and started to walk out. A plaintive meow halted him in his tracks.</p><p>Goddamn cat.</p><p>He stared at it for a long time and then shook his head. He reached down, picked up the limp ball of fur and stuffed her into his bag. She yowled once but he zipped it up, leaving a small opening for her to breathe and set off for town.</p><p>By the time he reached the row of shops, Patches was making her displeasure widely known. Garrett glanced at the bookstore. Weren\u2019t little old ladies who ran bookstores supposed to love cats?</p><p>He entered, throwing the door open so hard that the bell gave a disgruntled clank instead of the light tinkle. The shop owner gave him a wary glance from behind the register as he approached.</p><p>He plopped the bag onto the counter and the woman took a step back, looking at the bag like she expected the antichrist to pop out.</p><p>\u201cI have a cat,\u201d Garrett began. \u201cWell, it belonged to Sarah. She was in here a day or so ago?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded but she still looked at Garrett like he was an axe murderer.</p><p>\u201cSarah had to leave unexpectedly and, well, so do I. I was hoping you could take the cat?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, hoping to soften her obvious wariness but it felt more like a grimace. He couldn\u2019t believe he was standing here with a goddamn cat. He should have just left her at the cottage. Cats could fend for themselves, right? While he was standing here fucking around with the animal, Sarah was getting farther away.</p><p>He unzipped the pack and put a hand down to make sure Patches didn\u2019t bolt at the first sign of freedom. But the cat just licked him and began purring loud enough for the store owner to hear.</p><p>The woman peered over the edge of the bag and her eyes lit up. \u201cOh, she\u2019s adorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll take her?\u201d Garrett asked hopefully.</p><p>The woman looked startled and very much like she would refuse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate for her to starve. She\u2019s a sweet cat. Probably a good mouser.\u201d</p><p>He hated the cajoling, whiny way his words came out. If his brothers could see him now, he\u2019d never hear the end of their torment.</p><p>The woman looked at the cat and then back up at Garrett. She set her lips together as her eyes narrowed and then finally she said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take her. It\u2019s obvious she isn\u2019t going to do okay in your bag.\u201d</p><p>Garrett didn\u2019t even flinch over the disapproval in her voice. He\u2019d saved the animal from starvation, hadn\u2019t he? He peeled Patches from the bag and unhooked her claws from his shirt then thrust her toward the woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, I appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left before the woman could say anything further. He\u2019d done as Sarah had asked and made sure the cat had a decent home. At least it wouldn\u2019t starve to death now.</p><p>His next stop was at the dock where there were three charter services. He asked benign questions like whether it was possible to hire a boat to take him to the neighboring island. The first two were more than happy to accommodate his request and could arrange it immediately. The third, however, the woman informed him that her husband was already on a trip to the next island and wouldn\u2019t return for some time. When he pressed her, she clammed up and all but shoved him out the door.</p><p>Oookay. So it seemed that Sarah had arranged for a charter to make her escape and that she\u2019d likely done it well in advance of her actual departure. He needed to get there a hell of a lot faster than the couple hours it would take by boat.</p> <p>He hopped one of the two taxis on the island and got dropped off at the airfield on the east end. The guy at the counter eyed him with a speculative gleam when Garrett told him he wanted to charter a helicopter to the next island. Immediately. It was a look that told Garrett this was going to cost him a fuckload of money.</p><p>\u201cSure, I can take you over. I had a client supposed to come in for an aerial tour of the island chain, but I can cancel if the price is right.\u201d</p><p>Yeah like Garrett didn\u2019t know that was coming. \u201cYou take plastic?\u201d</p><p>The guy grinned broadly at Garrett. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Garrett pulled out his wallet and ripped out his credit card. On KGI\u2019s dime, of course. Sam would have a kitten, but oh well. He could always bill Resnick.</p> <p>\u201cHow soon can we leave?\u201d</p><p>The guy picked up Garrett\u2019s credit card and smiled. \u201cJust as soon as I run your card.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>PEOPLE just don\u2019t goddamn disappear. Did they? Garrett was tired. He was hungry. And he was one pissed-off motherfucker. He\u2019d been over every inch of this island and there was no sign of Sarah. No one in the harbor had seen her\u2014or so they said. There wasn\u2019t a flight with her on it\u2014as near as he could tell.</p><p>The woman had simply vanished into thin air.</p><p>He wanted nothing more than to say fuck it all, go home and let Resnick deal with Sarah Daniels. It was what he should do. His sister-in-law was about to deliver. Sam\u2019s hands were tied if they got another job because Garrett was off fucking around in paradise. And quite frankly, he\u2019d have a hell of a lot better time blowing some shit up over playing junior detective. Hell, that was Donovan\u2019s job.</p> <p>He should just go home and call it good.</p><p>But he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>It was a pansy-ass excuse. But if he hadn\u2019t kissed her. If he hadn\u2019t gotten close to her. Hadn\u2019t seen her fear. Hadn\u2019t felt her tremble beneath his fingers. If she hadn\u2019t tasted so damn good. If he hadn\u2019t kissed her, he could go home and forget she ever existed. He could leave her to Resnick and company.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. Somehow in the course of a few days she\u2019d become his. His responsibility. His to protect.</p><p>It was a fucked-up scenario no matter how he looked at it. He couldn\u2019t make it go away no matter how hard he wanted it to. All he knew was that somehow, some way, he and Sarah Daniels were connected.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t like it. But there it was. All laid out, sort of like he felt right now. Balls flapping in the wind.</p><p>No man should ever get so damn tied up in a woman. Especially one he barely knew.</p><p>Yeah, go home. It\u2019s precisely what he should do.</p> <p>Then he could better prepare himself for the job of protecting her. While Donovan ran her to ground, he could haul out his arsenal and start planning for the eventualities. Hell, he never went anywhere without at least four rifles and a few handguns. And yet here he was with only a Glock and his winning personality to get himself out of a scrape on this shit hole of an island. And he\u2019d have to leave the Glock behind.</p><p>He stalked into the tiny-ass terminal that served as ticketing desk, luggage check and security all in one and tossed his bag onto the stuttering conveyor belt.</p><p>\u201cI want to get the hell out of here,\u201d he announced to the startled agent. \u201cWhat\u2019s your next flight out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiami,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>\u201cDone. When does it leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf hour, sir. They\u2019ll be boarding in the next few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scanned the waiting room to see four other people all watching him like he was the shoe bomber. He smiled through gritted teeth. \u201cBad breakup. Girlfriend dragged me down here for a vacation and dumped me for the first dude she saw in a Speedo.\u201d</p><p>The two men grimaced in sympathy while the two women looked like they thought it was no wonder.</p><p>He tossed his credit card onto the counter and hoped to hell Sam hadn\u2019t already discovered the last charge and frozen the account. The agent hastily shoved a printed boarding pass over the counter and then went to secure the routing ticket onto Garrett\u2019s bag.</p><p>\u201cYou say I have thirty minutes? When is last boarding call?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The agent checked her watch. \u201cYou have twenty minutes before final boarding. The plane takes off in thirty.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked back outside, where he pulled out the sat phone. This time Donovan actually answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Garrett began.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Donovan echoed. \u201cI don\u2019t see a \u2018we\u2019 in this equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Garrett growled. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>Donovan sighed. \u201cWhat else is new? What, did you forget your bathing suit? Oh wait, no, the sunblock right? Give me a minute. I\u2019m actually mustering real sympathy for you here. I might even manage to squeeze out a tear or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Garrett asked impatiently. \u201cSarah took off.\u201d</p><p>There was dead silence.</p><p>\u201cShe gave you the slip?\u201d</p><p>Garrett closed his eyes and braced for what was to come.</p><p>Donovan laughed in his ear. \u201cLet me get this straight. All you had to do was stay close to a beautiful woman. Watch over her. Even cozy up to her, if that\u2019s what it took. And she gave you the slip?\u201d</p><p>Garrett could hear the fool wheezing through the phone. He pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger and closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat your ass when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh man, I wish I could be there to see this one,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do. It\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m hopping a flight home. I need you to find out where the hell Sarah has gone. She took a boat off the island but her trail was cold when I got here. I need to know if she flew, swam, took a boat or what. I\u2019m counting on you to find out, Van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell hell,\u201d Donovan grumbled. \u201cI like how you take an assignment and I do all the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh and by the way. You can\u2019t use Resnick or his resources. I don\u2019t want him to know about any of this.\u201d</p><p>Again there was a long silence. \u201cYou want to explain to me why you\u2019re holding out on the man you took the assignment from?\u201d</p><p>Garrett checked his watch. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have a lot of time. I\u2019ll explain when I get there. In the meantime, if Resnick knocks, you play dumb. And find out where the hell Sarah is.\u201d</p><p>He cut the connection and turned to go back into the terminal. What he needed was about twelve hours\u2019 sleep. He wouldn\u2019t sleep a wink on the plane. He hated commercial flights.</p><p>GARRETT pulled into the driveway of his house and frowned when he didn\u2019t see Sam\u2019s or Donovan\u2019s truck parked. Sophie\u2019s SUV was under the carport and he pulled in behind it. Where the fuck was everyone? He was tired from the flights, pissed over the entire deal, and he\u2019d called Donovan as soon as he\u2019d landed in Nashville to tell him he was on his way home.</p><p>He needed to get in, get whatever info Donovan had and get the hell back on the road. Hopefully this time, one of the Kelly jets would be available, because damn, this going-through-security-hoops at airports was for the birds.</p><p>He opened the front door and stepped inside. \u201cHello? Anyone home?\u201d Where the hell was everyone?</p><p>Frustration frayed his already worn patience. He didn\u2019t have time for this.</p><p>\u201cGarrett?\u201d</p><p>He turned in the direction of the kitchen to see Sophie standing in the doorway, her face pale, her hand palming her enormous belly. He strode across the room, concerned by her pallor.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She clutched at his shirt when he got close and swayed unsteadily on her feet. \u201cNo. I mean, yes. I\u2019m in labor. I need you to take me to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. \u201cWhere is Sam?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not answering his cell. He went over to Ethan and Rachel\u2019s but when I called over there no one answered. I was just about to call Marlene when I heard you come in.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the anxiety etched in her expression, he put his arm around her and squeezed reassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want you to worry. Have you got your bag packed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the door,\u201d she said.</p><p>Suddenly she went still and gripped his hand with enough force to cut off his circulation. Damn, but for a little woman she packed a mean grip. She closed her eyes and took in several light breaths through her nose. Shouldn\u2019t she be taking deeper breaths or something?</p><p>Panic hit him in the stomach like a baseball bat. Give him a fucking war, but a pregnant woman in labor? He was clammy just thinking about it.</p><p>When the contraction passed, she started for the door and he hurried beside her. He bent down to retrieve her bag and reached for his cell phone at the same time. This was a hell of a time for Sam to go MIA. What the fuck was he thinking? Sophie could have been completely alone. She had been alone until Garrett showed up.</p><p>He ushered Sophie to his truck and instead of helping her to climb up, he lifted her and eased her down onto the seat. Then he gave her an awkward pat on the leg and hurried around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>He called Sam first but when he got no answer, he called his mom next.</p><p>\u201cMom, is Sam over there?\u201d he demanded as soon as his mom answered.</p><p>\u201cGarrett? You\u2019re home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ma, look I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I need Sam. Where the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cHe\u2019s helping your father and brothers look for Rusty. She didn\u2019t come home after school today.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Just what he needed was Rusty\u2019s irresponsible ass to cause trouble when everything else was going to shit.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s in labor. I\u2019m on the way to the hospital with her. Sam isn\u2019t answering his phone. He needs to get his ass to the hospital to be with his wife.\u201d</p><p>Rusty could rot. He didn\u2019t say it but his mom wasn\u2019t an idiot. It was there in his voice to hear.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Marlene breathed out. \u201cI\u2019ll get him. I\u2019ll call your father. Tell Sophie I\u2019m on my way over right now. Tell her not to worry.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was going to tell a pregnant woman not to worry about pushing a bowling ball out of her uterus.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go, Ma. Find Sam for me. I\u2019m going to take care of Sophie.\u201d</p><p>He tossed down the phone and glanced over at Sophie, who had a tight grip on the door handle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d He hoped he wasn\u2019t lying. What the hell did he know about women in labor? \u201cMa is going to run down Sam. He\u2019ll be there. No way would he miss this.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, Sophie looked less worried than Garrett felt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn Rusty,\u201d he bit out. \u201cShe didn\u2019t show up after school. Apparently they\u2019re all out looking for her.\u201d</p><p>Sophie frowned. \u201cOh, I hope she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shook his head. \u201cShe better damn well have a good reason for this and I\u2019m thinking unless she\u2019s in the hospital, there isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p><p>Sophie laid her hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Garrett. Really. I\u2019m having contractions, but I\u2019m pretty sure she isn\u2019t coming anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be the one comforting you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, yeah, I wouldn\u2019t turn down sympathy or a little petting. I am a little nervous about all of this. I think I\u2019ve been in a state of denial over the actual labor process. This stuff hurts!\u201d</p><p>Garrett grimaced and then took her hand, squeezing to reassure her. \u201cSorry, sweetheart. I\u2019m an insensitive jerk, but then I think you already knew that. Is there anything I can do to make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have the baby for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell no,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat a baby. You took a bullet without whining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well that\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about just getting me there as quickly as possible. Maybe I\u2019m far enough along to have an epidural right away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>He drove as fast as possible without wrapping them around a tree. It was about a thirty-minute drive to the hospital. He made it there in twenty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a big deal,\u201d she pleaded as he roared into the parking lot. \u201cNo big entrance at the E.R. Just park and we\u2019ll walk into the hospital\u2019s front entrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this an emergency?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>She gripped his arm and was silent for a moment. Then she took a deep breath and exhaled. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t an emergency. I don\u2019t want to look like a moron. Just park and help me inside. They\u2019ll take me up to the right floor.\u201d</p><p>Garrett frowned but he did what she asked, although he did make a new parking place right up close to the front entrance. They could kiss his ass or tow his truck. He wasn\u2019t making her walk all the way across the lot no matter what she said.</p><p>He jumped out of his truck and walked around to open the door for Sophie. She put both her hands out to brace on his arms, but again, he just plucked her from the seat and eased her down onto the pavement.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded and took a step forward toward the entrance. The doors slid open and she stopped and held on to his arm for a long moment.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, granted I\u2019m no expert on having babies, but are you sure this baby isn\u2019t coming soon? Those contractions seem to be awfully close together.\u201d</p><p>She blew out and started forward again. \u201cThey\u2019re irregular. Some are close. Others are spaced ten to fifteen minutes apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re relying on the kid to realize they\u2019re supposed to be regular?\u201d</p><p>Her sides shook with laughter as an elderly woman in a volunteer uniform hurried over.</p><p>\u201cAre you in labor, dear?\u201d</p><p>Sophie grimaced and nodded.</p> <p>\u201cStay right here with your husband. I\u2019ll call for a wheelchair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sophie said as the volunteer hustled away. \u201cBe a good husband and stand here without losing your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so going to kill Sam for this. I took a bullet for you. He should at least have to be here for the delivery.\u201d</p><p>Again Sophie laughed. \u201cTrust you to prefer the bullet.\u201d But she squeezed his arm and this time it wasn\u2019t because of a contraction. \u201cThank you. Really. I was scared back at the house.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her in a hug and kissed the top of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what family is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep reminding me.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, an orderly entered the lobby pushing a wheelchair. Garrett got Sophie settled in, fussed over her a few seconds and then followed alongside them as the orderly pushed her toward the elevator.</p><p>Once upstairs, they were greeted by a smiling nurse who took over the wheelchair and wheeled Sophie into a small room with a rather uncomfortable-looking exam table. Weren\u2019t they supposed to have beds? Like comfortable beds? Geez, childbirth clearly wasn\u2019t for sissies.</p> <p>\u201cIs there where you\u2019re putting her?\u201d Garrett blurted.</p><p>The nurse smiled and set a hospital gown on the \u201cbed.\u201d \u201cNo, this is only temporary. We need to see how far along she is. Sometimes we send the mothers back home for a while. False alarm and all that. But if she\u2019s progressed enough, we\u2019ll move her to a delivery suite.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scowled. \u201cSend her home? She\u2019s in labor. You can\u2019t send her home. Can\u2019t you see she\u2019s in pain? Can\u2019t you give her an epidural now?\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed. \u201cCalm down, Garrett. We\u2019ve got it handled. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The nurse patted the gown. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you to change. I\u2019ll be right back to do an exam and hook you up to a monitor.\u201d She glanced at Garrett with barely veiled amusement as she walked back out.</p><p>Sophie picked up the gown and Garrett froze. \u201cUh, you don\u2019t need help or anything, right? I mean, you\u2019ll be okay if I just go over ...\u201d He glanced around. There wasn\u2019t anywhere else to go in the tiny room except out. \u201cUhm, I\u2019ll just step out unless you need ... help.\u201d Oh God, don\u2019t let her need help.</p><p>\u201cYou can leave or you can turn your back,\u201d Sophie said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take but a second to slip into the gown.\u201d</p><p>He whipped around to face the door and raised his eyes heavenward. Where the fuck was Sam?</p><p>He heard the rustle of clothing and even though he was facing away, he closed his eyes and listened for any sign that she was having trouble. Or a thump.</p><p>\u201cOkay, all done,\u201d she said. \u201cI could use your help getting onto the bed if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Garrett turned back around and kept his gaze averted just long enough to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to see anything he shouldn\u2019t. Slowly he let his gaze travel upward, relieved to see that the gown covered all the necessary parts.</p><p>She was trying to climb up but with her belly and her holding the gap closed on the gown, it looked awkward as hell.</p><p>\u201cYou hold the gown, I\u2019ll lift you up,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Her lips twitched suspiciously as she gathered the material in her hands. He lifted her onto the bed and hastily arranged the sheet so she was modestly covered. A few seconds later, a knock sounded and the nurse returned.</p><p>\u201cI need to see how much you\u2019re dilated,\u201d she said.</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good. Garrett kept his eye from twitching. Barely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just wait outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sophie waved him off and he stepped outside the room. He leaned against the wall in relief. Christ but he hated hospitals. He didn\u2019t even want to know what the nurse was doing in there. His imagination was in overdrive and it was frying his brain.</p><p>He waited. And waited. He started to pick up his cell phone and realized he\u2019d left it in the truck. Just great. If Sam had tried to call, he was probably losing his mind by now.</p><p>Several long minutes later, the nurse stepped into the hallway and motioned for Garrett to step inside again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already dilated to five,\u201d she said in way-too-cheerful a voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving her to a delivery room and the good news is she can get her epidural just as soon as the anesthesiologist can be paged.\u201d</p><p>Garrett looked over to where Sophie lay but she was watching the monitor at her bedside.</p><p>\u201cUh, so how long does she have? I mean until the baby gets here.\u201d</p><p>The nurse patted him on the arm. \u201cNo way of knowing really. It could be soon or it could be hours yet. We\u2019ll monitor her progress. No need to worry, Dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not her husband. I mean, I\u2019m not the father. I\u2019m her brother-in-law. The father should be here any time.\u201d Where the fuck was he?</p><p>\u201cOh, well, then just relax and help keep Sophie calm and comfortable. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. The baby is doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>A commotion outside the door had Garrett turning. He breathed a huge sigh of relief just as Sam barreled inside, a crazed look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSophie? Baby, are you all right?\u201d Sam demanded as he rushed to her bedside.</p><p>Sophie raised her head and smiled. Her entire face lit up and Garrett could see the tension ease in her expression. \u201cI\u2019m good. Really. Garrett took good care of me.\u201d</p><p>Sam took her hand and then leaned over to kiss her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there. My damn phone went down and we were out looking for Rusty. I never should have left you. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be gone but a few minutes to Ethan and Rachel\u2019s and then Ma called.\u201d</p><p>Sophie put a finger over his lips and then followed with a soft brush of her mouth. \u201cShhh. I\u2019m fine, Sam. Garrett was great.\u201d</p><p>Sam turned to look at Garrett for the first time. \u201cThanks, man. I\u2019m glad you got home when you did.\u201d He studied him for a long moment. \u201cEverything okay with you?\u201d</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cYeah, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed. \u201cHe was afraid he\u2019d have to coach me through delivery. He was pretty green there for a while.\u201d</p><p>Sam settled into the chair beside Sophie\u2019s bed and laced his fingers through hers. \u201cNo chance I\u2019d miss this.\u201d He smoothed a hand over her swollen belly. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet our little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to interrupt, but we need to move Mrs. Kelly to another room now,\u201d the nurse said from the door.</p><p>The nurse moved forward to unhook the monitor. Sam helped Sophie from the bed and she walked awkwardly toward the door after the nurse. Not knowing what else to do, Garrett followed the group down the hallway to a larger, much more comfortable-looking room. The bed was certainly bigger and it didn\u2019t look like a slab at the morgue.</p><p>As the nurse settled Sophie into the bed, Sam stepped back to stand beside Garrett. Garrett turned to his brother. \u201cI should probably leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to stick around for the birth of your niece?\u201d</p><p>Garrett swallowed. \u201cYou want me to watch?\u201d He tried to keep the horror from his voice but knew he failed miserably.</p><p>Sam laughed and slapped him on the back. \u201cYou can stick around until the messy part comes and then move into the hall. Hell, before it\u2019s over with, I imagine the entire family will wind up here.\u201d</p><p>Garrett ran a hand through his hair. He needed to get with Donovan and figure shit out about Sarah. And he needed to get on the road, but how could he leave when his niece was about to arrive? Donovan would want to be here, not stuck in the war room on his computer looking for Sarah.</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Sarah Daniels? Besides the fact she gave you the slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into her cottage and scared the shit out of her. So she bolted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is this about keeping Resnick in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you worry about Sophie and let me deal with Resnick and Sarah Daniels.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned but the nurses were moving away from Sophie and Sophie looked over to find Sam. Sam left Garrett and returned to Sophie\u2019s bedside. He took her hand and kissed each finger, his smile warm and contented.</p><p>Garrett leaned back against the wall and wondered how the hell he\u2019d gotten himself in the middle of childbirth.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>SEAN Cameron turned his patrol car onto another county road that led away from the lake and scanned the tree line and farther down the dirt road. It really pissed him off that Rusty had pulled this crap after all the Kellys had done for her. He\u2019d questioned some of the students at her school and had been told she drove off with Matt Winfree after school ended.</p><p>When he got his hands on both of them, he was going to wring their necks. Especially Rusty\u2019s. Marlene and Frank were sick with worry and now Sophie was in the hospital about to deliver. Something that should be a joyous occasion for all the Kellys. They should all be at the hospital, not scouring the countryside looking for an ungrateful twit.</p><p>When he rounded the bin, he fishtailed to a quick stop, coming only inches from running over a person in the road. He looked up to see Rusty staring at him through the windshield. Her hair was a mess. She had blood trickling from the corner of her mouth, and her eyes were wide and frightened.</p><p>As soon as she recognized him, her expression grew hard and cold. Her lips twisted belligerently and she limped past him and continued down the road. He shot out of the car and charged after her. He grabbed her arm and spun her around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>Her nostrils flared. \u201cGet your hands off me, copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either my hand or the cuffs. Take your pick,\u201d he snarled back.</p><p>He pulled her back toward his car and pushed her against the side. She trembled underneath his fingers and he let go, standing in front of her, arms across his chest in an intimidating manner.</p><p>\u201cStart talking, Rusty.\u201d</p><p>She refused to meet his stare. \u201cIt\u2019s about a mile up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you wreck it? Where is Matt Winfree?\u201d</p><p>Her head popped up and anger burned through her eyes. \u201cWhat do you know about Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you left school with him when you should have been going home. And that you took off without telling anyone where you were. Damn it, Rusty, the Kellys are worried sick about you. Sophie\u2019s in labor and the family should be with her but they\u2019re all out looking for your irresponsible ass.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell and for the first time he saw beyond the belligerent front to the pain that lurked deep in her eyes. He frowned as he took in not only the trickle of blood but the redness of her face. His gaze swept downward to take in her torn shirt and the welts around her neck.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Rusty flinched away and would have taken off but he put his hand on the car to block her.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Rusty. What the hell happened? Did that little bastard hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head mutinously and Sean blew out his breath in frustration. \u201cGet in. Show me where your car is.\u201d</p><p>He walked around to put her in the passenger side and she looked briefly up as she slid in. \u201cNot going to make me ride in back like the other prisoners?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t arrested you. Yet.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the door and went back around. He needed to call Marlene to put her mind at ease but he wanted to find out what the hell had happened first. Rusty was holding out\u2014not that it was any shock.</p><p>They drove up the road and about a mile up, he saw the car nosefirst in a deep ravine.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIs Matt still inside?\u201d</p> <p>Anger flashed on her face again and she shook her head. \u201cMind telling me where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took off.\u201d</p><p>Sean pulled up beside the wrecked car and rested his hand over the steering wheel as he looked over at Rusty. \u201cAny reason why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I threatened to call you,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cCall me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay? It was a bluff. Pretty stupid. You wouldn\u2019t piss on me if I was on fire.\u201d</p><p>Sean reached over and touched the blood drying at the corner of her mouth. Then he lowered his hand and pulled the collar of her shirt back just an inch to reveal the already discolored places on her neck.</p><p>Rusty stared back at him, her gaze challenging.</p><p>Sean picked up his phone and punched in Frank\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cFrank. I\u2019ve found Rusty. I\u2019ll bring her home after I\u2019ve straightened things out. No, don\u2019t come. I\u2019ll take care of it. You and Marlene just worry about Sophie.\u201d</p><p>He hung up before Frank could press further and then he stared back at Rusty.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do this one of two ways. You can tell me exactly what happened, or I can take you back to the station and you can tell me there. Your choice. But you are going to give me an exact accounting or I\u2019m going to find Matt Winfree and get his side.\u201d</p><p>Rusty closed her eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You won\u2019t believe me. Nobody will believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face toward the window and stared out. More bruises shadowed the slim column of her neck up to her ear. He was getting more pissed off by the minute. Then she looked down and her shoulders shook as if she was valiantly trying to hold on to her control.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make them worry,\u201d she said in a cracked voice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be anything more than a ride home. Matt Winfree is cute and popular and I thought he was interested in me. He asked if I\u2019d give him a ride home. So I said yeah. I mean, what girl wouldn\u2019t? After we left the school, he asked if he could drive. He thought the car was cool and wanted to get behind the wheel. I know I should have said no, but I wanted him to like me.\u201d</p><p>The pained vulnerability in her voice gripped Sean by the throat. Christ, she was just a kid. It was hard to remember that sometimes, but she was still just a seventeen-year-old kid who\u2019d had a hell of a hard life.</p><p>\u201cSo I pulled over and told him he could drive to his house and that was all. I knew Marlene would worry if I wasn\u2019t home, but I figured she wouldn\u2019t mind five minutes.\u201d</p><p>She went silent and locked her gaze on some distant object out her window.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Sean urged.</p><p>She dragged her hand through her hair and he saw two nails, broken to the quick, tiny lines of blood at the tips. He had a very bad feeling about this.</p><p>\u201cHe drove past his house. I asked him what the hell and he laughed and said he wanted to show me something. I was pissed because I\u2019d already told him just to drive to his house. He came out here, with me yelling at him the entire way. He tried ...\u201d</p><p>She leaned her forehead on the glass and hunched her shoulders inward as if to hide herself completely from Sean.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he try?\u201d Sean asked quietly.</p><p>Rusty whirled around, tears swimming in her eyes, but they blazed with fury. \u201cHe wanted sex, okay? He wanted me to put out. Apparently it\u2019s the hot gossip at school that any boy can get into my pants, and so he wanted his turn.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached. \u201cDid he rape you?\u201d</p><p>She gave a dry laugh. \u201cHe tried. He tried, okay? I told him I\u2019d tell you, and he laughed. Said you\u2019d never believe me over him, that everyone knew what kind of girl I am. I fought him off and he drove my car into the ditch. Then he took off. Probably called a friend on his cell phone to come get him. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She lifted pain-filled eyes to his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>Relief was crushing in her eyes. Tears slipped down her cheeks and then she raised her hands to her face as sobs billowed out. He reached over to lay his hand against her hair.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t get away with this, Rusty.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head up again. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t tell anyone. No one will believe me. No one. Do you understand? My life will be ruined. I won\u2019t be able to go back to school.\u201d</p><p>The sad thing was she was right about a lot of people not believing her. But that didn\u2019t mean that Sean and the rest of the Kellys couldn\u2019t make the little bastard\u2019s life miserable.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t press charges,\u201d she said vehemently. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll say nothing ever happened. You can\u2019t make me.\u201d</p><p>Sean slid his hand underneath her chin and nudged it upward. \u201cTrust me, Rusty. I know you and I don\u2019t see eye to eye. I know you hate me. But trust me. I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d</p><p>The hope in her eyes damn near undid him. It was gone in a flash, and her expression went dim again.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me where you\u2019re hurt. Do you need to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and shook her head. \u201cHe hit me a few times. Tore my clothes.\u201d</p><p>He touched the side of her neck where the bruises had already formed. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>She twisted away and pulled her torn shirt up to cover it. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. He held me by my neck while he ripped my shirt.\u201d</p><p>Sean itched to get his hands around Matt\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want to do then. I\u2019ll take you to the hospital if you want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want Marlene,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take you home. Okay? I\u2019ll call ahead to make sure she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t she be at the hospital with Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think right now you need her more,\u201d Sean said gently.</p><p>Rusty breathed a sigh of relief and then she looked at him. \u201cThanks. You\u2019re not so bad, you know? For a cop.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re not the bad guys, Rusty.\u201d He glanced over at her car. \u201cDo you need anything out of there before we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy purse. And my school stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sit tight while I go get it. I\u2019ll need to call a wrecker to come get the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank and Marlene are going to be so upset,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just got me that car and I promised to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Sean paused and then leaned back into the car to look over at Rusty. \u201cThey\u2019ll be happy you\u2019re okay. They don\u2019t give a damn about that car.\u201d</p><p>As he walked toward the wrecked car, he pulled out his cell phone. \u201cMarlene? This is Sean. Yeah, Rusty\u2019s okay. Look I know you\u2019re probably on your way to the hospital but ... Rusty really needs you right now. I\u2019m going to take her home if you can meet me there.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>SEAN parked his patrol car outside Matt Winfree\u2019s home and sat for a moment trying to get his anger under control. Dealing with teenage punks of Matt\u2019s ilk wasn\u2019t anything new, but this time really set him off. It was no secret there was no love lost between him and Rusty. She\u2019d been obstinate, obnoxious and rebellious from the first moment she\u2019d learned that Sean was a cop. Half the time he wanted to shake her senseless. The other half, he preferred to just avoid her. But she didn\u2019t deserve this shit with Matt. For all her faults, he knew beyond her tough-girl exterior lay a very frightened, insecure girl who just wanted what other teenagers took for granted. Someone to love her and give a damn.</p><p>He got out and walked toward the front door. Matt\u2019s father, Tom, opened it when he was halfway up the walk.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d he greeted. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Sean stopped a foot in front of the bottom step. \u201cI need to talk to Matt, Tom.\u201d</p><p>Tom frowned and his brow drew together. \u201cIs there a problem? He just got in from school. He\u2019s up doing his homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get him. I need to have a private word with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him, but I\u2019ll hear whatever it is you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Sean shrugged. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>He stood outside, hands shoved into his pockets while he waited. A few minutes later, Tom returned with Matt and they stepped outside onto the porch. Matt glanced nervously between Sean and his father and then his lips curled and he went on the offensive.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what that little bitch said, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d Tom barked. \u201cYou\u2019ll show some respect.\u201d</p><p>Sean leveled a stare at Matt and enjoyed watching him squirm. \u201cWell now, I hadn\u2019t said anything at all. Interesting that you get on the defensive right away now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes narrowed and he fell silent as he stared at his son. Then he turned to Sean. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Sean? Just spit it out. What is it you think Matt has done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything,\u201d Sean said softly. He looked past Tom to Matt and then took a step forward. \u201cYou\u2019re damn lucky I don\u2019t haul you down to lockup.\u201d</p><p>Matt smirked, though his eyes betrayed his panic.</p><p>\u201cRusty isn\u2019t pressing charges, though I tried to talk her into it. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to stuff you into a cell. But let me tell you this. If you so much as breathe her name\u2014even once\u2014I\u2019ll make your life miserable. You got me? You don\u2019t talk about her. You don\u2019t brag to your buddies that you got next to her. If I hear a single word that you\u2019ve done anything to make her miserable at school, I\u2019ll come down on you so hard you won\u2019t be able to take a piss without me breathing down your neck and then you can kiss your football scholarship to UT good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Matt paled and Tom\u2019s perplexed expression turned angry. \u201cMatt, what the hell is he talking about? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Matt spat out. \u201cThe little bitch is a prick tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the bruises on her neck. I saw the tears in her shirt. You wrecked her new car\u2014which, by the way, you are going to make restitution for. You\u2019re getting off scot-free, which pisses me the hell off. But it ends right here and now. If you don\u2019t think I\u2019m serious, you just try me. I can ruin your life, and moreover, I\u2019d take great pleasure in doing so if you do anything to give Rusty a hard time.\u201d</p><p>Tom closed his eyes and shook his head. All the color had drained from his cheeks, and Sean felt sorry for him. Tom was a good man. He was a longtime school board member and a huge supporter of the high school. He didn\u2019t think for a minute that Tom would condone his son\u2019s behavior.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make amends,\u201d Tom said hoarsely. \u201cYou have my word on it.\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s face reddened and swelled up with anger, but his father\u2019s look prevented him from speaking his mind.</p><p>\u201cI want him to stay away from Rusty and keep his mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Tom nodded. \u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned and started toward his car when Matt\u2019s outburst reached him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nothing! Just some little tramp. Why do you give a shit about her?\u201d</p><p>Sean stopped and then slowly turned back around. He pinned Matt with the full force of his glare until he saw fear glimmer back in Matt\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, you little prick. Take my advice. Forget you ever heard Rusty\u2019s name. She\u2019s very much a part of the Kelly family now, and if you know anything about them, then you know they don\u2019t suffer any insult to their family. She now has six older brothers who\u2019d love nothing more than to kick your little arrogant ass all over Stewart County.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, for God\u2019s sake, shut up,\u201d Tom snarled. \u201cYou\u2019re in enough trouble as it is.\u201d</p><p>Sean tipped his hat in Tom\u2019s direction and then continued to his car.</p><p>Satisfied that he\u2019d given Matt Winfree plenty of incentive to keep his mouth shut and to leave Rusty alone, he drove toward the Kelly house.</p><p>A few minutes later, he pulled to a stop beside Marlene\u2019s car and sighed. This sucked all the way around. Especially for Rusty. But he could at least allay her fears of the incident making the rounds at school.</p><p>He knocked and waited. Marlene opened the door, her eyes fiery. Oh, he\u2019d seen that look plenty of times. She was such an easygoing, loving woman, but God help the fool who messed with one of her chicks.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Marlene sighed. \u201cUpset but trying not to let me know how much. She\u2019s playing it off, of course, but it scared her to death. Tell me you beat the shit out of that little asshole.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean\u2019s shoulders shook with laughter. \u201cI might have threatened to.\u201d</p><p>Marlene made a disgruntled sound.</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Marlene opened the door wider. \u201cOf course. Come on in. She\u2019s in the kitchen. I made her put an ice pack on those bruises.\u201d</p> <p>Sean scowled at the mention of those bruises. It made him want to go back over and bruise Matt Winfree\u2019s face.</p><p>He followed Marlene into the kitchen and braced himself for Rusty\u2019s belligerence. But when she looked up, he saw no sign of anger or hostility. She looked ... young and extremely vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She leaned against the kitchen sink and let the hand holding the ice pack fall away. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>She sounded subdued. He almost preferred her mouthy and obnoxious. He didn\u2019t know how to take the quiet and beaten-down Rusty.</p> <p>\u201cI just came by to tell you that you don\u2019t have to worry about Matt Winfree causing you any more trouble. And school won\u2019t be a problem. He won\u2019t be running his mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise and to his extreme discomfort tears shimmered on the surface.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked hoarsely.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat I did isn\u2019t important. What is, is that he won\u2019t be a problem for you. And Rusty? If you ever need me, you call, okay? You seem to think that no one is on your side and that you can\u2019t depend on anyone. By now you should know that isn\u2019t true. The Kellys stand by you, and so do I.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes held the faint glaze of shock as she stared wordlessly at him. Marlene\u2019s phone rang, breaking the growing silence that followed his announcement. She picked it up and he listened as she said hello and then broke into a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s had her baby!\u201d she said over the mouth of the phone.</p> <p>Sean smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Tell Sam I said congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Marlene spoke on the phone a few more seconds and then hung up, beaming from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I drive you two up to the hospital to see Sophie and the new baby?\u201d he offered. He glanced at Rusty as he spoke. \u201cSeems to me this is a good time to be surrounded by your family.\u201d</p><p>A smile hovered over her mouth, the corners lifting as her eyes lightened.</p><p>Marlene looked over at Rusty and then reached out her hand to squeeze Rusty\u2019s. \u201cWhat do you say? Want to go up and see the newest addition to the Kelly clan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Rusty said in a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cWell come on then. I\u2019ll give you code-three treatment,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p> <p>\u201cMEXICO? What the hell is she doing in Mexico?\u201d Garrett demanded.</p><p>Donovan rubbed his hand over his hair and yawned as he stared with bleary eyes at his computer. \u201cYeah. A cargo pilot gave her a ride. She paid him a bundle.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cApparently not enough to buy his silence. How\u2019d you dig this up so quickly?\u201d</p><p>Donovan lifted one eyebrow. \u201cLike I\u2019m going to tell you. You and Sam just think you run this operation. Neither of you could manage without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling unappreciated, Van?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Garrett chuckled. \u201cI think Sam and I are both well aware of who\u2019s the brain in this camp. It definitely ain\u2019t me. So give me everything. Jesus, but I had no desire to go back to Mexico anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to go?\u201d Donovan offered. \u201cI\u2019ve had time to rest up. You can stay here and watch over KGI while Sam makes goo-goo eyes at his new daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Donovan raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy not? Besides, how\u2019s it going to look for the beach bum who saved her ass on Isle de Bijoux to show up in Mexico? There ain\u2019t no amount of explaining that\u2019ll make her believe in that big of a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s going to go over real well.\u201d</p><p>Donovan wasn\u2019t telling Garrett anything he didn\u2019t already know. He\u2019d wrestled with his conscience ever since Sarah bolted. He knew he\u2019d gained her trust, or at least some degree of it while they were on the island. He was going to have a damn good explanation for showing up again. One that didn\u2019t get the door slammed in his face and didn\u2019t have her bolting again at the first opportunity.</p><p>Garrett pushed out his breath in an angry huff. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell her Lattimer sent me. That he wanted me there all along. It\u2019ll shock her enough that she\u2019ll buy it because no one\u2019s supposed to know. I was with her a lot on the island. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in constant contact with Lattimer so I think it\u2019ll buy me some time. And if she talks to Lattimer, and her asking about me draws him out, all the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good plan,\u201d Donovan said. He stared thoughtfully at Garrett. \u201cSo why does it have you so pissed off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I hate lying to her, goddamn it,\u201d Garrett exploded. He dragged a hand over his head to the back of his neck and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s already been fucked over once. I hate the idea of lying to her, of using her, even if the end justifies the means.\u201d</p><p>Donovan nodded slowly. \u201cYeah, I get it, man. My offer still stands. I can go. She doesn\u2019t know me. I can stash her someplace and we can lay a trap for Lattimer sans Resnick. You get the girl. Uncle Sam gets Lattimer. Everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I go. You find me a place I can safely stash Sarah. I\u2019d feel better if we pulled in a few team members and send them ahead to the safe house. I may have to lie to Sarah, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t protect her with everything I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say this and it\u2019s probably going to piss you off, but I think you should stay the hell away from this one, Garrett. It\u2019s personal with Lattimer and now it sounds personal with Sarah. I can do this with a clear head. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going near Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flashed in Donovan\u2019s eyes. Garrett cleared his throat in disgust and refused to say anything else on the matter. Donovan wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew Garrett was ass-deep in some uncomfortable shit. But that didn\u2019t mean his brother was going to get all chatty about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take me an hour or so to make the arrangements and get the jet ready,\u201d Donovan said.</p><p>\u201cI never unpacked so I\u2019m ready to hit the road as soon as you give me the green light. While you do all that, I\u2019m going to run by the hospital to say good-bye to Sophie and see our niece. I\u2019m also going to drop by Ethan and Rachel\u2019s on my way back over so Rachel won\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Donovan offered a snappy two-finger salute to which Garrett responded with his middle finger. He was almost to the door when Donovan\u2019s voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Garrett. This obviously goes deeper than we know. Get down there and do whatever you have to do to get her to trust you. Then you need to grab her and get the hell out of there.\u201d</p><p>Garrett turned, his hand gripping the doorframe. \u201cYeah, I hear you. And thanks, Van. I appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>MARCUS Lattimer stared coldly at the man standing in front of him. Two of Marcus\u2019s men flanked the dirty, bloodied traitor, their guns pointed at his sides. Marcus\u2019s lip curled in distaste. He had no use for disloyalty. This man had infiltrated Marcus\u2019s organization, gained his trust, and the entire time he\u2019d been working for the CIA.</p><p>He let Douglas Culpepper stew for a moment before Marcus addressed him directly.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Douglas. I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>The flicker in Douglas\u2019s eyes betrayed him as Marcus called the man by his name. He remained silent as he stared dully at Marcus, the knowledge of his fate reflected on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou sold me out, Douglas, but tell me, did you sell out my sister too?\u201d</p><p>It was one of the few mistakes Marcus could remember making. He\u2019d made a life of being careful. But Douglas had been good. Marcus had let his guard down, a fact that still made him furious. He\u2019d told Douglas things. Things he hadn\u2019t ever divulged to anyone else in his organization. He\u2019d told him about Sarah.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s jaw twitched as Douglas remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI might have let you go except for that,\u201d Marcus continued. \u201cAre they hunting her?\u201d</p><p>Douglas\u2019s lips tightened and his nostrils flared.</p><p>Marcus shot to his feet, his palms slapping the top of his desk as he leaned toward Douglas. \u201cYou\u2019ll talk, you son of a bitch. I guarantee you before this day\u2019s over, you\u2019ll talk. You\u2019re going to tell me everything you reported back to your superiors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cFuck you, Douglas.\u201d</p><p>He made a motion with his hand and Douglas was dragged from the room by three of Marcus\u2019s men. Marcus sank into his seat and leaned back as he turned to stare out the window. Douglas would talk. Not that it really mattered. Marcus had to operate under the assumption that Sarah was no longer a secret. Which meant she was in danger. The CIA and countless other operations would have no qualms about using her to get to him. A fact Sarah herself knew, since she\u2019d naively fled to protect Marcus.</p><p>He smiled at the idea that his little sister would protect him. He was one of the most feared men in the world and yet a woman with a soft heart and little to no knowledge of just how bad the world was had it set in her mind that he needed her protection.</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t matter if Douglas talked but he sure as hell was going to regret betraying Marcus\u2019s trust. Marcus didn\u2019t want a quick end to Douglas\u2019s suffering. His men had been instructed to keep him alive for as long as possible. Eventually he\u2019d die in the worst sort of agony. Until then he\u2019d pray for death with every breath.</p><p>Marcus opened his laptop and checked the email account where Sarah sent him messages. There was a new one from her. Grim satisfaction gripped him as he scanned the contents. She was finally asking him for help. He rapidly typed in a detailed response, giving her curt instructions on where to go and what to do when she got there.</p><p>Once he was done, he closed his computer and hoped she had the sense to listen to him.</p><p>He leaned back again in his chair and studied the patterns in the painting that adorned his wall. Then slowly pulled open the drawer where he kept a photo of Sarah locked away in a small lockbox.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow anything to happen to her. She\u2019d already suffered far too much. If their father had done his duty, Sarah would have been raised with the protection and privilege she deserved.</p><p>He hoped the bastard was rotting in hell. Right alongside Allen Cross.</p><p>\u201cSoon, Sarah,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you never want for another thing. I just need a little more time.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>THERE was no ocean view. No sound of incoming waves and no cool breeze from the water. It was hot. The humid, cloying type of heat that made Sarah\u2019s edgier than she already was.</p><p>She\u2019d arrived the day before after hiding in a ridiculously small, run-down hotel room in a town she couldn\u2019t even remember the name of. When she\u2019d received Marcus\u2019s email with explicit instructions, she\u2019d been both fearful and relieved. As much as she didn\u2019t want to involve her brother in her mess, she needed help and he\u2019d provided wonderfully.</p><p>Fiona, the caretaker of the house Marcus owned, had stocked groceries and all the necessities, and as soon as Sarah arrived, she\u2019d discreetly disappeared leaving only a telephone number where she could be reached if Sarah needed anything.</p><p>The area was remote but not without its escape routes. She\u2019d spent every moment of her first hours here meticulously planning for any eventuality. She\u2019d been a little\u2014okay a lot\u2014na\u00efve when she\u2019d arrived on the island weeks earlier. Not that she hadn\u2019t been exceedingly cautious, but even so, she\u2019d been caught unawares and without a way to protect herself. Escape route, yes. She\u2019d made sure of that from the moment she\u2019d arrived on Isle de Bijoux. But she hadn\u2019t considered her own protection. Ridiculous, considering her circumstances.</p><p>It was no longer an issue. Thanks to Marcus, she now owned a gun and while she wasn\u2019t exactly able to test-fire it, she\u2019d been over every inch of the weapon, loading and unloading, testing the stiffness of the safety, the weight of the gun and how the stock rested in the cradle of her palm. It was big and a little awkward for her, but in a pinch, it would work.</p><p>She\u2019d raised it, pointing at an imaginary enemy and tested her resolve to kill another human being. When all else failed, she pictured Allen Cross and imagined facing him down and putting a bullet through his heart.</p><p>She could look out for herself. It was time to look out for herself and stop being the scared, defenseless twit she\u2019d turned into over the past year.</p><p>In a former life, she would have been able to stay on the island and perhaps enjoy a vacation romance with Garrett. He\u2019d certainly seemed interested enough. He\u2019d kissed her. She\u2019d seen the way he looked at her. She wasn\u2019t immune to the man despite the faint sense of alarm he raised whenever he was near. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, it wasn\u2019t fear of him as someone who posed a potential risk to her safety. It was the fear a woman had when she sensed a man who could overpower her senses and reduce her instincts to those of a primal being.</p><p>It was a heady sensation. It filled her mind and soul with a vibrancy that awakened a deep longing. To possess and be possessed.</p><p>Mocking laughter bubbled up in her throat as she stared at the lush terrain surrounding the house. She stood in the window and rubbed her hands up and down her arms. She was running for her life and was standing here contemplating the what-ifs involving a fling with a hot guy.</p><p>But she was encouraged by the flare of attraction, the ability to think of a handsome man without fear and mistrust overwhelming her. It was ... a step in the right direction. Progress. Healing. Sweet, sweet healing.</p> <p>Amidst such turmoil and the knowledge that her life was irrevocably changed, hope burned. That maybe, just maybe, her future wasn\u2019t the bleak horizon it had been months ago. It was ... liberating.</p><p>Hunger drove her toward the kitchen. Reluctantly, she left her perch high above the surrounding acreage. Here she felt more secure. She could see an approaching threat.</p><p>The kitchen, while small, was well stocked and surprisingly had updated appliances. It was more modern than her apartment back in Boston. After checking the fridge and pantry, she decided to go for simple and made herself a sandwich. She\u2019d cook later when she wasn\u2019t feeling so antsy, as if someone would pop out of the woods at any moment and storm the house.</p><p>She poured herself a glass of wine and started to put the bottle up but then decided an entire bottle wasn\u2019t a bad idea. It would definitely help take the edge off the previous days of all-consuming stress.</p><p>She tucked the bottle under her arm, picked up the saucer with her sandwich and then collected her wineglass with the other. She went back to the living room with all the windows and positioned herself so she had the best view. By the time she was halfway through her sandwich, she\u2019d already refilled her glass twice.</p> <p>Mellowed by the wine, exhaustion crept like a slow-moving fog, seeping through her veins until her limbs went slack and her eyelids were so heavy that she struggled to keep them open.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes and leaned forward to put her plate on the coffee table next to the almost-empty wine bottle. After staring a moment at her glass, she drained the contents and then slumped back on the couch, her head bouncing gently against the plump cushion.</p><p>Probably not the best idea to get soused when she was supposed to be on her guard, but she hadn\u2019t slept in three straight days, and she was fried. She had to sleep or she was going to go crazy.</p><p>There was one other thing she had to do before she succumbed to exhaustion. She dragged her laptop over to her from the end of the couch and opened it. It took a moment for her computer to find the wireless network, and she held her breath, hoping the Internet connection was reliable enough for her to check her email.</p><p>The screen blurred and she reached up to rub her eyes and massage her forehead as she tapped at the keys with her other hand and completed the series of steps to access her account. Her connection was slow and it seemed to take forever for the page to load. When finally, the screen bearing the message that she had new emails popped up, she tapped impatiently at the keypad to access the content.</p><p>The first was merely one line.</p> <p>Let me know you made it safely.</p><p>The second contained all the impatience and worry she knew Marcus was capable of.</p><p>Damn it, Sarah, what\u2019s going on? Check in the minute you get this. I\u2019m worried.</p><p>She opened a blank email and typed a short response.</p><p>I made it. Thank you. Please don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m waiting like you told me to.</p><p>She shut the laptop and pushed it toward the end of the couch. Her eyelids drooped more precariously than before. Sleep. Finally, fatigue was fast overtaking her. She glanced over to the end table to her right and reached out her hand to grasp the gun. After checking to make sure the safety was engaged, she placed it in front of her on the table by her discarded sandwich, making sure the weapon was within easy reach of her position on the couch.</p><p>She yawned broadly and welcomed the approaching oblivion of sleep. Aided by the wine and three days of adrenaline-induced wakefulness, she slipped under. But even so, her sleep was fractured and she dreamed of dark shadows and of something else entirely. She dreamed of Garrett.</p><p>GARRETT didn\u2019t immediately intrude on Sarah\u2019s newfound sanctuary. He spent the first day scouting the area, keeping his ear to the ground and making damn certain that he wasn\u2019t walking into a trap\u2014and furthermore that when he did make his presence known, they\u2019d have a clear escape path.</p> <p>Donovan was positive that the house Sarah was holed up in belonged to Lattimer, which meant Sarah had been in contact with him since leaving the island. He was going to have to talk fast and make damn sure Sarah didn\u2019t contact him again after Garrett made his presence known or his cover would be blown to high heaven.</p><p>Whatever had prevented her from accepting help from her brother before evidently had gone out the window as soon as she\u2019d run scared. Or maybe this had been the plan all along. Who knew how Lattimer thought. It pissed Garrett off that Sarah\u2019s brother had left her vulnerable for so long while she was on the island. If she was so damn important to him, then Lattimer should have hauled her away to one of his many holdings whether she liked it or not.</p><p>As a result of Sarah\u2019s flit, Garrett had no idea what he was getting into. For all he knew, Lattimer could be here with her, although it would make him the dumbest son of a bitch on the planet, and Lattimer hadn\u2019t stayed alive as long as he had by being stupid. Still, stranger things had happened, and one thing Garrett had learned in his years in the military and the missions that KGI had taken over the years, was that crazy shit happened all the time and rule number one was to be prepared for anything.</p><p>He shifted his backpack, and switched his rifle to his other hand as he climbed another hill in the wooded area surrounding Sarah\u2019s house. He was nearing an end to his recon after having made a complete 360 of the terrain. What he\u2019d seen so far pleased him. There was no sign of recent activity, no indication that anyone had found her before he had. But still he paid careful attention to the smallest indicator that anyone but him had been watching the house.</p><p>He rested on his stomach and moved his field glasses to his eyes. He trained them on the many glass windows of the house. The openness made him twitchy, although it being one of Lattimer\u2019s holdings, it was likely all state-of-the-art bulletproofed.</p><p>Garrett scowled even harder when he found her, standing at one of the windows looking out with a worried frown. It didn\u2019t matter if the glass was bulletproof or not. Her parading around in the opening was an invitation to anyone hunting her.</p><p>He was going to have a long talk with her about safety measures just as soon as he explained to her the magnitude of the danger she was in. Hell, everyone in the world wanted a piece of her. Resnick was probably having a kitten right this moment and would be breathing hard down Sarah\u2019s neck. If Donovan had found Sarah, so could Resnick.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even want to think of who else was looking for her. The break-in on the island still weighed heavily on his mind.</p><p>When he was through with his surveillance, and satisfied that an immediate threat didn\u2019t exist, he stashed his gear between two rocks and began the slow journey toward the house. He\u2019d get his equipment after his come-to-Jesus moment with Sarah. If he barged in fully armed, he\u2019d only scare the shit out of her, and she was already going to have a big enough what-the-fuck moment over his arrival. And he didn\u2019t have chocolate to wave under her nose this time.</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t want her to have any advance warning of his coming\u2014she\u2019d probably take off again\u2014he was careful to keep his approach disguised and circled to the back edge of the property so he could access the back entrance.</p><p>Subtlety had never been his strong point, but now he warred between whether to knock like he was some casual guest\u2014yeah, right\u2014or just break in the back and corner her before she got any crazy notions. He was confident in his ability to talk fast once he was in.</p><p>He\u2019d rather go in, explain later. Much more his style.</p><p>When he reached the solid wood door from the back terrace, he gave the knob an experimental tug. At least she\u2019d locked it. He moved to the window a few feet from the door and peered in. He felt like a damn creepy stalker, and if she saw him, she wouldn\u2019t have reason to believe otherwise.</p><p>\u201cGet in first. Explain later,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She was a mission, and he shouldn\u2019t feel like he had to apologize for making sure she was safe.</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that, buddy. Maybe you\u2019ll believe it.\u201d</p><p>Christ. Now he was having pussy conversations with himself. Maybe he should have let Donovan take the job after all. It was apparent he was losing his damn mind.</p><p>After peering in, he didn\u2019t see her, and it was likely she was still standing by the damn windows in the front. He tested the window and found it locked as well. Not just locked, but there were sticks between the top of the sill and the middle to reinforce the security. No one would get in unless they broke the panes.</p><p>So it was back to the door.</p><p>He took out the small pouch that held his \u201ctools.\u201d Hell, it had been a damn long time since he\u2019d resorted to a breaking-and-entering that didn\u2019t involve explosives. It took him longer than he\u2019d like, but he finally jimmied the lock and carefully opened the door.</p><p>Only to find two chains that prevented it opening more than two inches.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>There was no quiet way to do this. He didn\u2019t exactly carry around bolt cutters.</p><p>So he\u2019d make an entrance anyway, despite his resolve not to scare the daylights out of her.</p><p>He pulled back and then rammed his shoulder into the heavy wood. It took two attempts before the chains gave way and he sprawled into the house. He hit the floor and rolled. Only to stop in front of a pair of female feet.</p><p>If he expected her to scream, panic or have an otherwise girly reaction, he was dead wrong. When he glanced upward, he was staring down the barrel of a fucking cannon. Jesus, she was holding a goddamn Desert Eagle .50 cal. When he looked higher, he met with one pissed-off woman. He dropped his gaze again to the gun to see that she had a haphazard grip around the stock, and worse, the safety was off, and her finger was curled way too tight around the trigger.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIt was you all along, wasn\u2019t it? You weren\u2019t there on some vacation. Someone sent you after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d he said mildly, still keeping a very close eye on her trigger finger. \u201cBut if I\u2019d been sent to kill you, you would already be dead.\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered across her face. Clearly that hadn\u2019t been what she\u2019d expected to hear. \u201cDid Marcus send you?\u201d</p><p>Interesting that she seemed to think someone else would have sent him. He\u2019d get to that later. Right now he had to be damn convincing. \u201cYes. He sent me.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed and she took a step back although she kept the damn gun pointed at him, and the problem was where she had it pointed\u2014though he wasn\u2019t going to take the chance of pissing her off by asking her to target a different portion of his anatomy. There was a humiliating medical report he had no desire to file. Having his nuts shot off by a pissed-off woman.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in suspicion as she stared down at him. \u201cWho is Marcus? And you better know all the answers or I\u2019m going to shoot.\u201d</p><p>There was a firm set to her chin. Her lips were pressed tight and her eyes glittered, and it wasn\u2019t with fear. No, she seemed more than capable of shooting him just because she was pissed off.</p><p>\u201cCan I get up?\u201d he asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stay down. Start talking.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. He took a shot that Resnick knew what the hell he was talking about and hoped he wasn\u2019t wrong. \u201cYour brother sent me. He doesn\u2019t want you unprotected.\u201d</p><p>Surprise made her suddenly unsteady, and he tensed, hoping she didn\u2019t shoot him by accident. Then her eyes narrowed again. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen exactly would you have had this heart-to-heart?\u201d He took another stab and hoped he was right about Sarah not being in constant contact with Lattimer. He suspected she corresponded solely by email, judging by how fanatical she was about that damn laptop. \u201cYour brother isn\u2019t the type to spell things out through an email. Nothing\u2019s one hundred percent secure, you know. Plus, he didn\u2019t want to worry you. My job was to stay close and make sure you stayed safe.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSo why all the elaborate charade? You didn\u2019t have to date me to watch out for me.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze and remembered kissing her. Remembered touching her and stroking his hands over the curves of her body. And what he was about to tell her, while a lie, would be the absolute truth if her brother really had hired him to protect her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wanted to spend the time with you. You intrigued me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all that bullshit on the island was just you making sure our paths intersected repeatedly so you could do a job?\u201d</p><p>The note of incredulity in her voice was hard to miss. As was the sarcasm. But there was also a hint of hurt in her voice that twisted the knife a little further in his gut.</p><p>\u201cHell no, and I think you know that.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes and shook her head for a moment. The hand holding the gun wavered precariously, and he seized the opportunity before she accidentally pulled the trigger and made a woman out of him.</p><p>He rolled and grasped her wrist, pointing the gun toward the wall. Then he squeezed until she yelped in pain and the gun dropped with a clatter to the floor. He immediately eased off her wrist but held on while he reached for the gun with his other hand.</p><p>Still holding on to her hand, he hoisted himself up and then turned her arm over and rubbed his thumb over the mark he\u2019d made on the inside of her wrist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She yanked her arm back and clutched her arm to her chest, her eyes troubled as she stared nervously at him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p> <p>He popped the clip out of her gun and pocketed it before laying the pistol on a nearby end table. \u201cMy name is Garrett. I didn\u2019t lie about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tells me precisely nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for different people,\u201d he said. \u201cI protect people. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>She arched a delicate brow. \u201cYou\u2019re a mercenary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if I take money in return for my services, then yes. I don\u2019t work for free.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd how much are you being paid to protect me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it matter? What\u2019s important is that I keep you safe. I\u2019d think you\u2019d take a keen interest in that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect me to trust you. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>He had to control the wince. Yes, he wanted her to trust him even as he fed her a huge lie. He went on the offensive instead.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted you dead, you\u2019d be dead,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI damn sure wouldn\u2019t have gone through an elaborate charade to get close to you, and I damn sure wouldn\u2019t have kissed you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and he kicked himself for bringing it up. He wasn\u2019t trying to be manipulative and make it about emotions though it would certainly look that way in the end.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to.\u201d That much was the truth.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like she knew what to say to that. Confusion flickered in her eyes and then she turned away, her hands going to rub at her temples. When he walked around enough that he could see her face again, her utter fatigue flashed like a neon sign.</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the last time you slept?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She looked even more startled by the question. Her hands came away from her head and she stared at him like he was a puzzle she couldn\u2019t quite figure out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you, Garrett. I don\u2019t get any of this. Why are you here? I don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She raised her hand again and pressed her open palm to her forehead. \u201cLet me rephrase then. I don\u2019t want you here. Go home. I\u2019ve changed my mind. I don\u2019t want Marcus involved. Just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, growing more irritated by the minute. \u201cYou really think you can go it alone? Sarah, you\u2019re a victim waiting to happen. Hell, you\u2019ve been standing in front of the windows, gawking around like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up and she glared at him, her eyes flashing. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I have. I\u2019ve been here for two days scouting and making damn sure you weren\u2019t followed. You haven\u2019t exactly made it hard for anyone to find you. You may as well hang up a neon sign that says \u2018Sarah Daniels Is Here\u2019 and paint a big red X on your forehead.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with her hand and closed her eyes. \u201cGod, I was careful. I thought I was careful. Am I deluding myself? I don\u2019t know anything about hiding. I\u2019ve never had to hide.\u201d</p><p>She looked dangerously close to collapsing. Her shoulders slumped in a gesture of defeat, and she looked so damn small and vulnerable. He stepped forward, fully intending to pull her into his arms, but he hesitated. On the island he wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about it, but it was different now. He\u2019d misled her. She probably thought everything that happened on the island was merely an effort to gain her trust. And while that had been his initial intention, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t why he kissed her or why he was dying to do the same right here and right now. Only now he\u2019d upped the stakes. He\u2019d never outright lied to her before now.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>She looked up, her eyes raw, exhaustion practically screaming back at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to fully trust me yet, but right now you don\u2019t have a hell of a lot of choices. Until I know what the threat to you is and eliminate it, you\u2019re stuck with me. That has nothing to do with your brother or anyone else. It has to do with you being safe, and I\u2019ll do whatever I have to in order to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you care?\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her for a long time. \u201cI care. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>SARAH gawked back at Garrett, still trying to process the fact that he was standing in her house. In Mexico. She wanted to be furious\u2014she was furious\u2014but she was too damn tired and befuddled to do anything but stare like an idiot as she tried to take it all in.</p><p>Then she shook her head. Why the hell were they standing there talking about kissing?</p><p>He reached out and cupped his hand over her cheek. The touch was a jolt to her system and sent a flicker of awareness down her spine. He rubbed his thumb over her cheekbone, the pad rasping over her skin until a shiver crept up her nape.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep, Sarah. I\u2019ll watch over you. No one will hurt you. I need you at your best and then we need to get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>She swayed, hypnotized by the deep timbre of his voice. How easy he made it to fall under his spell.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this for you?\u201d Then as if she remembered, \u201cBesides the money,\u201d she said with a hint of bitterness.</p><p>His hand stilled on her face, and a slight current of tension raced through his fingertips. He seemed to struggle with the question, and she wondered if he\u2019d bother answering. Then he dropped his thumb until it rubbed over her lips. \u201cYou. You\u2019re what\u2019s in it for me.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, disconcerted by the utter seriousness she heard in his voice. He followed. She retreated until her back bumped against the wall and then he bumped into her, his body pressing against hers until his heat invaded her limbs.</p><p>She raised her hands, fully intent on shoving him back, but they stilled when they came into contact with his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you again, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m not,\u201d he growled just as his lips melted over hers.</p><p>This was stupid. They were kissing. She\u2019d just threatened him with a gun. He\u2019d just called her an idiot who was trying to get herself killed. He\u2019d purposely positioned himself on the island to get close to her. Their meeting hadn\u2019t been happenstance. He\u2019d lied.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. Not really. She\u2019d been an idiot for not being more careful. He hadn\u2019t had to lie to her because she\u2019d never pressed him for information. He\u2019d been there, a strong, steady presence and she\u2019d latched on like some pathetic moron. Much like she was doing now.</p><p>She stood still, determined not to respond. Determined that she could show indifference. That she was still angry over his deception. But he was patient. Oh, the man was patient. And lethal. He wooed her with his mouth, tasting, kissing each part of her lips before he gently teased her mouth open so his tongue gained entrance.</p><p>He savored her like she was something decadent and delicious, his tongue dancing lightly over hers and then stroking, warm and soft. She closed her eyes and swayed into him, her fingers digging into the hardness of his chest. She froze when her belly pressed into his groin and she felt the evidence of his arousal, hard and hot against her softness.</p><p>He cursed softly and pulled his mouth away, leaving only an inch between them. \u201cIgnore that,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. She couldn\u2019t help it. Her shoulders shook and she looked down and laughed all over again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is so funny?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDefinitely not good for a man\u2019s ego when a woman looks at his dick and laughs.\u201d</p><p>This time her laughter came out in breathless wheezes. She laughed so hard, tears gathered in the corners of her eyes and then streamed down her cheeks. He glared at her, his scowl growing more ferocious with every burst of laughter.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d she managed to get out. \u201cYou tell me to forget something that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying not to be an asshole,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>For some reason she found that even funnier. \u201cYou break into my house. You take my gun away from me. Informed me you lied about pretty much everything when we were on the island. Then tell me I\u2019m an idiot who\u2019s trying to get herself killed. And you\u2019re worried about being an asshole?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth then promptly shut it. Then he backed away and picked up her gun from the table he\u2019d laid it on. He turned it over in his hand then looked back up at her. \u201cNot a bad choice, but it\u2019s too big for you. You weren\u2019t holding it tight enough for it not to kick back and probably knock you on your ass. You need something smaller that fits your hand better. A .38 would be a good choice.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI was holding it tight enough to shoot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were aiming at my balls,\u201d he said in a disgruntled voice.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you start laughing again, I\u2019m going to kick your little ass.\u201d</p><p>She clapped a hand over her mouth to stifle the giggle that threatened to pop out.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get some rest. While you sleep, I\u2019ll figure out where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said I would go anywhere with you,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll talk more about that after you\u2019ve gotten some sleep.\u201d</p><p>It was really hard to maintain any semblance of anger or argue with him for that matter, when all she wanted was to lie down and do exactly as he suggested. And if he was telling the truth and really was here to protect her, then she could sleep without worry of who or what was out there.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll talk,\u201d she said by way of agreement. \u201cI want to know everything.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAs do I, Sarah. There\u2019s a hell of a lot I need to know if I\u2019m going to keep us both alive.\u201d</p><p>She was careful not to show any outward reaction, but panic curled in her stomach. She merely returned his nod, not trusting herself to speak. He wanted to know all, and she needed time to determine just how much of the truth she could tell him without telling him everything.</p><p>\u201cShow me around the inside of the house. I want to make sure you\u2019re going to sleep in a secure area where there isn\u2019t a threat from the outside.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach still churning, she guided him toward the large open living area that served as dining room and living room all rolled into one. He alternated between shaking his head and cursing under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t go into this room. Period. And stay the hell away from the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is where I stay most of the time. I can see everything from here. I\u2019d know if someone was approaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you knew I was here?\u201d he asked balefully.</p><p>She flushed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t most people. You were probably skulking around in the bushes wearing camouflage paint and wearing shrubs on your head.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and held up his hand, and she braced herself for the lecture she knew he was about to deliver.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, if you can see out, they can damn well see in. And at night, you can\u2019t see a damn thing out there, but with the lights on, they can see you bright as day. Second, anyone who comes after you is damn well not going to walk up and knock on your front door. He\u2019d position himself out there in the bushes and he\u2019d put a bullet through your head the minute you stuck your head out of the house.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from her face and she closed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re right, okay? I didn\u2019t think ... I mean I don\u2019t know how to think like a ... a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have me,\u201d he said. \u201cNow let\u2019s get the hell out from in front of these windows. From now until we leave, this room is off limits.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and followed him toward the hall where the two bedrooms were located. He poked his head in the first and promptly backed out, shaking his head. \u201cNot this one. Too vulnerable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed.</p><p>He opened the door at the end of the hall and stood in the entryway for a few moments before motioning her in. It was the smaller of the two bedrooms with only a twin bed, but at the moment, she didn\u2019t care. There was only one window, a small square situated at the top of the wall just under the ceiling. Just right to let sunlight pour into the room but not large enough for a human to get in or out of.</p><p>He turned and nearly bumped into her. He grasped her shoulders to steady her and then guided her toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cI want you to sleep. I\u2019ll wake you in a few hours and we\u2019ll get on the road. I\u2019d rather not stay in Mexico a minute longer than I have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk first,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll decide whether or not I\u2019m leaving with you. Marcus said I\u2019d be safe here. I only just got here. Why would I leave?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that suggested she wasn\u2019t going to get a choice in the matter. She glared back and curled her lip to show him her irritation. He merely winked at her and her mouth fell open in shock. He\u2019d winked at her? Such a playful action was in direct contradiction to every opinion she\u2019d formed about him. Then she scowled because she realized he was just messing with her.</p><p>\u201cAll yours,\u201d he said, gesturing grandly toward the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll mosey on out\u2014unless, of course, you need my help undressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck,\u201d she muttered as she shoved by him to sit on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to get undressed anyway.\u201d</p><p>She flopped back onto the mattress and closed her eyes. The bed dipped, and alarmed, she opened her eyes only to find herself staring up at Garrett as he loomed over her.</p> <p>He had both hands planted on either side of her shoulders and his knees were straddling her. He leaned down and brushed his lips across hers. This time he didn\u2019t linger. Didn\u2019t wade into a long, hot exchange as he had before. He touched his finger to the spot he\u2019d kissed and then murmured, \u201cSweet dreams, Sarah. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>Then he backed off the bed and left the room without a backward glance. She lay there, stunned by her reaction to him. More stunned by the yearning that kicked through her soul with enough force to make her heart ache.</p><p>She needed to email Marcus and ask him about Garrett, but her laptop was in the living room shoved under one of the cushions of the couch. As soon as she got up, she\u2019d take care of contacting Marcus. Maybe by then she\u2019d be able to think. Perhaps Garrett was the solution. She could accept Marcus\u2019s protection\u2014through Garrett\u2014without having to be in close proximity to Marcus. They\u2019d both be safe.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>GARRETT let himself back into the house with his bag and rifle. He did a quick run-through and secured most of his equipment to his belt. He slipped two knives into loops on either side of his pants and made damn sure his grenade was secure. He still hadn\u2019t lived down Sophie lifting a grenade from him when all the shit had gone down with her father.</p><p>He made the rounds again, securing the broken back door in the process. He rigged a nice little surprise for anyone who decided to make an unexpected entrance. He prowled down the hall and nudged Sarah\u2019s door open so he could peek inside. Not that she had an escape route. And not that he even expected to find her awake. She\u2019d been dead on her feet, and the deep shadows under her eyes had lent a bruised, defeated look that hadn\u2019t improved his mood one iota.</p> <p>No, he liked watching her sleep. There was something infinitely fragile\u2014and angelic\u2014about her. Delicate eyelashes rested on her cheeks and the soft, even rise of her chest signaled that she was deep under. He watched her for a long moment, still perplexed by the hold she seemed to have on him.</p><p>When he should have been motivated to grab her ass and beat a path out of the country as fast as he could, instead he\u2019d kissed her and acted like an asshole on the make.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been pissed. She\u2019d laughed\u2014and lord but she had a beautiful laugh, even when she was laughing at his damn hard-on. He\u2019d grumbled, but the truth was, he\u2019d have stood there all day, dick flapping in the wind to bring such merriment to her eyes.</p><p>He backed out of her room and went into the kitchen to set up the sat phone and the small laptop he carried with him. Then he began a meticulous search of the house. He needed to find that laptop. There weren\u2019t many computers Donovan couldn\u2019t woo like a lover.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take too long to find, wedged underneath one of the cushions on the sofa. He needed to work fast because he wasn\u2019t sure how long Sarah would sleep even though she was completely dead on her feet.</p><p>He opened her laptop next to his equipment on the kitchen table and placed the call to Donovan. Donovan answered on the third ring. He sounded distracted though, and there were odd noises in the background that sounded like a cat in distress.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on there?\u201d Garrett demanded.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute. Charlotte isn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, Sophie needed a nap and Sam has been up all night. I think Charlotte needs a diaper change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, don\u2019t let me interrupt all that domestic bliss,\u201d Garrett said dryly. \u201cNever mind I\u2019m on a tight schedule over here and need this done like yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever try changing a baby\u2019s diaper while trying to save the world? It ain\u2019t easy. These things need to come with instruction manuals.\u201d</p><p>Garrett listened and cringed when he heard what sounded suspiciously like baby goo-goo nonsense coming from Donovan.</p><p>\u201cYou have lost your damn mind,\u201d Garrett muttered. Several moments later, the noise died down and Donovan spoke back into the phone. \u201cMiss Charlotte is all happy. Now, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my hands on Sarah\u2019s laptop. I was hoping to get you dialed in so you could poke around and eavesdrop on her conversations with Lattimer.\u201d</p><p>Donovan immediately went into a series of directions that made Garrett\u2019s eyes roll back in his head. Garrett followed them to a T and listened to Donovan\u2019s satisfied exclamations as he \u201cgot in.\u201d</p><p>As Donovan continued to talk to himself and to the computer in question, Garrett glanced over to see a folded piece of paper that had fallen out of the laptop when he opened it. Idly, he picked it up and opened it up to see a bunch of stuff that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to him. But he guaranteed it would mean something to Donovan.</p><p>\u201cHey Van, this might be something.\u201d He started reading off the list of what looked to be instructions and Donovan broke in excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWait, go back. From the beginning. Let me get all this down.\u201d</p><p>Garrett repeated everything on the piece of paper and periodically cocked his head in the direction of Sarah\u2019s bedroom, but all remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cGive me a sec to get back to my desk. I think you just gave me access to her email account. I also have some other info for you.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sighed and waited for his brother to get his act together. Although he couldn\u2019t say much because of all the Kellys, Donovan was the most organized. It bordered on some obsessive-compulsive disorder that the rest of them damn sure didn\u2019t suffer from. Sam was probably the closest to being an anal bastard as Donovan.</p><p>\u201cOkay, while I\u2019m getting into this account, I\u2019ll tell what else I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ve been doing some digging. I\u2019ve called in some huge favors\u2014the kind that could get people in some deep shit, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Garrett perked up at that. \u201cWhat kind of favors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to know if Resnick has been feeding us a line of bullshit. I also wanted to see if I could figure out Lattimer\u2019s last known location. And what his connection to Allen Cross was.</p><p>\u201cResnick\u2019s already started squawking. He doesn\u2019t buy for a minute that you bailed on the mission. He\u2019s pissed and raising hell. Threatening Sam and KGI and making all sorts of threats against humanity.\u201d</p><p>Garrett rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure that breaks Sam\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, no luck on running Lattimer down. Resnick doesn\u2019t have a clue, which isn\u2019t making him happy, especially now that you\u2019ve gone off the radar with Sarah. He\u2019s seeing his chance to nail Lattimer sliding down the toilet, and he wants Lattimer at any cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d Garrett muttered. Although he wasn\u2019t as willing to throw Sarah to the wolves as Resnick was. Garrett wasn\u2019t a half-measure kind of guy. He figured there was no good reason why he couldn\u2019t nail Lattimer and also keep Sarah safe in the process.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an unknown in the equation here, Van. Lattimer wouldn\u2019t have someone break into her cottage and scare the shit out of her. Neither would Resnick. Resnick\u2019s going to sit back and bait the trap. Sarah was spooked enough that she hauled ass off the island. She had an escape route planned from the time she set foot there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two actually. Unless your guy on the island is the same lead I have.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shook his head. Of course there was. Donovan did love to tell a good story. Garrett was more of a get-to-the-point sort of guy. Donovan liked to drag shit out for maximum effect.</p><p>\u201cWho now?\u201d he asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cStanley Cross. Allen\u2019s brother. In my digging, I found out Resnick uncovered the fact that Cross has hired a private recovery firm to bring Sarah in. Interesting that Resnick didn\u2019t see fit to share that little tidbit with us. Stanley is throwing a lot of money around. He seems pretty desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, that\u2019s all I need. Some mercenary wannabe wading in to throw Sarah over his shoulder and haul her home like a Neanderthal. He\u2019d probably get her killed inside of an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not planning to go all Neanderthal on her?\u201d Donovan asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get her killed.\u201d</p><p>Donovan chuckled and then his laughter trailed off. \u201cResnick doesn\u2019t know I know. And don\u2019t ask how I found out. Let\u2019s just say if I\u2019m ever asked to donate a kidney, I won\u2019t have a choice but to say yes. He\u2019s holding out on us, which is why I haven\u2019t busted your chops for holding out on him. I figure you\u2019re in the situation, you know it better than anyone, so the call is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d Garrett said dryly. \u201cI want to get the hell out of here with Sarah. What do you have for me? I don\u2019t want to lure Lattimer on his own turf. I want him where we have the advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a place. I didn\u2019t want to use any of the KGI usual haunts. Resnick would look there first. It\u2019ll be a little tricky getting there, but you\u2019ve got to ditch her current digs quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate when you use words like that. It\u2019s usually a gross understatement. Just how bad am I going to hate this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfognak Island, off the coast of Alaska. Logging camp and an out-of-commission lodge are all that\u2019s there and no one\u2019s on the island right now. They shut down operations last year. I have a contact with the tribe that owns the island and the lodge. The best part is that it will be virtually impossible for Lattimer to get on that island without our team knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaska? Could you have picked anywhere farther?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah well, just wait until I tell you the roundabout way you\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me. You\u2019re enjoying this way too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m worried, Garrett. This is a complete clusterfuck. I have Steele and part of his team en route. They\u2019re going to completely secure the island before you and Sarah get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? You\u2019re not going to argue and tell me to fuck off and give me a line about how you\u2019re going out on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck you, Van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the love. You\u2019re such a sensitive soul. I bet you read poetry to Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Garrett scowled. He may not have read poetry but leaving a basket of wine, books and chocolate on her porch came damn close.</p><p>\u201cCan we get back to the matter at hand? What arrangements have you made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll travel to Belize City. Guy at Pedro Air, a private charter service, fly-by-night operation, will take you to Jamaica. From there you\u2019ll hook up with Rio, who has a friend with a jet who\u2019ll fly you to Kodiak Island. From there you\u2019ll take a sea plane to Afognak Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eyes are crossing thinking about it. And what\u2019s Rio doing in Jamaica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called in everyone I can on this, Garrett. This seemingly innocuous mission is a hell of a lot more complicated than we thought. I have a bad feeling about this one. At no point are we going to let our guard down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate the backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you GPS coordinates so you know exactly where you\u2019re going, and I\u2019m sending you all the contacts and their information. The charters are cargo based and there\u2019ll be no passenger manifest, so that you and Sarah can\u2019t easily be traced.

Figured out that angle yet?\u201d</p><p>Donovan sighed. \u201cNo, but more and more I think it has everything to do with Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Garrett had the exact same feeling. It settled deep into his belly like after eating bad Chinese food.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m in. I was right. This is a secure email account. I\u2019ll have to be damn careful to wipe my fingerprints.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do they say? Is she emailing Lattimer? I just got through telling her he sent me. I need to know how long I\u2019ve got before that busts wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be able to help you out there,\u201d Donovan murmured. \u201cIf you give me an hour or so, I can make it so her emails are rerouted to me. Then I can answer as if I were Lattimer and cover your ass in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be emailing anyone for the next hour,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cShe\u2019s practically in a coma. What\u2019s been said so far and how many emails have they exchanged? I need all the information I can get if I\u2019m pretending an association with the asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. At first he was frantic wanting to know where she was. Then the tone changed once he seemed to know her location. She emailed him after she ditched you. Told him she was headed to Mexico and asked him for help. He told her where to go. His emails have been short and to the point. He\u2019s a careful bastard. He only gives her what is absolutely necessary. She isn\u2019t much better. She emailed him once she got there and told him she was fine and not to worry. Interestingly enough, all her emails have been about protecting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? What can she possibly do to protect him?\u201d It was on the tip of his tongue to ask why she\u2019d want to protect Lattimer, but he already had his answer to that. No matter what, Sarah was loyal and goodhearted to the bone, and Lattimer was her brother. Hell, for all he knew, she didn\u2019t know exactly what a bastard her brother was. He damn sure hadn\u2019t done anything to alleviate the loneliness of her childhood.</p> <p>\u201cThink about it, Garrett. If she saw him murder Cross and everything points to that being fact, she could be used to bring him down. It\u2019s certainly what the Cross family is thinking. To a lot of people Sarah represents a surefire way to get to Lattimer, Resnick included.\u201d</p><p>And himself. Garrett had to include himself in the number of people willing to exploit Sarah to get to her brother. He swallowed and refused to dwell on how much of a bastard it made him feel. He just had to keep reminding himself that the end justified the means.</p><p>\u201cSarah has to know that. If she can\u2019t be found, she can\u2019t be made to testify against her brother.\u201d</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath. Yeah, he\u2019d buy that. Sarah would be intensely loyal, but he was also disappointed that she\u2019d be so blind in her loyalty to her brother that she\u2019d ignore the cold-blooded killing of another human being. Maybe his sense of justice was more black-and-white than Sarah\u2019s, but it bugged him that she\u2019d walk way.</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Garrett said in a grim voice. \u201cIn a sick, twisted way, it makes sense. Thanks for covering my ass with the emails. It\u2019ll buy me some more time. If her emails are redirected and Lattimer is no longer getting them, it could work in my favor because she\u2019ll no longer be telling him she\u2019s okay. He\u2019ll worry. He\u2019ll no longer be content with a casual search while she\u2019s there reassuring him that all is well. He\u2019ll want to find her, and I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t envy you, brother. Sarah isn\u2019t going to be happy when the shit hits the fan.\u201d</p> <p>No, she wouldn\u2019t. But Garrett couldn\u2019t dwell on that right now no matter how much it bothered him. He had a job to do. He had justice to see even if Sarah refused to do so. He had a longtime promise to his fallen teammates to fulfill. His honor wouldn\u2019t allow for anything else, even if he lost some of it in the process.</p><p>The greater good. It was all about the greater good. But somehow shitting on a woman like Sarah for that greater good didn\u2019t leave him with any satisfaction.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>SARAH came awake to a gentle hand on her shoulder. It became more persistent and her head wobbled as her eyelids fluttered open.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sarah. Time to wake up. We\u2019ve got a lot to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>She rose up on one elbow and shoved her hair out of her face. She stared at him through bleary eyes as she tried to blink away the veil of sleep.</p> <p>\u201cSo I didn\u2019t dream you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you had a very nice dream about a really good-looking guy.\u201d</p><p>Though he delivered his teasing with a perfectly straight face, his blue eyes held a devilish glint. She shook her head to rid herself of the cobwebs. Talk. He wanted to talk, which meant he also wanted answers she wasn\u2019t prepared to give. She definitely needed a clear head so she didn\u2019t screw this up.</p><p>\u201cDo I have time for a shower before we have this talk?\u201d</p><p>He made a show of checking his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll give you five minutes and then we meet back here in this room. It\u2019s the safest place to be.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cFive minutes? It\u2019s obvious you\u2019re not married and have probably never lived with a woman. You don\u2019t give a woman five minutes to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look impressed by her response. \u201cFive minutes or I come in after you. They start now.\u201d</p><p>Good God, he was serious. And he\u2019d actually do it too. She didn\u2019t doubt that for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou now have four minutes and forty-five seconds.\u201d</p><p>She dove for the end of the bed and ran for the bathroom, his chuckle following as she nearly killed herself getting out of the door.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d she grumbled as she turned on the shower. He was probably used to hosing off in three minutes in the military. Well, she wasn\u2019t in the military and furthermore, it took longer than five minutes just to wash her hair.</p><p>Still, his threat rang in her ears, and she wasn\u2019t entirely certain that he wouldn\u2019t come in after her so while she stuck her head under the spray to rinse the shampoo, she scrubbed the other parts of her body.</p><p>She momentarily got caught up in the absolute bliss of the hot water raining down over her. Instead of energizing her, as she\u2019d hoped a shower would do, it made her want to crawl back into bed and sleep for about a year.</p><p>In disgust, she reached for the knob and turned the hot water completely off. The result was an icy blast that made her yelp as it pricked her body like little ice pellets. At least she wasn\u2019t mooning over how good the bed would feel again.</p><p>As she stepped from the shower, shivering, Garrett pounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cSarah? Is everything okay in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, fine!\u201d she called. The last thing she wanted was for him to make good on his threat. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in just a minute, promise.\u201d</p><p>She hurriedly dried and then pulled on her underwear and jeans over her still-damp skin. She struggled with her bra, and in her haste, she managed to put the damn thing on inside out. God, but she was a mess. With a laugh, she righted her bra and then yanked on her shirt. She wasn\u2019t even going to bother with her hair. If he was so determined that she make it out in five minutes, then he\u2019d just have to deal with her looking like a drowned rat. More like a horde of rats had taken up residence in her tangled tresses.</p><p>She gave one last wipe to her hair so it wasn\u2019t actually dripping and then gave up and opened the door. Garrett was leaning against the opposite wall and he raised an eyebrow.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat? You gave me five minutes. This is what happens when you give a woman only five minutes in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, I didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. It was that look you gave me like you were staring at Medusa.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and kicked off the wall. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell were you looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard to figure out.\u201d</p><p>She glanced downward and saw that her shirt was clinging very damply to her bra, which was also ... damp, which in turn gave him a pretty darn good glimpse of her breasts and the outline of her nipples.</p><p>\u201cOh hell.\u201d She turned and charged back into the bathroom to get another towel. \u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you hollering about?\u201d he asked from the doorway.</p><p>She turned around, armed with a towel that she held strategically over her chest. \u201cI turned the cold water on so I could wake up. You said you wanted to talk. I can\u2019t talk if all I want to do is go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back into the hallway and gestured for her to precede him back into the bedroom. She plopped onto the bed and switched the towel for a pillow and held it to her chest as she made herself comfortable.</p><p>Garrett loomed\u2014there was no other word for it\u2014over the end of the bed. He was a big man, and in such a small bedroom, he seemed to take up every available inch. He made her nervous.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, sit down or something. I can\u2019t think with you hovering like that.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of amusement but accommodated her by settling on the end of the bed. But that only brought him closer and made the entire setting feel decidedly intimate.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, his gaze moving over her face in a way that made her think he was peeling her skin back. \u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d</p><p>That was a stupid question. Something an oblivious man would totally ask. So she ignored him and stared pointedly, waiting for him to begin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put my cards on the table. It\u2019s time for you to deal yours.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and then she narrowed them in irritation. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything of the sort. I know your name and that my brother supposedly sent you\u2014which, by the way, I plan to confirm.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shook his head and sighed. \u201cYou have no sense of self-preservation, Sarah. You and I have to work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was the bad guy feeding you a line about your brother sending me, you just tipped your hand and put me on notice. If I was threatened by that, it would be awfully damn easy to make you sure you weren\u2019t capable of checking in with Lattimer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the good guy, and I want to teach you not to make mistakes that could get you killed.\u201d</p><p>He looked indulgent, like he was having to display a large degree of patience with her na\u00efvet\u00e9. Okay, she got it. She was a complete moron. But in her defense, there weren\u2019t any classes where one learned the art of deception and cloak-and-dagger crap that was the hallmark of overwrought spy thriller movies.</p><p>Much was said about common sense, but common sense was for the generalities of life. No one she knew had experience with murder and hiding from the law.</p><p>\u201cCut me some slack,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI know I\u2019m an idiot. I get it. I do.\u201d She rubbed her hand over her forehead and a wave of hopelessness hit her like a tsunami. Who was she kidding? She was never going to survive on her own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot,\u201d Garrett said in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your very normal life upended. You\u2019ve made some bad choices, and you haven\u2019t been as careful as you should, but that\u2019s where I come in. I\u2019m going to do my damndest to make sure nothing happens to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you only knew,\u201d she murmured. Then she let out a dry laugh. \u201cBad decisions. If I could only go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think that way. You play with the cards your dealt and you move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou strike me as someone who lives with no regrets,\u201d she said, intensely jealous of how grounded and confident he always appeared.</p><p>He seemed surprised by her observation and he laughed, but the sound wasn\u2019t one of amusement.</p><p>\u201cMy attitude is born of necessity. I\u2019ve made mistakes. I\u2019ve made decisions I regretted. I know what it\u2019s like to live with regret. I live with it every day. But if I let it take over, I\u2019d never get out of bed in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The frank, raw note in his voice shook her. For a moment she got a glimpse of the man beyond the self-assured, steady exterior. For some reason it reassured her and put them on more of an equal footing.</p><p>He stared back at her, neither of them speaking. She was unwilling to break the brief moment of connection\u2014true connection\u2014and she savored that he\u2019d shared something beyond casual conversation. He hadn\u2019t said much but it had been what he said. She wasn\u2019t the only person to make mistakes\u2014though hers seemed so much larger and the consequences so much more far-reaching, but how was she to know the true depth of his mistakes?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in Boston, Sarah?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Garrett watched as the blood drained from Sarah\u2019s face. She went as pale as the sheets rumpled around her. Her arms tightened around the pillow she held so close to her chest and she dug her chin into it until only her eyes shone over the top. Damn. He didn\u2019t want to scare the hell out of her, but he had to pry the information out.</p><p>\u201cI need to know what you saw, Sarah,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI need to know what kind of danger you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>If possible, she went even whiter. For a moment she closed her eyes and when she reopened them he saw a vulnerability so deep that he wanted to reach out and hold her.</p><p>\u201cIt was best that I left,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI can\u2019t go back. I\u2019ve resigned myself to that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life running? That\u2019s no way to live, Sarah. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. I need ...\u201d He ran his hand through his hair back and forth in agitation. He hated the hypocrisy in what he was about to say to her. He hated that would ask her to give him something he had no right to given his deception. \u201cI need for you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her eyes dull. \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>So starkly said, the words hit him hard. There was a wealth of emotion even when her expression was so dim and lifeless.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>She refocused on him, blinking as their gazes met.</p> <p>\u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p><p>And she could. With her life. Her well-being. He\u2019d do whatever necessary to keep her safe. He wasn\u2019t being honest with her, and that was something he\u2019d have to live with. But she could damn well trust that he\u2019d never let anyone hurt her.</p><p>Somehow he would separate what he had to do in order to bring down her brother and shield her in the process. She would see it as a betrayal. She was too loyal, too loving and giving to accept what he had to do. But it was the right thing to do and somehow, someway, even if it took forever, he\u2019d make her understand that. He didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>Her struggle was vivid, played across her face and awash in her eyes. He saw an intense desire to be able to trust him. She was so wary but she longed for someone to lean on. And damn it, he wanted to be that person.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>She locked gazes with him again.</p> <p>\u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p><p>The lie that wasn\u2019t a lie. Was anything ever straightforward? Life was a study in shades of gray. As black and white as he tended to view the world, here and now he understood the pull between right and wrong. Between what he had to do and what he wanted. He didn\u2019t like it. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what happened the day you walked into the building where Allen Cross was murdered.\u201d</p><p>He watched her battle the tears, but she blinked them back and swallowed, her jaw tightening. \u201cI saw Allen Cross die. I wasn\u2019t in time. I wasn\u2019t in time,\u201d she repeated helplessly.</p><p>Garrett\u2019s frowned and leaned forward. \u201cWasn\u2019t in time for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have prevented it. Oh God, I could have stopped it.\u201d</p><p>A spasm of grief crossed her face. It was uncomfortable to witness, and for a moment he wanted to pull her into his arms and drop the entire subject. It was a stupid, emotional reaction\u2014one he couldn\u2019t afford to consider. Too much was at stake here.</p><p>\u201cHow could you have prevented it, Sarah? Did your brother threaten Cross?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcus doesn\u2019t make threats. He doesn\u2019t posture. He acts.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to tell by the inflection of her voice whether her statement was a criticism or a bleak statement of fact. There was no pride in the words.</p><p>\u201cThen how could you have prevented it?\u201d Garrett asked again.</p><p>He might not be that intuitive when it came to women, but his gut was starting to scream. Some of the puzzle pieces were coming together. He didn\u2019t know why it hadn\u2019t clicked for him before. But now the facts were there, laid out in front of him and he had a very bad feeling he knew exactly what had prompted Marcus Lattimer to go to Allen Cross\u2019s office and shoot him in cold blood.</p><p>He met her gaze, saw so much more than he had even five minutes ago. \u201cWho hurt you, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>Her face lost all color again and her eyes went blank, like a deep freeze or a white-out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>The words stuttered out, utterly unconvincing.</p><p>He reached over to take her hand. She tried to retreat, but he held firm and gently rubbed his thumb up and down her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re as skittish as an abused animal. Someone hurt you. I think I finally understand what happened and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why ask if you already know everything? You have it all figured out. You don\u2019t need me to spill my insides.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t put off by the bitterness is her voice. He may have lied about Lattimer, but there was one thing he planned to be blindingly honest with her about.</p><p>\u201cI need to know,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd I need to know because I can\u2019t live every minute wanting to kiss you and touch you, all the while knowing that someone made you afraid. Not just of me but all men.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and her lips parted in a gasp of surprise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be afraid of me, Sarah. More than anything, I want you to trust me. I want you to be able to feel my touch and know that I\u2019m never going to hurt you. I want you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized how much he wanted her to touch him until he\u2019d said the words. He wanted to feel those soft hands on his skin. His groin ached and throbbed. He wanted her fingers wrapped around his dick, stroking with her featherlight caress and then firmer. He wanted her on every inch of his body. He wanted to see the contrast of her paleness against his darker skin.</p><p>He wanted to taste her and for her to taste him. Sweat beaded his forehead and his breaths had shallowed until it embarrassed him. He was panting after her like a moron, but she flipped every one of his switches, and some he hadn\u2019t even known he had.</p><p>He wanted to make love to her. He wanted her to trust him enough to take that step. He wanted to show her that he\u2019d never hurt her.</p><p>Her surprise turned to hurt, her gaze growing dim. He hated the sadness that was deep seated there. It was like watching day turn to night as some of the light went out and shadows stretched like storm clouds through her eyes. She pulled her hand away and he let her this time.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, Garrett,\u201d she said in a brave voice that trembled with the effort it took her to make the admission. \u201cSomeone did hurt me. More than that, he took something away that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever get back.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to control the rage that mounted with every breath he took. He willed himself to remain still and not to outwardly react. She seemed so hesitant\u2014and vulnerable\u2014almost as if she expected him to back away as though she had the plague.</p><p>But he knew. Goddamn it, he knew that Cross had been the one who raped her. Everything clicked together at light speed. Her quitting her job with Cross and not taking one since.</p><p>It even made sense why Lattimer had killed the son of a bitch, and as much as Garrett loathed Lattimer, he understood why. There was plenty to condemn Lattimer for, but not this.</p><p>Sarah turned her haunted gaze to Garrett, and he saw her visibly withdraw. The walls went up, almost as if bracing herself for his rejection.</p><p>Instead, he eased forward, moving inch by inch until he slid his hand over hers again, cupping it protectively in his palm. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe raped me,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI trusted him and he raped me.\u201d</p><p>He wished he was one of these guys who always knew the right thing to say at the right time, but he wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t subtle. He didn\u2019t know how to be sensitive and he sucked at words. He acted. That was who he was.</p><p>He reached out and tenderly nudged her chin with his free hand until their gazes met again. Tears shimmered in her beautiful eyes and he remembered all the times before when she\u2019d been so stalwart, on the verge of tears but never letting them fall. Had she ever cried for herself? Had she ever given herself permission to grieve?</p><p>\u201cHoney, you gave him your trust. He shit on that. That\u2019s on him. Not you. Never you. I\u2019d like to find the bastard and cut his nuts off, but I know that doesn\u2019t help you now.\u201d</p><p>She gave a shaky laugh and a single tear slipped down her cheek. He caught it with his thumb and whisked it away but continued to stroke her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMarcus killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut it was a nice image, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>This time her laughter was stronger and some of the light flooded back into her eyes. And damn if he didn\u2019t want to pull her into his arms and tell her it would be okay. But he had no way of knowing that. It was just words, and she didn\u2019t need platitudes.</p><p>And just as quickly, her face crumpled and she took her hand from his and wiped at her eyes. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m laughing and a man died because of me. Because I didn\u2019t stand up for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deserved to die,\u201d Garrett said fiercely. \u201cAny man who preys on a woman deserves a long, painful death. He doesn\u2019t deserve your regret or your guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just him. My brother killed him for me. When he found out what Cross had done, he was so furious. I shouldn\u2019t have told him. But he knew. He knew something horrible had happened.\u201d</p><p>She was babbling now, talking fast, the words tumbling over each other, but he remained silent and let her get it out.</p><p>\u201cI was so devastated. I couldn\u2019t even go out of my apartment. Isn\u2019t that ridiculous? I was afraid to go out because it would mean unlocking my door. I didn\u2019t want to chance seeing him even though the odds of our paths crossing when I no longer worked for him were nil. I didn\u2019t go to the police because I heard Allen telling me over and over that no one would ever believe me. It\u2019s so stupid. Why did I believe him? Why did I allow him control even after it was over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot stupid,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes were glassy, and she was lost in another time and place. Locked in her past. Reliving it with each breath. He\u2019d asked for her trust, but he hadn\u2019t realized what it would cost her. And he hadn\u2019t realized how painful it would be for him to hear. Even though he\u2019d strongly suspected what had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cMarcus doesn\u2019t visit. I mean, not often. I\u2019m sure you know he ...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t spend much time in the States. But we email often. He always looks out for me. Wants to know if there\u2019s anything I need.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d been trying to get in touch with me and was worried when he couldn\u2019t reach me so he came to my apartment. It had been months. Months. And for me, it was like it had just happened the week before. At first I refused to tell Marcus, but he wouldn\u2019t relent. He was so worried. He wanted to take me to a doctor. He thought I was ill. When I finally told him, he went crazy. I thought it was all talk. People say things in the heat of the moment all the time but they don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe meant it,\u201d she repeated bleakly. \u201cHe spent so much time with me that it slid away, his threats, the words he said when he was so angry. He took me places. Bullied me to eat. Made me laugh again. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without him. He saved my life. I know that sounds so dramatic, and I know you think I\u2019m probably still a mess and I\u2019m this scared little mouse, but it was so much worse then. It felt like something broke inside me and I didn\u2019t know how to fix it. I\u2019ve always been na\u00efve. I know that about myself. I\u2019ve been called a Goody Two-shoes. Miss See the Best in Everyone. He took that from me. I never imagined in a million years that he would have done something like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself a good person. I\u2019ve never done anything to purposely hurt anyone. I was in shock that this happened to me, and because it did, I turned into this vengeful person. I\u2019ve never truly hated anyone, but I was glad when I saw him lying there on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Garrett could stand it no longer. The ache in her voice, the absolute devastation was tangible. He pulled her into his arms and pressed her cheek to his chest. She didn\u2019t resist as he stroked his hand through her hair. He closed his eyes and pressed his lips to the top of her head.</p><p>When she spoke again, her voice was muffled by his shirt. He shifted and pulled her more firmly against him, but turning so that he could hear.</p><p>\u201cMarcus began making plans. He talked of taking me away. I let him take charge. I thought at the time he was still worried and wanted to take me someplace he could keep an eye on me and so that I would get away from where it all happened. I didn\u2019t realize what he\u2019d planned until the day we were supposed to leave. I was packed. Marcus had made all the arrangements. His jet was waiting for us. And then Marcus said he had a last-minute appointment. He asked me to wait and that he\u2019d send his driver for me as soon as he was finished and he\u2019d meet me at the airport. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been in such a fog, I would have realized much sooner that Marcus would never have let it go. He was too furious after I told him. But that\u2019s just it. I didn\u2019t think. I never imagined ...\u201d</p><p>Garrett squeezed her lightly and rubbed his hand up and down her arm to offer her the comfort she needed.</p><p>\u201cI think I know the rest,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou went to try to stop Marcus. Allen was already dead. I think I know why you bolted instead of going ahead with the plan to go away with your brother.\u201d</p><p>She shifted and turned her face upward, which sent her body snuggling even closer to his chest. He caught her, wanting to keep her there as her gaze found his. \u201cIf I stayed\u2014if someone saw me or placed me at the crime scene\u2014I\u2019d either be a suspect or I\u2019d be forced to testify against Marcus. No one knows of our relationship. No one would have reason to connect us. It was better if I was as far away from him as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett was torn. Well and truly torn. If he didn\u2019t hate Lattimer so much, he\u2019d shake his hand for taking care of the scumbag who\u2019d hurt Sarah. Somehow the idea of taking him down didn\u2019t hold quite the appeal it did before. Sarah had been bitterly betrayed by a man she trusted, and now she\u2019d be betrayed again. By a man who\u2019d asked her to trust him, even knowing how much it cost her.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment before she laid her head back down against his shoulder and tentatively trailed her hand up his arm until she tucked her fingers around the ball of his other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI owe so much to Marcus. I can\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t be used against him. He should never have done what he did. But he did it for me. Because he loves me. I know he isn\u2019t perfect. I suspect he\u2019s done some not-so-nice things, but thinking and knowing are two different things. No matter what he\u2019s done, I won\u2019t have him imprisoned because of me.\u201d</p><p>Garrett had to bite his tongue to keep from telling Sarah just what a bastard Marcus was. She\u2019d already been dealt a shock, on top of a traumatic attack. He couldn\u2019t\u2014and wouldn\u2019t\u2014further destroy her illusions. Not until he had to.</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p> <p>DESPITE her conversation with Garrett, Sarah pulled out her laptop from where she\u2019d hidden it underneath the sofa cushion and carried it into the bedroom so she could check her email while she packed. Or that was her excuse. She hadn\u2019t unpacked. All she had to do was put on her shoes and she was ready to leave. Again. This time not alone. With Garrett.</p><p>The relief she felt over that detail was telling. It was staggering even. She was weary to her toes and tired of the fear that seemed to overwhelm her more with each passing day.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a new email from Marcus, so she opened a blank one and typed the longest message she\u2019d sent to date. She allowed some of the emotion she\u2019d kept under wraps to bleed into her words. She was still careful not to state specifics\u2014she couldn\u2019t be absolutely certain her emails weren\u2019t intercepted. But she hoped she allayed Marcus\u2019s fears by telling him she\u2019d agreed to accompany the man he\u2019d sent to protect her.</p><p>She looked up when she saw Garrett step to her doorway and knock lightly on the frame.</p><p>\u201cWe need to make tracks. One thing you should be aware of is that Allen Cross\u2019s family has hired a private recovery firm to find you. His brother is footing the bill and apparently money is no object. It wasn\u2019t hard to find you here, and I expect it would be just as easy for anyone else, given the right motivation.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from her cheeks, and she swayed from her perch on the edge of the bed. She put her hand down on the mattress to steady herself and gripped her laptop with the other.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let them take me back,\u201d she said in a low voice. She hadn\u2019t intended it to come out as a question, but it was so hesitantly said, that it conveyed her uncertainty in neon glow.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body.\u201d</p><p>Bolstered by the absolute confidence in his voice, she allowed some of the panic to recede. She hadn\u2019t dared tell Marcus all of it\u2014of Stanley\u2019s involvement. Not after he\u2019d killed Allen. There would be no more blood on her brother\u2019s\u2014or her\u2014hands, if she could help it.</p><p>She was reaching for her bag when she realized she had no idea where they were going. Garrett intercepted the large bag that held her clothes and tossed it over his shoulder. She stood and stuffed her laptop into its case and glanced around to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed anything.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>There was a slight quirk to the corner of his mouth, almost as if he was amused. \u201cAlaska.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and then narrowed. \u201cAlaska? I\u2019d prefer to stay out of the U.S. I don\u2019t want to risk going back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more risky than where you are right now. You\u2019ve been found out at the two places you\u2019ve chosen, so it\u2019s my turn. That trust thing we talked about? Now\u2019s the time for you to decide. I\u2019m not going to do anything that puts you at risk, Sarah. Members of my team are already en route. They\u2019re going to secure the location and remain at the ready while we\u2019re there.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced down at the T-shirt and pair of shorts she wore and grimaced. \u201cIsn\u2019t it cold there?\u201d</p><p>Garrett chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d</p><p>Just the words sent a blast of heat up her spine to her neck and over her cheeks. She couldn\u2019t even meet his gaze, because he\u2019d see the effect he had on her. He was teasing her, but the images of her wrapped in his arms\u2014warm and safe\u2014was such a powerful enticement that she longed to make the fantasy a reality.</p><p>He held out his hand to her. \u201cAre you ready? We need to hit the road.\u201d</p><p>The simple question was several inquiries all rolled into one. Did she trust him? Would she go with him? Was she agreeing to his protection?</p><p>She slid her palm over his and allowed him to twine his fingers with hers. He squeezed once and then leaned forward to brush his lips against her forehead. Then he tugged her toward the door and they walked down the hall. He veered toward the back door and tucked her securely behind him.</p><p>\u201cI have the truck pulled up almost to the door. I\u2019m going out and I want you to stick like glue to my back at all times. Don\u2019t stick any body part out that you don\u2019t want to part with. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone\u2019s out there?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI always assume there is. We can\u2019t afford to take any chances.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded her agreement. He gave a brisk nod in return and then opened the back door. He reached behind him and wrapped one arm around her waist, pulling her flush against his back. He pulled out his gun with the other hand and stepped into the night.</p><p>\u201cSO who pissed Van off?\u201d Cole asked as he boarded the seaplane on Kodiak Island with his teammate P.J. Rutherford and team leader Steele. \u201cAnd why did Dolphin and Baker get the get-out-of-jail-free card on this gig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you whining about now, Coletraine?\u201d P.J. asked as she slid in beside him. She tossed her duffel bag onto the floor between her legs and then stretched out in the seat. Not that her legs took up much room.</p><p>Steele, ever silent, crawled into the cockpit with the pilot and turned to glance at Cole and P.J. \u201cEveryone set?\u201d</p><p>At their nods, he motioned to the pilot they were ready and he revved up the engines in preparation for takeoff. The plane set off over the water, gathering speed as they left a foamy trail in the emerald-green sea.</p><p>\u201cAlaska,\u201d Cole grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking cold here even in summer, and it stays light too goddamn long. How are we supposed to sleep?\u201d</p><p>P.J. chuckled. \u201cI think the point is that we\u2019re not supposed to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You\u2019re a damn robot. You\u2019re not human. No one can go as long as you without sleep.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIf I fall asleep, someone could die.\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head. P.J.... P.J. was something of an enigma. She\u2019d been part of his team for a few years now, and he\u2019d yet to figure her out. He knew next to nothing about her past, only that she\u2019d come from S.W.A.T. and that she was a damn good shot. Better than him\u2014not that he ever admitted that in front of her.</p><p>They were competitive, and he liked to give her shit. He didn\u2019t always understand her, but then it had been his experience that all women were creatures from an alternate universe anyway. But she was steady. He could always count on her. The entire team could.</p><p>The plane sailed over the water and in the distance, the island was visible.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking at here, Steele?\u201d Cole asked. They hadn\u2019t had time for a full briefing. Steele had taken the call from Donovan and pulled him and P.J. They\u2019d left on a minute\u2019s notice, not that it was anything new.</p><p>\u201cGarrett is bringing Sarah Daniels here. Our job is to be invisible and make damn sure no one gets on this island,\u201d Steele replied.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s nice, but who is Sarah Daniels?\u201d P.J. piped in.</p><p>Steele\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cDoes it matter? Our job is to keep her safe. Watch Garrett\u2019s back. Do the assignment, just as we do all the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever get curious?\u201d P.J. grumbled.</p><p>Steele raised an eyebrow and turned back around in his seat. Cole shot her an amused look and she scowled and flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cSteele, curious?\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>P.J. rolled her eyes and said in a low enough voice that Steele wouldn\u2019t hear, \u201cAnd you said I wasn\u2019t human. He\u2019s a machine.\u201d</p><p>The plane dipped and P.J. turned to look out the window as they nosed down toward the water.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bald eagle,\u201d she said in an excited voice as she pointed.</p><p>Cole ducked his head and leaned forward to look. \u201cI had no idea you were such a wildlife buff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unpatriotic if you don\u2019t get a thrill at seeing a bald eagle,\u201d she said, shoving at his arm. \u201cAren\u2019t you army guys supposed to be more gung-ho about national symbols?\u201d</p><p>He winced and then growled through his teeth, \u201cI was not in the goddamn army and you damn well know it. Navy, P.J. I was a SEAL, for God\u2019s sake. Have some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get you all confused,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cWho the hell can keep up with all the branches of the military you people wimped out of.\u201d</p><p>Cole gave her a look of disgust. She was so full of shit. She had a memory like a steel trap. She didn\u2019t forget anything. She could probably name branch, serial number and rank for every single one of the KGI members.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, what\u2019s your story, Rutherford? You talk shit about us, but all that I know is that you wimped out of S.W.A.T. after being the first female in your unit. Couldn\u2019t take the heat, or what?\u201d</p><p>Though he was teasing, pain swamped her brown eyes followed quickly by ice so prevalent it shriveled his nipples. Her lips tightened into a line but he saw the betraying tremble. It was the first time he\u2019d ever seen true emotion from her. She could joke and give hell with the best of the guys, but for the most part, she kept to herself, and when she wasn\u2019t teasing, she kept her mouth shut and followed orders.</p><p>He would apologize, but that would only piss her off, so he pretended he hadn\u2019t seen her reaction and dropped the subject. But it intrigued him. The first crack in her give-a-shit attitude. Somehow it made her more human. And it made him want to know more about the mystery that was P.J. Rutherford.</p><p>The plane skimmed the surface of the water before slowing and turning into a cove. They coasted to a stop alongside an aged, wooden dock and the pilot hopped out to secure the plane. Cole stepped out and reached back for his bag. He didn\u2019t offer to help P.J. He\u2019d made that mistake before. She carried her own weight and never asked for help. It made her a damn good team member, but it bugged the shit out of Cole. He couldn\u2019t even put his finger on why.</p><p>After their bags were on the dock, the pilot gave them a wave and climbed back in. A few minutes later, he took off toward Kodiak Island. Cole stood with Steele and P.J. as they surveyed the immediate area.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of ground to cover,\u201d Steele said grimly. \u201cI expect Garrett in two days, maybe sooner. We need to be ready. We\u2019ll start with the lodge they\u2019ll be staying in and then we\u2019ll expand our perimeter to encompass as much of the island as we can cover in two days\u2019 time. We\u2019ll set up in a triangle around the lodge. Stay low and out of sight and keep your guard up at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, exactly, are we expecting to show up?\u201d P.J. asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Steele said shortly.</p><p>Cole frowned. \u201cDo we know anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVan has a bad feeling. His instincts are usually damn good and I trust them. Garrett took a job to find and protect a woman who witnessed a murder in Boston. A murder committed by Marcus Lattimer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Cole muttered. \u201cWhat the hell was Sam thinking letting G take that gig? One of us would have done it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>P.J.\u2019s brows drew together in confusion. \u201cWhat am I missing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing important,\u201d Steele said. \u201cWhat is important is that Garrett feels that there\u2019s a wild card and that someone other than Lattimer is after Sarah Daniels. The problem is they don\u2019t know who. Yet. Garrett is stashing her here until they know what they\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s our job to make sure she stays safe.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded. \u201cAin\u2019t no thang. Another day at the office.\u201d</p><p>P.J. pulled her pack over her shoulders as Cole did the same. As they turned to head up the incline toward the lodge, Steele called out, \u201cOne more thing.\u201d</p> <p>Both Cole and P.J. turned and Cole was surprised by the amused glint in Steele\u2019s usually stoic expression.</p><p>\u201cWatch out for the bears.\u201d</p><p>P.J.\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBears?\u201d</p><p>Steele struggled to maintain a straight face. \u201cYeah, they have Kodiaks here. Big-ass fucking bears. Make grizzlies look kind of friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d P.J. swore. \u201cNothing like being trapped on an island with BAFBs.\u201d</p> <p>Cole shot her an inquisitive look.</p><p>\u201cBig-Ass Fucking Bears,\u201d she said patiently, echoing Steele\u2019s description. She cast him a sideways look and mischief danced in her eyes. \u201cWe can always use Cole for bear bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all heart, Rutherford. All heart,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cVAN, when was the last time you heard from Garrett?\u201d Sam asked as he strode into the war room.</p><p>Donovan rotated in his chair and stared back at his brother. \u201cHe checked in a few hours ago. Said Sarah was sleeping and as soon as she woke up, he was getting them the hell out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me up to speed. I hate feeling left in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>Donovan grinned. \u201cA new baby will do that to you.\u201d</p><p>Sam rubbed a hand over his unshaven jaw and barely managed to stifle a yawn. He was deeply and madly in love with his new daughter, but she was a whole new experience. Sophie was tired and trying to do it all in her quest not to interfere with the goings-on at KGI since Garrett was off on a mission, but Sam had nipped that in the bud quick.</p><p>She had exhausted herself by trying to do too much too soon and he\u2019d put her to bed and taken over baby duty. Only Charlotte hadn\u2019t expressed a whole lot of interest in sleeping. She\u2019d alternated fussing with wide-eyed staring at her father. She seemed perfectly content to be held. As soon as Sam tried to put her down, she put up a fuss that had him scrambling to soothe her before she woke Sophie up.</p><p>\u201cNothing in my years in the army prepared me for having a baby,\u201d Sam said wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s not for pussies, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Donovan chuckled. \u201cThink how Sophie feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I don\u2019t know how she does it. I had to make her take some downtime. She was running herself ragged trying to do everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Rachel coming over was nice,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI have to admit, I was a little worried about how she\u2019d take Sophie having a baby. She was so devastated when she remembered having the miscarriage.\u201d</p><p>Sam ran his hand over his face, wiping some of the sleep from his eyes. His younger brother\u2019s wife had spent a year a prisoner in South America, leaving Ethan and the rest of the family to think she was dead. When they discovered she was alive, KGI had gone in with the full force of their resources and rescued her, but she\u2019d come home missing memories of her life\u2014and of her difficulties in her marriage to Ethan.</p> <p>\u201cI was worried too. I wouldn\u2019t have her hurt for the world,\u201d Sam said. \u201cSophie was concerned too. She was reluctant to take the baby over to Mom\u2019s because she was worried about hurting Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s a doll,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have her.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled at that. \u201cYeah. Damn lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rachel has handled it well. She and Ethan have been doing so much better. She seems ... stronger lately. I\u2019m seeing more and more of the Rachel we knew before she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>The security doors opened and Sam swiveled to see Ethan walk into the war room. \u201cHey man,\u201d Sam greeted. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression I was on your payroll now, even if I do still draw the pussy missions,\u201d Ethan said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about Rachel,\u201d Donovan said by way of subtly reminding Ethan why he was still drawing the light-duty tasks.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Any reason in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just remarking on how much better she seems to be doing,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. We were worried how she\u2019d take the new baby. I worried it would upset her. Bring back bad memories.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shoved his hands into his pocket and rocked back on his heels. His expression was bland, but Sam could see the unease in his brother\u2019s stance. Rachel\u2019s miscarriage had been a catalyst for a chain of events that had led to the complete unraveling of Ethan and Rachel\u2019s marriage. Ethan still struggled with the guilt for what his wife had gone through and what she continued to battle on a daily basis.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019d like to try to get pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>Both Sam and Donovan exchanged surprised looks and then Sam went back to Ethan to check his reaction. He didn\u2019t look thrilled.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cChrist but I hate these conversations,\u201d Ethan muttered. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t said anything. It\u2019s just a feeling I get. Or maybe I still just feel like a shithead and I\u2019m projecting. Don\u2019t you love all the new words you learn in therapy?\u201d</p><p>Donovan chuckled. \u201cOkay, but you didn\u2019t answer the question. Are you guys ready for that kind of step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ethan said bluntly. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready. Damn it, she\u2019s still so fragile. If ... if she got pregnant and miscarried again, I don\u2019t even want to imagine how she\u2019d react. I don\u2019t think we can deal with that right now when she\u2019s getting better. It\u2019s like ... God, there are times when it\u2019s just like old times. Before I fucked everything up. I feel like I have her back, the way she was before she forgot so much. I don\u2019t want to do anything to mess that up. I don\u2019t want her hurt again. I just want to protect her and make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI get it, man. I really do. I\u2019d do a hell of lot to make Sophie happy.\u201d</p><p>Ethan cupped his nape and glanced over at Donovan. \u201cI didn\u2019t come over for couples therapy. I wanted to check in on Garrett and see what the hell is going on. No one\u2019s said jack to me beyond the fact Garrett was taking a job that Resnick asked him to take.\u201d</p><p>Donovan provided the details while Sam stood to the side and listened in. Damn but he was tired. And if he was tired, he couldn\u2019t imagine how wasted Sophie had to be. Her labor, despite its quick beginning, had actually gone longer than expected. And then there had been complications afterward. Not serious, but it had taken a lot out of her.</p><p>She and Charlotte were his world. And for the next few days, he was going to become even more intimately acquainted with his daughter, because her mother was going to do nothing but rest, if he had to all but tie her to the bed.</p><p>It took him a moment to realize that Ethan had asked him a question. He blinked and tuned back into the conversation. \u201cWhat did you say about Rusty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Sean yesterday. I wondered if he\u2019d told you about what happened,\u201d Ethan said, a scowl darkening his face.</p><p>\u201cAbout the Winfree punk roughing Rusty up and wrecking her car? Yeah, he told us. He also told us he threatened the little prick and scared him shitless,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>Donovan\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cI want to go over there myself. I may not see eye to eye with Rusty. Hell, half the time I wonder if Mom\u2019s lost her damn mind for taking on that project. But no little teenage bastard is going to get away with fucking with one of the family, Kelly-born or not. Any guy who goes around manhandling a teenage girl ought to have his balls removed and shoved down his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of this is our fault,\u201d Sam said evenly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t exactly been accepting of Rusty. Most of the time, we ignore her existence. That\u2019s created two problems. One, she doesn\u2019t feel like she can come to us with a problem like that. Hell, if Sean hadn\u2019t come up on her right after it happened, she probably never would have told anyone. And the little bastard probably would have went after her again and succeeded. Two, because we haven\u2019t been accepting of her, others pick up on our disinterest. We\u2019ve done her a disservice. Whether we approve of her or not, she\u2019s a part of this family. She deserves our protection and she damn sure needs to feel like she can come to one of us if she\u2019s getting grief from some asshole at school.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve made her an outsider despite the fact that Mom has declared her a member of the family. No matter what our feelings, everyone else needs to know that she\u2019s one of us and no one fucks with the Kellys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat deserves a hooyah,\u201d Donovan said with a grin.</p><p>Ethan looked at him in mock horror. \u201cGarrett would kick your ass over that. A Marine allowing a navy salute past his lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett\u2019s too busy corralling his lady to worry about me,\u201d Donovan said with a smug grin.</p><p>Sam and Ethan looked at each other and then back at Donovan. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s the deal? And you better spill,\u201d Sam threatened.</p><p>The look of unholy glee in Donovan\u2019s eyes made Sam feel instantly sorry for Garrett before even hearing the situation. Whatever it was, he was probably already taking some heavy-duty shit from Donovan.</p><p>\u201cCome on, give it up, Van,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cSarah Daniels has Garrett chasing his tail and not in a fun way. He\u2019s been acting awfully strange about her. When I volunteered to take over the mission when he was home a few days ago, he damn near took my head off. He\u2019s got that possessive caveman thing going.\u201d Donovan looked at Ethan and smirked and then yanked his thumb in Sam\u2019s direction. \u201cYou know, like lover boy over here got when Sophie landed in our backyard.\u201d</p><p>Sam scowled. \u201cFuck you, Van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing that a lot lately,\u201d Donovan said with exaggerated hurt.</p><p>Ethan rubbed his jaw in a thoughtful manner. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for Garrett to get all growly over a woman. He\u2019s extremely protective of Rachel. He\u2019d take off someone\u2019s head if they posed any sort of threat to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like Sophie at first,\u201d Sam pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThis is different,\u201d Donovan insisted. \u201cI\u2019m telling you. There is something going on with Garrett this time. He gets awfully tense over Sarah Daniels. They\u2019re heading to Alaska as we speak. I sent Steele and part of his team ahead. I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this.\u201d</p><p>Sam frowned. \u201cThink we should go then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the both of you are fine right where you are for the time being,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cYour wives need you. I still have Rio and his team on tap, and I\u2019m free if he needs more. Steele, Cole and P.J. are there and are providing protection. I have every confidence that they\u2019ll more than be able to handle anything that comes up.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>SARAH melted into the front seat of the black SUV and waited anxiously for Garrett to walk around to the driver\u2019s side after he closed her door. Thanks to his caution, she was now fully convinced people were poised to jump out of the trees at every turn.</p><p>Garrett tossed her bag and his into the backseat and then slid into the front. He quietly shut his door then cranked the engine. As he put it in gear, he glanced over at her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She gave a nervous nod.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a drive ahead of us, so get comfortable, but don\u2019t let your guard down. If I tell you to do something, do it. No questions.\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded and he started forward, navigating around the heavy tree cover where he\u2019d parked the SUV.</p><p>They rocked and bumped over the broken-paved road toward the small village several miles away. But he turned off about a mile out of town and took an even smaller, one-lane dirt road to the north.</p><p>As if sensing her question, he said, \u201cI want to stay off the main roads as much as possible and out of towns if I can help it. If I found you, so can others.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI made it that easy to find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart, but it wasn\u2019t that difficult. There isn\u2019t much my brother can\u2019t find out about someone. He probably knows your bra size.\u201d</p><p>She glared over at him. \u201cI see. And did he share this information with you too?\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned. \u201cNo need. I plan to find out that one myself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and then she laughed at the blatant flirting. Just when she thought she had him figured out, he always did something to unbalance her. He might appear to be the uptight, grumpy person he swore his brothers labeled him, but he was also fun and a huge flirt. He was also extremely sensitive though if she told him that, he\u2019d probably shoot himself. Or her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so careful. Or I\u2019ve tried to be. I still don\u2019t understand how anyone found me on Isle de Bijoux.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that suggested it was a stupid question and didn\u2019t require an answer.</p><p>\u201cClearly I\u2019m not cut out for a life on the run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Isle de Bijoux anyway? It was a good choice. An obscure location. You just didn\u2019t cover your tracks well enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I took a cab to the airport in Boston, I picked the first flight out that I could book, which happened to be a nonstop to Miami. On the flight there, I sat next to a couple who were continuing on to Isle de Bijoux. I thought it sounded like a good plan since it wasn\u2019t an island I\u2019d heard of. Since I\u2019d made it easy to track me to Miami, when I arrived there, I hired a private Cessna and paid for it via a wire transfer from a bank account Marcus had set up for me years earlier.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019ve ever used his money. The idea always made me uncomfortable before, but I was desperate and knew I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad plan on the fly,\u201d Garrett conceded. \u201cUnpredictability is always an advantage. If you can keep the people looking for you off balance, you can stay ahead of them with better success.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and began her next question hesitantly. \u201cCould you arrange a fake passport, birth certificate, driver\u2019s license? All that stuff?\u201d</p> <p>He yanked his head around to look at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late to be thinking of all that now.\u201d</p><p>She growled in frustration. \u201cYes, I understand. Believe me I get it by now. I\u2019m a fuckup. I suck at subterfuge. I can\u2019t lie worth a damn and I don\u2019t have a clue how to take care of myself. Well damn it, give me some credit for trying. It\u2019s not like I want to be some helpless twit.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched suspiciously and he stared ahead at the road. \u201cI was only going to say that it\u2019s not necessary now. I\u2019ll make sure you have everything you need, Sarah. I\u2019m not about to give you the tools to ditch me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it was personal,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to get hurt. I didn\u2019t want me to get hurt. At the time I thought you were some poor ex-military guy who\u2019d been injured and needed a vacation. The last thing I wanted was for you to get caught up in my mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey I was a poor ex-military guy recovering from a wound,\u201d he protested. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie about taking a bullet for my sister-in-law. It was a bonding experience for both of us.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t your sister-in-law who shot you? I have a feeling you\u2019re an infuriating person to be around on a constant basis.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed her a grin that did suspicious things to her insides. \u201cWell, now, I guess you\u2019re going to find out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>God help her but she was, and the fact that her insides lit up just a little at the thought made her smile. Then she frowned. \u201cOh my God. Patches! I didn\u2019t even ask you about the cat. Is she okay? Did you take care of her?\u201d</p><p>He looked startled by the abrupt change in topic. \u201cYeah, I gave her to the lady who owns the bookstore. I\u2019m sure Patches is very happy.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in relief. As ridiculous as it seemed to worry over a cat when she had so many other problems, the idea of the cat being alone and hungry bugged her endlessly.</p><p>\u201cThanks. That was a nice thing for you to do.\u201d</p><p>He scowled as if the last thing he wanted to be considered was nice.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going?\u201d she asked as she stared dubiously into the night. There wasn\u2019t much recognizable, just landscape blanketed in black. There weren\u2019t even any stars out.</p><p>Fog hovered low to the ground and swirled around their headlights, making long-distance visibility impossible. It was spooky and only fired her already overactive imagination.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but the trusty GPS does.\u201d</p><p>He tapped on the GPS mounted in the dashboard as he spoke and once again she felt like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just shut up now,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cTry to relax. I\u2019d like to get out of Mexico as soon as possible. I hope you peed before you left.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and leaned back in the leather seat.</p><p>They drove for an hour, but they couldn\u2019t have traveled very far because the road was impossible and visibility was so poor that he couldn\u2019t drive much more than twenty-five miles per hour for the majority of the time.</p><p>She\u2019d just closed her eyes when she heard him swear under his breath. The truck ground to a halt and she popped open her eyes to see the road blocked by what looked to be the local police, or whatever it was they called Mexican law enforcement.</p><p>Garrett reached hastily into his pocket, pulled out a small electronic device and then reached under his seat. His hand came back up empty. He glanced once her way but then focused his attention to the roadblock before them.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Sarah. I want you to sit tight, and don\u2019t say a word,\u201d Garrett said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019m outnumbered and I don\u2019t want to do anything that puts you at risk. Which means I\u2019m going to have to cooperate with these assholes.\u201d</p><p>Dread filled her stomach and rose into her throat, tightening until it was hard to breathe. Cooperate? Outnumbered? This sounded bad. Really, really bad. Three police cars were parked at angles and at least seven men were standing in the road. They began approaching the SUV with automatic rifles held high. One man shouted in Spanish.</p><p>Garrett kept his hands on the steering wheel and Sarah flinched when one of the men jerked open her door. At the same time, Garrett\u2019s door flew open and the officers motioned for them both to get out.</p><p>Sarah looked at Garrett, her heart damn near pounding out of her chest. He gave a short nod and then ducked out of the truck, careful to keep his hands up.</p><p>\u201cNo habla Espa\u00f1ol,\u201d Garrett said when one of the men barked at him in rapid-succession Spanish.</p><p>To Sarah\u2019s horror, the man drew his baton and rammed it into Garrett\u2019s stomach. Another officer cracked his baton over Garrett\u2019s head, dropping him to the ground. She screamed and tried to run for Garrett, to cover him, to somehow protect him from the unexpected attack.</p><p>She was quickly intercepted, a strong arm wrapping around her waist. The policeman who grabbed her uttered a guttural command she didn\u2019t understand when she kicked and fought like a woman possessed. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out he was telling her to cease and desist, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them beat Garrett to death.</p><p>She twisted in his arms and jabbed her fingers in his eyes. He howled in pain and dropped her like a stone. She flew to Garrett and threw herself over his body just as one of the policemen was about to deliver another blow. She tensed, expecting the pain, but it never came.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Sarah, what the hell are you doing?\u201d Garrett hissed.</p><p>\u201cSaving your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d one of the men said in strongly accented English. \u201cDo it slowly, se\u00f1or. You wouldn\u2019t want the lady to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as he says,\u201d Garrett ordered. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t do anything to piss them off.\u201d</p><p>Strong fingers curled around Sarah\u2019s arm and hauled her off Garrett. She stumbled and nearly fell as she was shoved against the hood of the SUV. Garrett picked himself up off the ground and no less than three guns were pointed at him as he stood to his full height.</p><p>Two of the policemen went to the SUV and pulled out the bags from the back seat. They emptied the contents onto the ground, the first being Sarah\u2019s clothing. Humiliation burned in her throat as the men laughed when her underwear fluttered to the ground.</p><p>Next they pulled out Garrett\u2019s arsenal, frowning and talking to each other. They gestured at Garrett and rattled off more Spanish as they picked through all his weapons. Guns still drawn on Garrett, the police officers converged and motioned for Garrett to turn around and face the vehicle.</p><p>They began patting him down and even she was amazed by the number of weapons they pulled from his belt, pockets and pants. Panic scuttled around her stomach until she was ready to puke. This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>Two of the men seized Garrett by the arms and directed him toward the backseat of the SUV. Before they stuffed him inside, they cuffed his hands behind his back and then slammed the door behind him. And suddenly their entire focus was on her and she\u2019d never been so terrified in her life.</p><p>One wrapped his hand in her hair and yanked her sideways toward the other passenger door. She stumbled after him on tiptoe, drawn up by his grip on her hair. He opened the door and shoved her inside but didn\u2019t cuff her as they\u2019d done Garrett. She landed with a thud against Garrett and stayed there, preferring the comfort of his body over the alternative.</p><p>Two men got into the front while the others returned to their vehicles. The SUV fell into line between two of the police cars and they raced down the narrow road too fast for the condition of the road or the weather.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they taking us?\u201d she asked fearfully. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even ask us for identification or anything. They didn\u2019t say why they were detaining us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Garrett said grimly.</p><p>His voice was barely a whisper against her ear and she stayed in her position so they wouldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t police,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re not very discreet with their conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you didn\u2019t speak Spanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told them,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t keep her voice from shaking. \u201cWhat do they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom. It isn\u2019t an uncommon practice. But listen to me, Sarah. No matter what happens, you do nothing to draw attention to yourself, do you understand me? No matter what they do to me, you aren\u2019t to put yourself in the way.\u201d</p><p>His voice was fierce and brooked no argument.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She nodded, knowing it was a lie.</p><p>One of the men turned around, baton in hand and swung in Sarah\u2019s direction. \u201cDo not talk!\u201d he said.</p><p>Garrett shoved her over and turned so that the blow landed on his shoulder. \u201cStay down and out of his way,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Not wanting Garrett to suffer anymore, she huddled in the seat and remained silent as they bounced recklessly down the road. It was at least another hour before they came to a stop. The headlights slashed over a hacienda-style house with an iron gate. After a moment, the gate swung open and the vehicles drove the short distance to a circular drive in front of the house.</p><p>Again, the back doors opened and Sarah found herself hauled out. Garrett fared no better, and the men took it upon themselves to land a few more blows as they herded Garrett toward the front door.</p><p>She was sick with fear and fury. He couldn\u2019t defend himself with his hands cuffed behind his back and the bastards were taking full advantage.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she screamed when at the steps, one of the men slammed his baton viciously into Garrett\u2019s back.</p><p>Garrett\u2019s knees buckled and he went down on one knee. He staggered back up and pinned her with his ferocious stare. \u201cDamn it, Sarah, you promised me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip to keep the sob from welling out.</p><p>She was dragged through the front room and unceremoniously shoved into a room in the back that had bars over the window and a cement floor. It was, for all practical purposes, a jail cell. A ratty mattress lined one wall and in the center was what looked to be an old bloodstain.</p><p>Oh God, what hell had they stumbled into?</p><p>A single lightbulb hung from the ceiling and the man reached up and smashed it with his baton, plunging the room into darkness. She went cold. Ice invaded her veins as he trailed his fingers up her arm.</p><p>Fear. Panic. Horrible, unending shame. Memories crowded her mind until she wanted to scream them away.</p><p>She would die before she let another man take from her what she wasn\u2019t willing to give.</p><p>To her surprise, the man stepped away, leaving her standing in the middle of the room. Then he simply left and closed the door behind him.</p><p>She waited a few moments and flew to the door, testing the knob. It didn\u2019t budge, not that expected it to. She stared around, her eyes adjusting somewhat to the dark. Only a narrow beam shone from underneath the door, and it wasn\u2019t enough to make out much.</p><p>A light from outside cast just enough illumination through the window that she could make out her surroundings. Barely.</p><p>She began to pace back and forth, her mind short-circuiting with all that had happened. She didn\u2019t understand any of it. And she was scared out of her mind for Garrett.</p><p>Where had they taken him? What were they doing? What did they want?</p><p>She heard raised voices in Spanish and then in broken English. She strained to hear. Something. Anything. She listened for Garrett but never heard him utter a word. She jumped when she heard a crash. It sounded like a chair being knocked over to the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Several long minutes elapsed. Silence. No voices.</p><p>Then the low murmur of voices again. She pressed her cheek to the filthy door listening and straining.</p><p>A sound filtered through from the next room and she froze. She didn\u2019t even breathe as a sick knot grew in her stomach. It sounded like ... Oh God, there it was again.</p><p>It was the unmistakable sound of an object hitting flesh.</p> <p>It was slow and methodical. Rhythmic almost. Garrett never made a sound and the beating only got louder and more forceful. She covered her ears, trying to shut out the horrible reality. Numb to her toes, she shuffled to the far side of the room, wanting nothing to do with the bloodstained mattress.</p><p>Her eyes stung and watered as the sound echoed again, and she slid down the wall, her knees hunched to her chest. She hadn\u2019t cried for herself. She couldn\u2019t. But when she heard Garrett\u2019s muffled sound of pain\u2014the first noise he\u2019d made at all\u2014she bowed her head as the sobs welled in her throat. And she cried.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>WHEN the door opened, the flash of light blinded Sarah. She had no idea the passage of time, only that each minute that had passed had seemed an eternity. Her face was ravaged and raw, her eyes swollen. She scrambled to her feet as Garrett was shoved into the room.</p><p>The door slammed shut behind him, plunging the room into temporary darkness once more.</p> <p>She rushed forward just as Garrett went to his knees. He put one hand down to brace himself and clutched his abdomen with his other.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered, her voice hoarse from crying. \u201cGarrett, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She dropped down and wrapped her arms around him, holding on to him so he didn\u2019t fall completely down. His breaths came in low pain-filled rasps and he knelt there, leaning into her for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do? Why did they do this?\u201d</p><p>She could barely get the words out around her sobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p> <p>She could feel his battle as he struggled for control. Then slowly he wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her closer into him. He rested his forehead on her shoulder and sucked in long, steadying breaths.</p><p>She ran her hands over his back and up his sides, and then she pulled away to slide her fingers over his face and down his chest, feeling for blood or swelling. When she reached his mouth, her fingers came away slick with blood and her heart leapt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding. Where else are you hurt? What did they do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad. Help me over to the mattress.\u201d</p><p>When she tried to rise supporting him, her knees buckled but she jammed one foot back to brace herself and willed herself not to stagger under his weight. By sheer determination, she managed to maneuver him over to where the bloodstained mattress lay, and her spirits plummeted even more as she realized that this wasn\u2019t the first time someone had been beaten and left in this room.</p><p>He went down onto the thin mattress, which did little to shield him from the hardness of the floor. She tried to help him lie down, but he put a hand down to block her effort.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Let me do it. Only hurts when I try to move too fast.\u201d</p><p>She backed hastily away, not wanting to add to his discomfort. When he was settled on his side, she pushed forward again and knelt over him, unsure of what to do or even what she could do. She\u2019d never felt so helpless in her life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d she whispered again.</p><p>\u201cBeat the hell out of me,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cMostly ribs. Hurts like hell to breathe. Everything else is okay though. Nothing broken.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes again and she leaned down, gently wrapping her arms around him. She didn\u2019t know what else to do\u2014she wanted to offer comfort if nothing else.</p><p>He raised his hand and brushed it over her cheek, wiping at the wetness there. \u201cAh, Sarah, don\u2019t cry for me, honey. I\u2019ve been in worse situations. This is nothing. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to know about those other situations. She hadn\u2019t lived through those with him. She\u2019d lived through the sounds of his beating and knew there was nothing she could do to stop it. Rage built in her veins until her blood simmered and boiled like a volcano about to erupt.</p><p>\u201cThose bastards,\u201d she spat. \u201cThose goddamn bastards. Why did they do this? What do they want?\u201d</p><p>His hand absently stroked through her hair, offering her comfort, and that only shamed her all the more. She hadn\u2019t been the one subjected to such brutality. She caught his hand and held it to her cheek, rubbing against his palm.</p><p>\u201cInformation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t police. Not in an official capacity, although they probably have a pretty damn tight stranglehold on this part of the region. They want money. Want to know who I am and what potential threat I pose to them. They want ransom. These roadblocks are routine in some of the less-developed areas where the law is a nebulous being and left up to the ones doing the enforcing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe wait,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd in the meantime, you do nothing, and I mean nothing to draw their ire. You become invisible and if they question you, you cooperate. You do whatever it is you have to do to survive. I\u2019ll get us out of this, I swear.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his gaze burning into her even though the darkness prevented her from seeing much more than the outline of his face. He caressed her cheek, rubbing his thumb over her skin as she continued to rub against his palm. She knew what he was telling her. Don\u2019t fight. Even if it came to the worst. And he knew what he was asking because he already knew what she\u2019d endured.</p><p>It was telling that even now when he was so beaten that his strength held them both up. It bled into her soul and firmed her resolve. If he could endure so much, then so could she.</p><p>\u201cYou survive, Sarah. Let me take the heat. It\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t endured before and likely will again. My job takes me into bad situations all the time. It\u2019s knowledge I live with on a daily basis. Have faith that I can endure and don\u2019t react to anything they do to me.\u201d</p><p>Hot tears slipped over his fingers. \u201cBut this time ... this time you\u2019re here because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand around her nape and tugged her down until his lips touched hers. It was just a gentle brush and he was careful to keep the side of his mouth that was bleeding from her lips.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he urged as he pulled her down farther.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Lie next to me. Let me hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the smile in his voice when he spoke. \u201cI won\u2019t argue one bit. Come hold me then.\u201d</p><p>Carefully she stretched out beside him, mindful of the injuries to his ribs. Only when he coaxed her closer, did she put herself flush against his body. Then she curled her arm over his waist and nuzzled her cheek against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, not knowing what else to offer. Her heart ached and she was so damn angry that she wanted to rage against the bastards who\u2019d done this. She\u2019d doubted that she would have the wherewithal to shoot a person when she\u2019d procured the pistol, but now she knew without a doubt that she could. Without hesitation.</p><p>Hate was an emotion that she\u2019d done without for most of her life. She hated Allen Cross and his bastard brother as much as she imagined ever hating anyone, but here and now, her anger was a terrible, ugly thing. It consumed her and with it came a hatred she didn\u2019t think she was capable of.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said against her hair. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked, infusing strength into her voice. She didn\u2019t want to come across as a whiny twit. She wanted to sound positive and as confident as he did. The least she could do was offer whatever support she could.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably leave us here. No food or water. Try to wear me down. Then they\u2019ll probably take another shot at me. If that doesn\u2019t work, they\u2019ll use you.\u201d</p><p>Despite her resolve not to show weakness, she couldn\u2019t control the shiver that racked her body.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to get that far. My team will come for us, Sarah. I just have to buy us enough time for them to get here. That\u2019s why I want you to keep your head down. They will come for us. You can help me by doing as I ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He squeezed her a little and then tensed in pain. She raised her head and found his lips there in the dark. She didn\u2019t care about the blood. All she cared about was finding him, showing him her love. And maybe give him something of herself when he\u2019d already given so much to her.</p><p>Love.</p><p>It was nothing like the movies or books. No big lightning bolt from the sky where she instantaneously discovered she\u2019d fallen in love. As if it were something random, like winning the lottery or a momentary high caused by hormones.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d started falling the day he saved her on the island. Or when he left her books with wine and chocolate on her porch. Or maybe it was his unwavering devotion to keeping her safe.</p><p>What she knew was that he was a good man, the kind she\u2019d always dreamed of having. Loyal and protective. Willing to sacrifice for her. But love also meant sacrificing for him, and no matter her promise, she could not and would not go down without a fight. She wouldn\u2019t allow him to suffer endlessly while they waited for rescue.</p><p>And what she knew was that she had fallen and was still falling for the badass with the big heart and gentle soul.</p><p>She whispered the words in her mind, savoring them as she rested in his arms. Now wasn\u2019t the time for emotional outbursts, but when they were safe\u2014and they would be because she believed him without reservation\u2014then she\u2019d tell him what she thought about the man he was. The man she wanted.</p><p>And if he walked away, she\u2019d never have any regrets. Love was a gift, but it was up to the recipient to accept and cherish or to reject the offering. All she could do was give unreservedly. And for the first time since her assault, she realized that she could give something she\u2019d never thought to give again. Her trust and her love.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>\u201cSON of a bitch. Son of a bitch!\u201d Donovan exclaimed.</p><p>He got up from the desk and hit the floor at a dead run. He left the war room and sprinted over to the house. He burst into the living room, where Sophie was feeding Charlotte. Sam was sprawled on the couch beside her and looked up in alarm when he saw Donovan.</p><p>Donovan didn\u2019t waste time trying to preserve Sophie\u2019s modesty. Nor did he bother trying to hold back so as not to frighten her. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation.\u201d</p><p>Sam was on his feet in an instant. Sophie\u2019s eyes widened in alarm and the baby let out a mewl of protest.</p><p>\u201cGarrett?\u201d she asked fearfully.</p><p>\u201cHis locater was activated several hours ago,\u201d Donovan said to Sam.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t we know until now?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know,\u201d Donovan bit out. \u201cSignal may have been interrupted. Maybe it was the damn satellite. But the time stamp was during the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cIs he in trouble?\u201d</p><p>Sam gave a short nod. Then his expression softened as he looked at his wife and child. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have activated unless he was in trouble and needed help. It\u2019s our SOS system. It means he\u2019s down or in deep shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs you. I\u2019ll be fine. I have Marlene and Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Sam only hesitated a brief moment before leaning down to kiss Sophie and then Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cBring him home, Sam,\u201d she said in an urgent voice.</p><p>\u201cI will, baby. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Donovan had already turned and ran back toward the war room with Sam on his heels.</p><p>\u201cRio will be closest. I\u2019ll reroute Steele and his team from Alaska, but we\u2019ll get there first after Rio,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re dealing with but I\u2019m going to assume the worst and pull every available man to get the hell down there.\u201d</p><p>While Donovan hailed Steele and gave him the order to pull out, Sam picked up the phone and punched in a number. A few moments later, he said, \u201cEthan, Garrett\u2019s in trouble. We need you.\u201d</p><p>Donovan was already opening the gun locker. He pulled out an array of weapons and tossed two rifles in Sam\u2019s direction. When they had their gear packed, they hustled out to the truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive. We\u2019ll swing by to get Ethan and then head to the jet. You raise Rio and give him the coordinates,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The drive was silent, but Donovan knew Sam was as worried as he was. And Donovan blamed himself. He should have put a team with Garrett from day one. When he smelled a rat, he put Rio and Steele in place but it was too little, too late. He should have hog-tied Garrett to a chair if necessary to make sure he didn\u2019t go to Mexico alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was always the cake jobs that went all to shit.</p><p>GARRETT lay with Sarah in his arms listening to the quiet rhythm of her sleep. He\u2019d shamelessly lied to her about the condition he was in. Not that he was ready for a pine box, but his ribs hurt like a bitch, and he hadn\u2019t been able to sleep for the discomfort.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t wanted to scare her any more than she already was. He was damn proud of her for not losing it completely. She was scared witless, but she was also one pissed-off woman. It was the pissed-off part that worried him.</p><p>Pissed-off women were unpredictable.</p> <p>He\u2019d lost sense of time but he figured it ought to be daylight soon. Sarah had slipped into an uneasy sleep during the night and when she stirred, he\u2019d soothed and quieted her as much for her peace of mind as to prevent her from moving too much against his ribs.</p><p>He hoped to hell he\u2019d told her the truth about what their captors would do. Again there was that whole predictability factor at work. And while it made sense that they\u2019d leave them to worry and wonder over their fate, wear them down, they\u2019d already proved what stupid sons of bitches they were. He didn\u2019t have a whole lot of faith in their intelligence.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t fought them, which rankled. He\u2019d meekly gone along, like some lamb to a slaughter, because he hadn\u2019t wanted to risk anything happening to Sarah. If it had been him alone, he would have kicked some serious ass and enjoyed every minute of it. But Sarah was with him, and he\u2019d die before allowing any harm to come to her.</p><p>His growing discomfort signaled a need to shift positions, but he didn\u2019t want to wake Sarah. She\u2019d finally settled into a more peaceful rhythm and he liked the sensation of her warm breath on his neck.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed him the night before. The first time she\u2019d initiated any intimacy between them. It was soft and so damn sweet he\u2019d been able to forget the pain for that barest moment when her mouth had met his.</p> <p>When he could stand the position no longer, he tried to edge to the side so he could turn more fully onto his back. She came awake instantly, her head shooting off his shoulder. She leaned over him, her hair falling onto his chest as she stared down at him, concern blazing in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Are you hurting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you. I just need to turn onto my back for a while.\u201d</p><p>Her hands ran lightly over his chest as she helped him roll the quarter turn onto his back. He felt an instant relief as some of the pressure on his ribs subsided. His breaths came easier and he took in several deep ones.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he said. \u201cNow come back here. I like you close to me.\u201d</p> <p>She settled into the crook of his arm and laid her head on his shoulder. Her hand ventured lightly over his chest and down toward his ribs. It was cool against the heat of his pain. A soothing balm; he closed his eyes at the sheer pleasure of her touch.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t stop. It feels damn good. I like you touching me.\u201d He felt her smile against his shoulder.</p><p>Carefully she skimmed over his shirt, her touch so light it was almost not there. She rubbed a path to his belly and then back up again, taking care around his rib cage. Then she settled her palm against his chest, right over his heart as if reassuring herself that he was there and alive with her.</p><p>After a moment, she retraced her path downward again. He could stand it no longer. The damn shirt was in the way and he wanted to feel her hands on his bare skin like he wanted nothing else.</p><p>\u201cPush up my shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cTouch me, not my shirt.\u201d</p><p>He waited to see if she\u2019d balk, but she lifted the end and slowly pushed upward until his shirt was bunched under his arms. Then she put her palm on his bare chest and he almost groaned from the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>Such gentleness in the face of such violence and pain. So warm and sweet. He drank it up greedily, wanting to be soothed by her fingers.</p> <p>When she ventured lower, down to the band of his pants, his body reacted. His dick surged to life and swelled, begging to be included in her tender ministrations.</p><p>Hell, the last thing he wanted was to frighten her or put her off.</p><p>\u201cWatch your hand,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI seem to have this problem around you.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled softly and raised her head up again. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have imagined, I mean not now. You have to be hurting so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnd my dick isn\u2019t particularly concerned with what the rest of my body\u2019s feeling.\u201d</p><p>To his further surprise, she leaned down and pressed her lips to his chest. She kissed him softly and then moved down an inch and kissed him again. All the while her palm smoothed over the skin of his belly awfully damn close to his waistband. The discomfort in his groin was fast overtaking the pain in his ribs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me to stop if I do.\u201d</p><p>Like that was ever going to happen. He could be missing a leg and he\u2019d be damned if he called a halt to her sweet seduction. An angel in hell. That\u2019s the only descriptor he could come up with. His sweet angel.</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee that I\u2019m not going to tell you to stop,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI only wish to hell I could make love to you. I want to touch you, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Again her husky laughter washed over him like a healing wind.</p><p>She lovingly kissed and caressed every part of him that hurt. Every bruise. Every cut. Her soft mouth moved over his flesh as if she were absorbing the pain. She placed one hand on the other side of him and pushed herself up and over him until her hair fell down around his face. Then she lowered her lips tentatively to his.</p><p>The first brush tasted like ambrosia. Sweet. So damn sweet. Fire raced through his veins when the tip of her tongue rubbed shyly over his mouth. Her hand left the mattress and cupped his cheek. Her fingers stroked gently over his jaw, feathering up to his temple as she kissed around the cut at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He\u2019d give anything to be able to turn her over, hold her tight and slide between her legs. It certainly gave him incentive to get the fuck out of this hellhole, because when they did, he was going to do everything to her that he was currently fantasizing about.</p><p>She continued her gentle ministrations, touching, petting lightly and following her caresses with her lips. No part of his battered face and abdomen was left out of her sweet lovemaking. She soothed his aches and pushed away his pain, replacing it with warm pleasure.</p><p>Finally she lay her head on his chest and slid her hand over his belly in a light, comforting pattern. He raised his hand and thrust his fingers into her hair, enjoying something so simple as touching her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think. He could only feel. Mellow and content, his woman lying on his chest snuggled into his body. He covered her hand with his other one and squeezed, unable to voice all that he felt. She squeezed back as if understanding his silence.</p><p>They rested there, their fingers laced together, and forgotten for the barest moment, was the hell that waited.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>MARLENE pulled into Sam\u2019s drive and hurried toward the front door. She didn\u2019t bother to knock but simply pushed in and called Sophie\u2019s name.</p><p>Sophie rounded the corner, Charlotte bundled in her arms, and Marlene saw the worry reflected in her daughter-in-law\u2019s eyes. She held out her arms and went to pull both mother and child into her embrace.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d she asked Sophie.</p><p>Sophie posted a brave smile. \u201cThe question is, how are you? I can\u2019t imagine how you do this so often with all your sons gone and not knowing if they\u2019re safe.\u201d A quick shudder rolled over her shoulders and Marlene reached to take Charlotte from her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m okay. Worried, of course, but you get used to it.\u201d She smiled down at her granddaughter. Love, so strong, rushed like a flood through her heart. \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Sophie smiled, but it was a tired smile laced with the strain Marlene knew she felt. Marlene squared her shoulders and eyed her daughter-in-law. \u201cI want you to pack what you need for several days. Then you and I are going to go get Rachel, and we\u2019re going to hole up at the Kelly headquarters, as I like to call it. Oh, I know Sam has his war room here but honestly, my house has and always will be Kelly central. At a time like this, family has to stick together.\u201d</p><p>Relief shone bright in Sophie\u2019s eyes and her shoulders sagged just a bit. \u201cThat sounds wonderful, Marlene. Being alone right now ... well, it sucks.\u201d</p><p>Marlene laughed. \u201cWell, of course it does. You have a new baby. You\u2019re tired. And your husband is gone to rescue that fool son of mine who doesn\u2019t think he needs anyone. Get your things. It\u2019ll be one big sleepover. We\u2019ll drive Frank out of his mind. He\u2019ll likely flee the premises before it\u2019s over with.\u201d</p><p>Sophie smiled, lighting up her entire face. \u201cGive me just a few minutes to get what I need for Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>While Sophie went off to pack, Marlene settled on the couch and gazed down at her sleeping granddaughter. She was more concerned about Rachel, truth be told, which is why she had no intention of letting either of her daughters-in-law weather the next few days alone. Ethan still stuck close to Rachel most days, and when he did go off on assignment, Marlene made sure she wasn\u2019t alone. The entire family checked in on her, Garrett especially.</p><p>Rachel and Garrett shared a special bond, and with Garrett MIA and Ethan going into an unknown situation, Marlene didn\u2019t like to think about how upset Rachel would be.</p><p>And what she didn\u2019t want either Rachel or Sophie to know was how worried she was. Oh, she gave Sophie that song and dance about being used to it, but did a mother ever get used to saying good-bye to her sons and not knowing if they\u2019d come back? It was a worry she lived with every day.</p><p>Garrett was the loner and self-sufficient. He was the steadfast one. He could always be counted on when the chips were down. But now he was the one in need, and Marlene couldn\u2019t get rid of the sick feeling in her stomach.</p><p>Sophie returned carrying a huge baby bag slung over her shoulder and an additional bag with her things in her other hand. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Marlene rose. \u201cWe\u2019ll take my van. I had Frank install a car seat for Charlotte so she\u2019s all set.\u201d</p><p>The women hustled from the house and Marlene settled Charlotte into her seat in the back. They tossed Sophie\u2019s bags in the rear compartment and Marlene started for the driver\u2019s side. To her surprise, Sophie stopped her and pulled her into a huge hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sophie whispered. \u201cI told Sam to go. I wanted him to go. But after he left, all I could think was that I didn\u2019t want to stay in that house alone, worried out of my mind that something horrible has happened.\u201d</p><p>Marlene squeezed her back. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, honey. That\u2019s what family is for.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled away, tears shimmered in Sophie\u2019s eyes. Then she smiled. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m getting used to it. I never had a real family. It feels ... nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell come on then. Let\u2019s stop with all the emotional girly stuff and go get Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Marlene pulled into the driveway of Ethan and Rachel\u2019s house. Before she could get out, Rachel came out onto the front porch, her face pale and her eyes troubled.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here with Charlotte,\u201d Marlene said to Sophie. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the van running. We won\u2019t be but a minute.\u201d</p><p>She hurried out and Rachel met her at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Marlene took both of her hands in hers and wished like anything she could get rid of the shadows that still lurked in Rachel\u2019s eyes. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, baby. Nothing at all. I just decided that at times like these, family should stick together. I\u2019ve come to collect my daughters and we\u2019re going to drive Frank out of house and home for the next few days. Now go pack a bag. You\u2019re coming with me. None of us should be alone right now.\u201d</p><p>The relief was staggering in Rachel\u2019s eyes. It was as if she was prepared to hear the very worst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so worried about Garrett. And now Ethan. God, Marlene, what could have happened? I hate not knowing.\u201d</p><p>Marlene pulled Rachel\u2019s hands together and squeezed a little harder. \u201cThey\u2019re coming home to us, Rachel. Just like you did. My boys are fighters. They fought for you. They fight for others. They damn well will fight for each other. Now go get your things. Sophie and the baby are waiting for us in the van.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Rachel turned and hurried up the steps. Marlene sighed, pulled herself together and turned back to the van to wait. A few minutes later, Rachel came running out and climbed into the middle seat beside Charlotte\u2019s carrier.</p><p>Marlene glanced over at Sophie and then over her shoulder to Rachel. \u201cOkay, girls. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Both women smiled and Marlene drove out of the driveway and turned toward home.</p><p>When they pulled up to Marlene\u2019s house, to her surprise, Rusty was sitting on the front steps. She rose when the van came to a stop but remained where she was as she watched the women get out and get their bags. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could use some help with Charlotte,\u201d Marlene called to Rusty.</p><p>Rusty moved forward, looking a little hesitantly at the baby in Marlene\u2019s arms. \u201cYou want me to take her?\u201d She glanced over at Sophie and then back at Marlene.</p><p>Marlene arranged the baby in Rusty\u2019s arms, gave her the necessary instructions about supporting the head and then shooed her toward the house. Rusty had a mixture of terror and wonder in her eyes as she slowly turned away and went up the steps into the house.</p><p>Marlene shook her head as she went to the back to help Rachel and Sophie with their things. \u201cI swear, you give a teenage girl a baby to hold and it\u2019s like an exorcism.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie and Rachel both burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cThere now, that\u2019s better,\u201d Marlene said, offering a squeeze to both their arms. \u201cWe look like we\u2019re heading to a wake.\u201d</p><p>As they started to the house, Frank appeared on the porch. He simply held out his arms to Rachel and Sophie and pulled them both to his chest in a tight hug. \u201cHow are my girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Rachel said softly.</p><p>Frank kissed her cheek. \u201cWell, good. I\u2019m going to fire up the grill later. Thought we\u2019d have steaks for supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Frank said to Sophie. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get some rest, young lady. You look tired. That granddaughter of mine is cute as a button, but she\u2019s got her days and nights mixed up from the look of you.\u201d</p><p>Sophie gave him a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave your bags on the porch. I\u2019ll get them in a minute,\u201d he said. And with that, he turned, still holding both of the women to his side and pulled them into the house.</p><p>Marlene stood for a moment simply watching her family do what they did best. Then she turned her eyes heavenward. \u201cTake care of my boys,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBring them home to us. This family isn\u2019t whole without them.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p> <p>SARAH sat on the floor beside the mattress, knees drawn to her chest as Garrett dozed beside her. She didn\u2019t want to be scared, but the truth was she was terrified. She didn\u2019t want to not believe that she and Garrett would be rescued, but despite her efforts, doubt crept insidiously into her mind.</p><p>He\u2019d been right so far, though. Throughout the long day, their captors had left them alone in the dark and silence. No sounds could be heard through the door. No food. No water. The food didn\u2019t bother her yet, but she was thirsty.</p><p>Thoroughly humiliated by the fact that there was no place to relieve herself, she\u2019d waited until Garrett had nodded off before crouching in the corner. She\u2019d die if he\u2019d been awake to witness her mortification.</p><p>She put her head down on her knees and rocked back and forth, trying to keep her focus, trying not to let panic overwhelm her. Garrett needed her strong, not helpless.</p><p>Not knowing the extent of his injuries worried the hell out of her. Every so often, she leaned over him to hear the reassuring sounds of his breathing. And then she resumed her vigil, sitting and waiting. Watching over Garrett as he\u2019d watched over her.</p><p>Garrett stirred and she picked up her head to see him raising his head to look around. His gaze found hers, and he reached for her hand as if to reassure himself she was there and safe. She took it and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Don\u2019t worry. Just sore. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as it felt like at the time.\u201d</p> <p>The cheer he forced into his voice melted her heart. He was doing everything he could to keep her spirits up and keep her optimistic.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re ready to go kick some ass then,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? I\u2019m sure between us we can break the door down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not that chipper yet,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cCan you help me sit up? I want to test the ribs out.\u201d</p><p>She got to her knees and looped his arm around her shoulders. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>He grunted once as he pushed to a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>He sat there for a moment catching his breath and then rubbed his hand over his midsection. \u201cI\u2019m good. Just bruised, I think. They seemed pretty careful to rough me up without breaking anything. Nothing feels broken anyway. Just stiff and sore.\u201d</p><p>She kept his arm over her shoulders and leaned into his side. She wrapped her arms around his waist and laid her head against him.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared, Sarah. But we\u2019ll get through this. I promise. My team will come.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together for a short moment and then asked the question plaguing her since the night before when he\u2019d told her the same thing. \u201cHow will they know? I mean, how will they know where to find us?\u201d</p><p>He turned his face into her head and pressed his lips to her temple. \u201cTracking device. Our SOS system, so to speak. I activated it when we hit the roadblock and tossed it under the front seat of the SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat we were in bad shape? Yeah. And if it had turned into a false alarm, I could have always checked in, but nothing about that situation looked anything but fucked-up.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cAnybody ever tell you that you have a way with words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>He reached under her chin and nudged upward. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said as he lowered his mouth.</p><p>She went willingly, fusing her lips to his. Before she\u2019d been achingly gentle with him, not wanting to hurt him. She\u2019d wanted to offer comfort\u2014and her love. Now, she kissed him desperately, wanting and needing his warmth and comfort.</p><p>He let his hand slid up to cup her face, and he held her there as he fed from her mouth. He was every bit as impatient as she felt, hungry and a little wild. He took her breath\u2014returned it\u2014then took it again, the exchange of hot, moist air elevating the itchy desire that grew with every moment she spent with him.</p><p>He drew away and stared down at her, stroking her cheek. \u201cI hope to hell this isn\u2019t one of those situations where you go a little crazy because we\u2019re in a bad situation and you don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get out so you do stuff you\u2019d never dream of otherwise. Because baby, when we get out of here, I\u2019m going to spend two days doing nothing but make love to you. And it won\u2019t have a damn thing to do with anything but the fact that I want to be inside of you more than I want to breathe.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hiccupped and stuttered. Her chest grew tight and she swallowed under the intensity of his gaze. Then she reached up to touch his face, allowing her fingertips to trace the strong lines of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI kissed you because I wanted to. That won\u2019t change tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good damn thing,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He leaned in to kiss her again when a noise outside the door made him go rigid.</p><p>\u201cGet behind me,\u201d he ordered. \u201cDo it now. Don\u2019t make a goddamn sound. Don\u2019t talk. Don\u2019t react. You pretend you\u2019re invisible. You got it?\u201d</p><p>Every single part of her wanted to argue like hell, but she did what he asked and scrambled behind him and made herself as small as she could against the wall.</p><p>The door burst open bringing with it a blinding flood of light. Garrett bolted to his feet, and she didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d done it so fast and with such ease. It had to have been excruciating.</p><p>He stood, in an almost a casual pose, but his hands were fisted at his sides. A stream of Spanish erupted from the doorway and two of the men came into the room and took Garrett by the arms.</p><p>Fight, she silently willed him. Don\u2019t take it. But oh God, he went willingly and she knew why. She closed her eyes as the door shut and rage billowed inside her. He didn\u2019t want to do anything that would draw their attention to her. He didn\u2019t defy them, because he feared they\u2019d retaliate by hurting her.</p><p>She rammed her fist into her mouth to stifle the sob that swelled like a malignant growth. She wouldn\u2019t cry. She wouldn\u2019t give in to the despair. Garrett would need her. Strong and steady. Like him. She wouldn\u2019t fail him. Not when he was sacrificing so much for her.</p><p>Bolting to her feet, she ran to the door and pressed her ear against it, straining to hear. She had to know. She didn\u2019t want to, but she owed that much to Garrett, to know what was being done to him.</p><p>The murmur of voices continued forever. They were questioning him in broken English and his answers were clipped, noncommittal, the subtle version of go fuck yourself. After each negative response he gave, she tensed, expecting to hear the sound of them beating him.</p><p>But the questioning continued. She sagged against the door for what seemed like hours. Her legs were numb, her knees shaky and her entire body was bathed in perspiration.</p><p>And then it started. She flinched when the first sound of violence reached her. She held her breath until she was lightheaded. More questions. Another strike. They were slower and seemingly more measured this time.</p><p>Through it all Garrett remained silent, and she didn\u2019t know how. How could a person\u2019s will be so strong that they could suffer such pain and not give in to the urge to scream? When finally she heard the scrape of chairs and the sound of footsteps approaching the door, she flew back to the far wall, there next to the pallet. And she waited.</p><p>The door flew open, but this time, there was only one man and no sign of Garrett. He stared at her for a long moment and then crossed the room. He spit out a stream of Spanish and she never looked up, refusing to meet his gaze or to let him see how terrified she was.</p><p>He reached down and grabbed her hair with one hand and circled her arm with the other. He hauled her to her feet and shoved her toward the door, his grip never easing. The light blinded her and she closed her eyes and then blinked rapidly, trying to adjust as he forced her into the room.</p><p>She stumbled forward and gasped when she got her first good look of Garrett. He was tied to a chair, arms behind his back, completely vulnerable. Blood streamed from his nose and mouth. He looked tired and haggard, but the moment he looked up and saw her, something deadly entered his eyes.</p><p>They sharpened and where before he looked half unconscious, he was now fully alert, tense, his gaze taking in every detail.</p><p>The man standing to the side of Garrett put down the piece of wood in his hand and approached Sarah, his face expressionless. She looked past him, meeting Garrett\u2019s gaze, trying to infuse every ounce of her strength to him. She allowed no fear to show and it was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done. And she pleaded with him silently not to do anything crazy. Not to draw their wrath. He couldn\u2019t take much more.</p><p>The man circled her like a cat stalking his prey. He glanced up and down her body in a clear, suggestive manner and then he moved in close, his hand touching her cheek. She didn\u2019t flinch away, but neither did she look at him.</p><p>He turned then to Garrett all the while keeping his hand on her face, stroking up and down her cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cMy men are very eager to have your woman,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me no reason to deny them.\u201d</p><p>This one spoke nearly perfect English, his accent light. It was clear he was the authority figure here. It was also clear that he was the one who\u2019d inflicted the most damage to Garrett. It was all she could do not to ram her knee into his nuts.</p><p>But she stood there, stoic and unmoving, all the while staring at Garrett, telling him she was okay.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I want to know or I leave her to them.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s nostrils flared. His gaze was so deadly that she shivered under the impact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he finally said. \u201cLeave her alone. You\u2019ll never get what you want from her. It\u2019s me who can provide the ransom.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled, his eyes gleaming with triumph. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d see it my way.\u201d He turned and snapped his fingers at one of his men, who immediately came forward. The other man grabbed Sarah\u2019s arm and dragged her back toward the room. She turned her head, her gaze finding Garrett\u2019s one last time. To her astonishment, he winked at her. She almost missed the gesture, it was done so quickly. And just as fast, Garrett\u2019s focus was back on his captor.</p><p>Sarah found herself shoved once more into the dark room and the door shut behind her. She stumbled back over to the wall and this time, she lay on the mattress and curled into a tight ball. Something inside her had broken at the sight of Garrett. Nausea rose in her stomach and she scrambled to the corner as she heaved and gagged. There was nothing to come up, but her stomach still revolted. Dry heaves racked her body and she took in deep breaths, but the cloying smell of urine and sweat only made her sicker.</p><p>When she was finally able to gain control and stop the horrible twisting in her gut, she crawled back to the pallet and collapsed, weak and shaky\u2014ashamed.</p><p>She had to get it together before they returned with Garrett\u2014if they returned. These weren\u2019t men of honor. How was she to know they wouldn\u2019t kill him after he gave them what they wanted? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, she wouldn\u2019t think of that. She couldn\u2019t. Garrett had promised her, and she believed him.</p><p>She lay there, eyes closed, sucking deep breaths and trying to ignore the horrible knot in her stomach. This time she didn\u2019t hear their approach. The sudden opening of the door startled her and she rose up on one elbow, shielding her eyes with the other. Garrett stumbled forward as he was shoved into the room, but this time he didn\u2019t go down. He stood defiantly until the door shut behind him and then he scanned the room. Looking for her.</p><p>He walked slowly toward her and then sank to his knees in front of the pallet where she lay. She opened her arms and swallowed back the sob. He gathered her close and, with a groan, lowered them both back to the pallet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured over and over. \u201cI\u2019d hoped they wouldn\u2019t touch you, that you wouldn\u2019t be scared. I know you must have been terrified, but I\u2019m so damn proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled away and ran her hands over his face, wiping at the blood, uncaring that it stained her hands and clothes.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cThey figured out they weren\u2019t going to get anywhere with force. That\u2019s why they pulled you in. I should have done a better acting job. I could have pretended to be beaten down more. They would have left you alone then. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>The words tumbled out and she put a finger over his lips to silence him. He was apologizing. God. She replaced her finger with her lips and kissed him tenderly, peppering tiny little kisses over his bruised and battered mouth.</p><p>For a long while they lay in silence, tangled together, exchanging the occasional kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat now, that you\u2019ve told them what they wanted to know?\u201d she asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them shit. I was just trying to buy us some time before. Time for my team to get here. I gave in now because by the time they figure out it was a bunch of nonsense, we should be out of here.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so sure that it elevated her flagging confidence.</p><p>\u201cYou need rest,\u201d she said. \u201cFor when your team gets here so you can help kick butt.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cBet your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you really okay? I mean, you don\u2019t need to tell me you are just to make it seem not so bad. I want to know.\u201d</p><p>He made a disgruntled sound. \u201cI\u2019ve been better. But I\u2019ve been worse. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough guy,\u201d she chided.</p><p>\u201cBet your ass,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cKnow what I want when we get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Naked?\u201d</p><p>She blushed and buried her head in his shoulder. \u201cBesides that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay, I give up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of your three-course meat dinners. I\u2019m thinking chicken, pork and steak will do nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d he breathed. \u201cWith ketchup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench fries,\u201d she said dreamily.</p><p>\u201cAnd chocolate cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething caramel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like caramel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. My favorite. Anything caramel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI have a confession to make.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head in curiosity.</p><p>\u201cThat time on the island when I brought you a chocolate bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I sort of had a chocolate and caramel bar in my stash too but I offered you the chocolate because caramel is my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be pissed over that. Caramel hoarding is a sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should be,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you though. I make some of the best caramel num nums ever. It\u2019s the only thing besides meat that I can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNum nums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t know what the real name of it is. It\u2019s graham cracker crumbs with caramel poured over with a thin layer of chocolate on top. They\u2019re so damn good all you can say when eating them is num num num.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shook as she laughed and she squeezed him. He winced and she backed off, an apology on her lips. He put his finger over her mouth. \u201cNo, don\u2019t say it. I like you touching me. I\u2019m okay. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want those caramel num nums,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He leaned in to kiss her again. \u201cYou\u2019ll get them.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>SARAH came awake to the sounds of footsteps\u2014heavy, hurried footsteps\u2014outside the door. But what alarmed her more than the potential threat was the fact that Garrett didn\u2019t rouse from sleep. He was extremely alert and quick to pick up on any noises, but he lay still. She put her hand down to rouse him and wondered if he was unconscious and then she yanked her hand back just as the door burst open.</p><p>Enough was enough. The bastards weren\u2019t going another round with him. She lunged to her feet and flew across the room to plant herself between the man and Garrett.</p><p>\u201cEnough, you bastard,\u201d she hissed. \u201cTake me. You\u2019ve done enough to him already. What use is he to you if you kill him? If you want your jollies then take me and do your worst. I\u2019ve already been there and survived, and I\u2019m not going to let an asshole like you break me either.\u201d</p><p>She yanked at her shirt, determined to distract him from his goal. She had it up and her bra pushed aside, prepared to take it all off it that\u2019s what it took, when the man reached out and grabbed her wrist, preventing her from baring any more flesh.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cI\u2019m willing. I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I won\u2019t fight you. Just leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes but she squeezed them back as she defiantly faced down the man who\u2019d come for Garrett.</p><p>\u201cSarah, honey, it\u2019s okay. He\u2019s one of mine,\u201d Garrett said from behind her.</p><p>She whipped around to see Garrett leaned up on one elbow as he tried to get up. Then she turned back to the man who still held her wrist.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d the man said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay now. My name is Rio. I\u2019ve come for you and Garrett. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he carefully pulled her clothing back into place as she stood shocked and appalled by what she\u2019d just done. Behind Rio, another man barreled into the doorway and she took a quick step back. Her knees buckled as realization set in. They\u2019d come. Just like Garrett had promised.</p><p>Rio caught her before she fell but she batted away his arms. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine. You need to see to Garrett. He\u2019s hurt. Don\u2019t worry about me. Please just help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one touches her, Rio.\u201d Garrett\u2019s softly issued warning floated through the room. \u201cMake sure your men know.\u201d</p><p>A look of understanding passed between the two men and Rio motioned for the man behind him to come through. Sarah backed away, hugging herself as she watched the flurry of activity begin.</p><p>The second man stopped by her side and stood with his gun up, clearly protecting her. When she glanced up, he nodded respectfully. \u201cI\u2019m Terrence, ma\u2019am. We\u2019re here to take you home.\u201d</p><p>Still numb, she turned to see Rio help Garrett to his feet. He leaned heavily on Rio as they stood a moment to allow Garrett to get his bearings.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Rio asked grimly. \u201cI have to tell you, you look like shit, man.\u201d</p><p>Garrett cracked a grin. \u201cI\u2019d worry more if you told me how pretty I looked.\u201d</p><p>Terrence snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen prettier jackasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad. They were fucking amateurs,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI guess for that I can be grateful. They worked me over pretty good but it\u2019s mostly bruises.\u201d</p><p>Sarah shook her head, trying to take it all in. They were standing around like this was some big joke. \u201cWe should go,\u201d she blurted. \u201cHe\u2019s not safe here. He needs a hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Garrett said, holding out his free arm to her.</p><p>She went instantly, anchoring herself to his side, holding on to him for dear life. Dear God, she was trying to keep it together but she could feel the hysteria rising like a tidal wave. She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>He squeezed her to him and kissed the top of her head. \u201cWe\u2019re safe now. My team is here. They\u2019re not going to let anything happen to us.\u201d</p><p>Garrett felt the betraying tremble of her body and knew she was hanging on by a thread. He tried to step forward, still holding her next to him, but his body was stove up from the beatings and every muscle screamed in protest. He\u2019d been still for too long and the simple act of moving was damn near impossible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need help,\u201d he said to Rio.</p><p>Rio frowned, and Garrett knew he was thinking it had to be bad for Garrett to admit he couldn\u2019t walk out under his own steam.</p><p>\u201cTake Sarah out first,\u201d he said to Terrence. \u201cRio and I will be right behind you.\u201d Then he looked down at Sarah. \u201cGo with him, honey. I won\u2019t be far.\u201d</p><p>She glanced a little nervously at Terrence but stepped away from Garrett and then followed the big man out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Rio asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI got the shit kicked out of me. Stupid bastards nabbed us at a roadblock. Wasn\u2019t much I could do facing down seven armed men, and I had Sarah with me to protect. I activated the SOS and then tried to buy us as much time as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they hurt her?\u201d Rio asked, a deep scowl working over his face.</p><p>\u201cNo, they left her alone. Dragged her out to make me cooperate when they figured out their methods of making me talk weren\u2019t working. Scared her, but she\u2019s been fierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I got that. I think she would have taken me on when I came in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Garrett said softly. \u201cFor her to do that. You don\u2019t even realize the courage it took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do. She\u2019s been hurt before.\u201d</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cThat she was willing to ... for me. Damn but I\u2019m furious and awed all at the same time. She\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rio agreed. \u201cFierce.\u201d</p><p>Rio started forward but Garrett held back. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Van briefed you or what all you know, but Marcus Lattimer hired us. That\u2019s the story. Sarah is his sister and she doesn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want her to find out until I have a chance to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cVan gave me the rundown. My men have been briefed. We\u2019re cool. We\u2019re not going to blow your cover. Now let\u2019s get the fuck out of here. If I had to guess, we don\u2019t have a lot of time before your brothers come in and start a fucking war with Mexico.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned. \u201cFamily motto. No one fucks with the Kellys.\u201d</p><p>With Rio\u2019s help, Garrett walked out of the room and then out to the front of the house, where the rest of the team was assembled. They passed the bodies of the men who\u2019d held him and Sarah captive and he frowned at what Sarah had seen on her way out.</p><p>Rio shook his head. \u201cTerrence wouldn\u2019t have let her see all that crap. I know my man better than that. He\u2019s real protective when it comes to women.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shook off Rio\u2019s hold as they exited the house and he breathed in the fresh air. He automatically looked for Sarah and saw her standing off to the side, her arms wrapped around herself. She looked pale and completely lost. Terrence hovered over her and was speaking to her in low tones, but Garrett wasn\u2019t even sure she heard. The three other members of Rio\u2019s team were spread out and on careful watch duty.</p><p>As soon as she looked up and saw him, she broke away and ran to him. He braced himself for impact and opened his arms, but she stopped in front of him and then carefully went into his embrace.</p><p>She buried her face in his chest and wrapped her arms around his waist. She shook like a leaf.</p><p>\u201cWe need to make tracks,\u201d he whispered softly.</p><p>She shuddered and tilted her head to look up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here a minute longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>Garrett caught Rio\u2019s gaze over Sarah\u2019s head and tilted his head in the direction of the SUVs. Rio nodded and then took a step toward Sarah.</p><p>\u201cSarah, we need to get you inside the vehicle where it\u2019s safe. Will you come with me?\u201d</p><p>Rio kept a foot of distance between himself and Sarah and was careful to keep his voice measured. She wouldn\u2019t even meet Rio\u2019s gaze. A flush swept over her cheeks, and Garrett\u2019s heart clenched at the humiliation in her eyes. For her to feel shame for what she\u2019d done for him\u2014that she was willing to sacrifice for him\u2014made him sick. He was damn sure going to have a heart-to-heart with her at the first opportunity, because no way in hell was he going to allow her to be embarrassed over trying to protect him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked Garrett. \u201cYou\u2019re coming, right?\u201d</p><p>There was fear in her voice despite the fact that her words came out steady. Her hand trembled in his and he squeezed reassuringly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. I want you inside first. I\u2019ll need to go in the back and I want you in the middle where you\u2019re protected. There\u2019ll be men on either side of you. Rio\u2019s team.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed back. \u201cI know. If you trust them, so do I. I\u2019m just so ...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too, honey. Me too. But we\u2019re going to make it just fine. And then I\u2019m going to fulfill a little promise I made.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled in question.</p> <p>\u201cYou. Me. Naked. Me inside you. As many times as I can get there.\u201d</p><p>Color bloomed in her cheeks and she glanced hastily at Rio to make sure his murmured words weren\u2019t overheard. Rio\u2019s expression never changed. Sarah looked back, her cheeks still flushed, but there was heat in her eyes. He\u2019d purposely reminded her of what they\u2019d shared and what they would share to ease some of her shell shock.</p><p>A smile glimmered on her lips when she looked back at Garrett.</p><p>\u201cGo with Rio. I\u2019ll feel better knowing you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and eased her hand from his. He didn\u2019t want to let her go even for a minute, but he wanted her in the truck, under guard while he got the report from his men and they got the hell out of this damn country. Nothing good ever came of him being in Mexico.</p> <p>He watched as Rio ushered Sarah into the backseat of the SUV and Terrence stood guard outside the door. Then Rio walked back over to where Garrett stood.</p><p>\u201cOkay, man, what\u2019s the plan? You need a hospital and Sarah isn\u2019t going to be happy if you don\u2019t go. She\u2019s all sorts of worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me whip your ass in front of your woman. It would be humiliating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have more important issues to worry about than a hospital. Besides that, I don\u2019t want Sarah out in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about Sarah going to the hospital?\u201d</p> <p>Garrett tensed and fixed Rio with his stare. \u201cShe stays with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to bring this up but it needs to be said. You need to give this assignment up and let someone else in KGI take over. You\u2019re hurt and the entire mission is compromised because you\u2019ve made this personal. You need to back off now.\u201d</p><p>It took all he had not to kick Rio\u2019s ass, even if it damn near killed him in the process. And Rio knew it pissed him off because he was watching Garrett with those dark eyes, studying every reaction and only convincing himself that he was all the more right. Well, maybe he was. He\u2019d probably be preaching the same sermon to one of his team members if they were in the same position.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t give a shit about the mission right now,\u201d Garrett said in as controlled a voice as possible. \u201cWhat I care about is keeping her safe, and don\u2019t feed me that bullshit about how any of you can keep her safe. Okay, I get that. I don\u2019t doubt your abilities. I trust you with my life. But I\u2019m not trusting anyone but myself with hers. You said I\u2019ve made it personal. You\u2019re damn right I have. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell fuck, Garrett,\u201d Rio swore. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a hell of a problem then. Resnick\u2019s going to be breathing down our necks wanting to know where Sarah is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother reason for me not to show up in some damn hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that Lattimer will be looking for his sister and the fact that you\u2019re lying to her about who you are. You need to figure out what\u2019s more important to you, man. Nailing Lattimer or having Sarah. Because something tells me you won\u2019t get both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I really don\u2019t want to get into this with you. Find me a damn clinic or fly me to Marin and let her check me over. Sarah goes where I go. End of story. This is my mission and I\u2019ll fucking figure out what the hell I\u2019m going to do. But for God\u2019s sake, can we get the fuck out of Mexico?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d Rio drawled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a chopper waiting about thirty miles south of here. We\u2019ll ditch the rides and hop the border into Corazol. I have a contact there who can help us get medical care for you. On the way I\u2019ll have to try to make contact with Van because they\u2019ll all be coming in hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need to call home,\u201d Garrett said quietly. He could only imagine how his mom and sisters-in-law felt. Ethan and Sam both would have gone. He knew because in their shoes he\u2019d do the same for his brothers. Rachel was probably taking it especially hard. They tried to arrange it so that both he and Ethan were never gone at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d Rio asked. He signaled his remaining men. \u201cLet\u2019s make tracks.\u201d</p><p>Garrett took an experimental step forward and then another. Rio kept pace beside him and opened the back to lay the third-row seat down. He tossed the equipment to one of his other men, who transferred it to the other vehicle. Soon, Rio had a large enough space for Garrett to crawl in and lie down.</p><p>Sarah turned in her seat and watched as Garrett inched his way forward. By the time he was in, sweat beaded his forehead and he felt like he was going to puke his guts up.</p><p>\u201cDo you have water?\u201d Sarah asked softly, looking at Rio who was still standing behind Garrett. \u201cNeither of us has had anything to eat or drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Rio said. \u201cI\u2019ll have Terrence dig some out of his pack while I get us on the road. Okay, doll?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all set, man?\u201d Rio asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cGet us on the road and get me a damn sat phone.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>SARAH leaned her head back against the rest and closed her eyes. She was tired to her bones and worry for Garrett beat at her brain. Rio had pissed Garrett off by injecting him with a painkiller when he wasn\u2019t looking, but Sarah was glad he did it. The roads were terrible and lying in the back and being jarred by every bump and pothole would have been excruciating.</p><p>At least now he had fallen into a drug-induced sleep. She looked over her shoulder every few minutes, checking his expression for any sign of discomfort. There was no tension in his face and he looked at peace.</p><p>Beside her, Rio sat, his gaze constantly darting right and left and like her, over his shoulder to check on Garrett at intervals. Terrence drove, and another team member whom she\u2019d heard referred to as Decker rode shotgun. Literally.</p><p>Alton and Browning followed in the other SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>Rio\u2019s gaze settled on her, and she regretted drawing his attention. She wanted to die over the fact that she\u2019d darn near undressed in front of him. He\u2019d certainly gotten an eyeful of her cleavage.</p><p>\u201cCorozal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelize?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re not too far from the border. Couple hours even on shitty roads. I want Garrett to see a doctor there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family will be there.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really a question since she\u2019d heard Rio conversing with one of Garrett\u2019s brothers earlier. But it was a way to seek information because she was as nervous as hell at the idea of meeting his family.</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Rio said. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably be there before we will. They were en route to Mexico and rerouted to Corozal after I let them know we\u2019d gotten Garrett out.\u201d</p><p>He continued to study her until embarrassment crowded in once more and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered back to him.</p><p>\u201cThat was a damn brave thing you did back there. I don\u2019t think Garrett knows whether to turn you over his knee or kiss your feet. There should be no shame or embarrassment. You earned my respect today and my gratitude for taking such care of a man whose friendship I value and a man I\u2019m extremely proud to work with.\u201d</p><p>Her throat grew tight and her eyes itched fiercely. She wanted to wipe them but the gesture would betray how shaky her emotions were.</p><p>\u201cI feel like an idiot now,\u201d she muttered. \u201cGarrett is probably furious. He made me promise several times not to draw attention to myself. He was so bent on protecting me. But I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cThey\u2019d already beaten him twice. I thought ... when I heard you, I knew I couldn\u2019t allow them to hurt him again. If it meant sacrificing my ... body ... it was something I was willing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people would never make that kind of sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI showed you my breasts, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she said in disgust.</p><p>He grinned, white teeth flashing. He was extraordinarily handsome and when he smiled, he transformed from dark warrior to someone with oodles of charm.</p><p>\u201cAnd as a gentleman, I\u2019ll not comment on how spectacular they were.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and rolled her eyes, but she smiled, feeling a little lighter and less mortified than she had before.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor coming. Garrett said you would, but there were times I wondered. It felt like we were there for a week.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew serious. \u201cWe look after our own. No way we\u2019d not come for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoyalty like that is priceless.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and then reached to the floorboard for one of the packs. \u201cAre you still hungry? You didn\u2019t eat much before. And are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her forehead and then massaged the bridge of her nose between her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Just fried. I think if I ate anything else I\u2019d be sick. My head is killing me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou should have told me. I can give you an injection.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be out of it. The idea kind of freaks me out right now. Just some ibuprofen would be wonderful. I think it\u2019s just going to take a while for me to come down.\u201d</p><p>He dug into his pack and shook out several pills into his hand. Then he uncapped a bottle of water and extended it to her. After she took it, he handed over the pills and she threw them back and swallowed them with a gulp of water.</p><p>\u201cWill you check in with Marcus? He\u2019ll be frantic that I haven\u2019t checked in. I assume you would have already told him that we\u2019re safe. I\u2019d like to ... talk to him if possible,\u201d she said.</p><p>Rio\u2019s face became expressionless. \u201cYour brother knows you\u2019re safe. Garrett will handle reporting in. We work for Garrett but this is his mission. He took the assignment from Marcus.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s enough that he knows. Garrett will handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you try to sleep?\u201d Rio asked gently. \u201cYou can stretch out and put my pack against the door to lay your head on.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so exhausted and yet I feel like I\u2019ll never sleep again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me give you something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll relax you and allow you to rest. It\u2019ll alleviate some of the anxiety you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and he pressed. \u201cYou need the rest, Sarah. You\u2019re dead on your feet and when Garrett wakes up and sees you like this, he\u2019s going to wig out, and then we\u2019ll have no hope of getting him the care he needs. He\u2019ll be too worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was dirty,\u201d she said with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. I do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh all right,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cPull your sleeve up,\u201d he directed as he dug back into the pack.</p><p>She complied and he uncapped a prefilled syringe. She looked doubtfully at it as he swabbed an area of her skin with alcohol. Then before she could question, he plunged the needle into her arm. She gasped and then rubbed when he withdrew.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat seemed like an awful lot of medicine for something that\u2019s just supposed to bring me down and relax me a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019ll knock you on your ass for several hours,\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>Already the world was going hazy around her and her eyelids grew heavy. \u201cWhen I wake up, I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u201d she slurred.</p><p>Rio leaned her toward the window and tucked his pack underneath her head. He gave her a gentle smile. \u201cGood night, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>SAM paced the tarmac with restless energy while Donovan and Ethan leaned against the door of the Kelly jet. Sam checked his watch for the third time in as many minutes and swore under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s taking them so long? I hope they didn\u2019t run into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d know if they did,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cRio can handle it. They\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Ethan remained silent, his expression tense. \u201cGarrett called home. He knew the women would be upset. If he was thinking of Mom and Rachel and Sophie, he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>The distant sound of a helicopter quieted the conversation. The hum grew louder until the chopper burst over the dense area of trees. A few minutes later, the chopper touched down several feet away from where the jet was parked and Rio hopped out of the cockpit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam started over, his brothers on his heels. Sam waited for the engine noise to die before addressing his team leader.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened? Where\u2019s Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs medical,\u201d Rio said. \u201cThere\u2019s a clinic about thirty miles out. It\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Ethan cut in. \u201cWe can get him on the jet and take him home to a hospital there.\u201d</p> <p>Rio shook his head. \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to explain why?\u201d Donovan asked.</p><p>A dilapidated old van creaked onto the tarmac and drove noisily over to where the chopper had landed. Rio motioned to Terrence, who ducked into the helicopter and came out a moment later, a woman curled into his arms. He carried her toward the van while Sam and his brothers watched in confusion.</p><p>\u201cIs that Sarah?\u201d Donovan asked. \u201cWas she hurt too?\u201d</p><p>Rio shook his head. \u201cLook it\u2019s a long story and one I\u2019d love to tell you, but right now we need to get Garrett out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Sam glanced at his brothers and then nodded. They hurried over to the helicopter to see Garrett lying on a makeshift stretcher.</p><p>\u201cI can damn well walk,\u201d Garrett growled at Browning who had the misfortune of sitting next to Garrett\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it doesn\u2019t look like it to me,\u201d Sam drawled. Even though he purposely needled his brother, the relief at seeing him lying there bitching as usual nearly staggered him. He had to grip the doorway to steady himself.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Garrett, you scared the shit out of us,\u201d Donovan cursed.</p><p>Garrett picked his head up and saw his three brothers crowded into the doorway of the chopper. \u201cWell, son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grinned back at him. \u201cYou look like a pussy.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett rose up to flip Ethan the bird but groaned as the motion rippled pain across his midsection. Yet something else his brothers would give him hell over. He grinned as he stared at the roof of the chopper. Some things never changed, and he hoped to hell they never did.</p><p>\u201cOne of you assholes help me sit up. I can walk out of here, damn it. I don\u2019t need a goddamn stretcher.\u201d</p><p>Ethan chuckled but reached his hand out for Garrett to grasp. Donovan shouldered in and reached for Garrett\u2019s other. His muscles protested, but he was gratified to be able to get out of the helicopter without collapsing.</p><p>As soon as his feet hit the ground, he looked around, taking in the surroundings \u201cWhere is Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. Terrence took her to the van. I gave her an injection to make her sleep. She was wound tighter than a spring,\u201d Rio said.</p><p>Garrett relaxed and then took a good look at the van in question. \u201cWell, hell, Rio. Is this what you call a first-class ride?\u201d</p><p>Rio chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s all about blending in. Can\u2019t have a limo showing up at some out-of-the-way clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the jet here,\u201d Sam said with a frown. \u201cYou should damn well let us take you home. You can\u2019t continue this job in your condition.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett ignored him and started toward the van. Ethan followed and grasped Garrett\u2019s arm to steady him. He was grateful for his brother\u2019s help, not that he\u2019d admit it. The last thing he wanted was to face plant on the runway. He wouldn\u2019t live down that humiliation ever.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Garrett,\u201d Sam said in resignation. \u201cI swear if you didn\u2019t already look like you\u2019ve been rode hard and hung up wet, I\u2019d kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Garrett turned and shot a cocky grin over his shoulder. \u201cYou can try, big brother. You can try.\u201d</p><p>Donovan shook his head and followed the procession over to the van.</p><p>Garrett stuck his head inside to see Sarah curled onto the floor of the van. There were only two seats in front and the entire back was empty. She was out cold and her features were drawn into a tight grimace, but at least she was resting. The past few days had been hard on her, and she\u2019d already been through enough.</p><p>He hesitated before entering the van and turned to face his brothers. \u201cI\u2019ll make this quick. We need to get out of sight. I\u2019m not going home with you.\u201d He held up his hand to stop the protest that Sam was already preparing to launch. \u201cYou three get your asses home. Make sure the women aren\u2019t worried. Tell them whatever you need in order to make them feel better. I don\u2019t want the family involved with this. Think about the danger we\u2019d be bringing to our front door. Lattimer is a wild card. The whole point of this job was to flush him out. I\u2019m not going to do that in any way that puts our family at risk, and you damn well know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy suggestion was to leave Rio with Sarah. Let his team take over the job. You need to get your ass home and be in a real hospital,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you right now, I\u2019m not leaving Sarah.\u201d</p><p>He stared his brothers down. He saw Donovan shake his head and blow out his breath in resignation. Donovan knew. He already had a damn good idea that Garrett was in way over his head with the woman.</p><p>\u201cThere is still a threat to Sarah, one I haven\u2019t identified. And do you think for one minute that if we all go home, Resnick won\u2019t be all over us in a minute? Hell, he\u2019s probably on his way here right now. He\u2019s a complication I don\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you forgetting that you\u2019re lying to her?\u201d Sam asked in a low voice. \u201cWhatever your feelings for her, she\u2019s not going to forgive being used as bait to lure her brother out of hiding. Get out now, Garrett. Let Rio do the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Sam. Would you have left Sophie to Steele or Rio? Would you have backed off and let them protect her while you went home with your tail tucked between your legs?\u201d</p><p>Understanding flashed in Sam\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Garrett turned to Ethan. \u201cWould you have let us go in after Rachel while you stayed at home sitting on your hands because you were too emotionally involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d Ethan bit out.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d Sam bit out. \u201cI hate when you have to make a goddamn point that I can\u2019t respond to.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned. \u201cGo home, Sam. You have a wife and a new baby. Ethan has a wife to take care of. Sarah is mine to take care of. Rio and his team will stick with me. I trust them to do their job, but the only one I\u2019m trusting with Sarah is me.\u201d</p><p>Sam rubbed a hand over his hair and made a sound of disgust. \u201cOkay, Garrett. Have it your way. Not that you ever do anything else. I hope to hell you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been hurt before, Sam,\u201d Garrett said quietly. \u201cShe trusts me. She\u2019s not going to trust another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what are you going to do when the shit hits the fan?\u201d Donovan asked. \u201cShe trusts you and you\u2019re going to betray that trust.\u201d</p><p>Pain that had nothing to do with his injuries washed through his chest. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to figure out a way to do my job\u2014do what\u2019s right\u2014and hope that she\u2019ll understand\u2014and can forgive me\u2014for doing what needed to be done.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>SARAH stirred and tried to blink away the groggy, hungover feeling that cloaked her like a thick fog. It took her a moment to even remember what had happened and that Rio had drugged her. She was also no longer in the SUV they\u2019d traveled in, nor was she on a helicopter that she knew they\u2019d intended to take into Belize.</p><p>She pushed herself upward, taking in her surroundings. Immediately her gaze locked with Garrett, who was sitting up, his back to the side of what looked to be an old utility van. Briefly she gazed around to see Rio also sitting in the back, as well as Terrence and another team member she hadn\u2019t caught the name of. Browning and Alton were in the front, Browning driving.</p><p>Then she glanced back at Garrett, who studied her with frank appraisal.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous question,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cThe real question is, how are you?\u201d</p><p>He cracked a grin and then patted the small space beside him. She crawled over and nestled into his side.</p><p>\u201cI prefer you close to me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay. Just stove up. I\u2019ll be sore for a couple of days, but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She was skeptical of his self-diagnosis but she didn\u2019t argue. What she did do was glare over at Rio, whose lips twitched suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to a clinic at least, right?\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cYes ma\u2019am. Whether he wants to or not.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I have such a say here,\u201d Garrett said dryly.</p><p>She laid her head on Garrett\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat do we do then? I mean, where do we go? I assume you\u2019ll need to check in with Marcus. I don\u2019t know what your arrangement is with him, but he\u2019s very used to being on top of things.\u201d</p><p>He tensed a moment before moving so he could put an arm around her. \u201cYou let me worry about Lattimer, okay? Rio and his team are going to stay with us so we don\u2019t get into any more situations like before.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and knew she needed to come clean with everything. Before ... before there were several reasons she held back. She wasn\u2019t entirely certain she could trust Garrett\u2014at first. That had faded away, and now he was the only person she did trust. And she was ashamed. Deeply humiliated by what had happened to her and her sense of betrayal had been so numbing that she hadn\u2019t been able to fathom telling anyone. Not Marcus\u2014especially not Marcus.</p><p>Garrett needed to know exactly what he was dealing with, because from the moment he\u2019d told her that Allen\u2019s brother had hired someone to find her, she knew. She was a threat to Stanley Cross. If she was ever hauled into court to testify against Marcus for killing Stanley\u2019s brother, the whole sordid tale would come out. Allen was dead, but Stanley wasn\u2019t, and he could still be held accountable for his role in her rape.</p><p>\u201cSarah?\u201d</p><p>The question in Garrett\u2019s voice told her he knew something was bothering her. But she couldn\u2019t tell him now. Not in front of his men even though they\u2019d have to know later.</p><p>So she shook her head to let Garrett know it was nothing. And later, after he\u2019d been taken care of, she would divulge the last of her secrets.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>\u02baOKAY, now that the doctor has assured you all that I\u2019m not dying, can everyone stop with the babysitting?\u201d Garrett grumbled as they exited the small, rural clinic where Rio had taken him to be examined.</p><p>Sarah rolled her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say all that bruising is nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo broken bones,\u201d Garrett reminded her. \u201cProbably fractured a few ribs, but that\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t done before.\u201d</p><p>They stood in the sunshine a step away from the van that had taken them thirty miles from Corozal. Rio and his men stood to the side, and Garrett leaned against the van as he looked to his team leader.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what now? I assume you have a place off in the wilds somewhere where you can stash us. Donovan was going to send us to Alaska, but that\u2019s out now. Too risky. I don\u2019t want Sarah out in the open for that long.\u201d</p><p>It also needed to be a place where they could draw Lattimer. The sooner they ended this madness, the sooner Sarah would be safe again, and then he could address this thing between them.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I do,\u201d Rio said. \u201cAlways pays to have a few safe places that even the bosses don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>Garrett shot him a look. Rio shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d be a dumbass if I didn\u2019t plan for every contingency.\u201d</p><p>Garrett couldn\u2019t argue with that logic.</p><p>\u201cI have a place on the Belize River several miles from the nearest village. It\u2019s well stocked, isolated and it gives us several escape routes. I have a chopper there and a boat. We can bail at a moment\u2019s notice by air, water or roadway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how big is this place?\u201d Garrett asked. The last thing he wanted was to be tripping over five other men in close quarters.</p><p>Rio grinned. \u201cBig enough. Besides, we\u2019ll be taking position in a perimeter around the house. No one will get within a mile unless we want them to.\u201d</p><p>Armed with painkillers, the trip over less-than-ideal roads wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been. Still, by the time they turned onto the winding road that led to Rio\u2019s safe house, Garrett felt like he\u2019d been beat all over again.</p><p>There was a large security gate that couldn\u2019t be seen from the road. Security cameras were mounted at each post on the left and right and Garrett raised his brow as Rio opened the gate by remote.</p><p>\u201cExactly how much are we paying you, man?\u201d Garrett joked.</p><p>Rio snorted. \u201cNot nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>The drive was a half mile long and looped around the incline to where the house rested atop a hill, completely surrounded and sheltered by dense trees.</p><p>Garrett whistled when he caught sight of the place. He\u2019d been expecting a shack or maybe a stone building that more resembled a cave. Rio and his men had reputations for being staunch, cave-dwelling loners who kept to themselves when they weren\u2019t on assignment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rio liked his privacy\u2014obviously\u2014but he damn sure wasn\u2019t suffering in some hovel.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to see this,\u201d he muttered as they piled out of the van.</p><p>A high-security fence circled the house in addition to the barrier provided by the trees. The house was modern and sleek and spread out over at least three thousand square feet. When they entered, Garrett was struck by how clean and efficient the house looked, but what immediately took over his notice was the high-tech surveillance gear, the computer system and the weapons locker located just inside the door.</p><p>\u201cVan would cream himself,\u201d Garrett said.</p> <p>Rio laughed. \u201cThat he would. I\u2019d have to kick his ass because he\u2019d be touching my stuff.\u201d</p><p>He guided Sarah and Garrett into a kitchen that looked like something out of a catalog. All the modern appliances, granite countertops and a professional-grade stove with six gas burners.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen is fully stocked. If it\u2019s edible I probably have it. Freezer and fridge have all the necessary foodstuffs. Staples in the pantry. Plenty of bottled water. Don\u2019t drink out of the tap. We don\u2019t have the best water.\u201d</p><p>They carried on into a sprawling living room, which Garrett immediately approved of. He cast a sideways glance at Sarah, wondering if she was noting the differences.</p><p>\u201cThis is the type of place you hole up in when you\u2019re hiding,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any open areas for anyone to see into the living room or take a shot at you from a distance. All the windows are high to allow light to enter but this is a completely safe room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat if they have a grenade?\u201d</p><p>Rio laughed. \u201cWell then it\u2019s KYAG time.\u201d</p><p>At Sarah\u2019s raised eyebrow, Garrett supplied, \u201cKiss your ass goodbye time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, very succinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bedrooms are through here,\u201d Rio said as he led them down a long hallway. \u201cEach has its own bathroom and the master suite has a Jacuzzi tub and separate shower. Take your pick and make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sarah asked softly. \u201cNot just a safe house. I mean it\u2019s your safe place.\u201d</p> <p>Rio was silent for a minute. \u201cYeah, it is. It\u2019s the place I go when I want to be alone, but hey, a guy likes his creature comforts too.\u201d</p><p>Sarah grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we\u2019re intruding then. But thank you for sharing your private getaway with us.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her then and leaned over to ruffle her hair affectionately. \u201cWell, if it was only Garrett I would have stashed him in some hovel somewhere. Much more in keeping with his winning personality. But I couldn\u2019t very well treat a lady like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019m going to puke over here,\u201d Garrett grumbled. \u201cDon\u2019t you have something better to be doing?\u201d</p><p>Rio grinned again and gave a snappy two-finger salute before he sauntered back down the hall to round up his men.</p><p>Garrett and Sarah were standing in the doorway to the master suite and Garrett waited for her to venture in. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said as she turned in a circle in the middle of the room.</p><p>Garrett dropped their bags on the floor, startling her. She looked at the bags, looked at Garrett and then color rose in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take one of the other bedrooms,\u201d she said as she started toward her bag. \u201cYou can have this one. I don\u2019t need much room.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her wrist before she could bend to retrieve her bag and then he pulled her up close until they were flush against each other. \u201cYou\u2019re staying in here with me.\u201d</p><p>She trembled and her eyes took on a slightly glazed, hungry look that brought his body to immediate attention.</p><p>\u201cIn that bed. With me,\u201d he said as he nodded toward the big king-sized bed in the middle of the room. \u201cYour legs wrapped around me, me inside you. I\u2019ve thought of little else for the past few days. It\u2019s what got me through the two days in captivity.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath and licked her lips nervously, leaving them plump and shiny and so damn irresistible. Then she put a hand on his chest and gave him a doubtful look.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make love, you idiot. What you need is a bath and food and rest. You should climb in the tub and soak while I go fix us something to eat. I thought I\u2019d make your favorite. Meat, meat and more meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, that sounds good. But here\u2019s what I think. I think you should take that bath with me and then we\u2019ll both figure out something to fix.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a minute and then past him toward the bathroom. He could see she was tempted. He pulled her in closer and murmured in her ear. \u201cYou, me, lots of hot water. I\u2019ll wash your back. And your front. And all parts in between.\u201d</p><p>She shivered delicately just as he sank his teeth into her lobe, nipping with just enough force to excite her.</p><p>\u201cAnd just so you know, Sarah, I\u2019m going to make love to you. I don\u2019t give a damn if it kills me in the process. I\u2019m going to have you. You\u2019re going to sleep in my bed, in my arms, your skin against mine. I want the last thing you feel before you go to sleep is me inside you, and the first thing you know when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>She made a soft, breathy, utterly feminine sound as she leaned into him, and he went painfully hard. God, but he wanted to touch her. He wanted to run his tongue from the tip of her nose to her toes and taste every delectable inch of her.</p><p>God, he had to quit or he was going to come in his pants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go run the water,\u201d she said. \u201cYou sit down and rest while you wait.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her bossiness. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Sarah pushed at him to get him to sit on the bed. When she was satisfied that he was comfortable and off his feet, she went into the bathroom. Her eyes widened when she took in the huge tub on an elevated platform. It was the centerpiece of the entire bathroom and would easily fit more than two people. Maybe Rio went in for more than one when it came to female companionship.</p><p>She laughed softly at the idea of the dark-eyed, quiet man being more frolicsome when it came to his private life.</p><p>On impulse, she searched the drawers for matches or a lighter and was delighted to find a long-stemmed candle lighter. She started the water running and then went around to light the candles placed at random spots around the bathroom. It seemed a girly thing to do but then a man owned this entire house, and the candles weren\u2019t girly smelling. The scent was more earthy and masculine. It reminded her of the outdoors.</p><p>She stood back to survey her handiwork and then let out a groan. It looked like she was bent on seduction. Then she chuckled. She could hardly be accused of seduction when Garrett had made it abundantly clear that he had every intention of making love to her.</p><p>She rubbed her hands up and down her arms as she watched the water grow deeper in the tub. She wasn\u2019t sure what had her on edge more. The idea of making love to Garrett or the fact that she wasn\u2019t more wary of giving herself completely and wholly to a man. Of trusting him.</p><p>She shrugged. The fact was, she wasn\u2019t afraid of Garrett. He\u2019d been achingly tender and up front with her. He hadn\u2019t hidden from the mutual attraction that flared like a brush fire between them. She cherished the honesty between them, and she trusted him\u2014in a way she\u2019d never thought to trust another man.</p><p>After putting out towels and arranging the soaps and shampoo just so, she turned the water off and went back for Garrett.</p><p>She found him flat on his back, eyes closed, and for a moment she stood there, watching him. Absorbing everything about him. His broad chest rose up and down with his breaths and he looked oddly vulnerable, a fact she found extremely endearing.</p><p>She eased onto the bed and leaned over him, letting her hair fall to his shoulder. She rubbed one finger down his jawline, and his eyelids slitted open. He watched her with lazy regard as she ran her finger over his lips.</p><p>\u201cBath\u2019s ready,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNeed help up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use help undressing,\u201d he said, an unholy gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d she muttered, but a smile hovered at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>She backed off the bed and watched as he rolled to the edge and put his feet down. Unsure of whether to help him or not, she waited and let him walk ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d he said as he looked around.</p><p>\u201cNot too girly?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cNope, not too girly at all. As long as you like it, I like it.\u201d</p><p>He wasted no time stripping off his shirt. She winced when she saw the multitude of bruises that colored his abdomen. He looked like an Easter egg. When he started to shimmy out of his pants, she turned away and then shook her head at the absurdity of the action. She glanced back to see a prime view of his backside as he climbed over the edge into the water.</p><p>Damn but the man was built like a brick house. All hard lines, lean at the waist and hips, broad at the shoulders and a muscled back that made her mouth water. When he turned to lower himself in the water, she saw the rippled, discolored tight abdomen and the dark hair at his groin. And even at a state of semi erection, the man was impressive.</p><p>Even as large as the tub was, he seemed to fill every inch. He sank into water and stretched out with an appreciative groan. \u201cDamn but this feels good.\u201d</p><p>Steam rose from the water\u2014she\u2019d been sure to make it hot\u2014and he leaned his head back and closed his eyes. Unsure of what she was supposed to do\u2014okay so she knew, but she felt damn awkward\u2014she piddled with her shirt.</p><p>Finally she turned away and walked toward the far corner so she could undress. She hoped she didn\u2019t lose the nerve because she wanted that hot bath more than she wanted anything right now.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>She turned at the sound of his voice to see him watching her through half-lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Her head cocked to the side in question, she returned to the bathtub.</p><p>\u201cWant to know what my fantasy is right now?\u201d he asked. Her eyebrow went up and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI want you to undress right there where I can watch.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed nervously. \u201cYou might not think it\u2019s such a fantasy when I get my clothes off.\u201d</p><p>His velvet gaze stroked over her body, touching fire to every nerve ending. \u201cYou have a beautiful body, honey. Perfect. I\u2019ve had some pretty sweaty fantasies about it since meeting you. And that day on the beach when you wore that little suit. It was so modest but it made me even crazier because I kept imagining what was underneath.\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized by the low pitch of his voice and warmed to her toes by the stark truth in his eyes, she reached down to unbutton her shorts. His gaze followed her every movement as she unfastened and then slid the material down over her hips.</p><p>She gripped the hem of her T-shirt and pulled up and over her head, leaving her in just her bra and panties. She stood for a moment, gauging his reaction, but all she saw was pure, unadulterated male appreciation.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure which should go next, bra or panties, so she mentally flipped a coin and the bra won. She reached behind her to grapple with the clasp, because was there anything less sexy than taking the straps down and then twisting it around to undo from the front?</p><p>The band popped free and the cups loosened, but she held them over her breasts for the barest of moments before allowing the straps to tumble down over her shoulders. Then she let it fall to the floor as she lowered her arms.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet his stare now and instead looked down as she hooked her thumbs in the lacy band of her panties. With a little wiggle, she worked the underwear down her legs and let it fall.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said in a sexy, husky voice.</p><p>When she looked up there was a predatory gleam in Garrett\u2019s eyes. A look that told her she was his and he planned to lay claim. Oh but she loved that look. No one had ever looked at her with such intensity. Like he dared anyone to take what was his away. Like he wanted to devour her in a single bite and savor the taste.</p><p>He held up his hand to help her over the edge of the tub. She slid her fingers through his and stepped into the steaming water. As soon as it sluiced over her ankles, she moaned with the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>He tugged her forward, closer to him and then downward until she knelt, facing him, in the water between his thighs. He reached around to cup her neck and then pulled her down into his kiss. His other found the swell of her breast, cupped one and ran his thumb over her nipple. It hardened instantly, becoming a rigid, sensitive point.</p><p>When he pulled away, they were both breathing hard. Arousal glazed his eyes, and the pupils were flared, making his eyes more black than blue.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he directed.</p><p>She complied and he pulled her into the V of his legs until her back was melded to his chest and she was surrounded by him, enveloped by his touch and smell.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe can use this for a while.\u201d</p><p>She leaned farther into his embrace until they were both reclined, water lapping to their necks. His hands wandered lazily up and down her body, down her waist and then back up again, where he\u2019d cup her breasts and bring her nipples to erect nubs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lulled by his light caresses, she closed her eyes and gave herself over to his touch and to the soothing hot water.</p><p>His touch grew bolder, lowering to the juncture of her thighs, teasing the curls at the apex. Her breath drew in painfully and she held it in anticipation as her body quivered\u2014wanting and needing him to touch her more intimately.</p><p>He was patient, drawing lazy circles, dipping down to run his fingers over the closed seam between her legs. She sighed and parted her thighs, wanting him to have easier access. Slowly he worked one finger between her folds and rubbed lightly over her clit.</p><p>She gasped and tensed as pleasure shot through her body, tingling and burning its way through her veins and to all her pleasure points. Her breasts tightened and ached, wanting equal attention.</p><p>\u201cLay your head back on my shoulder,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to see your face when I make you come.\u201d</p><p>Her head drooped back and she turned her face away as he nuzzled her neck. His fingers were magic, taking her up so close to her peak and then slowing and bringing her down until she was boneless in his arms.</p><p>His middle finger slipped lower, circling her entrance before entering the barest of inches, teasing and stroking. When her breaths were coming fast and shallow, he went back to her clit, exerting just the right amount of pressure as he found her sweet spot.</p><p>He licked her pulse point at her neck and then nipped lightly, his teeth grazing as goose bumps erupted over her flesh. \u201cCome for me, Sarah. Right here. Right now in my arms. Let go for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She twisted against him, arching into his hand as his fingers grew more insistent. He knew just how to touch her, just how hard to exert pressure and when to let off. As his mouth melted against her neck again, her orgasm flashed, quick and hard, exploding through her body. Wave after wave of intense, mind-bending pleasure curled through her pelvis and spread through her limbs until she was mindless and limp.</p><p>Slowly she came back to awareness as he rained a trail of kisses over the curve of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she murmured. She yawned broadly and floated in the sweet aftermath as he stroked her body with gentle hands.</p><p>His erection was rigid against her back. Hot like a branding iron. Thick and large.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cWhat you did back there, Sarah. I\u2019m humbled. I\u2019m furious with you for putting yourself between me and danger like that, and if you ever do it again, I\u2019ll spank your ass. But I\u2019m so goddamn amazed at the courage it took for you to face him down like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I figured whatever they did, it couldn\u2019t be as bad as what you\u2019d suffered. I\u2019d survive. I did it once. I can do it again.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her close and held on to her as he kissed the side of her face. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m furious. I\u2019m amazed. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>They soaked awhile longer, Sarah limp against his chest, content in the aftermath of his lovemaking. Finally, with the water cooling around them, she stirred and pushed herself upward. She turned to help Garrett, but he gripped the sides of the tub with bloodless fingers and strained to rise from the tub.</p><p>His face went pale and his lips formed a paper-thin line. His breaths spurted out raggedly as he stood a moment catching his breath. She hurried out of the tub and jerked a towel from the rack. She was there to help him as he stepped from the tub, not that she did him any good. But she was determined to take as good care of him as he had of her.</p><p>Gently she worked the towel over his body, wiping the wetness away. He was hugely aroused, and his cock strained upward toward his belly. Despite serious effort not to look, her gaze wandered to it more than once as she continued to towel him off.</p><p>Finally he seemed to be able to take no more. With a stifled groan, he gripped her wrist. \u201cFinish drying yourself off. I\u2019ll be in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>He walked stiffly from the bathroom, leaving her standing naked and still dripping. She wrapped the towel around her and hugged the material close.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid. She knew what was going to happen. More than that, she knew what she wanted to do. She didn\u2019t want to wait for Garrett to act. She didn\u2019t want to be a passive participant.</p><p>Hurriedly, she dried her hair and combed through it until the tangles were gone. There was a robe hanging from a hook on the back of the door, and as large as it was, it had to belong to Rio.</p><p>She pulled it on and tied the belt before walking out of the bathroom into the bedroom. Garrett was lying on the bed, a towel still wrapped around his hips. His eyes were closed and she frowned at the vivid bruising over his midsection.</p> <p>Even battered and bruised, he was a beautiful man. Drawn to the vulnerable picture he posed, she crawled onto the bed beside him. His eyes opened and he focused on her as she knelt beside him.</p><p>He started to speak, but she lowered her mouth to his to hush him.</p><p>Just as she had while they were locked in the cell, she worked to soothe his hurts. Only this time there was no fear of discovery. No uncertainty of their fate. No reason for her to hold anything back.</p><p>Garrett watched the series of emotions that flickered across her face as she drew away. Her hand slipped up and down his chest, pausing low on his belly. Her fingers trembled against him, part nervousness and part excitement, if he had to guess.</p><p>A little shyly, she pulled at the towel until the ends fell away, baring him completely to her gaze. His cock shot upward as a surge of lust blew through his system. Every muscle in his body screamed its protest but at the moment he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>There was a purposeful look in her eyes that had him hopeful and breathless all at the same time. Then she cocked her head and bit at her bottom lip as if she were unsure of what to do next. It was almost like she was looking to him for guidance. Or permission. Was she afraid of hurting him?</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Sarah,\u201d he whispered. \u201cTouch me. You feel so damn good. Do what you want. You won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He could be lying or maybe he was hoping like hell he spoke the truth. All he knew was that he wanted her mouth on him like he wanted his next breath.</p><p>She kissed him again, this time in the center of his chest. As she kissed a delicate path down his midsection, her hand slid lower and her fingers circled his erection.</p><p>Ah shit.</p><p>He groaned and stirred restlessly, ignoring the pain he felt every time he so much as twitched.</p><p>Then she released him and slid her hand back up again as she kissed each area of his bruised ribs. Little butterfly kisses, each one bringing such pleasure that he was dizzy with it.</p><p>She loved every part of his ache, coaxed and caressed until the pain slid quietly away, replaced by warm euphoria. Her mouth crept lower until her tongue circled a wet path around his navel and to the sensitive skin underneath.</p><p>She hesitated when she licked down to his groin, and his breath caught in his chest and held until finally she grasped his erection. He exhaled in jerky puffs as her fingers circled him once again and she gently moved her hand up and down.</p><p>Again she lowered her mouth and brushed her lips just above the base of his cock. He was crazy with anticipation. Each breath was shallower than the last and every nerve ending in his body was screaming. He moved restlessly, ignoring the protest of his body. His skin was itchy and alive like he was about to turn inside out.</p><p>And finally she slipped her mouth over the crown of his erection and did a warm, wet slide down to her knuckles. He was already hard but the moment her tongue brushed over his length, he hardened to stone, his dick so rigid that it was as much pain as pleasure, and God, he wanted more.</p><p>She glided upward again, tasting every inch. Her mouth was the sweetest pleasure he\u2019d ever known in his life. She took away the pain and replaced it with warmth he felt all the way to his soul.</p><p>He had to touch her. His hands curled and itched like crazy. He raised one to rest on her head and then delved into her hair, rubbing and moving down to her nape as he urged her on. He was careful not to push even though his mind and body were screaming to surge more fully into her.</p><p>She\u2019d shared every part of herself. He knew how difficult it must have been for her to initiate this. He savored it, tasted it. His hand gentled, squeezing softly at her nape before sliding through her hair once more to the back of her head. He loved the feel of her hair around his fingers. He wanted her skin more.</p><p>As she sucked him deeper, he closed his eyes again and skimmed down to the side of her neck. She shivered when he caressed the skin just below her ear. He lingered there a moment and when she dipped again to take him deep, he traced a line around the hollow of her throat and then to her collarbone.</p><p>Her breasts swayed just underneath his reach. Her robe had come open and he could see the tempting swells. He wanted to cup the soft flesh and run his thumb over her nipple, feel it pucker and harden against the pad. But he didn\u2019t want to take more from her than she was willing to give, and so he contented himself with stroking the flesh of her neck and watching her throat work up and down as she swallowed against his erection.</p><p>His release was building and as much as he wanted satisfaction, he wanted to live in the moment. He didn\u2019t want it to end so soon.</p><p>He touched her jaw and she instantly went still. She turned, releasing him from her mouth and faced him, her eyes glowing softly.</p><p>\u201cShould I stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d He couldn\u2019t contain the explosive denial and he worked to amend his statement. \u201cOnly for a moment. It\u2019s too soon. It\u2019s too good to end so quickly.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved upward into a sensual smile of a female who knew she was pleasing her man. She stroked him with her hand, working up and down in slow, rhythmic motions as she continued to watch him.</p><p>\u201cLower,\u201d he said in a husky voice. \u201cTouch me lower. Wrap your fingers around me, honey. I want you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He moaned when she slid her hand all the way down to the base and then let go to cup his balls. She measured the weight in her hand squeezing gently and running her fingers over the sac.</p><p>\u201cWith your mouth,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo it while you use your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her hair fell like a curtain as she lowered her head again. He pushed it aside, wanting to see her mouth as she closed it around his cock. As she massaged and rolled his balls in her hand, she sucked wetly down his length, exerting firm pressure with her mouth.</p><p>His breath escaped in a long hiss and every muscle in his body tightened. The pressure was painful as his bruised and aching muscles protested, but he urged her on, the pleasure of her mouth too much to deny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d he warned. \u201cYou can use your hand if you don\u2019t want me to come in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She made a low purring sound in the back of her throat and then took him whole. He bumped against the back of her mouth and felt her swallow\u2014an invitation\u2014against the head. Oh God, he wasn\u2019t going to last.</p><p>Like silk, she glided sensuously over his cock, her tongue rubbing erotically along the underside. She increased the pace and tightened the pressure until he was nearly insane with the mounting frenzy.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>Her name tore from his lips just as his release boiled up and over. Fire shot through his groin and raced through his veins like quicksilver. He spurted against the back of her throat and then his release coated warm liquid in her mouth and over his cock. She swallowed and continued her downward motion, taking him and holding him like she savored every inch.</p><p>Nothing had ever been so good. He floated, free of pain, free of everything but her.</p><p>Gently, she coaxed the last of his release from him with soft sucking motions. Then she carefully pulled him from her mouth and then facing him, she laid her cheek on his thighs and slid her hand up his hip and to his belly.</p><p>She smiled up at him, her eyes soft and contented. He trailed fingers through her hair, stroking over and over.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>There was worry in her voice and even as she asked, she slid her hand over the bruises as if she could wipe them away with her touch.</p><p>\u201cI promise you I felt nothing but pleasure after I got inside your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I wanted to take away the pain for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did more than that,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou gave me something very special. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks colored prettily and he brushed his fingers over her temple.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re starving, and I promised you caramel num nums.\u201d</p><p>She laced her fingers with his and squeezed. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept all your promises, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>DINNER was fun. Sarah wasn\u2019t sure if it was due to her relief at being alive and safe or if she just enjoyed Garrett\u2019s company that much. He put her in charge of the three-meat dinner course while he worked on caramel num nums.</p><p>\u201cI think you got the better work detail,\u201d she said as she sniffed at the caramel he was stirring.</p><p>\u201cThis is delicate work,\u201d he defended. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snorted and cracked open the oven to peer at the chicken breasts and pork chops. \u201cAlmost done here. What about you?\u201d</p><p>In response, he picked up the pot from the burner and carried it over to the pie dish, where he\u2019d formed the graham cracker crust. He carefully spooned the mixture into the shell and then dropped the pot into the sink.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to cool before I pour on the chocolate, so we can eat first,\u201d he said.</p><p>They set the table and Garrett helped dish up the pieces of meat. By the time they sat down, Sarah\u2019s stomach was growling. She was starving!</p> <p>As she ate, she was unable to keep her gaze from straying to Garrett. When they were in captivity together, she\u2019d admitted to herself that she loved him. She\u2019d wondered briefly if it was simply an emotional reaction to the possibility that they\u2019d die in that shit hole. But now as she stared at him, she realized that her feelings for him couldn\u2019t be explained away that easily.</p><p>The words danced on her tongue, eager to be set free, but she was deeply conscious of the fact that to him she was a job. He worked for her brother. A brother who was extremely protective of her.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d tell him. Maybe not right this minute. She\u2019d always chuckled at the idea of waiting until just the right time to tell someone you loved them. Wasn\u2019t any time good for such a thing? She realized now it wasn\u2019t as easy as that. There was marked difficulty in making yourself that vulnerable to someone else. Bearing your soul gave the other person power over you.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Garrett asked.</p><p>She shook herself from her thoughts and then smiled. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019m ready for a caramel num num.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll melt the chocolate right quick and then I\u2019ll pour it on. Thirty minutes in the fridge ought to set it right and then we can dive in.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he ambled back into the kitchen. Already his gait was smoother, though she could still sense tenderness in the way he walked. Garrett wasn\u2019t the type to dwell on pain, though. To him it was merely an inconvenience.</p><p>He looked up, caught her staring and his lips turned up into a smile. It took her breath away. Her pulse sped up and thumped against her skin until she was aware of every beat. His gaze smoldered with sensual promise.</p><p>She bit at her bottom lip and shivered. There was a lot she still had to tell him. Preferably before they became immersed in a sexual relationship.</p><p>A ridiculously giddy thrill rocketed up her spine, forcing a grin to her face. Sexual relationship. She was calmly contemplating a sexual relationship and furthermore, so far, she\u2019d been the aggressor.</p><p>She had the absurd urge to stand up and do a double-fist pump with a yeah attached for emphasis.</p> <p>What Allen and Stanley Cross had done hadn\u2019t been about sexual attraction or even sex. It was about power and the ability to inflict their will on someone weaker. Allen had raped her because he could, not because he was overwhelmed by desire.</p><p>Garrett wanted her. He desired her. But he held himself back because he was afraid of scaring her. She found that fact endearing, and it only made her want him all the more.</p><p>She watched as Garrett placed the dessert into the fridge and her breath caught in her throat as he returned to the table.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do for the next thirty minutes or so?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, what I want to do is going to take a hell of a lot longer than thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Oh lordy. Her hormones just went haywire.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could just talk,\u201d she murmured. There was a lot she still had to tell him. Preferably before she got swept away and became so senseless she forgot her name.</p><p>He moved closer to her, put his hand on her face, stroking over her cheekbone and then into her hair.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you like to talk about?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI have something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed in concern and his fingers stilled on her face. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Sarah glanced around. She hadn\u2019t seen Rio or his men since they\u2019d arrived at the house, but she couldn\u2019t dispel the unease or the fear of being overheard. She peeked back at Garrett and chewed nervously at her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cCan we go into the bedroom? It\u2019s ... private.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s look of concern deepened, but he turned without question, snagged her hand and pulled her gently toward the bedroom.</p><p>Once they were inside, he closed the door and faced her. \u201cWhatever\u2019s most comfortable for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sit,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the bed. I\u2019d prefer you not to loom over me. This is ... hard ... for me.\u201d</p><p>Garrett turned toward the bed, but he laced his fingers with hers and pulled her with him. He sat on the edge and then positioned her between his legs. He held both of her hands and looked up into her eyes. Then he squeezed. Just a simple gesture of support, but it meant the world to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never told even Marcus this,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cI might have eventually but after what he did to Allen, I knew I couldn\u2019t. He would have gone crazy. Saying aloud that Allen raped me was bad enough. I couldn\u2019t bear the humiliation of telling the rest.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s face darkened. \u201cThe rest? You mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly and tears pricked the corners of her eyes. She sucked in steadying breaths and blinked to hold the burn at bay.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cYou need to know. I should have told you the minute you told me that Stanley Cross had hired someone to find me. I was too ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s thumbs rubbed softly over her wrists and his gaze never left hers.</p><p>\u201cHe ... he was there. The night Allen raped me. He ... helped.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s lips curled into a snarl and his nostrils flared. She felt the quick huff of his breath and saw the tightening of his jaw. \u201cThe son of a bitch raped you too?\u201d</p><p>Sarah closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cNo. Well, yes, but not in the physical sense. He didn\u2019t penetrate me, but he may as well have. He watched Allen and laughed. Then he held my arms so Allen could finish the job. When Allen was finished, Stanley spit on me and told Allen to hire a new assistant because the one he had wasn\u2019t a challenge any longer.\u201d</p><p>Garrett swore long and hard under his breath and his fingers tightened around her hands.</p><p>\u201cThe night Marcus killed Allen, as I ran from the building, Stanley was there. He stopped me when I got off the elevator. He asked what the hell I was doing there. I knew he\u2019d either think I killed Allen or that at the very least he\u2019d know I saw who did. I also know he wouldn\u2019t want what he and Allen did to me to ever become public.\u201d</p><p>She shivered in Garrett\u2019s grip as the words fell baldly between them.</p><p>\u201cI know I should have told you before,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAs soon as I knew Marcus had sent you to protect me. You needed this information. I was certain that the person who broke into my cottage on the island was someone Stanley sent to kill me. It\u2019s why I left and why I finally accepted help from Marcus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Garrett said softly as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>He circled her body and hugged her close to him. It didn\u2019t seem to satisfy him. He pulled her down until she sat across his lap huddled to his chest. For a long moment he simply held her and pressed tender kisses to her hair.</p><p>Tension simmered through him. His muscles quivered beneath her skin and she could literally feel the battle he waged to get his anger under control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do my absolute best to protect you, Sarah. I need for you to believe that.\u201d He pulled away and nudged her chin until she returned his gaze. \u201cI also need for you to believe that you aren\u2019t just a job. This is personal for me. I care a lot about you. We have a connection. One I can\u2019t explain. I\u2019m not really interested in why. I protect the people I care about with my life.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered making her vision grow blurry. He swam in her sight and her heart stuttered and jumped erratically. She raised shaking fingers to his face and traced the line of his cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cI will kill any man who tries to hurt you. And you can believe, if you believe nothing else, I\u2019m going to make Stanley Cross regret the day he ever took part in hurting you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the violence in his voice. She believed him. There was nothing but stark truth in his eyes.</p><p>She leaned her head forward until her forehead touched his. Their mouths were a mere breath apart. She closed her eyes as a tear slid down her cheek.</p><p>His warm lips kissed away the damp trail. He was so exquisitely gentle that her chest tightened unbearably with a swell of emotion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you, Sarah,\u201d he said in a voice tight with the same emotion knotting her throat. \u201cI\u2019m so damn sorry. If I could take it away I would.\u201d</p><p>She slid her mouth over until it aligned with his. \u201cBut you can replace it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI need you, Garrett. Only you. I\u2019m not afraid. With you I feel so strong.\u201d</p><p>He framed her face with both hands and kissed her long and leisurely, his tongue delving deep as he explored the inside of her mouth. She sighed and melted against him, his heat seeping into her bones.</p><p>When he pulled away, she saw something in his eyes that surprised her. He looked ... uncertain. And now he hesitated as he stared softly back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAfraid? Of what?\u201d</p><p>He touched her swollen mouth with one finger and ran it along the seam to the corner and back across. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of doing the wrong thing. I\u2019m afraid of hurting you. Of frightening you. Sarah, honey, I\u2019d die if I did anything to make you go back to that night. I\u2019d do anything in the world to make this right for you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled then and for a moment she couldn\u2019t breathe around the sting in her nose and the hard knot in her throat. \u201cYou will. Oh, Garrett, you\u2019ll be just perfect.\u201d</p><p>She flung her arms around his shoulders and hugged him tightly. She buried her face against the side of his neck and inhaled his scent. Slowly he circled her body with his arms and hugged her back just as fiercely as she held him. Then he brushed his lips across the curve of her neck and spread a line of tiny kisses to her shoulder.</p><p>She felt free in a way she hadn\u2019t felt in a very long time. It was as if something inside her loosened and so much of what she\u2019d kept suppressed came bubbling out.</p><p>Carefully she pushed away from Garrett and slid off his lap to stand in front of him once more. It was important to her to be an equal in their lovemaking. Oh, she had no doubt that Garrett would be exquisitely tender. But she wasn\u2019t going to be a wilting ninny who had to be coaxed at every turn.</p><p>She was a normal, healthy woman. She\u2019d had lovers before. She wasn\u2019t a stranger to passion. She could do this.</p><p>Her gaze never leaving Garrett\u2019s intense blue eyes, she began to undress. Leisurely. Unhurried. She peeled off one item at a time, gauging his interest with every piece that fell to the floor.</p><p>His eyes smoldered. It was a wonder she hadn\u2019t gone up in flames. He watched her like a wolf watched his prey, his gaze stroking over her body like a paintbrush spreading liquid fire.</p><p>Finally she lowered her panties and let them pool at her feet. Then she pulled the straps of her bra down her shoulders until the cups fell away from her breasts. A mere second later, she tossed aside the bra and stood before him naked and trembling\u2014not in fear\u2014never in fear.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how beautiful you are?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cRight now I do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe way you\u2019re looking at me makes me feel like the most beautiful, desirable woman on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should.\u201d</p><p>Much as she\u2019d done, he rose from the bed and stood just a foot apart from her as he began to slowly undress. His jeans dropped to the floor, leaving him in his boxer briefs. The material hugged his behind and his groin, outlining the sheer beauty of his physique. Her gaze was riveted to the bulge and to the thick erection being restrained by his underwear.</p><p>He pulled his shirt over his head. The muscles in his chest and shoulders rippled magnificently as he stretched. She simply couldn\u2019t help herself. She had to touch him.</p><p>She pressed her palms to his broad chest and smoothed them upward to his shoulders. He trembled and flinched, his breathing raw and harsh, pushed from his chest in torturous sounding spurts. His reaction surprised her but when she looked into his eyes, she saw the same desperate need that unfurled inside her.</p><p>She stepped even closer until his body heat wrapped around her. The first touch of his flesh against hers was an electric shock. He was lean and hard, rough and hairy. She wanted to rub herself all over him like a cat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me, honey,\u201d Garrett rasped out. \u201cLord have mercy, but you\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and reached for the waistband of his underwear. He sucked in his breath as she started working them down over his hips. His erection sprang free and bumped against the softness of her belly. She let go of the material, not caring where it went. She wanted to touch him. It was an urgent, restless need that took over. She ran her fingertips lightly up his sides, grinning when he shivered in response. They danced across his chest and then slid down to his belly and then lower still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Garrett muttered as he pried her hands away from his cock. \u201cIf you so much as breathe on me, I\u2019m going to come and then I\u2019ll be so humiliated I\u2019ll never be able to get it up again.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and took a step back, more so she could look at him, all of him. Oh but he was beautiful. She thought that a lot about him, but it was so true. He was the perfect male specimen. Rough. Hard. Strong. A warrior in every sense of the word. There was nothing easy about him. She doubted there was a soft part on his body. And she wanted his hands on her more than she wanted to breathe.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she said in an aching voice. \u201cI want to feel you.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands over the sides of her neck and up to frame her face. His mouth came down on hers in a heated rush that stole her breath. His mouth was so gentle over hers, but insistent too.</p> <p>The warmth of his tongue licking delicately at her lips sent a shiver down her spine. He tasted her like she was a delicious treat he was sampling. And as if he found it decadent, he pushed inward, wanting more. She met his advance, rubbing her tongue over the roughness of his. There was a hint of caramel, proof he\u2019d snuck a taste while he\u2019d been making dessert.</p><p>He sucked lightly at her bottom lip, pulling it then letting it go as he delved once more inside. Then he retreated and nibbled at her upper lip to the corner where he peppered her with tiny kisses. His mouth slid from her mouth to her jaw, tracing a line to her ear.</p><p>His breath blew over the delicate shell of her ear even as he sucked the lobe between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI want to savor you all night,\u201d he said in a rough, husky voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to take this slow. I want it to be perfect. So perfect. Now that you\u2019re finally mine, I\u2019m going to kiss every inch of your body. I want to touch you and taste you and love you until you know in your heart that I\u2019ll never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her legs turned to jelly.</p> <p>Which was okay because he bent and looped his arm underneath her quivering legs and hoisted her into his arms. He turned and walked the few steps to the bed and gently laid her down on the mattress.</p><p>He loomed over her, staring down at her like she was a feast he was about to devour. His gaze was fixed on her as if he was totally absorbed in her. Just her. It was a heady, giddy feeling that sent tingles of excitement through her blood.</p><p>The mattress dipped as he crawled onto the bed beside her. At first he contented himself with touching her. Just as she\u2019d asked. And oh but his hands were wonderful. She was right. They weren\u2019t soft\u2014she knew that already. But the way they glided up and down her body in a reverent manner made her feel as though she was a goddess being paid homage to.</p><p>He levered himself over her so that his body half covered hers and he stared down into her eyes, his expression serious. \u201cIf at any time I do something you\u2019re not okay with, tell me. I\u2019ll stop immediately.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to cry. Not because she was sad. Or afraid. But because he made her feel so protected and ... cherished. It was a welcome change from fear and shame, from anxiety and fear.</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow kiss me.\u201d</p><p>His body pressed flush to hers as he lowered his mouth to capture her lips in yet another searing, soul wrenching kiss. Her breasts pressed into his chest, the light mat of hair teasing her nipples to hard points.</p><p>One hand wandered over her body, tracing a path over her curves, down her leg then back up again to her shoulder and then tangling in her hair. There was no sense of urgency about him. No rush\u2014though she could tell by the betraying tremble of his body how hard he fought for control. She released a sigh of bliss that he swallowed up as his mouth possessed hers.</p><p>She wanted him. Not just wanted, but had to have. She wanted everything. His body. His touch. His tenderness. His love.</p><p>He shifted and his cock rested across her pelvis, hot and pulsing, so rigid and yet satiny smooth. But he made no move to end things that quickly. He pushed himself up and over her once more and dipped his head to nuzzle at her neck. He teased the sensitive flesh below her ear and nibbled a path to her shoulder, spreading a thousand chill bumps in his wake.</p><p>Soft, open-mouthed kisses caressed her flesh, ever closer to her breasts. She held her breath, waiting for his mouth to close around her nipple, but he continued to tease and lavish his attention on the plump swell.</p><p>She groaned in equal parts pleasure and frustration.</p><p>Then he dragged his tongue across the aureole and finally over her aching nipple. It puckered and thrust upward, so tight it was painful. He traced a damp circle around the bud before finally returning to it. His lips closed over the point and he sucked, keeping it between his teeth.</p> <p>She arched off the bed, grasping wildly at his shoulders, something to hold on to, something for her fingers to dig into as she gasped her pleasure into the silence. He smiled against her breast and then carefully pulled away and fixed his gaze to hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so good at pretty words,\u201d he admitted in a somewhat self-conscious voice. \u201cI feel like I should be composing poetry or saying all the right things. You\u2019re so beautiful and the fact that you\u2019re giving yourself to me ... I don\u2019t have the words.\u201d</p><p>She melted all the more under his steady gaze. She let all her love for him bleed into her smile as she raised her hand to stroke over his cheek. \u201cThe way you look at me, the way you touch me, tells me far more than words ever could.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, more fiercely than before. Breathless. Until she fidgeted with the restless, achy need that bloomed inside her. She wanted more. So much more.</p><p>He slid down her body, his mouth brushing over her breasts and then her belly. He paused at the juncture of her legs and gently kissed the area right above the patch of hair at her groin.</p><p>She shuddered, sighed and then arched upward, parting her legs in unconscious invitation. He repositioned himself so that he was between her sprawled legs, and again she held her breath as she watched his dark head lower until she could feel his soft exhale over her clit.</p><p>And then he touched her with his tongue. Just a simple flick over her clit and her hips bolted upward. Her knees shook uncontrollably and her fingers curled into tight fists at her sides.</p><p>With gentle fingers he parted her farther and swept his tongue over her quivering flesh to her opening. He circled it in a slow, teasing rhythm and then licked his way back up to her clit. He drew away for a moment and toyed with the swollen nub with his fingers, exerting just enough pressure to drive her insane. How could she withstand sweet and slow when he was killing her with just a touch?</p><p>He pressed his mouth where his fingers had just played and kissed her softly, sucking until she twisted and arched spasmodically.</p><p>\u201cGarrett.\u201d</p><p>His name spilled from her lips, a soft plea, although she wasn\u2019t sure what she begged for.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as he raised his head.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He returned his attention to his gentle lovemaking, only this time he ran a finger through her folds. And when his mouth returned to her clit, he eased his finger inside her.</p><p>Lightning sizzled through her veins. Her orgasm welled up sharp and explosive. As he applied more pressure with his mouth, she went up in flames. Flood after flood of intense pleasure washed through her and over her.</p><p>It was several moments before she became aware of the fact that he was no longer between her legs. He lay beside her, gazing lazily down at her, smug satisfaction outlined on his face.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>She stretched and turned into his arms, rubbing against his warm body. She sighed and laid her cheek on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled lightly as he lifted a strand of her hair and let it fall from his fingers. \u201cWe\u2019re not done. Not even close to being done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the nicest things.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek and kissed her lingeringly. When he shifted over, she could feel his hardness burning into her belly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you pack condoms in your soldier gear.\u201d</p><p>He reared back and then he laughed. \u201cSoldier gear?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhatever you call it. Aren\u2019t you Marines prepared for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we routinely stop and fuck during a mission,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She giggled and punched him in the gut. \u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two. We\u2019ll have to make the most of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d he murmured as he swept her underneath him.</p><p>He started all over again, coaxing a response and building and stoking the fire within her. He alternated kissing her senseless and licking over her body until she was panting and twitching from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought,\u201d he rasped out as he rolled off her. She glanced sideways to see him dangle from the bed and fumble with his jeans. A moment later, her repositioned himself atop her and stroked his hand through her hair. \u201cNow. Where were we?\u201d</p><p>Feeling bold, she reached down and curled her hand around his latex-covered erection. She guided him toward her entrance and they both hissed out their breath when her heat surrounded him.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like here,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Lowering to his elbows on either side of her, he eased forward, pushing into her with extreme patience and care.</p><p>\u201cStop me if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>In response, she lifted her legs, curled them around his waist and arched her hips. Her movement caused him to sink farther into her body and she sighed. She stretched around him and the sensation was delicious.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>He surged forward the last few inches and her eyes flew open at the aching fullness. Tight, so very tight. She hugged his cock. Her body clenched with need and her pussy pulsed and rippled over his length.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re with me, Sarah. I can\u2019t hold back anymore.\u201d</p><p>The words came out in a pained-sounding rush. Sweat beaded his forehead and his jaw was clenched tight. Her fingers danced up his arms to his shoulders and she clasped her hands around his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you, Garrett. All the way. Let go. You won\u2019t hurt me. I want this. I want you.\u201d</p><p>With a groan he withdrew and thrust forward again. He only paused a second before he thrust again. And then again. He watched her the entire time and to ease his mind, she gave over to the all-consuming pleasure surrounding her like a cloud. She closed her eyes and threw back her head as the sound of his hips meeting the backs of her legs slid erotically over her ears.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need,\u201d he strained out. \u201cI want you to come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t stop,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>No matter that he thought he was the one lacking control. She was already teetering on the edge of another orgasm, this one more intense, more explosive than the previous one. She bowed upward, her legs wrapped so tight around his waist that her body ached with the strain.</p><p>He thrust harder but he watched her the entire time and his fingers gently caressed her cheek. His body tightened and he closed his eyes, his gaze leaving her for the first time. She knew he was close and she wanted to go with him.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A strangled sound escaped his throat and then he complied, rushing forward into her body. Once. Twice. She cried out his name, gripped his shoulders with bloodless fingers. Her name slipped from his lips in a husky, gravelly growl. Her orgasm burst over her like a balloon stretched too far.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t think. Couldn\u2019t process anything but the mind-numbing ecstasy that fired through her brain. And through it all, Garrett gathered her close. Murmured her name. Whispered soothing words that were a balm to her ravaged senses.</p><p>She was breathing way too hard and too fast. Bright spots flashed in her vision and she closed her eyes, melting underneath him. Boneless. Mindless. She lay still as he came to rest atop her.</p><p>His chest heaved against hers and she felt the dampness as his forehead rested against hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a woman come like you do,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so damn tired, I might take offense,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an insult. Right now I feel like Master of the Universe. It\u2019s a helluva ego trip for a man when his woman reacts that way to his lovemaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re going to get all smug on me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and kissed her nose. \u201cOh, hell, yeah, I am.\u201d Then he sobered. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Never better.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to the side and then turned his back to her for a moment while he discarded the condom. A moment later he rolled back to her and wrapped his arms around her. She snuggled into his embrace and laid her head on his shoulder. After a moment he rolled to his back, taking her with him so that she was tucked firmly into his side. His arm curled possessively around her and he rubbed his fingers up and down her arm as their quiet breathing filled the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about Stanley before,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. Especially since I knew he was likely to come after me. I just didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>Garrett lifted his head and kissed her temple.</p><p>\u201cI think I hate him more than I hate Allen. Isn\u2019t that stupid? Stanley didn\u2019t rape me. Allen did. But Stanley stood there with this smirk on his face the entire time. I begged him to help me and he just stood there looking at me like I was beneath his notice, like I deserved to be used. I\u2019ll always hate him for that. For being there. For allowing Allen to do what he did.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s arm tightened around her. \u201cHe won\u2019t get away with it, Sarah. I swear to you he won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>His vow comforted her even though she doubted Garrett would ever have the occasion to come into contact with Stanley Cross. She stretched her legs, tangling them with his. She rubbed her foot up and down his hair-roughened leg as her hand glided over his chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you for making tonight so special.\u201d</p><p>Garrett kissed her again. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d</p><p>She rose up to look at him in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you who made tonight special,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty special, Sarah.\u201d</p> <p>She lowered her head until her lips touched his. \u201cSo are you, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>THE next morning, Garrett waited until Sarah went into the bathroom to shower before he rolled out of bed and hurriedly dressed. He needed a moment to talk to Donovan because it was time to quit fucking around and end this.</p><p>He took the sat phone and stepped outside the reinforced, bulletproof glass doors to the enclosed patio off the master suite. The windows were tinted and was the only room in the house that allowed a sweeping view of the valley below.</p><p>Still, he remained in the shadows, in the corner and dialed up Donovan.</p><p>\u201cMiss us already?\u201d Donovan drawled a moment later.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Garrett said quietly. \u201cSend an email to Lattimer. Pretend you\u2019re Sarah and tip him off. I don\u2019t care what you tell him, just get him here. Let Resnick know so he can be in place. I need this over with as soon as possible. There are too many risks and Stanley Cross is the wild card here. He wants Sarah taken out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllen Cross\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Allen Cross is the son of a bitch who raped Sarah, but his brother was there. He watched. He participated. His story about hiring a recovery firm to bring Sarah in because she can help bring his brother\u2019s killer to justice is bullshit. He wants her out of the picture so she can\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Donovan muttered. \u201cWhat a fucking asshole. I vote that when this crap is over with Lattimer that you and I go on a little hunting trip.\u201d</p><p>Garrett grinned. One thing he loved about Donovan was that he had a very personal sense of justice when it came to certain crimes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about Sarah, Garrett? It\u2019s obvious she means a lot to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me worry about Sarah,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send the email. You need to alert Rio and be on guard. It\u2019s possible Lattimer won\u2019t even show. He might send his men in after her.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll come. Sarah is personal to him. He killed Allen Cross because he hurt Sarah. Personally. He didn\u2019t send someone else to do it though he could easily have done so. He risked a damn lot showing his face on U.S. soil again. Coming to Belize will be nothing to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe ready, Garrett. Lattimer\u2019s no amateur. He\u2019s a ruthless bastard with a very gray sense of justice.\u201d</p><p>Garrett thought back to when he faced Lattimer down all those years ago and felt the ripping sensation of the bullet Lattimer fired tearing into his leg. \u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me anything I don\u2019t already know. I\u2019ve waited a damn long time for this, Donovan. I won\u2019t fuck it up. And tell Resnick he better damn well be careful. If he barges in here like a fucking idiot, Rio and his men are going to take exception. This is our show and Resnick better play by our rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him know. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Garrett hung up the phone and then called Rio to relay the news.</p><p>SARAH hummed contentedly as she set out the plates for breakfast. She dished up the eggs and bacon and then went to the oven to pull out the pan of biscuits that had turned golden brown. It was easy to forget that they were in some way out-of-the-way place in Central America, or that she and Garrett had endured a harrowing captivity just two days earlier.</p><p>Peace that she hadn\u2019t experienced in a long time settled over her like a warm and comforting blanket. She felt energized. She felt alive. And she felt hope for her future.</p><p>It was all silly. This giddy, feeling that gripped her. But it was fun and light and she wanted to laugh for the sheer joy of laughing. She smiled as she put the tray of biscuits on the counter and then she looked up and found Garrett across the room watching her with those intense blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d he asked as he ambled over.</p><p>A delicious thrill ran over her body all over again as she recalled the previous night. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief glimmer of tension that rippled across his face before he walked over to where she stood and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her into his back. He kissed the side of her neck. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>She rotated in his arms and leaned up on tiptoe to kiss him. \u201cThank you for last night. For listening. For just letting me get it out without judging or reacting.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her and kissed her long and lingering, his lips melting over hers. \u201cHe won\u2019t touch you, Sarah. Ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you let Marcus know what\u2019s going on? I don\u2019t want him to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him for a long moment as reality edged its way into her euphoria. Strange how it always worked that way. Thinking of Marcus had brought home the fact that her entire life had been upended. She was starting over with only Marcus to rely on for help.</p><p>She pulled away and placed the biscuits on a platter and then went to set them on the table. Garrett followed her and when she went to sit down, he put his hand over her wrist, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and eased down into her chair. She picked up her fork and speared a piece of egg and then pushed it around her plate. \u201cMy life is a mess,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019ve been in survival mode for so long, just taking it day by day, never thinking beyond the immediate. Marcus would like nothing more than to take care of me, for him to put me up somewhere where I never had to worry about money or work, but what kind of life is that? Existing, but not living. I can\u2019t return to Boston. I wouldn\u2019t, even if Stanley Cross got hit by a bus tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant enough thought,\u201d Garrett cut in.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, I admit it is. But I wouldn\u2019t want him to die immediately. I\u2019d want him to linger for several days and be in agonizing pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you get all ruthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I love about you?\u201d she said in an instant change of topic.</p><p>He blinked in surprise. \u201cMy amazing body? My ability to give you awesome orgasms?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAside from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to throw a pity party because you know just what to say to make me laugh and smile.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew serious. \u201cI\u2019m not making light of your situation, honey. If anyone has a reason to bitch, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I mean it. Somehow it never seems quite so bad when I talk to you. I was sitting here thinking about what the hell I\u2019m going to do after this is all over with. But then I think if it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have those concerns because I\u2019d probably be dead. And life ... it\u2019s precious, you know? Even when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s still good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust when I think I\u2019ve got you figured out, you do or say something that just makes me realize that I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of the woman you are.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed under the blatant admiration in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty damn special yourself, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened and he looked down at his food, forking up a bite of eggs and shoveling them into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell me about you and Marcus. You were raised in foster homes and yet he\u2019s your half brother. He seems pretty concerned about you now. Why weren\u2019t you raised together?\u201d</p><p>The question caught her off guard and for a moment she sat there, fork frozen midway to her mouth. She lowered it to her plate and was silent a moment.</p><p>\u201cMarcus and I shared a father. I never knew him, but from what I\u2019ve heard he was a real bastard. Marcus hated him because he was unfaithful to Marcus\u2019s mom when he knocked my mom up. I would have thought that would give him reason enough to hate me. My mom wasn\u2019t self-sufficient. She was the type of woman who floated from man to man, looking for someone to take care of her because she had no desire to be responsible or hold a job. When she got pregnant with me, I think she thought I was her meal ticket. The problem was, my father wanted nothing to do with either of us. He sent her away without a dime and told her he\u2019d kill her if she ever tried to make trouble for him. Granted, this was my mother\u2019s side and I was very young when she told me these stories, but Marcus did confirm that my mother did go to my father\u2019s house when she found out she was pregnant with me and that our father threw her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a real piece of work,\u201d Garrett muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe died when I was eight and I went into the foster care system. You already know all that. Marcus has always felt guilty because he knew he had a half brother or sister, and he also knew our father would never accept me. After our father died, he started searching for me. When he found me, he wanted to give me things. A home. Money. Cars. I don\u2019t know if he was trying to assuage his guilt or if just wanted the best for me. I was uncomfortable with it. I had a good job. I\u2019d never get rich at it, but I was happy. And honestly just knowing he cared and that he\u2019d been looking for me was enough. Suddenly I had someone when I hadn\u2019t since I was eight. Plus ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus what?\u201d Garrett said as she drifted off.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t say this to insult you because I know you work for my brother, but I know he\u2019s not perfect. I suspect ... I suspect he\u2019s done a lot of things. Bad things. Our father wasn\u2019t a good man. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to know, because I love him and he\u2019s my only family. I feel guilty because I stick my head in the sand, but if I knew\u2014if I really knew\u2014that he\u2019d done terrible things, it would crush me.\u201d</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath. Goddamn but this sucked. He didn\u2019t even want to respond anything because anything he said at this point would be a lie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think badly of you,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cI mean, I know this is a job. You just work for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t just a job, Sarah. If you believe that, you\u2019re one hundred percent wrong. I don\u2019t give a damn about the job. What I care about is you and making damn sure Cross doesn\u2019t get close to you.\u201d</p><p>Pink dusted her cheeks and her eyes went soft. \u201cGarrett, there\u2019s something else I wanted to tell you. Something I wanted to tell you when we were in that prison and I was so afraid. I didn\u2019t think that was the right time, and maybe it isn\u2019t now. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Garrett looked up in annoyance when Rio and Terrence let themselves in the back door. Sarah stood abruptly, her cheeks flushed and her fingers curled into nervous fists. What the hell had she been about to tell him?</p><p>\u201cDo you guys want breakfast?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty, and I could put on some more eggs and bacon if the others would like to eat.\u201d</p><p>Rio glanced between Garrett\u2019s scowl and Sarah with a raised eyebrow. \u201cAre we interrupting anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cReally. We were just eating and talking about nothing. Why don\u2019t you join us?\u201d</p><p>Without giving Rio or Terrence a chance to answer, she hurried around to the fridge and took out more eggs and the rest of the bacon. She juggled another can of biscuits and plopped it all onto the counter.</p><p>\u201cYour timing sucks,\u201d Garrett muttered as Rio and Terrence took their seats.</p><p>Rio glanced over at Sarah, who was busy beating the eggs in a bowl. \u201cVan called. Resnick\u2019s sending one of his teams in. I don\u2019t like it, but we could probably use the backup. Lattimer has resources. I don\u2019t think it would be a bad idea to call up Steele for this. The last thing we want to do is underestimate Lattimer when all this goes down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo what you feel is best,\u201d Garrett murmured. \u201cMy priority is Sarah. Your job is to make damn sure we\u2019re both safe. If you need to call Steele in, then do it.\u201d</p><p>Rio gave a short nod as Sarah walked over to put two plates in front of him and Terrence.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rest?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cAren\u2019t they hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t leave their posts,\u201d Rio explained. \u201cTerrence and I won\u2019t be long. We just wanted to check in on you two and make sure everything was all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Sarah said breathlessly and gave Garrett a shy look that made him smile.</p><p>She sat back down, fiddled with her now-cold food some more and then looked up first at Garrett and then the others, and she frowned. \u201cDo you really think they\u2019ll find me here?\u201d</p><p>Rio shot Garrett a look that clearly told him he wasn\u2019t sure who the \u201cthey\u201d were that she was referring to and furthermore, he wasn\u2019t going to venture onto shaky ground.</p><p>\u201cCross. Or the people he hired, I mean,\u201d she amended when no one immediately answered her.</p><p>Garrett reached over and squeezed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. But probable? It would take time to pick up our trail from Mexico and a lot of resources to track us here. I\u2019m not saying it couldn\u2019t be done. We didn\u2019t have the cleanest exit in the world, and my brothers hauling ass to Corozal didn\u2019t help I\u2019m sure. But regardless of whether they know where you are, what you need to realize is that we\u2019re not going to let those bastards take you.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett glanced over at Rio. No, it wasn\u2019t Cross and company who concerned them. But make no mistake, once Lattimer was taken care of, Cross was definitely next on their list.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>THE slight bulge in Marcus Lattimer\u2019s jaw was the only indication of his mounting fury. He stared coolly at the email from Sarah he\u2019d just opened and leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowed in concentration.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t surprise him that someone had gotten to Sarah. She hadn\u2019t done the best job in disappearing. He\u2019d tried to persuade her to come to him, but he\u2019d understood her reasons why. Sarah had become a target from the moment Marcus had killed her rapist. It was one of the few times he\u2019d lost control in his life. It was one of the few mistakes he\u2019d made.</p><p>Not that he regretted killing Allen Cross even for a moment. But he\u2019d handled it all wrong. He\u2019d allowed his rage to rule his actions. Stupid. What he should have done was get Sarah away from Boston and settled. Somewhere she\u2019d be happy and taken care of. Then he could have dealt with Cross. Sarah would be none the wiser and he could have returned to her. They could have been a family.</p><p>Damn Culpepper. Another of Marcus\u2019s recent mistakes. He was growing careless. Culpepper must have gotten information to the U.S. government before Marcus dispensed of him a few days earlier. He\u2019d lasted longer than Marcus had thought he would. But no one could last forever under such horrific conditions.</p> <p>Now Marcus wanted to kill him all over again for selling out Marcus\u2019s only family. Sarah, who\u2019d never hurt anyone. Who\u2019d already been dealt enough misfortune in her life. He\u2019d been so determined to make it up to her, and in the end he\u2019d only caused her more pain.</p><p>It was all too pat. Too easy. Marcus doubted that Sarah even composed the email staring him in the face. She was too careful. She\u2019d never blab such explicit details through an email. The question was whether Sarah was even in Belize as the email stated. It was a trap. No doubt there. But were they using her for actual bait or were they just trying to get Marcus to walk blindly into capture?</p><p>They weren\u2019t the first to underestimate him. They wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>He leaned forward and punched the button on the desk to summon his head of security. He needed as much information on Sarah\u2019s actual location as possible. If she wasn\u2019t in Belize, he could go in, destroy the sons of bitches who bent low enough to use a woman in their war. If she was in Belize ... then he was going to have to be extremely careful. He wasn\u2019t going to give himself up, but neither would he allow Sarah to be sacrificed on his behalf.</p><p>It was time to call in a few favors.</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>RIO wasn\u2019t happy when Garrett informed him Steele and his team were coming in hot. The team leader\u2019s lips thinned and his jaw went taut.</p><p>\u201cShould have just hung up some balloons and announced a fucking party,\u201d Rio muttered.</p> <p>Garrett gave him a look of sympathy. Rio was a loner and it had probably been hard enough to open up his private sanctuary to Garrett and Sarah but now he had to play host to Steele and his entire team and there wasn\u2019t much love lost between the two team leaders.</p><p>\u201cTell him this is my show. He\u2019s not barging onto my turf and taking over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cVan was clear. You\u2019re on point. You know this area. You have all the escape routes. Steele and his team are here to provide cover and support.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded but he still looked pissed.</p><p>\u201cLook on the bright side,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cVan sent them to fucking Alaska first. Steele\u2019s probably not any happier that he\u2019s had to haul ass to Central America from Alaska.\u201d</p><p>Rio grinned. \u201cAlaska, huh. Ouch.\u201d</p><p>Garrett rolled his eyes at how delighted Rio was over Steele\u2019s inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stick Steele and his team on the perimeter. They can sleep in the trees. They\u2019ll have a bird\u2019s-eye view of the valley and the river. If someone comes after us, they\u2019ll come from the air or the river. Either way we\u2019ll nail them before they get here.\u201d</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cI want Lattimer taken down the first time he shows his face. And Rio, tell your men to be careful. Lattimer is a ruthless bastard. He has no compunction about killing those he perceives as a threat. I don\u2019t want to lose a single man.\u201d</p><p>Rio\u2019s eyes went flat. \u201cI already lost one man. I\u2019m not losing another.\u201d</p><p>Months earlier, one of Rio\u2019s men had been killed when Garrett\u2019s mom had been abducted from the hospital where Garrett\u2019s dad had been taken after suffering a heart attack. It had been hard on the team leader. He\u2019d felt enormous guilt over his man\u2019s death and Marlene Kelly\u2019s abduction.</p><p>Garrett put a hand on Rio\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know this sucks for you man, but I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s their ETA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours.\u201d</p><p>Rio nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll meet them at the river and show them their posts.\u201d</p><p>Garrett stifled a smile. Anytime Rio rolled out the welcome mat, it was guaranteed to be interesting.</p><p>After leaving Rio, Garrett went in search of Sarah only to find her curled on a couch in Rio\u2019s library with a book in hand. It still amazed him that Rio had such refined tastes. In addition to the well-stocked library, the man had a wine cellar that would make royalty green with envy. It was obvious that Rio had spent a lifetime stocking his house in all the things he loved the most. Sarah had called it right when she\u2019d suggested that this was Rio\u2019s refuge. His home. Something he kept away from the rest of his life. It made Garrett look at his team leader in a whole new light. It also made him realize how little he knew about the men\u2014and the woman\u2014that KGI employed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said from the doorway.</p><p>She looked up, setting her book down on her lap. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>A broad smile spread across her face, and her cheeks bloomed with color. It gave him a kick in the gut that she was obviously glad to see him.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying yourself?\u201d</p><p>She patted the spot on the couch beside her in invitation and he ambled over to settle beside her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird in a way. I feel almost guilty to be eating good food and enjoying good books. I keep thinking I should be looking over my shoulder and worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYours is to relax and not worry.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled into his arms and lay her head on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiling me, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>He stroked a hand down her hair and kissed the top of her head. \u201cBeing spoiled isn\u2019t a bad thing, surely.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and rubbed her cheek over his chest. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d Then she raised her head up so sharply she almost butted him in the chin. \u201cHey, I never got a caramel num num.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThey haven\u2019t gone anywhere. Well, not unless Rio and his men found them.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled out of his arms and hurried toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll fight Rio for them.\u201d</p><p>Garrett pushed up to follow her, grinning the whole way. In the kitchen, Sarah jerked open the fridge and stared inside, her brow furrowed in concentration. Then her eyes lit up and she reached in and pulled out the pie dish.</p><p>Garrett took it from her, turned the dish upside down onto a glass platter and tapped until the whole thing came out. Then he tossed the dish into the sink and began cutting the dessert into little pieces. Sarah hung impatiently at his side until he offered her a bite.</p><p>She pounced on it and nibbled at the treat. She closed her eyes and groaned. \u201cOh my God. This is wonderful, Garrett. Give me more.\u201d</p><p>She shoved him aside and picked out several of the larger pieces. He chuckled as she viewed him suspiciously, like she was an animal guarding her food.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all yours,\u201d he said, putting his hands up in defense. He watched as she put another bite into her mouth and closed her eyes with a soft groan.</p><p>\u201cRio has an enclosed pool off the left wing of this house. Wanna go for a swim?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She lowered the candy and scrunched up her brow. \u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if it wasn\u2019t. Rio is a paranoid bastard. He\u2019s made this place virtually impenetrable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Garrett pushed in closer to her, swaggering as he said the next. \u201cSkinny-dipping?\u201d</p><p>Color rose in her cheeks. \u201cGarrett! I don\u2019t want anyone seeing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention this pool is completely enclosed? No one will see you but me, honey, and I\u2019m going to end up seeing you whether you wear a suit or not. I just figure it\u2019ll make my job easier if you forego a suit from the start.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIncorrigible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am, I am,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mama has said so many a time.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOkay. Skinny-dipping it is. But if anyone else sees me, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers with a growl. \u201cIf anyone else sees you, I\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU ever think we spend most of our time in transit?\u201d P.J. asked as she hopped into the boat beside Cole. Behind her, Dolphin, Renshaw and Baker piled into the next boat while Steele stood on the dock coolly surveying the river.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we spend most of our time getting jerked around,\u201d Cole muttered. \u201cFirst it\u2019s fucking Alaska. Now it\u2019s the damn jungle. I hate the fucking jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only say that because you got shot the last time we ventured into the jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a ricochet,\u201d Cole pointed out.</p><p>P.J. shrugged. \u201cYou still took a bullet and had to be carried out.\u201d</p><p>Cole scowled as he stared at the smaller woman who serenely stared over the water. Steele climbed aboard and gave the motion to shove off. Damn woman was yanking his chain again and, as always, he rose to the bait beautifully.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what we\u2019ll have here,\u201d she said as she turned. \u201cIn Alaska, it was BAFB. I guess here it\u2019s BAFS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBAFS?\u201d Cole asked cautiously. He wasn\u2019t even sure he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cBig-ass fucking snakes,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cThey have anacondas here. They can swallow a man whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just fucking great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way too easy Coletraine,\u201d Steele said, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI hate snakes. They freak me the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>P.J. patted him on the arm. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you, Cole. I won\u2019t let the big bad snakes get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tempted to feed you to them.\u201d</p><p>Steele chuckled and turned his attention back to the river as the boats glided soundlessly through the water.</p><p>\u201cI hope wherever we\u2019re going, we get some sleep,\u201d P.J. said with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cThe accommodations will be up to Rio,\u201d Steele said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Cole said glumly. \u201cI think the man\u2019s idea of first-class accommodations is having a rock for a pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRio has a nice place here,\u201d P.J. piped up.</p><p>Steele raised an eyebrow while Cole turned sharply. \u201cHow the hell do you know what Rio has?\u201d</p><p>P.J. shrugged. \u201cHe told me about it. Sounds like a nice place. He worked on it for years. Pretty high-tech too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had an actual conversation with Rio?\u201d Cole asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s cool.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cJust how well do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the hell do you have time to talk? When we\u2019re all together for a mission, there sure as hell isn\u2019t time for chitchat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh, I have a life outside our missions, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Cole\u2019s mouth popped open. Granted he didn\u2019t know jack about what his team members did outside the job. If he was honest, most of the time they lived, ate and breathed the job. Sometimes they spent weeks together, day in, day out. It was hard to imagine anyone\u2019s life outside the team.</p><p>\u201cI saw him when he was in Colorado a few months back,\u201d she said with a huff of impatience. \u201cHe knew I lived in the area so he looked me up. We had a few drinks. Talked shop.\u201d</p><p>Cole scowled again and glanced over at Steele to see how he took the news. He appeared as unruffled as ever, but then that was Steele. He never interfered in their private lives. When they were on a mission, their asses belonged to Steele. No questions asked. They followed his command without question. But when they finished, they each went their own way, and until now, Cole never gave a thought to how his teammates lived when they weren\u2019t together.</p><p>P.J. was a good looking, very in-shape woman. She was smart. Sharp as a tack. And she could damn well look after herself. Any red-blooded male would be tripping over his tongue to hook up with her.</p><p>Now it was going to bug him to wonder what had happened between P.J. and Rio. Not that it was any of his business. P.J. was just a teammate. Nothing more.</p> <p>But as they slipped farther down the river, Cole couldn\u2019t help but imagine P.J. with Rio.</p><p>He scowled harder.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, they docked at a bend in the river. It was a moonless night and they were far enough from any town that the entire area was shrouded in a cloak of darkness. Cole\u2019s eyes rapidly adjusted and he caught movement at the other end of the dock.</p><p>He pushed P.J. back and stepped in front of her, then barked a low warning to Steele and pulled up his rifle.</p><p>Rio rippled out of the shadows and murmured a greeting to Steele and his team. P.J. shoved by Cole and then got into his face, her eyes spitting fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that, Coletraine? You ever pull a stunt like that again and I\u2019ll cut your balls off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>Hell, he didn\u2019t know what had possessed him to do that. She had a right to be mad. He\u2019d treated her like she was someone in need of protecting. Not like an equal.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Steele said shortly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got until dawn to scout and get into position.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>SARAH yawned and gave a gigantic stretch as she pried open her eyes. According to the clock at her bedside, it was already past noon. Noon? Holy cow.</p><p>She bolted upward and started to leap out of bed but then she flopped back onto her pillow and stared up at the ceiling. Why did she have to hurry? There was absolutely no place she had to be. Nothing to do other than whatever she wanted.</p><p>It was a nice feeling to know that she was safe and that she could slow down and stop the incessant worrying that had plagued her for so long that she\u2019d forgotten what it felt like to just be.</p><p>She had Garrett to thank for that. Well, and Marcus, but mostly Garrett. The man had made her feel like living again. She smiled and yawned lazily. After a moment, the sounds coming from the bathroom pricked her ears and she realized Garrett was showering.</p> <p>Feeling devilish, she scooted from the bed and hurried into the bathroom. Sure enough, he was in the shower and steam rose, fogging the shower doors and the bathroom windows. With a grin, she shed her nightshirt and opened the shower door to see Garrett standing with his eyes closed, face turned up into the spray as water cascaded over his muscular, lean body.</p><p>All the breath left her as she simply stared. He was so gorgeous. Sweet merciful lord. but the man was simply lethal.</p><p>Water slid over his belly, down through the dark hair of his groin and then down thickly corded legs. She frowned when she spotted a large, ugly scar on his upper leg that she hadn\u2019t noticed before. It was old but large. It didn\u2019t look like it had been stitched well. There was a mass of scar tissue, still angry looking, white at the edges and dull pink in the center.</p><p>When she glanced back up, she saw that his eyes were open and he was staring at her. His cock twitched under the onslaught of water and stiffened until it rose toward his navel.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>He scowled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting how little control I have around you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She stepped into the shower and shut the door behind him. Water bounced off him and pelted her as she sidled up to him and pressed her body to his. They both moaned when their flesh met. His erection was pressed between them but she was aware of his length, pulsing against her belly, growing more turgid by the moment.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d give you a little help,\u201d she said as she reached for the washcloth and the liquid soap.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can always use your kind of help.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his arms up to rest on the walls of the shower so she had full access to his body. She lathered soap onto the cloth and began at his shoulders. Gently, she lavished attention over his entire body, taking special care around the still-vivid bruises at his midsection.</p><p>She might have washed his behind more than necessary, but she was mesmerized by the full cheeks and the contrast between them and his lean hips and muscular legs. The pale globes were a stark contrast to his tanned arms and legs. It was all she could do not to lean over and take a bite out of his ass.</p><p>She knelt and rubbed up one leg and then the other. Each time her gaze was drawn to his thick cock thrusting upward from his groin. Deciding it needed extra special attention, she tossed aside the cloth and curled her hands around the base, guiding it down toward her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d Garrett groaned.</p><p>He dropped one hand and thrust it in her wet hair just as she sucked him deep into her mouth. He trembled from head to toe and thrust impatiently over her lips.</p><p>Before she could really get into it, Garrett reached down and hauled her up into his arms. He slammed her against the wall of the shower and devoured her mouth like he was starving.</p><p>\u201cNo condoms in here, damn it,\u201d he said in frustration.</p><p>He spun around, threw open the shower door and stepped out. She shivered as cooler air hit her wet body. Garrett stalked through the bathroom and into the bedroom. He tumbled her onto the bed and before she could take a breath, he flipped her onto her belly. She heard the nightstand drawer open and then slam. Felt his hands gripping her hips and pulling her to the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last condom,\u201d she teased. \u201cBetter make it good.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slipped between her legs and pushed inward as if testing her readiness. She was wet. She was definitely ready. She squirmed impatiently as his hand left her.</p><p>Firm hands gripped her legs, spread her and then he thrust into her from behind.</p><p>She cried out at the instant fullness. The indescribable pleasure at having him buried to the balls inside her body. The tightness, the sensitivity. Her heart raced. Her blood pounded through her veins. Her pussy pulsed and clenched around him. Every nerve ending was on fire, sizzling like the shortest of fuses.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he murmured close to her ear. He\u2019d gone completely still as he awaited her response. Her chest lurched and she closed her eyes, smiling at the depth of his concern and caring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she groaned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop. You feel wonderful.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled then and pulled out slowly, his length rippling over her swollen tissues until she squirmed underneath him. He pushed forward again, gaining depth at his hips pressed into her buttocks.</p><p>His hands smoothed over her back and he leaned down to kiss between her shoulder blades. He slid his tongue over her shoulder to her neck and then he nipped, eliciting shiver after shiver to quake down her spine.</p><p>He began pumping against her, the noisy smacks echoing erotically through the room. He maintained a steady rhythm, one destined to drive her insane. He drove her to the very brink of orgasm and then he\u2019d pause and change his speed and strength, forcing her to start all over again.</p><p>She panted frantically through her mouth until it was dry and all she could do was croak out her protests. Halfhearted protests. She even managed to confuse herself. Stop. Don\u2019t stop. You\u2019re killing me. That feels wonderful.</p><p>He was patient and he had the staying power of a damn machine. How could he hold out that long? She was exhausted and he still fucked her like he\u2019d just begun.</p><p>His body blanketed hers, pressing her into the mattress. There wasn\u2019t a part of her body that wasn\u2019t enveloped by him and his heat. His hips moved rhythmically against her behind, pushing her harder and further. She closed her eyes, curled her fingers into the sheets and arched up as high as she could with his weight pressing down on her.</p><p>By the time she realized that this time he wasn\u2019t going to stop, she was exhausted and so dizzy with pleasure that she was senseless. She moaned as the pressure increased. Burned. Sharp. A razor\u2019s edge. Higher and higher. Harder and harder. She didn\u2019t have the strength. This orgasm was going to kill her.</p><p>A high keening wail split the air and she realized it was her. Garrett pushed himself up off her by pressing his hands into the mattress on either side of her head and he began working into her hard. Much harder than before. He was as close as she was.</p><p>Her legs spread wider and the force of his thrusts pushed her up the bed until her head crept over the opposite side. She stared down at the floor, her vision going blurry and fuzzy as she arched painfully.</p><p>Then the pressure suddenly blew like a tire under pressure. She gave a gasp of relief and then moaned as the aftershocks splintered through her, painful, edgy, so good. So very good.</p><p>His teeth sank into his shoulder like he was a beast marking his mate and his hips pressed firmly against her, holding himself deep as if to tell her there was no escape. She was his. He was a part of her.</p><p>She melted into the covers and turned her face so that her cheek was pressed flat against the mattress. She closed her eyes and panted softly as he sprawled over her body, his cock still buried deep inside her.</p><p>She was pinned, filled, covered, and she loved it.</p><p>Garrett kissed her shoulder but continued to lay on her as his chest heaved. When he finally pushed himself up, she felt bereft of his touch. Felt naked and cold. She shivered and turned, seeking his warmth.</p><p>He stood by the bed, quickly rolling the condom off to toss in the trash. She stared up at him as he turned back to her and she sighed in utter contentment at the look in his eyes. No, words simply couldn\u2019t replace the way he looked at her, the way he touched her, the way he loved her like there was no one else in the world for him.</p><p>The words bubbled up again, and this time she knew she was ready to tell him.</p><p>She reached for his hand and he slid his fingers over her palm as he crawled back into bed beside her. She crawled into his arms, cuddling against his side. She threw one leg over his body, holding him as possessively as he often held her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He tensed beneath her and she smiled. Before he could respond, she put a finger to his lips.</p><p>\u201cShhh. Don\u2019t say anything. Please. I\u2019ve wanted to tell you, but the time just wasn\u2019t right. Maybe it\u2019s not now, but I can\u2019t hold back any longer. But the thing is, I don\u2019t want you to respond. I don\u2019t want you to say anything at all. I just need you to know how much I love you. How grateful I am for you. How utterly amazed I am that a man like you exists.\u201d</p><p>She levered up and over him and stared down into his eyes as earnestly as she knew how.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens, I wanted you to know that you are the most special man I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019ll never forget you. I\u2019ll never forget our time together. I never considered that I\u2019d be able to trust someone again. Somehow you made it easy. You made it second nature. I didn\u2019t even have to think about it long. You just snuck past my defenses and you made yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him warmly, pressing her mouth softly to his. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered again. \u201cSo much I ache. Thank you for helping me take back everything Allen and Stanley Cross took from me.\u201d</p><p>Garrett gathered her in his arms and squeezed her so tightly she couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cSarah, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door burst open and Garrett rolled Sarah underneath him to shield her from view.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Garrett roared.</p><p>Rio stood in the doorway, his expression grim.</p><p>\u201cWe have to move. The whole damn jungle is on fire and we\u2019re in its path.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>GARRETT pushed himself from the bed and yanked up the sheets to cover Sarah. He strode naked to the door where Rio stood. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig fire. It\u2019s moving rapidly in our direction. The smoke\u2019s made using the helicopter impossible. We\u2019ll have to go by boat. Meet at the trucks in five. We\u2019re moving out.\u201d</p><p>Garrett cursed and turned in the direction of the bed, where Sarah sat up, the covers pulled to her chin. Her eyes were wide and concerned and her fingers were white against the sheets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet up and get dressed, honey. We\u2019ve got to move fast.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled out of bed and ran to the drawers to yank out her clothing.</p><p>\u201cGet what you can stuff into your bag. Leave everything else. We don\u2019t have time,\u201d he said as he pulled on his jeans.</p><p>While she thrust items into her bag, Garrett retrieved his holster and shoved his Glock into it. He threw the strap of his rifle over his shoulder and patted his pockets for his knife.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Sarah said in a remarkably steady voice.</p><p>He kissed her forehead and then thrust her into the hall ahead of him. They hurried down the hall, through the living room and to the garage where Rio and the others waited.</p><p>\u201cSteele and his team are covering our exit. Then they\u2019ll rendezvous with us at the river,\u201d Rio said as they piled into the two trucks.</p><p>As soon as they burst from the dark garage, Garrett saw the hazy film of smoke in the air and the smell of scorched earth assaulted his nostrils. In the distance, the sky was blocked by a film of dark smoke and as they rounded the corner of Rio\u2019s drive, they got a glimpse of orange flames shooting skyward.</p><p>Rio accelerated as they lurched from his smoother drive onto the rough, narrow roadway that would take them to the river. They roared over bumps and holes and Garrett\u2019s grip tightened around Sarah so she wouldn\u2019t hurt herself or land on the floor.</p> <p>The river was visible ahead when suddenly two dark SUVs pulled directly in front of their vehicle and blocked the road. Rio slammed on the brakes, fishtailed sideways and in the same instant, jammed it into reverse and gunned the motor. Rio turned to look over his shoulder as he steered with his left hand and roared backward down the path they\u2019d come.</p><p>Garrett shoved Sarah to the floor and drew his weapon as Terrance did the same. The other SUV that occupied the rest of Rio\u2019s men was racing backward just behind Rio. The two vehicles were nearly back to the main road when yet more SUVs pulled onto the path to block them.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Rio swore. \u201cI knew this was a setup!\u201d</p><p>He braked, jammed the gearshift into drive and started forward again. They were nearly to the first vehicles that had blocked them when an explosion sounded and the vehicle careened wildly to the right. Rio fought for control and managed to reign the vehicle in but too late, they rolled to a stop against a tree.</p><p>The vehicle lurched on impact, throwing Garrett against the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cSarah!\u201d he barked. \u201cAre you okay? Stay down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cFuckers shot out our tire,\u201d Rio bit out.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Terrance muttered.</p><p>Garrett looked up to see what Terrance was swearing over only to find five heavily armed men just outside the vehicle, their rifles all pointed directly at them. One motioned with his rifle for them to get out.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Garrett echoed.</p><p>Rio raised his hands from the steering wheel. \u201cI hope to fuck Steele and company make it here fast. As much as it pains me to say, they\u2019re going to have to get our asses out of this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett?\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s fear-filled voice rose from her position on the floorboard.</p> <p>\u201cCome up, Sarah,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cSlowly. Don\u2019t make any sudden movements. When we get out I want you to stay behind me and Rio at all times. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she slowly climbed onto the seat.</p><p>Terrance opened his door and slowly got out. Rio followed suit and then Garrett carefully got out on his side and then motioned for Sarah. He gripped her wrist and pulled her out but was careful to tuck her behind his back as he turned to face their threat.</p><p>Behind them, the rest of Rio\u2019s team got out of their trucks and closed ranks around Sarah from behind. Garrett could feel Sarah shaking against him and he squeezed her reassuringly.</p><p>Several feet ahead of the men holding them at gunpoint, another person got out of one of the vehicles. When he turned in Garrett\u2019s direction, instant recognition flashed through Garrett\u2019s mind.</p><p>Marcus Lattimer slid the shades from his eyes and stared coldly in Garrett\u2019s direction as he slowly walked toward him.</p><p>Garrett\u2019s grip tightened around Sarah.</p><p>\u201cSarah, come out here,\u201d Marcus called softly as if he had no desire to frighten her either.</p><p>Sarah stiffened against Garrett\u2019s back and then cautiously she stuck her head around Garrett. \u201cMarcus?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Marcus demanded.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Garrett has taken good care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome away from Garrett,\u201d Marcus ordered. \u201cHe\u2019s no friend, Sarah. He\u2019s using you to get to me.\u201d</p><p>Sarah took a step forward, but her face wrinkled in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You hired him, Marcus. He\u2019s only done the job you hired him to do. He\u2019s protected me.\u201d</p><p>Marcus held out his hand and as soon as Sarah took it, he yanked her to his side.</p><p>\u201cHe lied,\u201d Marcus said shortly. \u201cI didn\u2019t hire him. He quite likely works for the U.S. government. He would have done whatever was necessary to draw me out, including hacking into your email and sending me messages to draw me out.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s stomach churned as Sarah only looked more confused.</p><p>\u201cNo, Marcus, you\u2019re wrong. Garrett didn\u2019t use me. He protected me. He ...\u201d She trailed off when she turned haunted eyes on Garrett. He stared stoically at her and something died in Sarah\u2019s expression. \u201cIt\u2019s true?\u201d she whispered as she stared dully at Garrett.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s damn well not true,\u201d Garrett growled.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you tell me Marcus hired you? Marcus says he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Garrett wasn\u2019t going to explain the whole goddamn thing here. He hoped to fuck that Steele and his team were moving in fast. It would be nice if for once Resnick was on tap at the right time.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is a traitor,\u201d Garrett spat.</p><p>Marcus lifted one brow even as he pulled Sarah closer to him. His hand slipped comfortingly over Sarah\u2019s shoulder and squeezed reassuringly. At least the bastard seemed to genuinely care for Sarah. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI remember you now,\u201d Marcus said casually. \u201cYou were the Marine I shot in Libya.\u201d</p><p>Garrett\u2019s nostrils flared and he snarled in Marcus\u2019s direction, \u201cA lot of American soldiers lost their lives trying to save your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall asking your government to do anything,\u201d Marcus said calmly.</p><p>Sarah looked between Garrett and Marcus, her confusion and hurt mounting by the minute. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she croaked out.</p><p>Marcus turned gentle eyes on her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sarah. I have many enemies. Men who would think nothing of stooping to using women in their war against me. I\u2019m so sorry he got to you before I did. I wouldn\u2019t have had you hurt for the world.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Garrett for confirmation but his cold stare said it all. He hated Marcus. She glanced at Rio and to his men, all men who\u2019d sworn to protect her. All the time they were using her to draw her brother out. The very thing she\u2019d feared the most had come to pass. She had been used against Marcus. Only it wasn\u2019t the judicial system as she\u2019d feared. These were men who\u2019d think nothing of killing her brother in cold blood. She\u2019d led them directly to him.</p><p>Nausea welled in her stomach. She\u2019d trusted Garrett as she\u2019d never thought to trust another person. She\u2019d made love to him. She\u2019d given him everything and all along he was involved in some sick vendetta against her brother.</p><p>She\u2019d told him she loved him.</p><p>\u201cHow could I have been so stupid?\u201d</p><p>The whispered words came out in a painful rush. Garrett flinched and raised his glittering gaze to her. \u201cSarah\u2014\u201d</p><p>The ground exploded beside Sarah as dirt flew in all directions. The distant retort of a rifle shot echoed and she stood there, stunned as she stared down at the dirt all over her feet.</p><p>Garrett and Marcus both lunged for her at the same time, but Marcus was there first, leaping in front of her and turning her so she was trapped between him and the vehicle.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s body lurched against her as another shot sounded and Marcus grunted in pain. She shoved at Marcus, wanting to see. The next thing she knew, Garrett had pulled her away from Marcus and flung her to the ground, his big body covering her as the world went crazy around her.</p><p>\u201cSniper at three o\u2019clock!\u201d Garrett roared. \u201cTake cover!\u201d</p><p>Pandemonium ensued. Sarah shoved at Garrett but she couldn\u2019t see or hear what was going on. Gunfire sounded loud in her ears, deafening her to all else. Her chest squeezed painfully as she glanced to the side to see Marcus lying on the ground a mere foot away, blood trickling from his mouth.</p><p>P.J. heard the shot and jerked her gaze in the direction of the gunfire. The shooter was close\u2014at most, twenty yards. She drew her pistol and stalked stealthily through the heavy cover, her nose quivering as her gaze took in every inch of thick foliage. She didn\u2019t dare radio. The sniper would hear.</p><p>She smelled him before she spotted him. Stupid asshole. His stench wafted through the leaves. Sweat. He reeked of it. He wasn\u2019t a professional, which took the challenge right out of it for her. This would be like taking down an infant.</p><p>She crept up behind him, disgusted that he hadn\u2019t even heard her. She pressed the barrel of her pistol to his head. \u201cDown, asshole!\u201d</p><p>The man whirled around and tried to charge her. She rolled her eyes, stuck out her foot and in a lightning move, yanked his arm back as he went down. She fell on top of him, his arm twisted painfully behind his back. His face was in the mud and her barrel was dug into his back.</p><p>She shoved him over and kicked away his rifle. The man ought to be shot for not taking better care of his equipment. It was a sin to abuse such a fine piece of weaponry. She dug her pistol into the side of his neck as she sat astride him.</p><p>\u201cTalk motherfucker. Who do you work for?\u201d</p><p>The man spit at her and she punched him. \u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off. Don\u2019t make me cut off your nuts.\u201d</p><p>She reached her knife and flipped it open until the blade gleamed wickedly in the light.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d listen to her. She\u2019s pretty mean when she\u2019s pissed off,\u201d Cole drawled.</p><p>P.J. looked up to see her teammate leaning against a tree several feet away, amusement glittering in his eyes.</p><p>She returned her gaze to her prisoner to see disbelief in his eyes.</p><p>She cut the button off his fly and used the knife blade to pry open his pants. He sucked in his breath when she got to his underwear, and she made quick work of the material covering his dick.</p><p>She shot him a pitying glance. \u201cNot that there\u2019s a whole lot to be prideful over, but still, most men would rather not do without. Though in your case, I can\u2019t imagine it makes much difference.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s face flushed with anger and he tried to roll her off him. She rammed her fist into his nuts and brought the pistol stock down over his jaw.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s try this again. You tell me who you are and who you work for or I cut off your dick and make you eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, P.J.,\u201d Cole chided, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to add it to your collection?\u201d He shook his head at the man underneath her. \u201cI used to think she had dick envy or something. Now I just know she\u2019s one mean bitch. She collects dicks, you know, like trophies. Dries them out, tans them like an animal hide and then hangs them on her wall. Kind of sick, if you ask me, but everyone has their hobbies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d the man gasped out. But sweat rolled down his face and his eyes bulged out of his head as he stared at the knife in horror.</p><p>\u201cWell, granted yours isn\u2019t anything to brag about, but I\u2019m sure I have a place on my wall for it,\u201d she said with a shrug. She made another cut to his pants and the acrid smell of piss assaulted her nose.</p><p>\u201cWell hell, he pissed himself, Cole. That\u2019s going to make this a little more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d the man shouted. \u201cStanley Cross hired me. Wants me to take out the Daniels bitch. Doesn\u2019t care how. He wanted me to bring back photographic evidence of her death. If I do, he pays me a mil.\u201d</p><p>P.J. sat back and faked a look of disappointment. \u201cWell, damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet her off me!\u201d</p><p>Cole chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t usually mess with P.J. I\u2019m kind of fond of my dick.\u201d</p><p>P.J. rolled off but was careful to keep her pistol aimed at the man\u2019s head. \u201cGet up, asshole.\u201d</p><p>As P.J. walked over to where Cole stood, he murmured low enough for only her to hear. \u201cDick collection, Rutherford? You didn\u2019t have to have quite so much enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cAs fond as you men are of them, I figured he\u2019d squeal sooner if I threatened his dick.\u201d</p><p>SARAH scrambled over to Marcus as soon as Garrett moved off her. Marcus lay partially on his side and she rolled him to his back, terrified at the copious amount of blood staining his chest.</p><p>\u201cMarcus,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cTalk to me please. I\u2019ll get you help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcus\u2019s eyelids flickered and he trained his unfocused stare on her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>Tears slid soundlessly down her cheeks. She shut out the goings-on around them. There were men everywhere. Garrett directed most of the action while Marcus\u2019s men were taken into custody. There were too many for it to just be Garrett\u2019s team. Marcus was right. Garrett had used her to get to him.</p><p>\u201cPlease be all right, Marcus. You\u2019re all I have. I love you. This is all my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have told you. I should have fought my own battles.\u201d</p><p>Marcus raised a hand to wipe at her tears. \u201cNo, Sarah. You had to fight them for far too long. You should have had a home. Me. A father who loved you. Neither of us had that, I\u2019m afraid. But I could have done more for you. I\u2019m sorry. I love you, you know. You\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever loved and who loved me back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have the sniper who shot at Sarah in custody,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Marcus slid his gaze sideways to Garrett. \u201cYou tried to be the one who took the bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Garrett acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cMy sins are my own. Sarah shouldn\u2019t be punished for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that too.\u201d</p> <p>Marcus\u2019s face spasmed in pain and he coughed, blood pouring from his mouth. \u201cTake her away. She doesn\u2019t need to see this.\u201d</p><p>Sarah hunched over Marcus, pulling him into her arms. \u201cNo!\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d She whirled, her angry gaze going to Garrett. \u201cAre you going to let him die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called in a helicopter,\u201d Garrett said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because of the smoke. We\u2019re going to have to meet them downriver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hear that, Marcus? You hold on. We\u2019re going to get you help.\u201d</p><p>Marcus shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Hot tears poured over her cheeks. \u201cNo. No, I won\u2019t let it be too late.\u201d She leaned down and pressed her lips to his cheek. \u201cI love you, Marcus. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019ve done. I love you. Do you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled faintly and his face whitened with the effort. \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing my father ever did. Everything ... else ... wrong. Don\u2019t ... know ... how ... you ... turned ... out. The way you did.\u201d</p><p>He raised a violently shaking hand to touch her cheek and then he closed his eyes, going still beneath her.</p><p>\u201cMarcus?\u201d</p><p>His name came out brokenly, a sound she didn\u2019t even recognize.</p><p>\u201cMarcus? Oh God ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, honey.\u201d</p><p>Garrett put his hands on her shoulders but she shrugged him away, unable to bear his touch. She buried her face in her hands and wept, rocking back and forth on her knees.</p><p>When men she didn\u2019t recognize came to cover Marcus with a blanket, she went crazy. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch him! Get away from him.\u201d</p> <p>She yanked the blanket down and then arranged it herself, pulling it to his chin so that the blood was covered but he appeared at rest, his expression surprisingly peaceful.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d Garrett said quietly. \u201cCome away, honey. We need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Where did she have to go? The thought was bleak. Her mind was numb, but one thought was clear. Garrett wasn\u2019t who he said he was. He\u2019d lied to her. She\u2019d trusted him and he\u2019d violated that trust.</p><p>A moan throbbed in her throat and welled out painfully. He tried to help her up, but she wrenched away from his grasp. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Just stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her protests, he picked her up and carried her to one of the trucks. \u201cStay here,\u201d he said grimly and shut the door, leaving her alone, numb, so devastated that she couldn\u2019t imagine anything ever being right again.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>GARRETT swore long and hard as he approached Adam Resnick. Resnick flicked his cigarette butt a short distance away and promptly lit another one, taking a deep drag as he surveyed the scene around him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Garrett. I wanted Lattimer alive. This is fucked up. His men can\u2019t do shit for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Steele and his team stalked out of the dense line of trees all but dragging a dirty, bedraggled man with them. P.J. smirked as they drew closer, and she shoved the man forward.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your sniper, Garrett. Dumb asshole was easy to peg. He says Stanley Cross hired him to kill Sarah. He wanted proof of her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Resnick swore as he tossed yet another cigarette. \u201cMy entire mission was ruined by a fucking amateur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Resnick. I\u2019m not any happier about how all this went down,\u201d Garrett snapped.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t ditched me, this might not have happened,\u201d Resnick snapped back. \u201cWhat the fuck was with your going rogue on me? This was a highly planned mission. You were supposed to follow my instructions to a T.\u201d</p><p>Garrett held up his middle finger and walked away. He stopped a few feet from the truck where Sarah sat, her features pale and drawn, pain swamping her eyes until he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her. What a clusterfuck. Her selfish bastard of a brother had finally found a conscience and took the bullet meant for Sarah. Unfuckingbelievable. Yet one more thing Garrett was going to have to be grateful to the son of a bitch for.</p><p>Sarah turned then and found his gaze. Her eyes turned to ice and her lip curled before she looked away, refusing to stare at him any longer. Christ, she hated him. She had every reason.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, I\u2019m going to have to take her in,\u201d Resnick said behind him.</p><p>Garrett whirled around. \u201cWhat the fuck? You know damn well she has nothing to do with her brother\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But I\u2019m more interested in what she can tell me. I\u2019ll need to access the emails they exchanged. I need to question her. Don\u2019t make this harder for me than it needs to be. You know this is how it has to go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just fucking great,\u201d Garrett hissed. \u201cShe already hates me for betraying her. Now her brother\u2019s dead and it\u2019s my fault and you\u2019re going to haul her away for questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain my role in this,\u201d Resnick said quietly. \u201cI doubt it\u2019ll make a difference. And I swear to you I\u2019ll keep you in the loop, every step of the way. Give her some space, Garrett. She\u2019s pissed right now. She\u2019s not going to listen to anything you have to say. I\u2019ll keep her safe. I\u2019ll go easy on her. And when it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Garrett glanced again at Sarah and knew Resnick was right. If he pushed now, he\u2019d only lose her. Forever. He\u2019d give her a few days to cool off while he attended to other matters. Mainly one Stanley Cross.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her I\u2019m coming for her, Resnick. You tell her there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting her go. Don\u2019t you dare let her think I deserted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Resnick grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her all that mushy shit. Jesus, man. You and your brothers are driving me insane with the women.\u201d</p><p>Garrett wanted to tell Resnick to tell her he loved her, but he figured he\u2019d save that one for the next time he saw her. Hopefully by then some of the shock of today would have worn off and she could view the events more objectively. If not, he was going to have a long, hard fight ahead of him. Giving her up wasn\u2019t an option. She belonged with him, in his arms, in his bed. He wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get the fuck out of here,\u201d Resnick said. \u201cYou and your men should clear out too. The government here is only going to be so understanding. Lattimer and his men have already done millions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage by setting the damn world on fire. It\u2019ll take them days to get this under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to stay and help Rio. He could lose everything.\u201d</p><p>Resnick nodded and started toward the truck where Sarah sat, two of his men on his heels. Garrett watched, his fists clenched tight at his sides while Resnick spoke in soft tones to Sarah. A moment later, he guided Sarah from the truck and down to one of the waiting boats.</p><p>Sarah walked stiffly, like an old woman without any fight left. Her gaze was fixed on the ground and never once did she look back at Garrett.</p><p>More of Resnick\u2019s men led the sniper away, hands cuffed behind his back. The rest of Resnick\u2019s team quickly and efficiently cleaned up the scene, carried Marcus\u2019s body away. Five minutes later, only Garrett and his men remained.</p><p>Rio turned in toward the smoke and then back in the direction of his house.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019ll take your house?\u201d Garrett asked quietly.</p><p>Rio shrugged. \u201cIf it does, it does. Not much I can do. I can always rebuild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to move out,\u201d Steele said crisply. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here when the locals show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go,\u201d Rio said. \u201cMy men and I will stay and take any heat. I have contacts here. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He looked up at Garrett. \u201cYou go with Steele and his team. Get the fuck out of the country. The boat will take you downriver to a waiting chopper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Rio said.</p><p>Garrett gestured for Steele and his team to follow him to the dock. They hurried down and got into the last remaining boat. Rio rattled off a terse stream of Kriole to the young man operating the boat and then waved to Garrett as the boat pushed away from the dock.</p><p>\u201cYou just going to let her go like that?\u201d P.J. demanded.</p><p>Startled, Garrett turned on P.J., his lips curled into a snarl. \u201cWhat the fuck do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the way you looked at her, and yet you let that asshole Resnick walk away with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Rutherford. You don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are such dickheads,\u201d she muttered. \u201cShe just watched her brother die. Of course she\u2019s upset. But she needs you with her, not hundreds of miles away while Resnick drills on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few things I need to do before I go after Sarah,\u201d Garrett said tersely.</p><p>P.J. snorted and turned her back. To Garrett\u2019s surprise, Steele eyed him with a grimace as well.</p><p>\u201cNot you too,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a fucking machine. The last thing I need is you nagging my ass too.\u201d</p><p>A glimmer of amusement flickered across Steele\u2019s face, but he remained silent and turned his attention to the shoreline as he watched for any threat.</p><p>They traveled a mile upriver and veered off into one of the fingers that drifted farther inland. The water shallowed to a couple of feet as they slogged closer to a sharp bend in the offshoot. A helicopter came into view as they hung a sharp left and drifted into the cove.</p><p>Garrett scrambled off the boat with Steele and his team and they piled into the helicopter. As it rose and hovered close to the ground, Garrett stared out the window and wondered how Sarah was doing. Resnick had sworn he\u2019d take good care of her, and Garrett knew he would. He wasn\u2019t quite the asshole he and his brothers liked to label him.</p><p>He may have taken the coward\u2019s way out but there was a lot he had to sort out before he could face Sarah again. He couldn\u2019t afford to fuck things up with her. First he had to remove any and all threats to her. Only then could he go to her and plead his case.</p><p>Maybe by then her grief wouldn\u2019t be so raw, her pain not so sharp. Maybe by then she\u2019d have a better perspective.</p><p>One thing he knew for sure, and he\u2019d known it the moment that Sarah had looked at him with such pain and betrayal in her eyes. He loved her and he\u2019d settle for nothing less than having her in his life. Until the day he died. He simply wouldn\u2019t consider any alternative. If it took him the rest of his life to convince her, then that\u2019s what he\u2019d do.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>RUSTY trudged from the school building toward the student parking lot. Today was just another shitty day in what was shaping up to be a shitty year. Her senior year. So much was made of a person\u2019s senior year. Magical. Time-of-your-life sort of thing. She barely held back a snort. The only good thing was that so far, Matt Winfree hadn\u2019t opened his mouth. Whatever Sean had said to him seemed to have worked. At least for now.</p><p>Instead he and his group avoided her like the plague.</p><p>At least she\u2019d gotten her car back. Almost like new. She\u2019d been afraid that Marlene and Frank wouldn\u2019t let her have it back after what had happened. But they hadn\u2019t said a word. Just handed her the keys and said that no one was allowed to drive it but her. Fine by her. She wouldn\u2019t make such a stupid mistake again.</p><p>She was so focused on her thoughts that she didn\u2019t see the men standing at the front edge of the parking lot until she heard the murmur of voices around her. When she did look up, her mouth fell open and her first thought was oh shit. What had she done now?</p><p>The Kelly brothers\u2014well, almost all of them\u2014stood in a formidable line. Even Garrett was there, and he was supposedly off on some supersecret mission after everyone had worried he was up shit creek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam stood the far left. Ethan was next to him and Donovan and Garrett stood together. They were wearing army-looking fatigues with boots and shit. Damn, they looked like they were ready to kick some serious ass. She sighed. Probably hers.</p><p>\u201cWinfree, just the guy we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Garrett called.</p><p>Oh shit. This was even worse. Rusty squeezed her eyes shut as the brothers looked beyond her. Then she slowly peeked around to see Matt standing several yards away, looking for the world like he was about to wet his pants. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all.</p><p>\u201cCome over here, boy,\u201d Sam said in a terse voice that you simply didn\u2019t ignore.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d Matt asked as he approached warily.</p><p>\u201cHeard you\u2019ve been messing with our sister,\u201d Ethan said with a growl.</p><p>Unexpected tears burned Rusty\u2019s eyes as she stared agape at the scowling brothers.</p><p>Donovan curled his lip back and took a step forward. Matt shrunk about three inches and went even paler. \u201cDo you know what we do with punks like you?\u201d Donovan asked.</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no respect for little pricks who beat up on women,\u201d Garrett snarled. \u201cEspecially a woman who happens to be a part of my family. Let me give you a little advice, Winfree. Stay away from Rusty. Far, far away. If I ever catch you near her, if you ever even say her name to anyone, I\u2019ll find a dark hole for your body and trust me, no one will ever find you. You got me?\u201d</p><p>Matt\u2019s head bobbed up and down, his eyes so wide that he looked like a deer in the headlights. Rusty wiped at her eyes, determined she wouldn\u2019t cry. But damn if her chest wasn\u2019t about to burst open. Their sister. They\u2019d called her their sister. A part of their family. They were sticking up for her. Hell, they\u2019d just threatened to kill a guy if he ever messed with her again.</p><p>She stared at them in wonder as Matt all but ran to his car. A moment later, in a squall of tires, he roared out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor me.\u201d</p><p>Sam grimaced and his expression softened as he took a step toward her. \u201cWe meant every word. You\u2019re our sister. Mom\u2019s taken you under her wing, and her chick you\u2019re going to stay. No one fucks with the Kellys, and I mean no one. You\u2019ve been around us long enough to know that by heart. Well, you\u2019re a Kelly now and no one\u2019s going to mess with you.\u201d</p><p>Without pondering the rightness or whether he\u2019d be appalled, Rusty launched herself into Sam\u2019s arms, nearly toppling them both over. She squeezed him so tight that it was a wonder he could breathe, and she\u2019d never felt anything better in her life.</p> <p>Brothers. Protective older brothers. The mind boggled. That they gave a shit about her stunned her. And it felt better than she could have ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said as she gripped him harder. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever done anything like that for me.\u201d</p><p>When she finally drew away, she was embarrassed by the tears streaking down both cheeks. Her nose was all snotty and she probably looked ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cGot a hug for your other brothers?\u201d Garrett drawled.</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously for a moment. He was nice enough to Rachel, and Rusty saw him be affectionate and lovey with both Rachel and Sophie, but the truth was, he scared the shit out of her. But when he opened his arms, she forgot all about her fear and launched herself into his embrace.</p><p>One by one they all hugged her until she was a weepy, snotty mess. She cried all over them and they sighed indulgently, just like big brothers should. It was the best day of her entire life.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>\u201cSO what are you going to do now?\u201d Donovan asked quietly when he and Garrett were finally alone.</p> <p>Garrett dropped onto the couch in the war room and stared tiredly at his younger brother. \u201cI\u2019m going to Boston to kick the shit out of Stanley Cross and make sure the little bastard never tries anything with Sarah again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Donovan said tightly.</p><p>Garrett nodded. \u201cRio called a while ago. He wants in too. I\u2019m going to make that little son of a bitch pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could always make him disappear,\u201d Donovan said with a shrug. \u201cThere are places where his body would never be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. I\u2019ve never contemplated cold-blooded murder in my life, but I\u2019d do it now and suffer no regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd afterward? What then?\u201d</p><p>Garrett knew what Donovan was asking. \u201cThen I\u2019m going after Sarah. I\u2019m bringing her home with me. I\u2019m not coming back without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you did,\u201d Garrett muttered. \u201cI\u2019m head over ass for her. I can\u2019t imagine my life without her. She may not forgive me. I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019ll do then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been the type to give up,\u201d Donovan said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn bastard.\u201d</p><p>The security doors opened, admitting Sam.</p><p>\u201cThought you were on kid duty,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>Sam wore a frown and Donovan and Garrett exchanged uneasy glances.</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s been hurt. Busted his leg. He\u2019s being flown to Fort Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Donovan swore. \u201cWhat about Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo word on Nathan. Ma got the call a while ago. All they told her was that Joe was hurt in combat. They patched him up and were flying him to the base. He\u2019ll be there tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, though? How did he break it? Bullet or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell her shit,\u201d Sam said in frustration. \u201cShe\u2019s pissed and ready to go kick some army ass. I\u2019m going over with her tomorrow to keep her in line or she\u2019ll end up behind bars.\u201d</p><p>Donovan chuckled despite the seriousness of the situation. Then he glanced at Garrett. \u201cShould we wait to see Joe before we head to Boston, or you want to go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you going to Boston for?\u201d Sam demanded.</p><p>\u201cA little unfinished business,\u201d Garrett said quietly.</p><p>\u201cShit. Don\u2019t call me to bail your asses out of jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him kill him,\u201d Donovan promised. \u201cRio and I will be there to witness what goes down. I guarantee you that Cross will fall down a few flights of stairs. Maybe more than once.\u201d</p><p>Sam chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t even bring myself to call you down. I\u2019d like a piece of the bastard myself for what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for Joe to get in. I want to make sure he\u2019s all right,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cVan, get the Kelly jet fueled and ready to go. I\u2019ll let Rio know what\u2019s going on so he can meet us there.\u201d</p><p>THE whole Kelly family descended on the base the next day. Even Rusty came along and Marlene evidently had been made aware of the fact that her boys had showed up at Rusty\u2019s school because she beamed at them nonstop the entire afternoon.</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t kissed them and pinched their cheeks in front of the military personnel on the base.</p><p>Sophie had little Charlotte bundled up, and Garrett had to admit the kid looked cute as a button in all that pink. She was a beautiful girl, just like her mama. Garrett gave Sam shit about how glad he was she hadn\u2019t taken after her daddy. Sam just grinned and agreed wholeheartedly.</p><p>Rachel had hugged Garrett so tight that he\u2019d felt immediate guilt for not going over to see her the minute he got back. He\u2019d been too preoccupied with thoughts of Sarah and calling Resnick every five minutes to get a status report.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweet pea,\u201d he murmured into Rachel\u2019s ear as she hugged him. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s you I\u2019ve been worried about.\u201d</p><p>She drew away and he could see the concern darken her already dark brown eyes. It gratified him to see that she\u2019d filled out more and the shadows she wore under her eyes like permanent bruises had lightened. She looked ... happy. Content.</p><p>\u201cYou look terrific,\u201d he said. \u201cEthan\u2019s been taking good care of you, I see.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her entire face lighting up. Rachel was a beautiful woman, but when she smiled, it seemed the sun shone just a little brighter. Ethan and Sam had chosen well with Rachel and Sophie. Now Garrett couldn\u2019t wait to bring Sarah home to meet his family. They\u2019d love her. He just knew it. And she\u2019d love them too.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll forgive you, Garrett,\u201d Rachel said softly so only he would hear. \u201cDonovan told me some of what happened. Don\u2019t be angry at him. I did puppy dog eyes at him.\u201d</p><p>Garrett laughed, making the rest of his family look over at him to see what was going on. He lowered his voice and turned Rachel to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re evil, Rachel. You know Van can\u2019t resist you when you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin. Then she sobered slightly. \u201cYou love her a lot.\u201d</p><p>Garrett sighed and glanced sideways again. It wasn\u2019t as if he was ashamed of his feelings. He just wasn\u2019t ready to share them with the world yet. \u201cYeah, I do. I fucked up though.\u201d</p><p>Rachel touched his arm and then wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug. \u201cI know a lot about pain. And forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Garrett squeezed her back. \u201cI know you do, sweet pea. Ethan\u2019s so lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll forgive you if she loves you. She\u2019s hurting right now, but she\u2019ll realize that being without you hurts more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a stubborn son of a bitch. I don\u2019t plan to come home without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet her. I can only think she must be an amazing woman if you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I love you and you\u2019re amazing,\u201d Garrett said.</p><p>She smiled. They were interrupted when the doctor came into the waiting area where the Kellys had been stashed. Marlene pounced immediately, though Frank wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my son?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing quite well,\u201d the doctor said as he surveyed the gathered family members. \u201cA bullet shattered the fibula and we\u2019re taking him into surgery shortly to reconstruct the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we see him before you take him to surgery?\u201d Marlene asked anxiously. \u201cI want him to know we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The doctor chuckled. \u201cOh, he knows you\u2019re here. I think the entire base knows you\u2019re here. I\u2019ll let you in to see him for five minutes. You\u2019ll be able to see him again when he comes out of recovery.\u201d</p><p>The entire family crowded into the small holding room where Joe was propped against several pillows, his leg swathed in tight gauze to anchor the break.</p><p>\u201cMa, Dad!\u201d His entire face lit up when his parents entered the room, his brothers right behind them. \u201cHell, you all didn\u2019t have to come.\u201d</p><p>Sam snorted. \u201cAs if we wouldn\u2019t come, little brother. What the hell have you done to yourself this time?\u201d</p><p>Garrett watched as Marlene fussed and clucked, kissed and petted. He grinned as Joe ate it all up just like he was a young boy with a boo-boo again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s damn good to see you again, son,\u201d Frank boomed out. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have had to see you in the hospital, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, do you know anything about Nathan?\u201d Marlene asked anxiously.</p><p>Joe grimaced and shook his head. \u201cSorry, Ma. He wasn\u2019t with me. Things were pretty tense. We were separated into two teams. Our team came under attack. I took a bullet. Two of our guys died. I don\u2019t know about Nathan\u2019s team. No one has told me jackshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marlene said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your team members.\u201d</p><p>Joe leaned back, his face white with pain and fatigue. \u201cYeah, it sucks. We were coming home after this mission. Most of us were getting out. We talked about nothing else for the last weeks. We all had plans. Now two of them aren\u2019t coming home and three of us are in the hospital. I\u2019m lucky to be alive, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll be home faster than you thought,\u201d Ethan piped in. \u201cMight take them a little while to get you discharged, but you sure as hell won\u2019t be going anywhere after this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan and I were supposed to get out together,\u201d Joe said through a clenched jaw. \u201cThis sucks. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alive,\u201d Marlene said as she kissed his cheek again. \u201cMy prayers are so close to being answered. My babies back home, where they belong.\u201d</p><p>The nurse stuck her head in the door and looked pointedly at the gathered Kellys.</p><p>\u201cTime for us to go, Joe,\u201d Frank said as he rose. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here, though. We aren\u2019t going anywhere. We\u2019ll see you when you get out of surgery.\u201d</p><p>Garrett stepped forward and took Joe\u2019s hand. \u201cHey man, I\u2019m shoving off for a few days. I have some loose ends to tie up. I\u2019ll be back soon. I\u2019ll be checking on you through Ma.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe gripped his hand in return. \u201cLet me know if Nathan gets in touch with any of you. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, no problem. Take care of yourself, baby brother.\u201d</p><p>Joe glared at him and flipped him the bird. \u201cI\u2019ll show you baby when I get out of the damn hospital.\u201d</p><p>The nurse herded the Kellys out the door and back toward the waiting area. Marlene plopped down in a chair and let out a huge sigh. Rusty, looking worried, sat beside Marlene and put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019ll be all right, Marlene.\u201d</p> <p>Marlene smiled at Rusty. \u201cI know he will, baby. I\u2019ll always worry about my children, though. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a mother\u2019s curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you and Frank,\u201d Rachel said as she sat on Marlene\u2019s other side. She glanced up Ethan and he nodded. \u201cOf course we will.\u201d</p><p>Marlene frowned up at Sophie and Sam. \u201cLet me kiss my granddaughter and then you get her home where she belongs. Last place she needs to be is a place full of sickness and germs. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I know anything.\u201d</p><p>Garrett leaned down and kissed his mother\u2019s cheek. \u201cVan and I are shoving off. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Marlene patted his cheek and then studied him as she rubbed her hand over his face. \u201cYou look tired, son. You need some rest. You\u2019re working way too hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing someone special home to meet you. I love her, and you\u2019ll love her too.\u201d</p><p>His mom\u2019s mouth gaped open as he stepped back. \u201cWhy am I always the last one to know these things?\u201d</p><p>Garrett smiled. Just saying it aloud had infused him with even more determination. Sarah belonged here with him. With his family. Surrounded by love and acceptance. He just had to make her see it.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>SARAH sat on the porch of the beach house where it all had begun. She was tired. Numb. Beyond exhausted. Her mind was in chaos. And she missed Garrett with every breath.</p><p>For several days, Adam Resnick had questioned her, albeit very politely. He\u2019d made sure her every need was met. She was catered to, waited on, treated like an important guest instead of the sister of the CIA\u2019s most wanted man.</p> <p>It had hurt to hear the truth about her brother. She knew he\u2019d been involved in some questionable activities, but she\u2019d been shocked to know the extent. It horrified her to know of the things he\u2019d done. The people he\u2019d killed. The lives he was responsible for wrecking. She\u2019d finally covered her ears and demanded that Resnick stop his recitation of Marcus\u2019s many crimes.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to help them. She would have, if she had any way to. But Marcus had never given any information to her. He\u2019d kept his dealings completely separate from her. He\u2019d been careful not to ever let that aspect of his life touch her in any way.</p><p>She\u2019d even given Resnick the number of her offshore account since Marcus had funded it. Now that she knew precisely how he\u2019d gotten it, she had no desire to ever use it again.</p><p>As a result, she was broke with less than a thousand dollars left in her personal account. If Resnick hadn\u2019t offered to set her up any place she wanted to go, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to come back here.</p><p>It was here that she wanted to sort out her life and pick up the pieces. Here is where her life had irrevocably changed. Yes, it had changed the moment Allen Cross raped her, but the island was where she\u2019d been given a new lease on life. Garrett had done that for her. And then he\u2019d crushed her in a way Allen Cross hadn\u2019t been able to. That was the height of irony.</p><p>For three days she\u2019d done nothing but sit on her deck and stare sightlessly over the water. She had no idea what she\u2019d do next. At some point she\u2019d have to make a decision. She couldn\u2019t spend her life hiding.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have surprised her to look up and see Garrett walking down the sand toward her cottage. But it did. It took all her willpower not to turn and flee into the cottage and lock the door behind her.</p><p>Instead she sat as calmly as she was able and watched him approach.</p> <p>He wore jeans and a T-shirt. Judging by the irritation of his face and the way he shook his feet at intervals, he\u2019d gotten a buttload of sand in his tennis shoes during the walk from town. Clearly he hadn\u2019t learned anything from his time here.</p><p>When he got closer, she saw that he held something in his hand. She forced herself to look away, out over the water as he approached.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment and then settled on the step beside her. Just as he\u2019d done weeks before. He piddled with the object in his hand and then extended it until she looked down to see what he held.</p><p>A smile quivered on her lips. How could she want to smile when she hurt so damn much on the inside?</p><p>\u201cI brought the big guns this time,\u201d he said as he held up the caramel chocolate bar. \u201cNo holding out this time.\u201d</p><p>He set it on her lap and turned to stare at the water as she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath and felt herself come apart all over again. Pain ripped through her heart and left a bloody cut as deep as a wound could go. She went so rigid that she shook. She started to bolt to her feet but his fingers circled her wrist and he tugged until she was forced to remain seated.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he begged softly. \u201cHear me out.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. Not and maintain her composure. She closed her eyes to keep the tears at bay. She\u2019d shed enough over the last week. Her head still hurt and her sinuses had gone to shit. She wouldn\u2019t cry anymore.</p><p>\u201cI know you feel hurt and betrayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how I feel,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea. If it\u2019s anything close to what I\u2019ve felt since Resnick took you away, I know it\u2019s pretty damn awful.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his statement. She fixed her eyes back over the water, determined to get through this even if it killed her.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLet me start from the beginning. I was asked to take this job because Resnick knew I had a personal score to settle with ... your brother. Six years ago, I led a mission to rescue your brother, when he made a deal with the wrong people. In return, he was going to work with the CIA to take down several terrorist networks that he\u2019d supplied arms to.</p><p>\u201cWe went in and Lattimer double-crossed us. He murdered two of my men and shot me in the leg. Resnick knew I hated him, and so when he got the information that Lattimer had killed Cross and that you had taken off, he asked me to tail you, stay close to you until your brother showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used me,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Garrett blew out his breath again. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurt, honey. I\u2019d do anything in the world to change what happened, but I\u2019m not sorry he\u2019s dead. I won\u2019t lie to you just to get you to forgive me. He was a bastard of the first order. However, I\u2019ll always be grateful that he saved your life. Given a choice between his death and yours? I\u2019ll take his hands down.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered as a fresh wash of tears flooded her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, the first time I laid eyes on you, things changed for me. I felt this connection between us and I was determined to keep you safe. Somehow you became mine from the first time I met you. After you left the island, I gave Resnick the slip. Told him to hell with the job. I just wanted you safe, and I wanted to remove any threat to you.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with you, Sarah. I fell in love with you but I still had a job to do. Lattimer was responsible for the deaths of many innocent people. I was sworn to take him down. I loved you, but I couldn\u2019t look the other way. Not for you. Not for anyone. I know he was your brother and that in his own way he loved you and protected you. You loved and protected him. I understand that, but I couldn\u2019t let him walk away after everything he\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>Sarah closed her eyes against the tears. Against the pain of his words. She clenched her fingers into tight fists as Garrett\u2019s impassioned words hit the very soul of her.</p><p>\u201cI know he wasn\u2019t a good man,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Garrett reached for one of her fists and gently pried her hand open before lacing his fingers through hers. \u201cI know you don\u2019t trust me after what happened, Sarah. I know trust is a big thing to you after what Cross did. I just want the chance to make it right. I want to show you that you can trust me. I love you. I want you with me. And I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to have you in my life. Always.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to meet his and saw soul-deep pain reflected in his eyes. He was suffering too. He hurt like she hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you asking, Garrett? What do you see for us? I have to tell you. I\u2019m a mess. I don\u2019t have a job. I have less than a thousand dollars to my name. I\u2019m still coming to grips with the fact that I was raped. I buried it deep and just existed from day to day.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened as he stared back at her. \u201cWhat I see is a strong, resilient woman who knocks me on my ass every time she looks at me. I see someone who\u2019s been hurt so badly she\u2019s afraid to trust again. I see someone who has such a loving spirit, who strives to see the best in people despite being shown the worst. What do I see for us? I see you with me, making me happy until I draw my last breath. I see us living and laughing together, having children eventually. Enjoying sunsets and growing old together.\u201d</p><p>His voice grew hoarse and shaky with emotion. \u201cHoney, I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t have a penny to your name. I don\u2019t care if you have a job. Those things will come. What I want is for you to be with me so we can work this out together. Together we can do anything. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone. I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. That\u2019s what love is about.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at their entwined fingers, watched as his thumb caressed the top of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Garrett. I feel ... alone. I mean, before I was alone, but I had Marcus, and I always knew that if I really needed someone, he\u2019d be there, no questions asked. This past week I\u2019ve had to come to grips with the fact that I have no one. I have no idea what I want to do. I just feel numb and terrified all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and held her tightly against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m scared shitless you won\u2019t forgive me and I\u2019ll have to go back home without you after I promised my mother I was bringing you back with me. She can\u2019t wait to meet you, you know. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s already planning our wedding.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled against him and shook her head.</p><p>He tucked a finger beneath her chin and prodded her upward so he could stare into her eyes. \u201cI love you, Sarah. I think I fell in love with you when I looked into those eyes and saw your determination not to be scared. I know I hurt you, honey. I can only promise I won\u2019t hurt you again. Not like that. But I have to be honest with you. I don\u2019t regret what happened, only that you had to be involved. It\u2019s who I am. I have a very strong sense of justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you really, Garrett? You didn\u2019t work for my brother obviously. Do you work for the CIA? Will I even ever see you?\u201d</p><p>He palmed her cheek and stroked gently over her face. \u201cWe do contract work for the government. We also work in the private sector too. I work for myself. Me and my brothers. We do things like hostage and fugitive recovery. As for whether you\u2019ll ever see me? You\u2019re going to be seeing a damn lot of me. So much of me you\u2019re going to want me to take a mission just so I\u2019ll leave you alone. My work is important to me, Sarah. It\u2019s part of who I am. But you\u2019re the most important thing to me.\u201d</p><p>He poked his finger at her for emphasis and she felt some of the ice around her heart crack and start to melt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always come first. You and our children. Is there risk involved in my work? Hell, yes, and I know it\u2019s a lot to ask you to take on. But for every mission I take, the goal is going to be the same. Coming home to you. Always.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, resting her forehead against his chin. \u201cYou make it sound so ... easy.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her back into his arms and hugged her so tight she could barely breathe. \u201cI love you. I think you love me. What could be simpler? Everything else we\u2019ll work out. Together.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head back up and took a deep breath as she drowned in those intense blue eyes. \u201cI do love you, Garrett. Even when I hated you for lying to me, I loved you. I want to be with you. I just feel so overwhelmed. Like I\u2019ll never get my life together. I feel like it\u2019s spiraled out of control.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek, and she was shocked to see a wash of emotion in his eyes. They glistened with unshed tears and when he spoke, his voice broke.</p><p>\u201cRight now, the first step is saying you\u2019ll try,\u201d he said. \u201cCome home with me. Let\u2019s work on our relationship together. You can decide what you want to do there. If you want to talk to someone about the rape, we\u2019ll find you a damn good counselor. If you want to go back to work in your current field, you can do that. Or you can study to become a teacher. We have a great university just thirty minutes away. The thing is, you have choices, Sarah. You have all the choices in the world. All I ask is that you let me be part of them. Let\u2019s tackle the problems together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She curled her arms around his neck and hugged him. Not content with any part of her not touching him, she crawled into his lap and burrowed into his chest until they were smashed together like two lovebugs.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still Stanley,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>He tensed and pulled slightly away. He tipped up her chin until their gazes met again. \u201cStanley won\u2019t ever be a problem for you again.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the conviction in his voice. Then her eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that me, Rio and my brother Donovan took care of the little asshole. He might have fallen down a flight of stairs. Twice. Or at least that\u2019s the story, and I\u2019m sticking to it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed helplessly, appalled that she found such satisfaction in the image but at the same time desperately wishing she could have witnessed it all. Then she squeezed him tight again.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Garrett. I do. I want us to be together. You make me not so ... afraid. You make me think that things really will work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will, honey. They will. I want to take you home. You\u2019re going to love my family and they\u2019re going to love you. I have some things to work out too. For instance, right now, I live with my two brothers and my oldest brother\u2019s wife. It\u2019s kind of crowded,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cSam\u2014that\u2019s my oldest brother\u2014has started construction on a complex for the entire family. It\u2019s impressive, really. We\u2019ll have all the facilities we need. A private airstrip, a helicopter pad, training facilities, a gun range and most important, we\u2019ll all have our own house. That\u2019s where you come in. I have the decorating sense of a mule.\u201d</p><p>Sarah smiled and felt her heart lighten with every beat. \u201cI should warn you I have girly tastes. I won\u2019t allow my living room to be decorated in camo. Oh, and Patches.\u201d She glanced anxiously up at him. \u201cShe\u2019s back with me. Can we bring her home too?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cYeah, you and Patches are a package deal. For you I can put up with a cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd girly? You don\u2019t mind your house being girly?\u201d she asked with a grin.</p><p>He pretended disappointment. \u201cI suppose I can live with girly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get used to it for all the daughters you\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up with such joy that it took her breath away. \u201cDid I tell you I have a new niece? She\u2019s beautiful. Not as beautiful as our daughters will be, but she\u2019s cute as a button.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed him again, unable to contain her excitement. \u201cAll week long I\u2019ve thought of the future with such dread. You\u2019ve made me think it will be filled with wonderful things.\u201d</p> <p>He slid his hand into her hair and gently ran his fingers through the strands. \u201cI\u2019m making you a solemn promise. For as long as we both live, I\u2019m going to spend every day giving you wonderful things. You will never doubt for one moment that you are as loved as a woman will ever be.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and wiped at her damp cheeks in irritation. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you. Think we can go home now?\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, warm and sweet, letting her lips melt over his. She breathed a sigh into his mouth and let herself go limp against him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>He tucked her firmly against him, and they sat there on the steps until the sky shimmered in gold and pink and the sun was a fiery half orb on the horizon. It was the first of many more to come. In the years ahead, they often returned to Isle de Bijoux. Though they enjoyed sunsets in a multitude of places, none was ever quite so beautiful as the ones here, where it all began. </p> </body></html>"]
