Thick stone walls and double-paned bulletproof glass worked to dampen the traffic noise of downtown Washington, DC, and sumptuous carpet and soundproofing in the walls kept his office a haven of solitude amidst one of the busiest cities in the world.</p><p>Richard Burns, executive assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, flipped through page after page, initialing and signing. The Bureau may have moved into the digital age, but paperwork still made the gears turn. With a sniff, he closed the folder and tossed it into his outbox for his assistant to pick up. At least he didn\u2019t have to write out his full title every time.</p><p>He was reaching to replace the fountain pen in its box when the buzzer on his phone interrupted him.</p> <p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Nancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity just called, sir. You have a visitor,\u201d his assistant\u2019s tinny voice announced over the speaker.</p><p>\u201cWho is it? I don\u2019t have any appointments until two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ID provided is for a Mr. Randall Jonas. Central Intelligence Agency.\u201d</p> <p>Burns looked at the phone in surprise. \u201cSend him through,\u201d he said as he stood and began straightening his tie and suit jacket.</p><p>It took five minutes, give or take, and the buzzer went off again. \u201cSir, the escort is here with Mr. Jonas.\u201d</p><p>Burns walked around his desk to greet his old friend when he came through the door. Randall Jonas had been one of three men in Burns\u2019 original Marine Corps squadron who had returned from Vietnam. Earl Grady was the other. They were like his brothers, and Burns would never turn down a surprise visit from one of them. But when the door opened and Jonas was shown into his office, Burns knew immediately that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d he said before he could think of a more appropriate way to say it.</p><p>Jonas nodded. \u201cWith good reason.\u201d</p><p>Jonas didn\u2019t look at all like the sharp CIA section chief Burns saw for an occasional drink at an upscale DC bar. Jonas looked worn, mussed around the edges, wild around the eyes. He was a large man with a lantern jaw, trending toward heavy in recent years, with gunmetal gray hair and eyes that were a washed out brown. He was usually full of good humor and charm, more a mischievous gnome than a spook. Right now, though, he looked like a bear being chased through the woods by bigfoot.</p> <p>Burns offered him a hand to shake and then gestured toward the leather sofa in the corner of his office. \u201cForgive me for skipping over the pleasantries, but it seems like you might want me to. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Jonas dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cI really stepped in something nasty, Dick. I was about five minutes from being detained at Langley,\u201d he said as he thumped onto the couch and pulled at the knot of his tie.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Burns sat down across from Jonas.</p><p>\u201cI came across something I was never meant to see. Long story short, someone within the Company has been using government assets to pull personal jobs for profit, and then offing the assets when they got wise. They turned the CIA into a hit service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some paperwork that made me suspicious, so I started snooping around. And when I followed the trail, that son of a bitch led right back to me.\u201d</p><p>Burns blinked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, focus for me here. Someone\u2019s setting me up to take the fall for ordering private hits. I found out before they got everything in place. So I picked up and ran.\u201d Jonas waved a hand, dismissing any further detail of his escape from Langley.</p> <p>Burns nodded, frowning hard. Abuse of power happened in the alphabet agencies just like anywhere else. Only it usually ended with death and destruction instead of bankruptcy, bailouts, or moving a factory to China.</p><p>\u201cSomeone within the CIA is eating their own. And you\u2019re the fall guy. I gather following the trail in reverse can\u2019t prove your innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re just notes from one lackey to another, issuing orders,\u201d Jonas said, leaning forward, bracing his elbows on his knees. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, Dick. I\u2019m being framed for misuse of resources, running operations on my own authority, unsanctioned elimination of personnel, and if it really goes bad, treason. I\u2019d definitely be put in jail for the rest of my natural life. That\u2019s if whoever is responsible doesn\u2019t just come after me as well. Assets are being cleaned. People are losing their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Randy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some help, and you\u2019re the only one I trust right now.\u201d</p><p>Burns realized he was staring, and he nodded curtly. He knew this man, had known him for the better part of forty years, and he knew if Jonas said it, it was the truth. Even if he was a damn spook. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a contact brought in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what details I was able to pull together before I ran, there\u2019s just one guy still alive who has the information needed to point to the bastard in charge of all this. They tried to clean him a year ago, but he got away.\u201d Jonas shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019ve been eliminating agents, Dick. Agent and handler teams going down or disappearing\u2014for a couple of years now. Slowly, almost randomly, and I can\u2019t say I would have caught on without coming across that file and getting suspicious.\u201d</p><p>Jonas nodded as he sat up and then leaned back, looking truly miserable. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my ass off for the Company, Dick. I\u2019m not going to let it go down this way. There\u2019s a cell inside, one that\u2019s not sanctioned and not supervised. I\u2019m not sure how high it goes, other than too high if they\u2019re gunning for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the stats on this contact? The one with the information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. He went dark over a year ago. I\u2019ve been in touch with his former handler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll get him pegged down and then I\u2019ll send an agent after him. We\u2019ll bring this to someone we can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t dispatch FBI resources, Dick. They\u2019ll be monitoring everything.\u201d</p><p>Burns raised an eyebrow at the paranoia, but that was a spook for you.</p><p>\u201cLook, Richard, I don\u2019t know much about your operations, other than the CIA uses you and whatever assets you\u2019ve cultivated over here for certain jobs. I know you\u2019ve got the means to do this off the board.\u201d</p><p>Burns pursed his lips and scratched at his nose, trying to hide the discomfort. \u201cI might know someone. I\u2019ll mobilize him. And until we can get this mystery asset of yours in, you\u2019ll stay here. Even the CIA isn\u2019t going to storm FBI headquarters to get to you. Who\u2019s the contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a foreign national named Julian Cross. Records say he\u2019d been taken out, but then he popped back up on the radar and rumor was he was still alive. When I talked to Blake Nichols, his former handler, he confirmed Cross is alive. For now. But he can\u2019t get Cross to come in.\u201d Jonas tapped his fingers on the arm of the couch, visibly agitated. \u201cI have an address, and I can only hope this guy has the information I need. He\u2019s the only one who could have it. All the others are dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian Cross,\u201d Burns muttered as he scratched at his chin. \u201cWhy does that name sound familiar?\u201d</p><p>Jonas shrugged.</p><p>Burns stood and went to his desk, waking his computer to type in a search. It returned nothing. But he knew the name. He tapped in a code and then searched again. This time the computer searched through a cache of hidden files, and it popped up with one file.</p><p>Burns snorted when he scanned the information contained in the file. Paris. Of course. He looked at Jonas. \u201cGive me all the information you have. I\u2019m putting my best man on it,\u201d he said as he pulled a cell phone out of a locked drawer.</p><p>\u201cIf Cross doesn\u2019t know who was giving those kill orders, no one does. But I have a feeling he put everything together and he thinks it was the CIA trying to kill him. That\u2019s why he went off the grid. He won\u2019t be easy to bring in,\u201d Jonas said as he walked over to the desk, pulling a folded piece of paper out of his pocket. \u201cThis is it. Name, contacts, addresses. And your man should know Cross is a high-level federal asset and wet works operative\u2014considered armed and extremely dangerous. He\u2019s... very capable\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded as he dialed, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThey\u2019ll get along famously.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. Walls are closing in and I need to go.</p><p>Love you.</p><p>ZANE sat straight up in the bed, soaked in sweat, ears ringing as his lover\u2019s name echoed off the walls. He had been dreaming, his mind taking him back to Ty\u2019s living room and the dance they had shared. Ty\u2019s name was still on his lips. He could still smell him and feel his arms around him as they swayed together. But that had been over a week ago.</p><p>It seemed he could still hear the music.</p><p>Zane shuddered and leaned over to grab up his cell phone. He swiped the screen to answer the call, interrupting the ringtone. \u201cGa-Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>The smooth voice struck Zane hard enough that he fell back onto one elbow, struggling to swallow the butterflies. He was too caught up in the dream. He wasn\u2019t sure he was awake at all.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d he said after too long a pause. It sounded plaintive. He rubbed his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou sound horrible. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, and his gaze fell on the shaft of moonlight that painted the wall across the room. He tried to focus his eyes on it. It was just enough to provide a soft blue glow in the room. He wiped a hand across his forehead. It came away damp. \u201cI... where the fuck have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Zane growled. He leaned over and groped for the almost empty bottle of water on the nightstand. It was tepid, but he took a few swallows anyway. \u201cCalm down, my ass. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ty said, the word drawn out. Zane recognized the tone of voice Ty used when he was trying to figure out how to explain something that didn\u2019t happen to normal people. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m in Tennessee. Or Kentucky. It wasn\u2019t really clear. That\u2019s not why I called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in one piece?\u201d Zane asked. He curled his free hand into the sheet.</p><p>\u201cSo far. But listen, Zane, I don\u2019t have much time. I got a call from Burns.\u201d</p><p>Zane shivered and shifted back to lean against the headboard. That meant Ty wasn\u2019t coming home any time soon, Zane was sure of it. When he spoke, his voice was dark and just barely controlled. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent for a moment. \u201cI miss you,\u201d he said. He sounded wrecked, which didn\u2019t help Zane feel any better. \u201cBut I have to go dark. He didn\u2019t give me a choice this time.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of Zane\u2019s tongue to demand an explanation, but the regret in Ty\u2019s voice stopped him. With anyone else, this conversation would have been ludicrous. Zane rubbed at his eyes. He\u2019d only gone to bed a couple of hours ago, and far earlier in the evening than normal. Ty wouldn\u2019t have expected to wake him.</p><p>\u201cYou scared the hell out of me, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty said, and though he sounded sympathetic, he didn\u2019t necessarily sound contrite. \u201cBut I had to go. I don\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>Zane had known Ty wasn\u2019t himself after their two weeks of hell. Zane had known, and he\u2019d hoped to have the chance to help once they\u2019d both caught their breath. But Ty\u2019s midnight exit had upset that plan. Frustration and anger swamped Zane again, drowning his brief feeling of relief. \u201cDo you know what I thought when I woke up without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully that you couldn\u2019t wait to see me again? I left you a note,\u201d Ty said, voice hopeful.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you know what? It didn\u2019t help!\u201d Zane said, giving up on trying to be understanding. \u201cThat\u2019s not something you want to find when you wake up to what\u2019s supposed to be the first day of the rest of your life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what, now?\u201d</p><p>Zane groaned, turned sideways, and flopped down onto his side. He pulled a pillow over his head and then talked anyway. His words came out muffled and stilted. \u201cBeaumont. Tyler. Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, whoa, full names? What the hell, Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I loved you, and the next day you were gone.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, but Zane could hear him breathing. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and hoarse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Zane. I do, and you know it. And when I get home, we\u2019re going to sit down and talk this out. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciated that.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled the pillow away and rolled onto his back to stare up through the dark at the ceiling. \u201cI told you twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does Burns want now? You\u2019re supposed to be on wellness leave.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t answer for a long time, long enough that Zane checked the display on his phone to make sure the call was still connected. Then he heard Ty huff. \u201cGod, I love it when you\u2019re cranky like this. Promise to still be pissed when I get home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed affectionately, and Zane\u2019s body responded to the sound despite the anger still washing over him. Zane grunted. There was no denying that his exasperating lover would be able to charm his way out of this. Damn him. But Zane was by far too angry to let it go so easily. \u201cAre you saying you knew I loved you before I said it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, Zane. I\u2019m a trained profiler. You really think I can\u2019t tell when someone\u2019s head over heels in love? You were just crunching the numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were scared shitless.\u201d</p> <p>Zane was silent. He wanted to deny it, but Ty was right. The day Ty had danced with him in his living room, he\u2019d told Ty he loved him before he\u2019d even realized the words were slipping out.</p><p>\u201cYou were terrified as soon as it came out, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t given you an out, what would you have done?\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou would have freaked out. And you were already freaking out anyway. Do you know how much it hurt to dismiss that? But you weren\u2019t ready. And I needed you to say it for you. Not for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane sniffed, feeling somewhat mollified. \u201cJesus, Ty. You know me too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead over heels, huh?\u201d Zane\u2019s lips twitched into a very reluctant smile, and he rubbed at them, then dragged his fingers through the dark beard he\u2019d let grow in during the past weeks as he\u2019d been blind. He was still angry, but he tamped it down for the moment, just relieved to hear Ty\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat else do you know about me?\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed. \u201cI know you\u2019re sleeping in my bed right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced around Ty\u2019s bedroom and sighed. Dammit. \u201cI\u2019m still upset,\u201d he muttered, not admitting anything. \u201cI understand you were strung out, but goddamn, Ty. You could\u2019ve said something, you could have talked to me about it instead of just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no excuse. Sometimes I\u2019m a selfish asshole.\u201d</p><p>Dregs of the scare still sloshed through Zane, enough that he didn\u2019t want to let it go, but he knew it wouldn\u2019t solve anything to harp at Ty over the phone. He sighed instead. \u201cWhat did Burns want?\u201d he asked in a more even tone, knowing it was a question he wouldn\u2019t have asked a week ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zane,\u201d Ty said, refusing to answer.</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw clenched. For good or for bad, Zane knew the drill. \u201cYou were ordered to go dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning immediate deployment off the grid, no contact with noncombatants, no trail to trace, no idea when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to call you.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard as that sank in. With this call, Ty was breaking protocol and disobeying a direct order, something Zane knew Ty didn\u2019t take lightly. All sorts of responses crowded on his tongue before a wry observation won out. \u201cI hope there\u2019s not a trace on your phone, or we\u2019re seriously busted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite frankly, Zane, I don\u2019t care if we are,\u201d Ty said with conviction. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d Zane said, throat aching. \u201cDo what you have to and then get your ass home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zane. I\u2019ll make this up to you.</p><p>\u201cThere better be groveling involved,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cSleep well.\u201d</p><p>The call disconnected. Zane was left with silence and a sudden overwhelming sense of helplessness and worry. Ty was out there working a job alone, and Zane didn\u2019t know any more now than he had a day ago. He swallowed hard and let the hand holding the phone fall to the side. After several minutes of focusing on trying to sort the upset from the lingering anger and not having much luck, he climbed out of the bed, yanked the sweaty sheets off the mattress, and headed down to the basement to put them in the washer.</p><p>He needed a shower and some iced tea\u2014preferably from Long Island, but that wasn\u2019t a good idea, so instant mix would do. He just hoped he could find enough work to keep him distracted until Ty returned and he could kick his ass.</p><p>RANDALL JONAS sat on Dick Burns\u2019 couch with his head in his hands. There was a cot in the corner with pillows and folded blankets where he\u2019d been sleeping, and there were whispers going around the office about why Burns wasn\u2019t taking meetings.</p><p>When the cell phone in his pocket rang, Jonas nearly jumped out of his skin. Burns bit his lip to keep from smiling. His old friend had been out of the game too long for this cloak and dagger stuff.</p><p>Burns glanced over at him from where he sat at his desk. The phone was a burn phone, the number only known to two people: Burns and Blake Nichols, Julian Cross\u2019 former handler.</p><p>Jonas turned the speaker on with an obvious sense of relief. \u201cNichols,\u201d he said in a grave voice</p><p>\u201cHello, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was able to get in touch with Julian Cross, sir. He understands the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wants no part in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that he\u2019s out and intends to stay out, sir. He wants no part in any of it. He said if anyone is sent to pick him up, they\u2019ll return in a body bag. Since you know where he is, he\u2019s packing up right now and preparing to move.\u201d</p><p>Jonas closed his eyes. Burns slid his palm across his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCross is my friend, sir,\u201d Nichols\u2019 voice said on the speaker. \u201cI don\u2019t want him hurt. But I also know that if this doesn\u2019t end he\u2019s going to be a target for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want assurances that after this is over, Julian will be left alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssurances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour word will do.\u201d</p><p>Jonas met Burns\u2019 eyes across the office. \u201cI\u2019ll go to bat for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that will have to do. He won\u2019t be easy to detain, but I may have a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange for his boyfriend to be at home at a certain time. If he calls Julian, Julian will come and could possibly be detained. But it has to be today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian won\u2019t go gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware of that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. If I were you, sir, I\u2019d sure as hell send more than one guy.\u201d</p><p>THE heavy thuds of wrapped fists hitting a punching bag echoed off the concrete block walls, as did the soft grunts of effort coming from the man abusing it. The FBI Baltimore field office gym was almost empty in the very early morning. That just meant Special Agent Zane Garrett didn\u2019t have to deal with people watching him beat the stuffing out of a bag.</p><p>Again.</p><p>He focused on his target, using hands, feet, arms, legs, whatever combination worked as he let his body attack and his mind empty. Then, after one vicious kick, the stationary bag swung backward and a deep oomph and a hard thump interrupted Zane\u2019s concentration.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, what\u2019s good, man?\u201d Special Agent Fred Perrimore muttered wryly from where he sprawled on his ass on the mat behind the punching bag he\u2019d been holding in place.</p><p>Zane lowered his fists and wiped the trailing sweat from his forehead with the back of his forearm. \u201cSorry, Freddy. I figured you were paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was!\u201d the stout, muscled black man said from the floor.</p><p>Zane offered him a grin and a hand. He helped the man to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNeed to talk about the prickly thing that crawled up your ass and died?\u201d Perrimore asked, rubbing his hip with one hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zane asked as he walked to the nearby bench and picked up his towel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been pissed for days, Garrett. You\u2019d think your fifteen minutes of fame would make you friendlier, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about publicity with me.\u201d Zane had not enjoyed the continued media attention after his touchdown run with a bomb at Green Mount Cemetery last week. His snowflake of a partner had been granted a reprieve, three days off work to deal with the mental fallout. But not Zane, no, because he had used up all his comp time being blind and helpless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad Grady hasn\u2019t been here. You two would be taking each other apart in the ring,\u201d Perrimore said with a nod to the boxing ring in the middle of the gym. He sprayed his face with his water bottle. \u201cHow the hell does he have so much damn leave time, anyway? Is he on psych eval again?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. He\u2019d been a little on edge ever since he woke up and found a good-bye letter in bed next to him instead of his lover. Zane didn\u2019t even know if Ty\u2019s little mental health trip had helped him. That phone call had been two days ago, and no Ty in sight.</p><p>\u201cHe needed some time after the building fell in on us,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>\u201cHell, Zane, I don\u2019t doubt that. I\u2019d be shocked if he were here. In fact, I\u2019m shocked that you\u2019ve been here.\u201d Perrimore crossed his arms and focused his disapproval on Zane. \u201cYou were blind for a week. And being in that building when it came down on you and Grady? You should have taken time too. The docs would have signed off on the leave, no question.\u201d</p><p>Zane edged up one shoulder as he punched halfheartedly at the bag, watching it waver. \u201cI had plenty of time to sit and think when I couldn\u2019t see. I need to be doing something, even if it is just paperwork. Mac\u2019s not letting me go out, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Perrimore said with a firm nod. \u201cBecause you\u2019re mean. He can\u2019t risk the PR nightmare if you were on the streets.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t think his behavior had been that bad. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Clancy to take her pom-poms and go home.\u201d</p><p>Zane wrinkled his nose. \u201cShe was going on about how great What\u2019s-His-Name from Financial Crimes is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you probably ought to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing when she\u2019s dating the guy.\u201d Zane\u2019s phone, sitting on the bench with his towel, began to chime. He turned to pick it up.</p><p>\u201cThey hooked up? Michelle and What\u2019s-His-Name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Keeping it quiet, though, so keep your mouth shut,\u201d Zane said as he looked at his phone\u2019s display. It was a Washington, DC number, one he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she dating a guy from Financial Crimes?\u201d Perrimore asked. He sounded exasperated.</p><p>Zane shrugged and hit the button to answer the call. \u201cSpecial Agent Zane Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett, Burns here,\u201d the caller said. He didn\u2019t offer his title, even though it was an impressive one. He didn\u2019t even offer a hello. \u201cI need you on a plane in less than two hours.\u201d</p><p>Zane figured he must have looked surprised, because Perrimore frowned and pointed at the phone, mouthing, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cA plane to where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago, but I don\u2019t have time to explain further. There will be information in your locker,\u201d Burns said, sounding harried and impatient.</p><p>Zane glanced at the clock high on the wall. It was almost five in the morning. Normally a call at this time would have caught Zane still in bed. \u201cGuess it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tap someone else for this, Agent Garrett?\u201d Burns asked, his customary composure somewhat lacking. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got less than fifteen minutes to find my man a backup, and I recall that you used to be less talkative.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned. There was something weird about this. \u201cNo, sir. I can leave immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, then. Take a lesson from your partner, Zane. Every minute you spend being a smartass is one minute on the other side that you\u2019re not there for someone who\u2019s counting on you.\u201d He ended the call without waiting for Zane\u2019s response.</p><p>Zane pulled the phone from his ear and looked at it as if it might lunge and snap his head off. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Whatever had happened had Burns more riled than Zane had ever heard him. Zane looked at Perrimore. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d He grabbed his towel and took off at a run for the locker room.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? Garrett!\u201d Perrimore called after him.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t stop to answer. He could be showered and dressed and in his truck in ten minutes. BWI wasn\u2019t far away.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>IT HAD been a whirlwind few hours. A single card of information\u2014airline and flight time out of Baltimore; a time and place in Chicago\u2014had been waiting on the top shelf of Zane\u2019s locker, along with a ticket for a nonstop to O\u2019Hare.</p><p>Zane had, upon occasion, worked with less information. And he knew enough about how Burns worked not to even be bothered with his methods.</p><p>He\u2019d made it to BWI with barely enough time to change into the suit he\u2019d had in the truck. He\u2019d taken the time during the past two days to repack the small duffel bag he kept in the truck for when he needed a change of clothes and more than a couple of spare magazines for his Glock. He\u2019d been able to check the duffel, along with his arsenal.</p><p>That he was in a hurry to serve as backup for another agent, he understood. Why it all translated into Burns being so tense, he had no idea. It was more than a little unnerving, actually, because it brought back memories of clandestine assignments he\u2019d thought he\u2019d buried. It made him wonder what Ty could possibly be doing for Burns that Burns needed to call Zane in on a job. This wasn\u2019t the first time Zane had worked for the assistant director at the order of a single phone call. It was just the first time he\u2019d done it since he was sober.</p><p>Zane tried to clear his mind as he waited for the plane to land and taxi to the gate. After the all clear, he pulled on his wool coat and headed up the skyway with a purpose. His plane was on time, not too surprising for an early morning flight, and his contact was supposed to meet him at the security point where the gate let out of the concourse proper, near baggage claim. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At quarter to seven, O\u2019Hare was bustling, and it helped Zane shrug off the last of the lingering unease from the flight. He had to walk at least half a mile through the sprawling terminals, maneuvering through throngs of people as he tried to get out, but he made it to the security point in under fifteen minutes. Right on time. Now he just had to find his contact.</p><p>He got stuck behind a group of college kids, some kind of sports team, as he came through the terminal exit. He stopped to try to look around and over them, searching for anything that might give him a clue as to whom he\u2019d be meeting.</p><p>Suit and tie, he would guess that much.</p> <p>Several people fit the bill as he surveyed the milling crowd. A man in an expensive suit with no luggage other than a briefcase was reading a newspaper. A woman in a sharp pantsuit and her hair in a tight bun stood near the entrance to a caf\u00e9, checking her watch. Zane gave her a second glance before his gaze coasted past a well-built man leaning over into a cold drinks case, wearing an expensive trench coat and a T-shirt and jeans. The T-shirt and trench combo didn\u2019t get rocked often.</p><p>Zane smiled when it made him think of Ty. The pang of hurt that had lodged in his chest a couple of days ago twinged, and he rubbed at it, ignoring the frazzle of irritation that followed. Ty would wear something like that. He would probably get to Chicago, think Damn, it\u2019s cold, and then go right out and buy a high-dollar trench to wear with jeans and a T-shirt because he\u2019d be able to wear it at work when he got home, and who cared what he looked like in the meantime? Zane chuckled despite the frustration and lingering sense of loss. It would make sense to Ty, anyway.</p><p>He tipped his head to one side to try to see what the T-shirt said. The man straightened and brought into view the face of one Special Agent B. Tyler Grady.</p><p>Zane did a literal double take, hardly able to believe who he was seeing.</p><p>Ty.</p> <p>Ty looked up and met Zane\u2019s eyes across the crowded terminal, and shock registered on his handsome face. He was wearing a pair of jeans Zane had intimate knowledge of and a T-shirt he had never seen before. It was pink and vintage-looking with an orange half circle on it. There were two cartoon characters in front of the circle, an alligator and a crocodile, one saying, \u201cSee you later,\u201d and the other replying, \u201cAfter while.\u201d He hadn\u2019t shaved in a day or two and looked a touch harried, but he also looked healthier than he had the last time Zane had seen him, less worn and more at peace with the world. As Zane drew near, he could see that Ty\u2019s hazel eyes were the same as he remembered: alight with life and humor.</p><p>\u201cZane! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Zane was torn between a nearly overwhelming urge to pull Ty into his arms and the driving need to shake him silly. Zane curled his hands into fists, all too aware of the people all around them. \u201cBurns sent me.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re my backup?\u201d he asked, a smile forming as he spoke. His eyes sparkled, and the smile lines around them appeared before he took an impulsive step forward and hugged Zane tight. Then he kissed him, heedless of the crowds milling through the terminal.</p><p>Zane clutched at Ty\u2019s arms in surprise, but the warmth of Ty\u2019s lips melted the shock away within seconds, and Zane squeezed his eyes shut as everything else faded.</p><p>It seemed like forever before Ty broke the kiss and took Zane\u2019s face between his hands to look at him. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be days before I got to see you.\u201d</p> <p>Zane turned his head just enough to press his lips to Ty\u2019s palm before he frowned. The swell of absolute relief and ridiculous happiness didn\u2019t stand a chance against the stored-up anger and frustration. He pulled back and took Ty by his shoulders, shaking him just like he\u2019d wanted to. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and grabbed him. \u201cStop! Okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should shake you until your teeth rattle,\u201d Zane said as he let Ty go.</p><p>Ty nodded as his smile fell away. His hands dropped from Zane\u2019s face, his fingers dragging against Zane\u2019s skin.</p><p>Zane had almost a week of frustration built up, and he wasn\u2019t about to let it go that easily, even if Ty did look like a kicked puppy because Zane sort of wanted to kill him. When he spoke again, he was surprised that it came out in a growl. \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged, looking away at the thinning crowd. \u201cHere and there. In theory, Tennessee was involved. Or Kentucky. I\u2019m still not sure.\u201d He looked back at Zane. \u201cWhich one has the bluegrass and which one has blue grass?\u201d</p><p>Zane barely resisted the impulse to shake him again. It wouldn\u2019t help, but it might help him feel better. \u201cI\u2019m not asking where Burns told you you were.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, refusing to comment on that.</p> <p>Zane shook his head and then glanced up at the ceiling before meeting his lover\u2019s gaze again. \u201cYou just left,\u201d Zane said, and he made no effort to hide his upset.</p><p>Ty glanced around the terminal, then looked back at Zane and flopped his hands. \u201cI had to. I don\u2019t know how to explain it; it\u2019s just sometimes it feels like... like the world is shrinking around me. Like if I don\u2019t get out and away that it\u2019ll catch me and crush me. And I know that sounds stupid, but it\u2019s a real feeling and I panic. I woke up that morning and I just had to go.\u201d He reached up and put his palm against Zane\u2019s cheek again. It was like he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cI tried to wake you, I really did. I even shook you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shook me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... I poked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! You were sleeping so soundly and.... You looked happy and safe so I let you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Zane said, too loud, and Ty glanced around. Zane stopped and gritted his teeth before continuing, his voice lowered again, \u201cI was. And then I woke up.\u201d</p><p>Ty met his eyes with difficulty. Even with the fear Zane could see, Ty was more rested and pulled together than he had been five days ago, when he\u2019d resembled a train going off the rails. He looked so much more like himself. Zane recognized just how stressed Ty must have been before taking off, and he could see that wherever Ty had been, it had helped.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left that morning I intended to be back that night. Or at least the next morning. I swear, Zane, if I\u2019d known I\u2019d be gone this long I would have tried to stick it out.\u201d Ty waited a few breaths and then added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t help Zane feel any better about the situation, especially when Ty\u2019s sincere remorse highlighted how he was acting like a stereotypical jilted lover. Jealous, demanding, cranky. Zane grimaced. It just wasn\u2019t fair that he had been the one left behind and yet he still looked like the asshole. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to come out of this looking good.\u201d</p><p>Ty grabbed his arm as Zane turned away, stepping in front of him to face him. \u201cWhat do you care if you come out of it looking good? The only person seeing you is me, and I know what I did was shitty. What do you care if we fight in front of a bunch of strangers who\u2019ll never see us again? I know you\u2019re angry, Zane. Show it. Just get it out so it doesn\u2019t sit inside you and blow up later.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked into his eyes and saw the near desperation there, and suddenly he could see the core of what had been bothering Ty. Neither of them had ever felt comfortable showing what they were feeling. For the first time, Zane could see just how badly Ty needed that. But Zane was too close to losing his temper as he stood there and looked into Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d The words came out graveled and curt.</p><p>Ty put both hands out, palms up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, bitch at me? Tell me it\u2019s okay? Say something. I\u2019m damn near groveling, here, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared me, Ty. Scared me,\u201d Zane snapped back, loud enough that people started glancing at them.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty said, still calm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you. I\u2019m sorry I bolted without saying anything to you. I\u2019m sorry I left when you needed me. If I could go back, I\u2019d do it differently. But I\u2019m not sorry for going. You and I both know I needed it. And somewhere in there, you know I needed to do it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have stopped you,\u201d Zane said in a more controlled tone.</p><p>\u201cI know, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid... I was afraid if I woke you and looked into your eyes I wouldn\u2019t be able to go. And I had to go, Zane, I had to.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. The anger was melting away, even after almost a week of percolating. Zane wanted to resent Ty for being so easy to forgive. He had expected to be hit with Ty\u2019s charm, not this disarming sincerity. Even though fear and worry remained, they were blunted by the desperately happy part of him that just wanted Ty with him, no matter what. And he was glad to see Ty looking healthy again.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re understandably pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go get your bags, take a cab ride to my hotel, and you can take it out on me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it out on you. As opposed to what, the world?\u201d Zane asked as he turned and started to walk through the breezeway.</p><p>Zane heard his partner sigh, but Ty kept his mouth shut as they walked.</p><p>Zane suspected he was overreacting, and he tried to swallow the anger. This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d wanted to see Ty again. He was not supposed to be angry and hurt and Ty all understanding and apologetic, making him feel like a caveman for being upset.</p><p>After checking the directory sign outside baggage claim, Zane found the baggage conveyor for his flight and stood waiting for his black leather duffel to scroll past. Ty stood at his side, silent and close. Zane could feel him. He took a steadying breath and turned to look at Ty.</p><p>He was watching Zane, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Zane sniffed in annoyance. \u201cStill upset,\u201d he muttered, the words almost lost under the shuffling sound of people moving around them. But he sighed and relaxed a little; just being able to see Ty and feel the bundle of energy that was his partner allowed that.</p><p>Ty gave him another serene, amused smile. He glanced over his shoulder, and then he stepped forward and took Zane\u2019s elbow. Before Zane could do anything but draw a breath, Ty kissed him again, right there in the middle of baggage claim.</p><p>Zane grabbed his elbows, holding him still so he could deepen the kiss. To hell with whoever was watching. Ty felt so good in his arms, and he smelled like sandalwood, of all things. Zane didn\u2019t care why Ty was suddenly so comfortable with the PDAs. He was going to take advantage while he could.</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you feel better to know I missed the hell out of you?\u201d Ty whispered, lips moving against Zane\u2019s. \u201cAnd I hope you\u2019re still just a little angry when we get to my hotel room.\u201d</p><p>Zane let out a shuddering breath. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more than just a little.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed, the sound deep and anticipatory. It was almost a purr. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Zane gripped Ty\u2019s upper arms tight. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled rakishly, damn him, and took a step back, looking Zane up and down before nodding at the conveyor belt. \u201cThere went your bag.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced around and had to dart after his duffel. When he pulled it off the belt and looked back at Ty in exasperation, Ty was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you the hotel Dick ponied up for,\u201d Ty said as he turned to head for the exits.</p><p>\u201cYou really have a hotel? But when do we move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Zane slung the small bag over his shoulder and loped after Ty. \u201cWhy was Burns in such a hurry to get me here this morning if the meet isn\u2019t set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because he knew I was here alone with nothing to do but something stupid. I\u2019ve been stalking this guy for two days now,\u201d Ty said as he dug around in his pockets, fussing with the heavy trench coat he wore. \u201cTook me a full day just to get a whiff of him. Burns needed to give you time to get under. It\u2019ll be this evening, so we\u2019ll have time to buy you some new clothes, give you time to scruff yourself up. Maybe give me time to scruff you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean scruff me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean screw you through a wall,\u201d Ty said, waving his hand up and down at Zane.</p><p>Zane laughed in surprise. That idea sounded pretty damn good.</p><p>\u201cAnd you look like a Fed. We\u2019re not supposed to look like government on this one, so we\u2019ll need to find you some new clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. All I know is I\u2019m backup. And a lot happier to be here than I was thirty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand snaked around Zane\u2019s waist and pulled him closer as they walked. \u201cBurns didn\u2019t give me anything but the city and \u2018hurry\u2019 and that he\u2019d call me to give me an address later. Then I sat here cooling my heels for two days because he decided I needed backup. I didn\u2019t even get a chance to run down this dude, who apparently is pretty good at not being found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you really want to talk about a case we\u2019ll be handling in less than twelve hours, or do you want to go see my kickass hotel room and discuss your feelings instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously asking me that question right now?\u201d Zane said as he moved his duffel to his other shoulder so it didn\u2019t hang between them.</p><p>\u201cIs that a no, then?\u201d</p><p>Zane reached to dig his fingers into Ty\u2019s ribs, smiling when Ty twisted to get away. \u201cYou might get there without being mauled in the back of a taxi, but I\u2019m making no promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. So how was your week, anyway?\u201d Ty asked, passing through the glass doors and out into Chicago\u2019s frigid March morning. He began to search his pockets again, not looking where he was going. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane stopped their forward progress toward the curb after Ty almost ran down a couple of nuns dragging neon paisley rolling cases. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you something,\u201d Ty said as he lifted one side of his trench coat and peered under it. \u201cThis damn thing has so many hidey holes I can\u2019t remember which one I put it in.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh again. \u201cYou got me something?\u201d</p> <p>Ty looked up, his eyes wide and sincere as he nodded. God, he was handsome. Zane had to shake the urge to kiss him again, and he let the warmth in his chest spread through him as he met Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty, as always, remained outwardly oblivious to the effect he often had on Zane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here an hour or so. Walked through the gift shop.\u201d He flopped his hands and gave up the search. \u201cIt\u2019ll fall out eventually,\u201d he muttered as he smoothed his hands down the front of his coat. He\u2019d definitely bought it for the exact reason Zane had thought.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to bring anything home but yourself,\u201d Zane said, sighing as he took Ty\u2019s arm and got him moving again, following the ground transportation signs toward the taxi queue. It was the same Ty Grady he knew and loved. Really loved. And wasn\u2019t that still an odd thought?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know when I\u2019d get home after this,\u201d Ty said with a wave of his hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t call you. I was pretty sure you were going to be frothing at the mouth by now, so I had to have a plan B in case a sincere apology and groveling didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t frothing at the mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Ty cleared his throat and glanced at Zane with a knowing look.</p><p>Zane shoved his hands in the pockets of his long overcoat and tried to ignore him, but he could just feel Ty watching and waiting. \u201cOkay, so I was a little put out.\u201d He shrugged as he glanced over at his partner.</p><p>Ty nodded as they came up on the cab in the front of the line waiting for passengers. He opened the door and they both climbed into the back of the car, and Zane stashed the duffel between his feet. Ty said something to the cabbie Zane couldn\u2019t make out over the traffic noise, and the car was moving a few moments later.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I left like that,\u201d Ty said as soon as they were sitting next to each other, a careful two feet of empty seat between them.</p><p>The structures whizzing by outside cast weird shadows into the cab, but Zane knew the features of Ty\u2019s face without having to see them, and a short glimpse in the sunlight showed him that Ty was watching him, eyes intent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt you had to.\u201d</p> <p>Ty gave an elegant shrug and smiled. \u201cShit happens,\u201d he said as he looked away.</p><p>\u201cUsually because you\u2019re full of it,\u201d Zane muttered, leaning back in the seat to take the first easy breath he\u2019d been able to draw in days. He glanced at Ty and felt more of the pressure in his chest ease away.</p><p>Ty rested his head against the seat and turned to look at Zane. \u201cNice suit.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked down at himself. It was a deep black suit with sharp lines and tiny charcoal pinstripes, bought to replace the suit ruined last week at Lydia Reeves\u2019 funeral and picked up from the tailor\u2019s just yesterday. The jacket had been cut a little fuller to allow for his gun holster, and the sleeves a little longer to cover his knives. \u201cBurns caught me in the gym. This was what I had for work, since I didn\u2019t have time to run home.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still watching him, his head lowered, his lips twitching as he fought a smile. \u201cNo, Zane,\u201d he said in a low voice, an entirely different tone to the words. \u201cI meant nice suit.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth went dry as the honey-smooth tone of Ty\u2019s seductive voice seeped into him. A slash of light caught in Ty\u2019s eyes, and they glittered green with flecks of gold, focused on him. Zane felt his cheeks flush. \u201cWell. I... uh.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t respond. He continued to watch Zane as the city passed by the cab\u2019s windows. Zane raised an eyebrow, and Ty smirked. Zane knew that look. He knew it very well, and the cab could not get to the hotel fast enough.</p><p>TY LED Zane through the lobby of the hotel Dick had put them up in, bypassing the front desk in favor of the elevators. Technically, they had two rooms for the day. They wouldn\u2019t need both.</p> <p>Ty had to admit that he was nervous. He\u2019d been nervous ever since the morning Richard Burns had called him and he\u2019d realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to get back to Zane before Zane completely flipped out. As soon as the elevator doors closed, Ty glanced at Zane and breathed in deeply to calm himself.</p><p>Zane turned to lean against the side wall, facing Ty, watching him. His dark eyes didn\u2019t stray, not that Ty had anywhere to hide.</p><p>\u201cYou mad?\u201d Ty asked, lips twitching as he fought a smile.</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed, and the calm fa\u00e7ade melted into something that looked a little more dangerous. A thrill ran through Ty\u2019s body, and he could not suppress the shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there more to say?\u201d Zane asked. His voice carried a cautious undertone. \u201cI\u2019m angry, you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Ty said, losing the teasing note. \u201cI think we have shit tons of things to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned, looking pained. But he nodded in agreement.</p><p>The elevator lurched as they reached their floor. Ty waited for the doors to open before he stepped closer and took Zane\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>Zane laced his fingers with Ty\u2019s, and the frown faded, replaced by an unusual vulnerability. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to keep me angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not exactly my plan,\u201d Ty whispered as he led Zane down the hallway. They passed a few people on their way to their door, but he never let go of Zane\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t let go of it as he fished his key out of one of his many pockets and unlocked the door, and once they were inside, he didn\u2019t let go of it after he let Zane drop his bag. Instead, he pulled Zane closer to kiss him.</p><p>Zane\u2019s free hand dug under Ty\u2019s trench coat to slide around his waist, pulling Ty to him as their lips met.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes fell shut and all the tension drained out of him as he wrapped around his lover. Zane was so warm, and his familiar scent seeped into Ty, pushing away all the worries he\u2019d been harboring. He reached out and slid his hand along Zane\u2019s waist, pulling at his shirt. \u201cI love you, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed, leaning to place a soft kiss at Ty\u2019s temple. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his head to instigate another kiss, delving into it with more heat. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this for days.\u201d</p><p>Zane clutched him close, heat and anticipation building between them, and Ty heard a soft groan escape Zane as the kiss continued. The sound went straight through Ty, and his hands began tugging at Zane\u2019s dress shirt, undoing buttons, pulling at his belt as they shuffled further into the room. Ty was forced to take a step back to keep his balance. He found himself against the side of the wet bar, and he just had to laugh and lean against the edge of the counter. Zane shoved Ty\u2019s coat off his shoulders and pulled at his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cBeen too long,\u201d Zane said before claiming another kiss.</p><p>Ty nodded, not able to say anything in reply. He pushed onto his toes and sat on the marble counter so he could slide his knees against Zane\u2019s hips and pull him closer. Zane wedged in, obviously determined to have skin on skin contact sooner rather than later.</p><p>Ty began to laugh again, pushing off Zane\u2019s shirt and dragging his hands against his shoulders. He leaned in to get another kiss, but just as their lips touched, Ty opened his mouth to say one last thing before he forgot and let it slide too long. Zane spoke first.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said between kisses, his hands firm on Ty\u2019s body. \u201cBe mine, just for now. There\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached for Zane\u2019s face, meeting his eyes. \u201cI was always yours,\u201d he said with difficulty.</p><p>Zane pressed his fingertips to Ty\u2019s lips. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, searching for the answer. His chest tightened and breathing became difficult, but he landed on the words he needed. He met Zane\u2019s dark eyes and realized he was feeling light-headed as he answered. \u201cBecause... you make me the kind of person I\u2019ve always wished I was.\u201d</p><p>Zane was silent, his gaze tracing over Ty\u2019s face. Ty held his breath until Zane spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted you just like you are. As much as you infuriate me, you\u2019re who I want.\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t put his finger on what those words felt like. It was somewhere between relief and elation. He didn\u2019t have any more he could say, so he just leaned forward and kissed Zane again, hooking his feet behind Zane\u2019s thighs so he couldn\u2019t get away.</p><p>With a groan, Zane started pulling at Ty\u2019s T-shirt to get it over his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt it! It\u2019s new,\u201d Ty said with a grin as he lifted his arms for Zane to pull the shirt off. It hit the floor, and Zane\u2019s hands splayed over Ty\u2019s chest and ribs while he latched on to Ty\u2019s neck. Ty moaned and let his head fall back, cursing when he banged it against the mirrored cabinet above the wet bar.</p><p>Zane sank to his knees, tugging Ty off the counter, mouth still on Ty\u2019s body, his beard leaving a trail of prickles. His hands slid into Ty\u2019s jeans, and he pulled them down as he moved.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty said, breathless as he looked down at Zane on his knees. He put his hand on Zane\u2019s head and pulled at his overgrown curly hair.</p><p>Zane dragged his tongue down the dark trail of hair along Ty\u2019s abdomen before he tipped his head back to look up at Ty.</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad time to tell you that I hate that beard?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d Zane said, that spark returning to his almost-black eyes.</p><p>Ty laughed, his hand tightening in Zane\u2019s hair. Zane retaliated by dragging his cheek down Ty\u2019s hip. Ty tugged at his hair harder. \u201cCome back up here.\u201d</p><p>Zane stood in one fluid motion, reaching out to cup one hand over the back of Ty\u2019s neck as he pulled him into a voracious kiss.</p><p>Something inside Ty flipped over, and he dug his fingers into Zane with a grateful moan. Something about Zane\u2019s touch felt different. There was more confidence in him, something more firm than just the muscles of his back that Ty was digging his fingers into. Something more certain.</p><p>Zane pulled him closer and squeezed him tight, then reached down to slide his hands under Ty\u2019s ass and lift him with a grunt. Ty wrapped around him so he wouldn\u2019t fall, and Zane swung around and took the three steps to the bed before tossing Ty down to the mattress.</p><p>Ty was still bouncing when Zane crawled over him to kiss him again. He remembered the first time they\u2019d ever tried this: Zane had picked him up like that, in the bathroom of that damn Holiday Inn in New York City. If Ty told Zane that he enjoyed it, he\u2019d be getting tossed around all the time. He\u2019d probably end up with a broken arm or something. Or Zane would ruin his back.</p><p>He let Zane take over, letting his lover\u2019s touch brush away all the stress and worry of the last few months, letting himself forget everything he\u2019d been holding onto, letting Zane wipe the slate clean for him. He tangled his hands in Zane\u2019s hair and kissed him like it was their first time.</p><p>When their mouths parted, both of them gasping for breath, Zane set his forehead against Ty\u2019s and slid his hand through Ty\u2019s mussed hair. His body was heavy against Ty\u2019s, his heart racing, warmth and anticipation flowing between them.</p><p>\u201cThis feels different,\u201d Ty said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zane shifted down to one elbow, laying all of his weight on Ty and pressing closer, nosing against Ty\u2019s chin and cheek.</p><p>Ty spread his legs wider, letting Zane settle between them. It had taken a few months, but he\u2019d finally gotten comfortable with just how much he enjoyed having Zane top him. He\u2019d taught himself quite a lot on that cruise ship job over Christmas.</p><p>He reached up to slide his fingers into Zane\u2019s hair, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes and lifting his hips, making Zane\u2019s breath catch.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane drew out, a shudder coursing through him and into Ty. \u201cYou make me crazy wanting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I like you,\u201d Ty said as he dragged his fingers up Zane\u2019s back. \u201cCome on, we have time.\u201d</p><p>Zane shifted and ground down against Ty\u2019s thigh. \u201cGood. I intend to make you as crazy as I am,\u201d he said against Ty\u2019s ear before pushing himself up and to his knees. \u201cAnd I believe you invited me to work off a little aggravation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess talky, Zane,\u201d Ty said with a smirk he knew would get Zane even more riled.</p><p>Zane gave him that narrow-eyed glare again and scooted back and off the bed. \u201cGet those jeans off now if you want them to be wearable later,\u201d he said as he stripped off the rest of his clothes.</p><p>Ty did so without ever letting his gaze leave Zane, watching his lover disrobe with a shiver of anticipation. Then he spread himself out flat and stretched his arms above his head. He met Zane\u2019s eyes, laying his body out to offer up control. If Zane deserved anything from him, it was enough trust to give him that.</p><p>Zane growled low in his throat and again crawled up Ty\u2019s body, rubbing his chest and cock against all the skin he could as he worked his way up, leading with his tongue... and that damn beard. Ty dismissed that obscenity to fuss about later, pushing his body up against Zane\u2019s, forcing his hands to remain above his head instead of touching Zane like he so wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want me to touch you?\u201d Zane asked in a voice that rasped against Ty\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cI just want you.\u201d</p><p>Zane rubbed against him more insistently as they kissed, hard and long and wet. His hands squeezed and petted until one followed the lines of Ty\u2019s muscled arm to close over his crossed wrists, holding them fast. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t kinky.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not kinky.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed. \u201cWant me to hold you down while I fuck you senseless? Is that why you\u2019ve got your hands up like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ty could barely get the word out as he stared up into Zane\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI can certainly oblige,\u201d Zane said, voice raspy and dark. He pushed down on Ty\u2019s wrists as he ground their hips together.</p><p>Ty whimpered at the tone of Zane\u2019s voice and the promise in it. \u201cI should do this for you more often,\u201d he said in a tortured voice.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive you everything I have.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met in the breathless silence. Ty could feel Zane\u2019s heart beating fast against his chest. Zane finally kissed him in a violent rush and then pushed up and away from him.</p> <p>\u201cStay there and spread your knees. I want to see you.\u201d</p><p>As Zane left the bed and disappeared into the bathroom, Ty did as he was ordered, placing his feet flat on the mattress and letting his knees fall to the sides. Zane had certainly gotten comfortable with his inner Alpha. Before Ty could form another thought, Zane was back, on the bed, between Ty\u2019s legs and licking his way up the inside of Ty\u2019s thigh to his cock.</p><p>Ty sighed, an almost inaudible release of air. The look in Zane\u2019s eyes was something Ty had never seen. It was intense and heated, possessive, filled with emotion that made Ty\u2019s chest hurt all over again, like the first time he\u2019d ever looked into that fire in Zane\u2019s eyes and known that there would be no one else in the world for him.</p><p>Zane worked his way back up Ty\u2019s body before saying, \u201cI love you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t have time to respond before Zane was kissing him, his lips and tongue demanding on Ty\u2019s, his body pressing down, insinuating himself between Ty\u2019s open legs.</p><p>One hand gripped both Ty\u2019s wrists as Zane rested his elbow against the bed near Ty\u2019s head. The other hand groped its way down Ty\u2019s body, a languorous, intimate exploration of the space between them. Ty closed his eyes as warmth and pressure spread through him. He felt Zane\u2019s long fingers, slick with cool lubricant, slide under his balls to rub.</p> <p>\u201cFuck yes.\u201d Ty\u2019s back arched and his fingers stretched for anything to grab onto as Zane held him tight. He hooked one leg over Zane\u2019s hip and moaned into the kiss. He could feel Zane\u2019s cock, hard and demanding against him, and every inch of Zane\u2019s body was tense where he touched Ty.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty whispered shakily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long since I got to do this,\u201d Zane said, his voice rasping and harsh. The head of his cock pushed against Ty, and Ty pulled his leg up higher to help the entry.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is ask,\u201d Ty said, unable to catch his breath over the rapid butterfly beating of his heart.</p><p>Zane nodded even as he turned his head and deepened the kiss. Ty lost himself in the sensations, submerging in the familiar scent of his lover and the absolute joy of being touched and taken like this. Then the head of Zane\u2019s cock pushed into him with a slow rocking of Zane\u2019s hips that forced him into Ty, little by little.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Zane.\u201d Ty pulled at his hands as the pain seared through him, desperate to be able to drag his fingers down Zane\u2019s back, but Zane held fast. His other hand came to rest on Ty\u2019s thigh, fingers digging in, pulling at Ty\u2019s leg as he worked himself in with infinite care.</p><p>Ty pulled his knees up higher as the pain ebbed into something dull and throbbing, letting Zane spread him wider and push deeper into him. He absolutely loved the feeling of Zane\u2019s hips, warm against the inside of his thighs and pressing against him. Loved the sensation of the shaft of Zane\u2019s cock sliding against tight muscles, of being pushed into as he was held down.</p><p>Grunting as he stretched out over Ty\u2019s body, Zane flexed his hips until he was as deep inside Ty as he could get. A soft moan escaped him, and after kissing Ty again, he began to move, a slow rocking motion that built into a real rhythm. The first true thrust wrung an involuntary gasp out of Ty, and he pushed his hips into each one that followed. It spurred Zane on, his movements sliding Ty\u2019s shoulders against the expensive sheets, the bulk of Zane\u2019s weight on that one hand forcing Ty\u2019s wrists to sink into the mattress.</p> <p>Ty couldn\u2019t describe how it felt to be pinned beneath Zane and taken in such an intimate, forceful way. Sex with Zane in any form was always enjoyable, but this was something different, something more than he\u2019d ever given anyone.</p><p>He wrapped his legs around Zane\u2019s hips, his back curling as he met Zane\u2019s thrusts. A desperate stutter of a moan passed his lips, and he jerked his head to the side as Zane shoved into him. Zane\u2019s free hand came up to grip Ty\u2019s hair, pulling his face back so he had to look up. It was an odd feeling, looking into the eyes of the man who moved inside him. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, though. Far from it.</p><p>Zane flexed his hips as he bit at Ty\u2019s lip. \u201cKiss me,\u201d he said, voice hoarse and demanding.</p><p>Ty nearly whimpered. His hands moved to reach for his lover, but Zane\u2019s restraint on his wrists stopped them. Ty gasped instead and rolled his hips again, then pushed back with his shoulders to lift himself just enough to press his lips to Zane\u2019s.</p><p>Zane crushed their mouths together, the passion flaring out of control as he sank deep. Ty\u2019s ears were filled with the thuds of their bodies meeting, the barely there gasps that wrung out of him, Zane\u2019s grunts of effort and pleasure against his neck. He curled to combat the brutal pounding, a cry escaping as his fingers splayed. Zane leaned even more of his weight forward on Ty\u2019s hands, thrusting in and then grinding close before pulling back, only to push in again.</p><p>Ty writhed and let out a shameless whimper, then moved again to hook his ankles behind Zane\u2019s lower back for lack of any other way to hold on to him. Zane moaned as the angle of his entry changed, and the soft sound ratcheted up the heat inside Ty, pleasure curling in his groin. Zane hissed before shifting to start in on him harder, his hips ramming against Ty\u2019s ass. As it went on and on, Ty cried out, and the hoarse sounds weren\u2019t quite words.</p><p>He twisted as Zane pounded into him, unable to do anything but open himself up to the vulnerability of pleasure. Breathing hard, Zane started to slow, changing the hard thrusts to long, smooth slides. He lowered himself to lie against Ty, reaching up with his other hand to pull Ty\u2019s wrists down. Zane kissed him, slow and sure. Ty moaned and spread his captive hands, letting Zane\u2019s fingers thread into his, feeling helpless in Zane\u2019s grasp but loving that he could trust Zane with that feeling. Not once did it cross his mind to panic or try to escape the grip of Zane\u2019s fingers. At that moment, he was totally Zane\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI love to see you like this,\u201d Zane whispered against Ty\u2019s ear, causing a shudder to travel through Ty\u2019s body. \u201cSo fucking perfect.\u201d</p><p>Zane must have felt Ty\u2019s reaction, because he gasped and snapped his hips hard and then moved back up on his knees. He let go of one of Ty\u2019s hands, then reached down to slide his free hand against Ty\u2019s hip, holding on to him. Ty arched into his touch, reaching out to drag his fingers over Zane\u2019s shoulder and down his chest. Short, tortured breaths escaped his parted lips. He couldn\u2019t force himself to open his eyes as Zane started to move inside him again.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said as he released Ty\u2019s other wrist and moved his hand to splay his palm across Ty\u2019s chest. \u201cLook at me. Open your eyes, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ty whimpered with the words, almost a pained gasp as he forced his eyes open.</p><p>Zane swallowed hard as he drew a shaky breath. \u201cAre you feeling this too?\u201d he asked, breathless as he rolled his hips against Ty.</p><p>Ty met his eyes for a brief moment before the pleasure and the proximity caused his eyes to fall shut once more and his body to jerk as he reached for Zane\u2019s neck and pulled him close. Zane\u2019s fingers tightened in his hair, holding him there.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered, surprised at how desperate the honest answer sounded. He moaned, licking his lips as he tried to process through the haze, and then pressed his mouth to Zane\u2019s ear. The flare of heat had Ty\u2019s blood pumping so hard that at first he couldn\u2019t be sure the words were coming out. He couldn\u2019t hear a thing but his own heartbeat. \u201cI\u2019ll always be yours, baby.\u201d</p><p>Zane shuddered against him, managing a dozen more thrusts before tensing hard. He shouted as he came, and his hips stuttered with each abbreviated thrust as he moaned Ty\u2019s name. Through his climax, Zane continued rolling his hips, providing the friction Ty needed, and it was enough to push Ty over the edge. They held tight to each other as they shared their pleasure, letting the world spin out of control for a few short moments together.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>ZANE stood on the bathroom threshold, looking out into the shadowed hotel room at the man he\u2019d left sprawled across the bed in a mess of sheets and sweat. The light shining from behind Zane lit Ty\u2019s face, highlighting long lashes that lay against flushed cheeks and lips Zane could tell were swollen.</p><p>He smirked as he turned the small box over and back in his hand. He\u2019d discovered it in his duffel bag, tangled up in a clean undershirt from the drawer where he\u2019d kept the box hidden.</p><p>It was like Fate had intervened and tossed it into his bag while he wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>Zane wanted to be angry at Ty, he truly did. But dammit, he just couldn\u2019t hold onto it. He was in love with a man who was flighty and spontaneous and headstrong all wrapped into one gorgeous, fun, frustrating package. Ty was a walking emotional hazard, and Zane had known that from the start. Zane huffed and leaned against the doorframe, wanting to burn into his memory the vision of Ty lying there after being thoroughly fucked.</p><p>Ty stretched, and the tangle of sheets muffled his low hum. He didn\u2019t look back at Zane, but he turned his head. \u201cYou\u2019re lurking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmiring,\u201d Zane said as he took his time looking Ty up and down.</p><p>\u201cWell. Go ahead, then.\u201d</p><p>Zane allowed himself a small smile. \u201cI expected to be angry at you for longer,\u201d he said as he moved to the bed and settled on his side next to Ty.</p><p>Ty stretched again, his muscles tensing, body flexing like a large cat sunning. He smiled at Zane, eyes sparkling. \u201cBut then?\u201d</p><p>Despite the fact that he had just about fucked Ty into oblivion not fifteen minutes before, a stroke of heat ripped through Zane as he watched the play of Ty\u2019s muscles, and he rolled his eyes in resignation. \u201cToo happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached out to slide the tips of his fingers down Zane\u2019s cheek. He scooted himself closer until he could press his nose to Zane\u2019s, and he draped his leg over Zane\u2019s hip. \u201cI did miss you. And I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded as he slid his hand down Ty\u2019s hip and pulled him close. He knew he needed to let the anger go; it wouldn\u2019t change what Ty had done. \u201cDid it hurt so much?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s expression softened into sadness, but it passed so quickly that Zane could have imagined it. \u201cSometimes I... I just need a break. Up here,\u201d he said, tapping his forehead. \u201cI have to go somewhere on my own to let life hit me. If I don\u2019t, too much piles up and... I end up not really able to deal. I just have to get away sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t understand; he wasn\u2019t sure he could without having seen the things Ty had seen or living the things Ty had lived. He supposed that when he had to take something apart and analyze it from all sides, it was his way of coping with an issue that would otherwise be too big to deal with. Ty\u2019s way of coping was to walk into an open space, either figuratively or physically, and let the problem hit him with its full force. It was one of the ways he and Ty were wired so differently.</p><p>Ty sighed and rolled to his back again. \u201cRunning for a few days is better than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeltdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s happened before, and it\u2019s not pretty. Taking off gives me time to think, gives me clarity.\u201d</p><p>Zane totally believed that. He couldn\u2019t imagine living inside Ty\u2019s head was easy. He laid his cheek against Ty\u2019s chest, listening to the steady heartbeat as he tried to convince himself not to brood about it. His hand clenched on the small box he still held.</p><p>Ty\u2019s arm snaked around him, pulling him close and tight. Zane shifted and moved his head to Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>Zane realized he\u2019d been staring at the headboard without really seeing anything, and he blinked back into focus to look up at Ty by resting his chin on Ty\u2019s chest. Ty\u2019s fingers curled around a lock of Zane\u2019s hair to play with it.</p><p>\u201cNext time... next time I need to go, will you go with me?\u201d</p><p>Whatever remnants of anger still lingering had no chance against a request like that. Zane would have sworn that he felt what remained of that hard knot he\u2019d carried in his chest for the past several days melt away. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, reaching to trail his fingers over Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Ty gripped his hand and smiled, looking relieved. \u201cEven if it involves the wilderness?\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cEven if it involves the wilderness.\u201d</p><p>Ty hugged him tight and let out the breath he\u2019d been holding in a rush. \u201cI love you. I will always be yours, Zane\u2014no matter where I am or where you are. I promise you that,\u201d he said, the words as serious as Zane had ever heard Ty utter.</p><p>Zane felt flushed all over, light-headed, and more than a little off-kilter. What Ty promised... it was more than Zane had ever expected to want from anyone ever again. But he did want that from Ty, desperately. He drew breath to speak, but it caught, and he had to try again before he could get anything out. \u201cYou\u2014you grovel pretty damn well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do everything well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that was one thing I thought a lot about while I was gone,\u201d Ty said as he rolled Zane to his back and gave him a quick kiss.</p> <p>\u201cGroveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing awesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane, shut up and let me talk.\u201d</p><p>Zane bit his lip to keep from smiling. He looked up into Ty\u2019s hazel eyes and found himself getting lost in them as Ty spoke.</p> <p>\u201cSee... there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t know exactly how I feel about you. Or how I feel about bagels or loafers or the color blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBagels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s nothing we need to hide from each other. And I know it\u2019ll be hard for both of us, and we might need to share some things gradually, but I think we should give it a try.\u201d</p><p>Zane settled, his arms curving around Ty\u2019s waist, his gaze still riveted to Ty. \u201cI think that sounds pretty damn good,\u201d he said, knowing it would help keep insecurity\u2014and jealousy\u2014at bay. He slid his hand over Ty\u2019s hip and up his side. \u201cHow do you feel about bagels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>Zane smirked and ran his hand down Ty\u2019s arm.</p> <p>\u201cBut that means you have to do the same for me,\u201d Ty continued. \u201cNo more hiding from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up into his eyes, wondering how he\u2019d found a man who knew him so well inside and out. \u201cYou know, once I make my mind up about something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cI love you.\u201d Then he lifted his head enough to press a kiss to Ty\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ty said with a smirk as he pulled Zane closer. \u201cAnd what the hell do you have that\u2019s poking me?\u201d</p><p>The hand still clutching the box was pressed against the small of Ty\u2019s back, and Zane shifted enough to pull his arm free, propping himself up on that elbow as Ty lay back and watched him. \u201cYou know how I spent all that time... crunching the numbers?\u201d he asked as an odd calm swept over him.</p> <p>\u201cI was aware, yes. Why?\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and then placed the little wrapped box on Ty\u2019s belly. He\u2019d been envisioning this moment for months. In every permutation of his imaginings, they\u2019d been wearing more clothing.</p><p>Ty had to duck his chin to see what it was, and he was looking at Zane oddly when he reached for the box. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought it for you while we were on the cruise ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all I got you was this stupid T-shirt,\u201d Ty said as he lifted the tape at one end of the box.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuss.\u201d Zane poked him in the ribs. Ty grunted and jerked away, reminding Zane that he was probably still sore from his collision with a very large fireman at home plate a couple of weeks back.</p><p>Ty glanced at him and opened the box like it might be rigged to explode. He set the lid aside and opened the case.</p><p>Set off against gray velvet and still gleaming after all those months was an elegant, polished white gold slide pendant hung on a length of tightly wound black cord. The slide was about the size and shape of a nickel, and the inset boasted a two-tone compass rose. Each of the eight points terminated in a tiny diamond chip set into the round seal.</p><p>Ty stared at it, speechless as he took in the intricate, uneven detailing of the hand-tooled piece. The imperfections reflected that it was one of a kind. Just like Ty.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty finally managed to say. He sat up, not seeming to notice that he\u2019d disturbed Zane\u2019s lounging, and looked down at Zane, agape.</p><p>Zane waited, feeling a slight trepidation niggling at him as he tried to decide what the reaction meant.</p><p>\u201cThis cost you a fortune,\u201d Ty said, aghast, as he lifted the necklace off the pad.</p><p>Zane edged up one shoulder in a tiny shrug. He hadn\u2019t even looked at the price tag. He\u2019d seen it and known he had to get it. And seeing the amazement on Ty\u2019s face just now was worth every cent.</p><p>Ty just looked at him, his hazel eyes boring clear into Zane\u2019s soul. Sometimes Zane found himself wondering what Ty saw when he looked into him like that.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Zane said, swallowing hard as he sat up. \u201cWant to see how it looks?\u201d Because he did. Desperately. He\u2019d visualized it uncounted times now.</p><p>Ty gave him a crooked grin and handed him the necklace. He sat so Zane could hook it around his neck. Zane unwound the leather cord and unfastened the clasp before moving it to settle it around Ty\u2019s throat. It took a few seconds to get the clasp closed\u2014Ty\u2019s gaze on him was too distracting for Zane to get his fingers to work\u2014and finally Zane pulled the pendant down so the necklace hung as it was supposed to.</p><p>Ty was still watching him. Zane touched the compass rose as it fell below the hollow of Ty\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cLooks great,\u201d Zane said, starting to feel a little self-conscious under Ty\u2019s unwavering gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhy a compass?\u201d Ty asked. He hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off Zane\u2019s yet.</p><p>Zane smiled and ran his thumb across the pendant. \u201cBecause you gave me direction when I was lost. You showed me the way.\u201d He looked up to meet Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re like my very own compass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m a sap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But you\u2019re my sap,\u201d Ty said fondly. He reached for Zane and leaned in to kiss him.</p><p>Zane laughed against Ty\u2019s lips. \u201cThis from the man who asked me to slow dance in his living room. I think you\u2019ve still got me beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Zane touched the compass rose again. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll wear it sometimes,\u201d he said, reaching to trail his fingers along the leather cord.</p><p>Ty reached up and gripped Zane\u2019s hand, meeting his eyes. Zane gazed at him; he couldn\u2019t get over how handsome he was.</p><p>\u201cThank you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Zane allowed himself a moment to soak in that smile and those sparkling eyes before pulling Ty into another consuming kiss. He didn\u2019t want to brood about the future or be embarrassed about the past anymore. He was taking a page out of Ty\u2019s book and concentrating on the now. And right now, the only thing he wanted was Ty.</p><p>He laughed as Ty wrapped his arms around him and pushed him back to the bed, then climbed on top of him to straddle him and hold him down. Zane gripped his hips, more than eager to see if Ty would ride him wearing nothing but that necklace.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Ty said with a grim note in his voice. \u201cAbout this beard you\u2019ve got going.\u201d</p><p>AFTER being convinced that the beard and mustache only lent to the image that they weren\u2019t Feds, Ty insisted that the best place to find Zane something else to wear for the job was the Magnificent Mile. Later that afternoon, they exited the cab away from the stores in order to stroll, because they had the time and why the hell not?</p><p>Ty\u2019s exodus had done him good, more than he\u2019d expected when he\u2019d gotten up that morning last week in a panic and bolted. He no longer felt heavy, no longer felt burdened by the past or the future, no longer felt the impending doom of walls closing in on his mind. It had been a good move on his part regardless of the backlash. A mental health break.</p><p>And to top off his improved mood, he and Zane were together in a city halfway across the country from anyone who knew them. Ty could feel the weight of the compass rose around his neck, and it was one burden he was happy to bear. He gave in to the impulse and reached out to slide his gloved fingers into Zane\u2019s bare hand. Zane\u2019s chin snapped around, and Ty could see his eyes widened in surprise, but Zane didn\u2019t pull away. Instead, he curled their hands together and gave a gentle squeeze. Ty\u2019s feeling of elation was borderline ridiculous.</p><p>Ty brushed his shoulder against Zane\u2019s as they walked along Michigan Avenue. \u201cI figure we\u2019re tourists for a few hours. We can do whatever we feel like.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and his shoulders relaxed. \u201cThat sounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing is to find you some new threads. We can eat a late lunch, do the tourist thing while we have the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do we have?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cWe move when Dick calls.\u201d</p><p>They walked along the bustling avenue, passing high-end stores that included Disney, Apple, Cartier, Crate &amp; Barrel, and Saks Fifth Avenue. After a quick meal, they went into several stores, Ty picking out clothing he claimed appropriate for the job and Zane shooting it all down as being made for a teenage hipster.</p><p>Ty was on the verge of getting frustrated when he found a pair of jeans he liked, forced Zane to try them on, and paid for them before Zane could argue or even take them off. He threw in a vintage burgundy Henley that cost a solid hundred dollars, a brown leather and suede jacket that would have bought him new tires if he had his Bronco back, and a pair of boots he thought he might end up stealing. He and Zane could share shoes and shirts as long as the shirts weren\u2019t tailored. Zane\u2019s height was the only thing that precluded them from sharing pants as well. It was a shame, because Zane\u2019s casual wardrobe could use a little help.</p><p>Ty eyed the finished product with a very real desire to get Zane back to the hotel and take it all off again.</p><p>Hands on his hips, he pushed at the back of his upper teeth with his tongue as he looked Zane over. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been gayer than I am right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane boggled at him, and Ty couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Zane shook his head and looked down at the clothes, then up at Ty with narrowed eyes. He tipped his head to one side and pulled up the collar on the jacket, ran his hand through his hair to ruffle it, and reached out to pluck Ty\u2019s aviators off his collar and slide them on. He ran his tongue over his lower lip and raised an impertinent eyebrow toward Ty.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Okay,\u201d Ty muttered, rolling his eyes and turning to leave. \u201cNow you\u2019re just embarrassing yourself.\u201d He smirked and glanced back, though, because Zane made embarrassing look pretty damn good.</p><p>Zane grinned as he followed, carrying his suit over his shoulder in a bag. \u201cI used to dress like this a lot in Miami, you know.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed as he pictured all the many forms he\u2019d seen Zane\u2019s style take in the past. His Miami attire had probably involved mesh shirts, snakeskin pants, and Thai silk. Aside from his partner knowing what walking shorts were, he seemed to be competent about dressing himself at home. Ty had to bite his lip to keep from laughing. He reached out to take Zane\u2019s hand again, angling them toward Navy Pier and the waterfront.</p><p>\u201cIf you like these jeans that much, maybe I should get some new clothes for at home. Been a while since I\u2019ve bought anything but suits for work,\u201d Zane said, assuming an idle tone, though Ty knew full well it was meant to needle him.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Ty said, adding a nod to emphasize that, yeah, Zane needed an all new wardrobe, preferably one that showed off his incredible shoulders and back, because Ty had to admit, that was his favorite part of Zane. He glanced sideways at Zane and smirked. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Navy Pier now. There\u2019s something you should see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>They walked several blocks south, then cut east past Pritzker Military Library to make for the lake. From the circle where cabs were coming and going, picking up and dropping off, they could look down the length of the ordered chaos that was Chicago\u2019s Navy Pier. The Ferris wheel and other rides, the yachts and touring boats moored at the docks, the seemingly endless array of shops and restaurants, extending as far as the eye could see from where he and Zane stood together.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Navy Pier?\u201d Zane asked as he followed Ty through a red metal arch bearing those words.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s got a Ferris wheel,\u201d Ty said with a careless shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Field Museum and Wrigley Field. You have to go do it if you go to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I know about Chicago I learned from The Blues Brothers,\u201d Zane said, distracted as they walked past small booths and ticket stands.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Zane,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cSo I came here last night very briefly because I needed a drink. You need to see this.\u201d He gave Zane\u2019s hand a tug, leading him inside the shopping area and wending through the mass of people, shops, and mobile vendors. When he stopped, they were standing in front of Garrett Popcorn Shop. Ty waved a hand at it with pride, as if it were somehow his doing.</p><p>Zane pulled off the aviators and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he said as he looked in the window.</p><p>Ty put his hand on the small of Zane\u2019s back and ushered him in, pointing to the far wall where the shop had several T-shirts hanging. The white one in the middle, the same one Ty had bought yesterday and stowed in his bag, had yellow-orange cheddar cheese and golden-brown caramel handprints on the chest and the slogan \u201cLove Can Be Messy\u201d above the word Garrett and the shop\u2019s logo. It had been too perfect for Ty to pass up.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips pressed together into a thin line, and when he glanced at Ty, Ty could see the amusement in Zane\u2019s eyes. It made them shine, the dark brown warm and inviting. Ty\u2019s chest tightened as he looked at his lover. Why the hell couldn\u2019t every day be like this?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good. I ought to get one,\u201d Zane said, plucking at the sleeve.</p><p>Ty stepped up behind him, letting his hand linger on Zane\u2019s back, soaking up the feeling of being with him again. \u201cYou can borrow mine,\u201d he murmured, smiling.</p><p>Zane turned his head, letting his nose brush Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and allowed himself to enjoy the moment. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said after a few seconds of content silence. \u201cLet\u2019s go see the sights for a few hours. Pretend it\u2019s real.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cPretend what\u2019s real?\u201d</p><p>Ty slid his hand down Zane\u2019s arm and linked their fingers again. \u201cThat I can hold your hand without worrying about being recognized,\u201d he said with a smile. He tugged at Zane\u2019s hand, wanting to get out of the shops and back onto the pier to see the water and the view.</p><p>Zane\u2019s smile reappeared and he nodded. \u201cAnytime you want.\u201d</p> <p>Ty gave him a melancholy smile, squeezing his hand. It was a shame they didn\u2019t get to go out and hold hands like this at home. A crying shame. But they couldn\u2019t risk being recognized and outed at work. As soon as they both retired, though, Ty intended to hold Zane\u2019s hand everywhere they went.</p><p>\u201cWHAT are you going to tell them?\u201d Randall Jonas asked as Burns dialed the number for his man in Chicago.</p><p>\u201cAs little as possible,\u201d Burns answered. He was silent as he waited for an answer, and when he spoke he was using some sort of code that Jonas didn\u2019t begin trying to decipher. \u201cYour father says hello,\u201d Burns told his agent. It must have been some sort of activator.</p><p>Jonas watched him as he exchanged a few more seemingly mundane pleasantries; then he broke the code and just outright said the information he\u2019d intended to pass on. \u201cConsider your mark armed and extremely dangerous. He\u2019s a federal informant who\u2019s gone off the grid, and we need him here, in my office.\u201d</p><p>Jonas frowned, confused by Burns\u2019 methods. But then, Burns had never had regular methods to begin with.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how you do it, just get him here. In one piece. Don\u2019t \u2018yes, sir\u2019 me, you little shit, just don\u2019t get dead.\u201d He hung up and looked at Jonas with a worried frown.</p><p>\u201cCan your men really bring in Cross without any backup?\u201d Jonas asked.</p><p>Burns pursed his lips. \u201cYes. I\u2019d put these two against any of your spooks, any day of the week.\u201d</p><p>Jonas raised an eyebrow, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile at his old friend\u2019s confidence. \u201cThem\u2019s fightin\u2019 words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it, old man.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p> <p>\u201cWE SHOULD be getting close,\u201d Zane said as the cab cut through the architectural jungle of downtown.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want to play it? Go in soft or heavy? Good cop, bad cop? Shoot first and ask questions later?\u201d Ty asked with a hint of sarcastic amusement.</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cAre you expecting trouble?\u201d Out of long habit, he slid his hand into his new jacket to check his weapon.</p><p>\u201cFrom this guy? Almost certainly,\u201d Ty said. \u201cDick talked about him like he was Batman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong list of connections to the CIA, organized crime, a laundry list of arms dealers and mercs, foreign and domestic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Burns want him? And why us?\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve learned not to ask those questions,\u201d he said as he looked at Zane with a smile to mitigate the harshness of the words.</p> <p>Zane nodded. He looked at Ty with warmth he probably shouldn\u2019t have been feeling while officially on the job. Ty seemed closer than he had been just a moment ago, close enough for Zane to smell him, the unusual musk of sandalwood that was so unlike Ty and the more familiar combination of Tide, gun oil, leather, and sweat that turned him on like crazy. But Zane felt a pang of yearning for a whiff of Old Spice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also expecting him to not actually be at this address. If he was this easy to find, he wouldn\u2019t be Batman,\u201d Ty said, drawing Zane out of his reverie.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s there, it would be novel for it to go so smoothly,\u201d Zane said as the cab came to a stop in front of an old building converted into condos.</p><p>Ty checked his gun and got out as Zane paid the driver, who didn\u2019t even blink at the weapons and nodded when Zane told him to wait. Ty clucked his tongue, trying his best not to smile as Zane joined him on the curb. Ty had been told not long ago that he shouldn\u2019t enjoy the almost-getting-killed part of his job as much as he did. Zane didn\u2019t know who had said it, but ever since, Ty had been making a concerted effort to hide his unholy glee during melees. It was still pretty clear to Zane, though.</p><p>He surveyed the light traffic passing by on the side street. It was evening, and there weren\u2019t many people out and about. Hopefully that would work in their favor.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked Ty.</p><p>Ty glanced up and down the street, then nodded and stepped up to the double glass doors of the building. They would have to be buzzed in, which never helped the element of surprise. Ty stared at the panel for a moment, obviously contemplating how to go about it. He glanced back at Zane and shrugged one shoulder, then pushed the number they\u2019d been given.</p><p>After a short pause, the small speaker clicked. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jimmy!\u201d Ty practically shouted, startling Zane. Ty\u2019s words slurred as he leaned toward the speaker. \u201cDude. You should not have left early tonight.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause. \u201cI think you have the wrong apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, man, don\u2019t be like that! I swear I didn\u2019t know you were into her! I left my good pants on your couch. If I go in to work hungover in my boxers again, they\u2019ll can me for sure. Four strikes and you\u2019re out, brother!\u201d Ty bit his lip to keep from laughing as he turned his head away from the speaker box.</p><p>Zane grinned and shook his head, covering his mouth and reminding himself that they were trained federal agents. Professionals. In theory.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong apartment. There\u2019s no Jimmy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ty drew out. \u201cShit, man, I\u2019m sorry! Didn\u2019t mean to go buzzing you so early in the morning.\u201d The last glance at his watch had told Zane it was nearing six in the evening. \u201cBut hey, do you know Jimmy, man? Could you grab my pants for me?\u201d</p><p>There was a longer pause, long enough that Zane thought the man on the other end of the speaker had abandoned the conversation. But then the box clicked again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no Jimmy here. Buzz somebody else.\u201d The words ended with some ring of finality.</p><p>Ty clucked his tongue again and shrugged at Zane. \u201cWorth a try,\u201d he told his partner with a smirk. He reached out and hit another button. A moment later a woman answered. \u201cDelivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t order anything,\u201d she said brusquely, and that was that. Four more tries later\u2014one no answer, two immediate denials, and a bizarre conversation with a stoner about the phases of the moon during which Ty had way too much to offer, in Zane\u2019s opinion\u2014Ty huffed in frustration.</p><p>\u201cHow many more are you going to try?\u201d Zane asked. They didn\u2019t really have the time to call the Chicago field office and ask for a warrant. Not to mention that would go over really well with Burns, who obviously wanted them to keep this as low as it could go. Was this the kind of thing that Ty was always doing for Burns?</p><p>Ty glanced at him stubbornly and pushed a button at random. Zane rolled his eyes. As soon as there was an answer, he stepped closer to the speaker and said, \u201cFederal agents, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, asshole,\u201d the woman said smugly; then the speaker box clicked off.</p><p>Ty growled dangerously. \u201cI hate this town,\u201d he muttered as he took his gun out from under his coat.</p><p>Zane straightened in mild alarm. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ty yanked a glove off one hand and wrapped it around the butt of his gun, then turned smoothly and rammed the handle into the glass door. The mottled glass cracked and shattered, but there was mesh wire embedded inside that kept it from falling in. Ty used the muzzle of his gun to clear out the window, ripping through the wire, raining pieces all over the sidewalk and Ty\u2019s feet. He reached through the iron bars and pushed the handle, opening the door and holding it for Zane with a gallant wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, sir,\u201d Zane drawled as he walked through the mess, already thinking of ways to make sure Ty would be the one writing up the report for this trip.</p><p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d Ty muttered as he looked up at the floor display above the elevators. He stopped in front of the fire alarm and looked at it for just a moment too long for Zane\u2019s comfort. Zane cleared his throat pointedly.</p><p>Ty looked at him almost guiltily and then followed him toward the stairwell. Zane didn\u2019t know if there were any sort of alarm on the door, but they needed to move a little more quickly regardless.</p><p>The condo they had targeted was on the second floor, not nearly a long enough hike up the steps to pacify Ty\u2019s annoyance. Zane pushed past him and started checking doors until they found the number they\u2019d been provided. He glanced at his partner, knocked on the door, and listened to what sounded like a rush of feet that immediately retreated. Zane frowned and reached out to rap on the door again, but someone approached from the other side and stopped. Zane figured the man was looking out the peephole, so he held up his badge. Behind him, Ty did the same. \u201cFederal agents.\u201d</p><p>A bolt slid and the door opened just a bit, blocked by the chain, and a slim, wholly average-looking man peered out.</p><p>\u201cCameron Jacobs? I\u2019m Special Agent Zane Garrett, and this is Special Agent Ty Grady. We\u2019re looking for Julian Cross.\u201d</p><p>CAMERON stared through the four-inch gap as he studied the two tall, capable-looking men holding out badges that looked pretty official. They could be federal agents. Or not. With Julian\u2019s past business, there was no telling who might come looking for him. It was the \u201cor not\u201d that was scaring Cameron right now, and his hand gripped the doorjamb so tightly that it hurt. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you know him better as Julian Bailey?\u201d the man called Special Agent Grady said drily. \u201cOr Sir? Maybe even Boss?\u201d</p><p>Cameron frowned as he shook his head. Surely federal agents would be nicer than this. He looked them up and down. And better dressed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you have the wrong....\u201d He frowned harder as he remembered the last time he had said those words, maybe fifteen minutes ago. \u201cWas that you on the speaker?\u201d he asked in outrage.</p><p>The man who had introduced them smiled slowly. To Cameron, it was like a dangerous animal showing its teeth. He frowned, looking over the man\u2019s windblown, curly hair, piercing eyes, and a crooked nose that had probably been broken at least twice. The smile was probably meant to put him at ease.</p><p>Special Agent Grady flipped over the badge he\u2019d been holding and pulled aside his leather jacket to slide it into an inner pocket. The move revealed a fairly large weapon in a holster under his arm. Whether he did it on purpose didn\u2019t really matter; his point was made.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind opening the door so we can have a word, Mr. Jacobs?\u201d Special Agent Garrett asked in a businesslike tone. \u201cOr you can just point us toward Cross and we\u2019ll be out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do mind,\u201d Cameron objected, his back straightening as he pulled his hand back to slam the door shut.</p><p>Grady\u2019s hand shot out in a flash, stopping the door from closing. He stepped closer and lowered his head, as if he might be about to share a secret. Everything about him screamed military to Cameron, from his gruff tone to his quick reflexes to his impressive athletic build.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much trouble it is to fix a chain that\u2019s been ripped off a doorjamb?\u201d Special Agent Grady asked calmly. \u201cOr how much it hurts my shoulder to put it through a solid oak door? This is oak, right? It\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>Cameron pushed hard against the door, and it made no difference at all. He glanced at Special Agent Garrett, who was taller, darker, and not offering any sympathy. This was not looking good. Not at all. So Cameron nodded jerkily and reached to unhook the chain, aware that Julian would read him the riot act for this.</p><p>Of course, Julian would yell at him for opening the door in the first place. But only a little bit.</p><p>Chain undone, Cameron took several steps back and gathered himself to reach for his phone and Julian\u2019s speed dial emergency number as he watched his four calf-high white Westies charge the strangers entering the apartment.</p><p>Special Agent Grady moved in slowly, his body turned almost sideways as his eyes scanned the room. His hand was on his weapon.</p><p>Cameron had seen Julian enter rooms in a similar fashion, and it set off even more warning bells. The man looked down at the four dogs and balked, side-stepping and gesturing for his partner to come in.</p><p>It was Cameron\u2019s chance. Cameron reached into his pocket for his cell phone and fumbled with it, trying to be inconspicuous about it. He hoped that he managed to hit the key combination for the prewritten text he needed to send.</p><p>Special Agent Garrett shut the door gently, and the strangers moved steadily into Cameron\u2019s condo. The more he watched the agents, the more they reminded him of Julian. They were on guard but confident. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re looking for. There\u2019s no one else here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Grady told him. He smiled and nodded to the pocket Cameron still had his hand stuffed into. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon, though. Take a load off, kid. It won\u2019t be so bad.\u201d He stretched out broad muscles and rolled his neck, the movement shifting his coat, revealing a specialty T-shirt. Grady turned to look down at the yipping dogs in distaste, and then he looked up at his partner.</p><p>Special Agent Garrett tipped his head to one side before focusing on Cameron. From twelve feet away, his eyes appeared to be flat black, and Cameron felt like he was pinned in place.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Mr. Cross, Mr. Jacobs?\u201d he asked. His voice was calmer than Special Agent Grady\u2019s, more polite, if still a bit cool.</p><p>Cameron pressed his lips together in a bid for silence. At least this was one of the possible scenarios Julian had outlined for him when they had set up the alert system. Despite Cameron\u2019s protests, his dangerous lover had insisted he\u2019d rather come here to protect him and eliminate the problem than stay away in dubious safety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Movement caught his eye, and Cameron glanced up to see one of Julian\u2019s large orange cats sinuously padding around the screen that sectioned off the bedroom. It was Smith, followed closely by Wesson.</p><p>The two very big cats stopped midstride upon seeing the strangers, and Cameron could have sworn he heard one of them growl.</p><p>\u201cNow see, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d the churlish agent said as he pointed at the cats. \u201cThose are guard dogs, Zane. Pound for pound the most effective killing machine in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you say, Meow Mix,\u201d Garrett answered. He sounded like he was humoring his partner. Zane Garrett, Cameron remembered from the door. And Ty Grady, he reminded himself. Garrett and Grady. It sounded like some obnoxious men\u2019s clothing store. Zane pointed at Ty. \u201cYou keep your hands off the wildlife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShove it, Garrett,\u201d Ty said with a huff. He moved around the couch and knelt several feet away from Smith and Wesson. He reached out his hand. \u201cWhat are they, Maine Coons?\u201d he asked Cameron with what seemed like genuine interest.</p><p>Cameron watched as the man put himself well within range of a serious tangle with pain. He swallowed and glanced at the digital clock next to the television. It had been three minutes. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cTy, I said keep your damn hands to yourself,\u201d Zane snapped. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for a field trip to the hospital if that cat decides it wants a taste of you.\u201d</p><p>Ty blithely ignored his partner\u2019s admonition, still holding out one hand and talking to Smith and Wesson in a low voice, a smile on his face. He turned and glanced over his shoulder at Zane. \u201cIf the big one didn\u2019t eat me, I think I can deal with two little ones.\u201d</p> <p>Smith and Wesson sat side by side, watching him in the way only a cat could watch an inferior being. Cameron figured he looked like he was watching Ty like the man was an idiot. He also wondered what cat the man could possibly have tangled with that was bigger than Smith or Wesson.</p><p>Zane gave an aggrieved sigh and walked a little further into the room, though Cameron noticed he kept both the front door and him in sight. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bite, Mr. Jacobs,\u201d Zane said, trying to placate him, Cameron could tell. Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cNo more than the cats, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last stranger who messed with them ended up with stitches from temple to lip,\u201d Cameron mentioned to Ty.</p><p>Ty merely made a clicking sound with his tongue, not moving as he continued to hold his hand out to the cats. Wesson began to move slowly, slinking toward him. \u201cCome on, handsome,\u201d Ty crooned to the cat. Smith lowered his head, his tail twitching as he watched, but Wesson continued to move toward him. He sat and graciously allowed the man to rub one finger under his chin.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s jaw dropped. Those stupid cats wouldn\u2019t even let him touch them, and he\u2019d been living with Julian for over a year now. He swallowed his feeling of dread. If this guy got hold of Wesson and hurt him, Julian would maim him, and that would be a mess. A moment later, Ty had gathered the big cat into his arms and was standing again, holding him over his shoulder, rubbing his ear gently. He turned to grin at his partner. \u201cLike playing the bagpipes,\u201d he joked about the large feline.</p><p>Cameron could hear Wesson purring from where he stood across the room.</p> <p>Zane shook his head, clearly exasperated. \u201cMake yourself at home, Ty. Want to check the fridge, see if there\u2019s any beer?\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted loudly at him and shook his head. He bent and set the cat down carefully, giving his ear a last twirl with one long finger before standing back up and brushing at the cat hair on his shoulder, then looking at his watch. Wesson wound his large body around the agent\u2019s ankles, still purring to the point he was almost vibrating. Cameron had never seen anyone besides Julian handle either cat like that.</p><p>Ty bent to pick the cat up again, turning him upside down and holding him like a baby in his arms as he rubbed him under the chin.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Zane, don\u2019t be scared of a little pussy,\u201d Ty told his partner with a sly grin. Zane circled one finger in the air, dismissing the... insult?</p><p>Cameron\u2019s brows lifted about as far as they could go. \u201cYou two are supposed to be FBI agents?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cAnd your guy is late,\u201d Ty commented as he nodded. He watched out the balcony doors for a long moment before he set the cat down and calmly reached into his coat to pull his weapon. He glanced at Zane with narrowed eyes and then nodded toward the door as he checked the gun in the same manner Cameron had seen Julian check his, with utter calm and competence. Zane pulled a gun out from under his jacket, handling it capably.</p><p>\u201cMr. Jacobs, will he come in firing, or will he be concerned for your safety?\u201d Ty asked, without a hint of real worry that Cameron could detect. It seemed like both men were accustomed to the idea of imminent peril.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t know Julian. He was a whole different level of danger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Cameron murmured. He shook his head and crouched, calling for the dogs. He gathered them and put them into their playpen in the far corner of the room. His gaze settled on Smith and Wesson. While the two cats tolerated him because Julian kicked them out of bed if they didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t like him that much. Cameron wasn\u2019t too sure he could get them back into the bedroom without damage to himself. So they\u2019d just have to take care of themselves.</p><p>Ty and Zane moved together in the middle of the living room as if drawn by magnets, putting their backs to each other, standing maybe four feet apart. Zane faced the door while Ty faced the balcony, synchronized like they\u2019d been doing this a long time. The dogs began yipping plaintively, and Smith and Wesson both sat down in the opening to the bedroom, ready to enjoy the show.</p><p>Cameron cocked his head, listening. He could hear nothing over the complaining of the dogs.</p><p>The door burst open suddenly, kicked hard from the hallway, splintering the doorjamb. Julian\u2019s gun was drawn already, trained on the two so-called federal agents. Zane was already facing him, gun up and pointed. Ty didn\u2019t turn to face Julian. He kept his gun trained on the silent balcony.</p><p>Julian moved into the room, hulking and livid. He pointed his gun at Zane, and the two men stood there aiming at each other, silent as they sized each other up. Cameron was struck by the strong resemblance between them.</p><p>\u201cJulian Cross?\u201d Zane finally asked evenly.</p><p>Julian answered by pulling back the hammer on his gun.</p><p>Cameron saw the trigger move. It was just a tap away from a bullet now. He swallowed hard and forced himself to keep his eyes open. But Zane didn\u2019t even blink.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here on orders from Richard Burns, assistant director of the Criminal Investigations Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to call on your status as a registered federal informant,\u201d Zane rattled off efficiently, neither his weapon nor his voice wavering.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as he saw Julian\u2019s gun waver ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd we would appreciate it if you\u2019d put that gun down,\u201d Ty added without turning around. \u201cAnd tell your buddy I don\u2019t appreciate the feeling of his crosshairs on my forehead.\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s eyes darted between them and Cameron. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked Cameron.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cameron said, resisting the urge to run over to his lover. He was using Julian Bailey\u2019s American accent, and Cameron remembered that Julian had told him that was a warning sign, that it meant he didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t trust the people they were with. \u201cThey didn\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s black eyes moved back to pin the man in front of him. \u201cPut your weapon down. Then we can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, Cross, tell your buddy on the roof next door to stand down,\u201d Ty interrupted in a gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cPut down your weapon and we\u2019ll discuss it,\u201d Julian repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t shoot your Irish ass just \u2019cause I\u2019m a Fed,\u201d Ty growled. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to be walking.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s gun was still trained on Julian. As far as Cameron could tell, he hadn\u2019t even twitched as Ty talked.</p><p>Even though Ty wasn\u2019t even looking at Julian, the threat still made Cameron shiver. Somehow they knew Julian wasn\u2019t American. Cameron had to swallow hard on a fresh wave of fear.</p><p>And Cameron didn\u2019t know how Ty knew someone else was out there at all. Cameron knew that it was Preston, Julian\u2019s ever-present, forever silent driver and cohort, which meant that if Ty even twitched he\u2019d be on the floor, and Zane wouldn\u2019t be but a second behind. Cameron really didn\u2019t want corpses of federal agents in their apartment.</p><p>\u201cJulian, please.\u201d</p><p>Julian waited another breathless moment before lowering his weapon. He eased the hammer down and then held it up sideways as proof that he\u2019d done so. He slid it carefully back into its hiding spot.</p><p>\u201cMy man on the roof stays trained on your partner while you show me a badge,\u201d he bargained.</p><p>He held up his hand in a signal to Preston. Cameron looked between Julian and Zane as Zane moved the hand bracing his gun and slid it into his jacket. He pulled out a leather wallet and tossed it to Julian.</p><p>Julian caught it deftly with one hand, then flipped it over to look at the identification within. He stared at it for a moment before looking up at Zane.</p><p>He made a \u201cquit\u201d motion with his hand toward the balcony. \u201cYou can tell Richard Burns to stick it,\u201d he finally said as he handed the wallet back.</p><p>Zane snorted as he pocketed the wallet and lowered his weapon somewhat. \u201cIf you know Burns, you know that won\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s eyes darted between the two men. \u201cGet out,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cAlso won\u2019t help,\u201d Zane said, sliding his gun under his jacket. \u201cWe\u2019re here to escort you to DC. If we don\u2019t get you there, someone else will, and much less comfortably, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s shoulders tightened. He lowered his head and shook it. \u201cI told them before. I will not be involved. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve wasted your time.\u201d He glanced at Cameron, his expression softening. \u201cPerhaps you should see the sights before you go home, make the trip worthwhile,\u201d he told the two agents. His voice was polite, but he couldn\u2019t fool Cameron. He was angry and tense.</p><p>Though Zane was the one talking now, Cameron paid more attention to Ty. He still had his gun out and in hand and was staring devotedly out the balcony doors.</p><p>\u201cNo misunderstanding, Mr. Cross,\u201d Zane said, his voice genial enough under such odd circumstances that it pulled Cameron\u2019s attention away from Ty. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a request.\u201d</p><p>Cameron stiffened when Zane\u2019s eyes turned to focus on him speculatively, and Cameron bit down on his tongue to keep from blurting out what was sure to be a stupid question.</p><p>\u201cThen so be it,\u201d Julian finally answered stubbornly. \u201cAnyone else looking for me will follow the bread crumbs you\u2019ve left behind you, no doubt. The longer you\u2019re here, the more you become my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said impatiently as he stuffed his gun into his holster and moved around the couch, approaching Cameron. \u201cMr. Cross, I understand you won\u2019t be accompanying us to Washington willingly, is that correct?\u201d he asked brusquely, continuing before Julian could answer. He moved toward Cameron as he extracted a pair of handcuffs. \u201cCameron Jacobs, you are under arrest for harboring a federal fugitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron yelped, putting his hands behind his back and backing away. \u201cHarboring a fugitive? Julian, what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay calm, love,\u201d Julian requested, though the undertone in his voice told Cameron he was having trouble following his own advice.</p><p>Whoever these two men were, they knew physically threatening Julian would have no effect on him, and physically threatening Cameron would just piss him off. Arresting Cameron, however....</p><p>Ty gripped Cameron\u2019s elbow and pulled at him, turning him around with alarming strength as he clasped one cuff on his wrist.</p><p>Cameron looked up at Julian, hoping he knew what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d Julian said as he looked at Zane. \u201cYou have no grounds to arrest him, and you can\u2019t force me to Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes, we do, and yes, we can,\u201d Zane replied. \u201cIt would be a shame to find an unregistered firearm in Mr. Jacobs\u2019 possession, especially if he threatened a federal agent with it.\u201d</p><p>Cameron gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s awful and you know it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re breaking my heart.\u201d Ty\u2019s hand tightened on Cameron\u2019s shoulder as he secured the handcuffs, and his voice was low and gruff in Cameron\u2019s ear. \u201cYou have a good evening now, Mr. Cross,\u201d he said in a louder voice, pushing Cameron in front of him toward the door.</p><p>Cameron tried to dig in his heels, but he was no match for Ty. Both the FBI agents were closer to Julian\u2019s size than his, and since the top of his head did well to reach Julian\u2019s nose, it wasn\u2019t much problem for Ty to push him around. But Cameron was determined to stay calm, like Julian had told him, though it wasn\u2019t looking good as Ty propelled him forward. At least he was almost certain these guys wouldn\u2019t kill him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have ways to find us,\u201d Zane told Julian as he walked toward the door, somehow managing to look casual but keep facing Julian the whole time. He was still holding his gun. \u201cIf you decide to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Julian sidestepped, stopping their progress. He didn\u2019t budge as Ty moved Cameron toward the door. Ty\u2019s fingers dug into Cameron\u2019s shoulder to stop him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cZane, I think Mr. Cross is a little more attached to Mr. Jacobs than we realized,\u201d Ty said casually to his partner.</p><p>\u201cWell, leave it to intel to miss important little details like that,\u201d Zane muttered. He offered Julian an insincere smile. \u201cYour choice, Mr. Cross. In a manner of speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither get out of the way or have your man on the roof shoot us,\u201d Ty told Julian, sounding as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p> <p>Julian narrowed his eyes. He glanced to the side, looking at Zane as he held up his hand and slowly reached into his coat with the other.</p><p>He extracted his cell phone carefully and slid it open. He looked back at Ty as he pressed a button and put the phone to his ear. \u201cPreston,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cshoot the stupid one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian!\u201d Cameron snapped, annoyance flaring. Julian was supposed to be helping them!</p><p>Julian shrugged. \u201cWhat do you mean, which one?\u201d he said to Preston, whose voice could barely be heard on the phone.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess; Preston drives the clown car?\u201d Ty asked, unimpressed.</p> <p>\u201cPreston, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d Cameron yelled at Julian\u2019s phone. \u201cHow is this going to help?\u201d He looked around at the three men, and Cameron realized what a mess this was. There was nothing here but a lot of testosterone. He hoped. \u201cAre you going to keep threatening each other, or is something going to happen besides someone dying on our floor?\u201d</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s got a temper,\u201d he observed as Cameron pulled at Ty\u2019s immovable hands.</p><p>Julian closed the phone in his hand in disgust and glared at the two agents. \u201cYou realize you put both our lives in danger with this stunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can live with that,\u201d Ty said. \u201cNow do you want to do this nicely, have time to pack your Uzi in your underwear, or do we get to cuff you and drag you out?\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI won\u2019t go without Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a vacation, Cross,\u201d Zane said.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s exposed now, thanks to you. I go with you willingly on the condition I keep him by my side.\u201d</p><p>Ty was already unlocking the handcuffs on Cameron\u2019s wrists. \u201cTell the clown on the roof to protect him,\u201d he told Julian. \u201cNot our job.\u201d</p><p>Cameron darted straight for Julian once Ty let him loose, moving to stand behind his imposing lover. \u201cIs this something important? This informant stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Julian said as he slid one hand into Cameron\u2019s, squeezing his fingers. He hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off Ty, who was holding up the handcuffs and smirking.</p><p>\u201cYou look like the type who enjoys these,\u201d the agent drawled.</p><p>Julian sighed in a rare show of exasperation. \u201cAre you two really the crack team they sent after me? This is almost insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you see isn\u2019t always what you get,\u201d Zane said. He glanced at Ty for a long moment, and Ty sniffed, looking somewhat disappointed that he didn\u2019t get to use his handcuffs. Zane looked at his watch. \u201cFine. Jacobs goes with. We\u2019ve got two hours to make our flight to DC.\u201d</p><p>Cameron pressed against the back of Julian\u2019s arm. \u201cJulian, I can stay here with Preston and Blake,\u201d he said, naming the two men who often worked with Julian on his clandestine \u201cjobs,\u201d his driver and his boss. Cameron still wasn\u2019t exactly sure what Julian did, but he knew for certain he didn\u2019t want details. He slept better at night without them.</p> <p>Julian turned his head, looking back at Cameron while still keeping an eye on the two men. \u201cPreston and Blake will be busy. Go pack a bag. Quickly. Please,\u201d he was careful to tack on.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the animals?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cWho the hell needs this many dogs anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being a pet owner?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you pronounced \u2018hoarder\u2019 wrong.\u201d</p><p>Glancing around, Cameron kept his mouth shut and looked to Julian for direction. Julian was looking at the agent with the equivalent of a glare for his stoic lover.</p><p>\u201cPreston will take care of them,\u201d Julian answered, jaw tight.</p><p>Cameron swallowed hard, and after one last look at Ty, he hurried over to the bedroom to pack for both himself and Julian. Zane followed behind him, intending to watch what he packed. Cameron glanced at the man uneasily. He had only an inkling of what was going on, but he did know they were in deep trouble this time.</p><p>TY TURNED and watched Cameron disappear into the bedroom. He looked back at Zane and shook his head. It wasn\u2019t a great idea to take the boyfriend along. Two prisoners would be harder to handle than one, but it could prove a useful way to control Julian Cross if he got unruly. Zane took a few steps toward the dividing screens of the bedroom and stood where he could watch Cameron\u2019s movements and see what he was packing in his bags.</p><p>Ty ran a finger along his eyebrow and turned to stroll into the center of the room again, looking out the balcony doors at the roof of the building across the street. He\u2019d seen the dying light glint off a piece of glass on the roof as he\u2019d been petting the cat and recognized it for what it was. How the sniper had gotten up there so quickly was the real question. It didn\u2019t matter, but it bothered Ty.</p><p>Ty smiled crookedly and gave the man on the roof, Preston, a cheeky little wave.</p><p>He heard Zane snort. He stayed across the room, keeping between Julian and the door and keeping Cameron within his line of sight. Not that it looked like either man was going to run.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that you\u2019re going to be held in a federal cell or safe house for the length of this thing,\u201d Zane said to Julian. \u201cYou really want him stuck there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sleep better knowing he\u2019s not in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Julian said. He looked at Ty. \u201cHe will shoot you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him to shoot the stupid one,\u201d Ty said as he pointed at Zane.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThe one standing out in the open in front of the window, waving at the sniper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that knows where the sniper is to wave at him. If he was going to shoot me, he would have.\u201d Ty looked at Julian. \u201cDoes that kid have any idea what you\u2019re about to drag him into?\u201d</p><p>Julian was silent, glaring at Ty for a moment before looking away and sighing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a no,\u201d Zane said. \u201cDoes he know what business you\u2019ve been working in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your concern. You and I both know I\u2019ll never set foot in a cell or a courtroom if I make it to DC. We know what this is. He doesn\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at Zane, trying to conceal the question in his expression. Apparently Cameron Jacobs wasn\u2019t the only one being kept out of the loop.</p><p>But Julian was perceptive, and he caught Ty\u2019s look. He laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo one told you. They just sent you here like good little errand boys.\u201d</p><p>Zane leveled a look at Ty that would have crushed a lesser man, but Ty was immune. He also had no clue why Zane wanted to be such a hardass in front of this guy. The Batman types were the most fun to annoy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to escort you to DC, Mr. Cross,\u201d Zane said. \u201cAnything beyond that is need-to-know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must really have it in for you two.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. He half suspected the man was just trying to screw with them, but he knew Richard Burns well enough to think he probably had kept something from them. Ty was used to it. That was just the way Burns operated. Ty trusted him implicitly. He didn\u2019t ask questions.</p><p>\u201cLook, O\u2019Doul, I have the patience of a bouncy ball right now, so how about shutting your mouth and getting your friend in there to hurry the hell up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said in that quiet, calm-down voice that Ty hated.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d he responded in the same tone. He turned to Julian. \u201cGet him out here. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s packed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron?\u201d Julian called without taking his eyes off Ty. \u201cThe irritating one is getting more irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Ty,\u201d Cameron called back from behind the screen.</p><p>Ty saw the big man give the entry to the bedroom a curious glance, as if wondering why he should care what their names were. Ty snorted at them both in annoyance. He glanced at Zane, raising one eyebrow and tilting his head toward Julian. They would have to restrain him before leaving. There was no way they could trust him. Ty was all for using Cameron to keep him under control, but they were damn sure tying Cross up and making sure he couldn\u2019t do any damage either way.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got five seconds,\u201d Ty said as he looked at Zane for one more moment.</p><p>\u201cCameron,\u201d Julian called. \u201cUnless you want the irritating one to help you pack, I suggest you hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always do the heavy lifting for you, Cross?\u201d Ty asked the man in a low, amused voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. Cooks and cleans too. Makes me feel more like a man,\u201d Julian said without a hint of sarcasm. \u201cWanker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ll have someone to argue with,\u201d Cameron said as he emerged with two bags, one on each shoulder, one of which Julian took as soon as Cameron stopped beside him.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to shoot him, not argue with him,\u201d Julian mumbled. He adjusted one of the straps and looked up at Ty and Zane, raising his chin. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be wanting to confiscate my weapon?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and smirked. \u201cHe\u2019s got the stiff upper lip going now,\u201d he said as he pulled his gun.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the British,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d Ty said, knowing it would upset an Irishman. He pointed his gun at Julian\u2019s feet. \u201cGuns on the couch. Mr. Jacobs, if you would please join my partner over here,\u201d he said with a tilt of his head at Zane, mimicking Julian\u2019s proper speech, \u201che\u2019ll be kind enough to handcuff you again and frog-march you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you work at being this rude?\u201d Cameron asked. Ty could hear Zane choking on what might have been a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI said please.\u201d</p><p>Zane was tamping down a smile as he took Cameron in hand and cuffed him. \u201cNow, Mr. Cross,\u201d Zane said, \u201cI\u2019m betting that you\u2019re going to be quite willing to cooperate as long as we treat Mr. Jacobs well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs not treating me well a possibility?\u201d Cameron asked, his voice wavering as he kept his eyes on Julian.</p><p>Julian shook his head as he looked at Cameron. He extracted the weapons hidden on his person and put them on the couch as he\u2019d been told, continuing to keep his eyes on Cameron. They seemed to be communicating. Ty recognized the way one lover could speak to another without words. He cleared his throat and moved toward Julian with care.</p><p>The man put his hands up behind his head, but something about him still made Ty wary. He could almost smell the capabilities of the man. He very carefully moved his hand up one of Julian\u2019s arms and down the other, then slid the handcuffs onto one wrist and clicked them into place.</p><p>\u201cThose are some impressive cats,\u201d he said as he holstered his gun and used both hands to secure Julian\u2019s behind his back. \u201cHow long have you had them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they can remember,\u201d Julian answered without looking away from Cameron.</p><p>Ty looked over the man\u2019s shoulder at Zane and rolled his eyes. He snapped the other cuff down hard, then patted him down. He found a long sliver of metal embedded in each sleeve, just at the cuffs, but no other weaponry.</p><p>Julian sighed in annoyance as Ty removed the lock pick pieces.</p><p>\u201cPoor hired killer, took away his toys,\u201d Ty said in mocking sympathy. \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d he said to Zane, patting Julian on the back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Jacobs,\u201d Zane said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in DC in about seven hours, and dealing with us will be but a happy memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for small favors,\u201d Julian murmured. He turned. \u201cThat second bag is quite heavy. Do mind your back, Agent Grady,\u201d he said with utmost sincerity, then smirked and began moving toward Zane and the door. Cameron shifted away from Zane as Julian approached, but he didn\u2019t try to move any further.</p><p>\u201cIf we want to make the plane, we need to go now,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty thought seriously about leaving the bags on the floor, but even he wasn\u2019t that much of a bastard. He bent and hefted both bags with a muttered curse. He nodded, turning one last time to salute the man he knew was probably still on the opposite roof, watching them through a scope.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this show on the road,\u201d he grunted as he headed for the door. \u201cMr. Jacobs, you\u2019re going to need to stop cowering. Garrett won\u2019t hurt you. Much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, in my experience, it\u2019s the tall, dark, and silent types who are the most dangerous,\u201d Cameron said as he preceded Zane out the door.</p><p>\u201cOh Christ, he\u2019s one of those, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Julian said in return.</p><p>PRESTON watched through the scope of his Parker Hale Model 85 as the two agents led Julian and Cameron out of the apartment and shut the door behind them. He raised his head to look down at the street and the cab waiting.</p><p>One thing was certain after seeing the face of the man waving to him in his scope: he couldn\u2019t just take them out from up here. He didn\u2019t know why, but the man looked familiar. He didn\u2019t wait for them to emerge on the street, instead packing up and moving as he pulled out his cell phone. He dialed the only number he really could in this situation.</p><p>\u201cHello, sir,\u201d he said as soon as Blake Nichols answered.</p><p>\u201cI know you call Julian \u2018sir\u2019 to annoy him, but do you really have to do it to me too?\u201d Blake asked, amused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI apologize, sir, but we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d Blake asked, tone changing.</p><p>\u201cTwo federal agents have just taken Mr. Cross into custody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, two federal agents\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you, Preston!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d Preston said as he trotted down the steps of the building he\u2019d been using as his sniper\u2019s nest.</p><p>\u201cWhat agency?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t be certain. They had FBI badges, but one of them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they CIA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, sir. I couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fucking fast. Stay on them, Preston, but do not move on them, understood? I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Preston flipped the phone closed and picked up the pace, hurrying to the ground level so he\u2019d have a chance to catch up with that cab.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>TSA used the screened-off area for security searches to pass through airline crews, law enforcement, and VIPs. It was quicker than going through as a regular passenger but still a lot of scrutiny, especially when it came to checking prisoners.</p><p>Ty and Zane had debated over whether to go through the law enforcement line since they were supposed to be operating dark, but the risk of taking Julian Cross through the searches without being restrained was too high, and trying to explain that he was handcuffed because he wasn\u2019t coming willingly without identifying themselves as FBI would get awkward.</p><p>So there they stood at Midway airport as one uniformed man each patted Cameron and Zane down. Ty rocked from side to side, checking the time on his cell phone every few seconds. Zane knew he didn\u2019t want to miss the plane, but he figured Ty also wanted to get rid of Julian as soon as possible. Zane didn\u2019t blame him; he felt much the same. Julian Cross was dangerous. Even standing sedately in front of them, his hands cuffed, Cameron\u2019s jacket thrown over them to hide the restraints from the general public, he made Zane uneasy. Obviously Ty felt the same way. And there was an added element in that Julian seemed to especially dislike Ty and vice versa. The animosity between the two was solid in the air, and Zane couldn\u2019t figure out why, other than Ty sometimes had that effect on people.</p><p>The TSA officials reported them done and waved Zane and Cameron over to the side. Zane holstered his gun when the guard spoke up. \u201cNext,\u201d he said, gesturing for Julian to step forward onto the screening mat. The other screener waved Ty forward.</p><p>They stood side by side, Ty annoyed with the whole process and Julian calm and serene as the TSA agent took Cameron\u2019s coat from him to reveal his handcuffs.</p><p>Ty had his arms up, hands held out to the sides as he was given a cursory pat down. Julian looked sideways at him, then at the TSA agent. After another moment he calmly said, \u201cHe has a bomb.\u201d</p><p>Zane whirled in place so he could see Julian just as the agent said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>Ty\u2019s head snapped up, and he looked at Julian murderously as Julian repeated, \u201cHe has a bomb.\u201d</p><p>Ty would have lunged and throttled him right then and there, but the TSA agent who\u2019d been searching him wrapped his arms around Ty\u2019s shoulders to restrain him.</p><p>\u201cCross,\u201d Zane said in warning, \u201cthey\u2019ve already checked our ID.\u201d Attempting damage control, he took a couple of slow steps to put himself between Ty and Julian. Cameron hovered on the other side of the mat, looking mortified.</p><p>\u201cTheir IDs are fake,\u201d Julian told the TSA agents with supreme confidence. He was even using his Irish accent as he spoke. He looked at Ty with what appeared to be heartfelt sincerity. \u201cI can\u2019t let you kill innocent people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Ty growled at him. He pointed a finger in Julian\u2019s face. \u201cIf I get a cavity search because of you, I will kick your ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrady, enough,\u201d Zane said, pointing at him before he turned to Julian. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping yourself, Cross.\u201d He pulled out his wallet with the utmost care and held out his ID and a confirmation card with the appropriate security numbers, hoping to head off a mess.</p><p>Julian actually smirked and winked at him. Zane resisted the urge to roll his eyes and maintained his calm, professional mask as a worried-looking TSA agent took his cards and made a beeline for the phone on the desk. Zane could practically hear Ty vibrating with outrage behind him.</p><p>Several minutes later, two very large security agents returned with the first and flanked Ty. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to come with us, sir.\u201d</p><p>Ty growled and pointed at Julian, looking at Zane as they dragged him away. \u201cI hate him.\u201d</p><p>Zane quashed a sigh and nodded. It wouldn\u2019t help to rail against the very excitable TSA, and he turned to nod at Julian. \u201cGo ahead and search him. Thoroughly,\u201d Zane told the agents. Worst case, he could leave Ty and Cameron and take Julian to DC himself, though he\u2019d get no end of shit about it from Ty afterward.</p><p>Julian was still smiling as he held his handcuffed hands up to be searched.</p><p>\u201cWHAT if they\u2019d just locked us all up? What would that have accomplished?\u201d Cameron asked Julian as they walked alongside Zane, following in Ty\u2019s wake. He was talking on his cell phone as he stalked toward the airline desk.</p><p>\u201cIt would have delayed the inevitable,\u201d Julian told him with a negligent shrug. He was smirking, something he only did when he was feeling particularly evil.</p><p>Ahead of them, Ty stopped in his tracks as he spoke on the phone. \u201cWhat do you mean, rent a car?\u201d</p><p>Julian began to laugh.</p><p>The delay at Midway had caused them to miss the last flight to DC for the night. When they\u2019d missed that one, whoever was giving Ty and Zane orders had told them to haul it to O\u2019Hare to catch the midnight flight, which they had tried to do, but they\u2019d hit the ever-present Chicagoland construction, and it had taken them a full three hours to get up to O\u2019Hare. By then the last flight was gone, and they were grounded until morning. Which was exactly what Julian had wanted.</p><p>Cameron wasn\u2019t sure what surprised him more, the ten-minute-long nearly incoherent rant that had come out of Ty\u2019s mouth as they\u2019d sat in traffic in a minivan taxi with no shocks, or the extent to which Julian seemed to be enjoying himself.</p><p>\u201cAntagonizing him probably isn\u2019t the best idea,\u201d he said as they stopped as well. Ty didn\u2019t seem to have a lot of patience to work with, and Cameron knew that Julian could try the patience of a saint if he felt so inclined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d Julian murmured.</p><p>Ty snapped the phone closed and turned to Zane. \u201cHe told us to rent a fucking car. He doesn\u2019t want us to hang around until morning. He wants Batman and Robin here on the move and away from the TSA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like he wants us to scramble,\u201d Zane said, just loud enough for Cameron to discern.</p><p>\u201cExactly, but I\u2019m not sure why. We\u2019re not on anyone\u2019s radar. Unless he\u2019s not telling us that either.\u201d</p><p>Julian hummed but didn\u2019t comment. Cameron watched as Zane just looked at Ty, and after a long moment, Ty sniffed, shoved his phone in his pocket, and turned on his heel to head toward the rental cars. Zane turned back to him and Julian. \u201cReady for a ride, gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ride? In a car? With the three of you?\u201d Cameron asked, horrified. \u201cTo Washington, DC?\u201d He would have sworn he saw a twinkle of humor in Zane\u2019s eyes before the man looked away.</p><p>Ty stomped back up to them and grabbed Julian by the elbow. \u201cGet the lead out, Garrett,\u201d he said to his partner. He was muttering to Julian as he dragged him away. \u201cCome on, funny guy. I\u2019ll show you where they keep the cavity search kits.\u201d</p><p>Cameron had to work hard to keep up with the three taller and longer-legged men. \u201cIs your partner always this way?\u201d he asked Zane.</p><p>Zane glanced at him, and this time Cameron did see faint amusement. \u201cNo. Sometimes he\u2019s a little excitable.\u201d</p><p>Cameron stared at him, trying to decide if he was joking or serious. He couldn\u2019t tell with Zane\u2019s dry delivery. When he looked away from Zane, Cameron nearly ran into Ty, who had stopped and turned around to wait on them. Cameron winced. The man had to be made of solid rock. Ty looked from him to Zane. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get friendly with the prisoners, take this one,\u201d he told Zane, unceremoniously shoving Julian at his partner. He took Cameron\u2019s upper arm in an iron grip and turned, pulling Cameron along with him toward the car rental desks.</p><p>Stumbling along, Cameron looked over his shoulder at Zane and Julian. \u201cIs this your way of getting friendly?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018He has a bomb,\u2019 he says,\u201d Ty parroted in answer. He kept on, taking on a comically exaggerated Irish accent. \u201cOh look, Mr. Rubber Glove Man, he has a bomb. Och, we missed our plane.\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed as he stumbled and bumped into Ty again. \u201cCome on, man, you\u2019re like half a foot taller than me. Give me a break!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a Valium or something,\u201d Cameron said under his breath as he tried to hurry enough that Ty wouldn\u2019t drag him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I should also be given a cigarette after what that TSA agent did to me,\u201d Ty snapped. He looked over his shoulder to find Zane and Julian lagging behind. \u201cGarrett!\u201d</p><p>Cameron watched as Zane held out a hand to his side, as if willing Ty to be patient. Neither he nor Julian looked to be in all that much of a hurry, which Cameron knew would just incense Ty more. Ty mumbled as he and Cameron came up to the rental desk. Cameron didn\u2019t even know if what Ty was saying consisted of real words, much less English ones.</p><p>By the time Zane and Julian joined them, the rental agent was almost finished telling Ty what models of car were available.</p><p>Ty turned to Zane and shook his head. \u201cI refuse to drive to DC in a compact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019d all get into a compact unless we lashed Cross to the roof,\u201d Zane said. Ty looked Julian up and down.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even have any SUVs,\u201d Cameron said to Julian and Zane.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the trunk,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>Cameron gave him a disbelieving look before shaking his head, and he was seized with the urge to smack Zane as the man looked to be considering it.</p><p>Julian looked between them without comment, then rolled his eyes and looked away.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Zane, I\u2019m not driving to DC in a fucking Chevy Aveo,\u201d Ty said after apparently dismissing the idea of stuffing Julian in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cTrain?\u201d Zane suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have to wait longer for that than the next plane,\u201d Ty muttered. Then a light entered his oddly colored eyes, as if an idea had struck him. \u201cLet\u2019s head to the field office. Steal a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorrow a truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe office is nearby. We\u2019ll get a cab,\u201d Zane said, taking Julian\u2019s arm to turn him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you two do this kind of thing often? Because you really don\u2019t seem very good at it,\u201d Cameron said as he resettled his bag on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPractice a little self-preservation, love,\u201d Julian murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got you for,\u201d Cameron said with a smile for his lover.</p><p>\u201cOh, gag me with a sock,\u201d Ty muttered as he pulled Cameron away and headed for the doors.</p><p>\u201cYou need a little love in your life,\u201d Cameron told him.</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes but had nothing sarcastic to say to that.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Cameron said, just to get in a dig of his own for being dragged around. \u201cIt did wonders for Julian\u2019s attitude.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and looked over his shoulder at Julian as they walked through the automatic doors. \u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s coming on to me,\u201d he told Julian with the same sincere honesty that Julian had used to tell the TSA agents Ty was carrying a bomb.</p><p>Julian made an annoyed sound in the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cZane\u2019s more my type,\u201d Cameron said, just to irritate Ty even more. Zane snorted before smiling again.</p><p>\u201cHear that?\u201d Ty asked Julian over his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of a whore.\u201d</p><p>Cameron huffed and elbowed Ty in the ribs as they exited the terminal. The man didn\u2019t even wince, which made Cameron want to find somewhere he didn\u2019t have a protective layer of muscle and kick him.</p><p>TY SAT in the driver\u2019s seat of a \u201cborrowed\u201d FBI sedan, drumming his fingers against the steering wheel. They hadn\u2019t been able to get away with an SUV, so the sedan would have to serve. It was roomier than anything the rental agency had been offering, and when the Chicago field office found the car missing, it would be a nice little \u201cfuck you\u201d to Dick for sending them into this mess without all the information.</p><p>Because it was painfully apparent that they didn\u2019t have all the information. They didn\u2019t even have the CliffsNotes version.</p><p>Ty smiled as he thought about the reaction the missing sedan would get from Burns, but he was still irritated just on principle. The first half of the day had been perfect, only to be marred by the addition of the two criminals in love in the backseat. Julian Cross got under Ty\u2019s skin simply because he felt dangerous. He was unflappable too, something Ty had rarely encountered. In fact, Ty couldn\u2019t think of a single person he\u2019d ever met that he couldn\u2019t irritate to some degree. Cameron Jacobs, however, was annoying because he was so damn na\u00efve it offended Ty\u2019s sensibilities. How the two had fallen in love and managed to stay that way Ty couldn\u2019t fathom.</p><p>Zane had insisted they stop to load up on supplies at the first drug store they came to. He was taking his sweet freaking time with it. Julian and Cameron were in the backseat of the car, handcuffed to the special rings welded to the floorboards, the child locks engaged so they couldn\u2019t get out. Ty sat with his gun resting on his knee, just in case Batman got creative. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat could you possibly gain by making us miss our plane?\u201d Ty asked when he got tired of hearing the two of them murmur to each other. \u201cNow your ass has to ride seven hundred miles in the backseat.\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t answer him. Cameron leaned as close to him as his restraints would allow and looked to be ignoring Ty as well. Ty watched them in the rearview mirror for a moment before rolling his eyes and looking back at the doors to the store. His knee was bouncing, and he didn\u2019t try to curtail the movement. He was considering the radio when he saw Zane finally approach the car, several plastic bags hanging off each hand.</p><p>Ty reached down to pop the trunk for him as he neared the car, but he stayed put as Zane dealt with the bags. Then Zane got into the car, placing a couple of bags at his feet before shutting the door and pulling on his seat belt. \u201cVamos, compa\u00f1ero,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ty glared at him as he started the car. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Zane leaned over, dug through a bag, then pulled out a can of Red Bull and held it out in front of Ty with an enticing waggle.</p><p>Ty raised one eyebrow and smiled crookedly. He took the can with a grateful \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, really?\u201d Julian blurted from the back seat. \u201cHe\u2019s going to twitch himself through the moon roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty and Zane said simultaneously.</p> <p>In the rearview mirror, Ty saw Julian reach sideways and touch Cameron\u2019s knee. It was all the contact they could manage.</p><p>\u201cThis should prove to be a long night,\u201d Julian said a moment later. \u201cPerhaps the rest of us could be treated to coffee instead of Agent Grady\u2019s Red Bull-fueled spurts of nervous energy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee sounds good,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Cameron added.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a McDonald\u2019s after we get out of the city,\u201d Ty said. He wanted to deny the request just for the hell of it, but he couldn\u2019t think of a good reason.</p><p>After an uneventful ride on the Chicago Skyway and over an hour later, Ty pulled off at the innocuous exit to Portage, Indiana. It took a few turns and a couple of miles to find the McDonald\u2019s, but soon the four of them had their rest stop and their coffee\u2014Julian and Cameron having to make do with their hands still handcuffed. Ty had a cup of hot chocolate with molten properties, and they were on their way back to the highway.</p> <p>It was two thirty in the morning, but Ty figured he could go another couple of hours on a can of Red Bull before they would need to stop at a hotel for a rest, since Zane had to be as tired as he was. Traveling at night would be quicker and less conspicuous, and the more the two in the back slept during this trip, the better.</p><p>The first thing Ty had done after borrowing the sedan was dismantle the active GPS locator; therefore, the GPS unit on the dash was silent and dark as well. They were using an off-brand portable GPS Zane had bought at the pharmacy for directions for their cross-country trek.</p><p>\u201cFollow the yellow brick road,\u201d Zane murmured as the GPS unit chirped directions at them in a woman\u2019s voice, telling him how to get back to the toll road.</p><p>\u201cI think I love her,\u201d Ty said as he petted the GPS attached to the dash with a suction cup.</p><p>\u201cUntil she talks back,\u201d Zane said as he settled back in his seat. They were coming up on the bridge they\u2019d crossed less than ten minutes before. Close to the highway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like about her. She\u2019s bossy,\u201d Ty said with a smirk as he glanced sideways at Zane.</p><p>\u201cLike that dominatrix you interrogated last month.\u201d</p><p>Ty whistled to keep himself from laughing.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I need a psychology degree to be here,\u201d Julian muttered from the back seat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re kind of entertaining,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cOur definitions of entertaining vary wildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly do have authority issues,\u201d Zane drawled to Ty before taking a sip of coffee, ignoring Julian\u2019s and Cameron\u2019s asides.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and smiled. He was about to respond when he felt a hand come up from behind him, between the seat and door at his side. He shouted as he realized it was Julian reaching for the child-lock button on the door, but before he could grab for him to stop him, his seat belt jerked tight, pinning him to the seat and tightening over his throat. Scalding hot coffee poured over his shoulder onto his chest and lap, and the car swerved across the bridge as Ty slammed on the brakes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Zane held his sloshing coffee out in front of him and braced his free hand on the dash as the car fishtailed across the bridge before coming to a stop just feet from the guardrail.</p><p>Ty shouted as he fought to get his seat belt undone while pawing at his shirt front. He heard the back door open and struggled with simultaneously trying to get his own door open and trying to get the scalding material of his shirt off his skin.</p><p>\u201cGet him!\u201d</p><p>Zane was out of his door, and the next thing Ty heard was a gunshot, a spray of concrete, and a scream from Cameron, who had been about to climb out of the back seat to follow Julian.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Ty finally rolled out of the car. He stripped his shirt off and wiped at his chest with it as he rounded the car and took in the carnage. God, he sort of hoped Zane had shot the Irish bastard.</p><p>What he saw was Zane with his gun drawn and trained on Julian, who looked like he had stopped and frozen in midstride. Small chunks of asphalt lay scattered at his feet.</p><p>\u201cBack in the car, Cross,\u201d Zane said in absolute monotone.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and swiped at his cooling belt buckle with the coffee-soaked T-shirt. The frigid air hit his damp skin, and he began to shiver.</p><p>Julian held his hands up toward Zane and moved back to the car. \u201cNo need to get combative, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, keep talking with the Irish accent. Makes it easier to shoot you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped over and grabbed Julian, slamming him against the side of the car. He secured the handcuffs Julian had picked, making them tight enough to leave bruises if they were left on long. They would need something more, because the man was obviously too slick for a single pair of restraints. He searched Julian thoroughly, finally finding the last sliver of metal he had missed on his initial search. Once he was satisfied Julian wouldn\u2019t be escaping again, Ty gripped him by the back of his neck, helping him into the car with a not so gentle shove after Cameron scooted back inside. He banged the man\u2019s head on the top of the door, muttering a careless apology as he shoved him inside and slammed the door behind him.</p><p>He looked over the top of the sedan at Zane. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s jerky movements as he holstered his gun spoke volumes. He took a breath and twitched. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said after a long moment, though Ty knew it was partially a lie. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurned my nipples,\u201d Ty said, not able to say it without smiling.</p><p>Zane gave him a whisper of a smile, and the tension in his jaw and shoulders relaxed. \u201cOpen the trunk. I\u2019ve got something that might help that.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at him dubiously, wondering what Zane might have bought at a Walgreens that would help burned nipples\u2014and why\u2014but he decided not to ask. \u201cLet\u2019s stop for the night, okay? Just stop and regroup, figure out a better way to keep Cross tied down. We\u2019ll tackle this shit in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Burns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPriority in this mission was low profile, not speed. He made that very clear. I think it\u2019s a good call to stop.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, and Ty leaned into the car to pop the trunk like he\u2019d been asked. He looked over the seat at the two men in the back. \u201cA for effort,\u201d he told them. Cameron looked a little pale, so maybe now he knew they meant business. To this point he\u2019d been treating them like they might be just as cute and cuddly as the hired killer he called his lover.</p><p>Julian met Ty\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t show a hint of emotion or an inkling of what he was thinking. The guy made the hairs on the back of Ty\u2019s neck stand up, and he found himself putting his hand on his gun without first being aware he was doing it.</p><p>Zane dug around in the plastic bags in the trunk for a minute, then walked around the car toward Ty. He had a small plastic package in one hand and a wad of brown cloth in the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d Ty asked as he straightened. He reached out to run a hand down Zane\u2019s arm, not caring that he shouldn\u2019t when they were working. Before this morning, he hadn\u2019t seen his lover in days, had barely touched him in a week, and he knew fishtailing in the car had to have set Zane\u2019s teeth on edge. Echoes of a nasty crash that had almost killed them both would do that.</p><p>Plus, Ty didn\u2019t care if the criminals knew he and Zane were an item. It was one thing to stay hands-off for a seven-hour flight. Entirely another for a two-day drive. He was tired of being so careful that it looked like he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Zane offered him a more natural smile as he held up the plastic package. \u201cWet wipes.\u201d He then shook out the brown fabric. It was a T-shirt, and on the front it displayed a picture of a blue robot with yellow eyes and the words \u201cOverkill is one of my many modes.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and took the shirt and the wipes. \u201cThanks, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like you,\u201d Zane said before taking back the wet wipes to open the package so Ty could use them.</p><p>Ty watched him with a growing sense of calm. Just having Zane here with him was enough to keep him sane.</p><p>After pulling open the package, Zane glanced up at him. \u201cAll right, Grady. Strip down or you\u2019ll be sticky and miserable, and then we\u2019ll all be miserable.\u201d</p><p>Ty muttered at him but pulled his wet jeans off, right there on the side of the road. Several cars passing by honked at them, but this didn\u2019t even register on the scale as far as Ty\u2019s embarrassing life moments went. He put the T-shirt on, and they used his other shirt to pat down the front seat. Then they tossed his wet clothing into the trunk, where the smell of the spilled coffee wouldn\u2019t make him want to kill things. He changed into a pair of dirty jeans from the small bag he\u2019d been carrying with him and slid back into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>He sat in the silence of the car and looked into the rearview mirror. \u201cNext time he won\u2019t be aiming at you,\u201d he told Julian.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s eyes widened as he looked from Ty to Zane, but Zane was looking out the windshield rather than back at them and offered no comment.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, Agent Grady,\u201d Julian said. He didn\u2019t seem put out that his attempt had failed, nor did he seem upset with the overt threat to his lover. That bothered Ty more than he liked to admit, and the simple fact that Julian Cross made him nervous also made him angry.</p><p>And he wanted to know how the hell Julian had slipped those cuffs so quickly.</p><p>He started the car with a grunt. \u201cBuckle up,\u201d he told them, even though neither man could comply because of their handcuffs. He pulled back out into traffic with a less than gentle yank of the wheel that sent both men toppling sideways.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>CAMERON looked out the window at the Comfort Inn, thinking it looked like it had landed right out of the seventies. Two floors, dark wooden plank construction, narrower and higher windows than in newer hotels, but it seemed nice enough for being out in the middle of nowhere, northern Indiana, off the toll road. It was almost three, and Cameron was exhausted. Surely Ty and Zane were too, and after Julian\u2019s attempted escape, they didn\u2019t seem to be willing to take any chances.</p><p>He dozed some while Zane was inside arranging their room, leaning his head against Julian, who had pulled as close as he could while handcuffed to the ring on the floor. The handcuffs were something new for Cameron. He\u2019d watched in horror as Julian picked his lock in the car with a flick of his wrist and nothing more, wondering at how much practice something like that would take. His lover never ceased to amaze him with all his nefarious skills.</p><p>Cameron sometimes wondered about his own moral makeup, that something like that could sort of turn him on.</p><p>He smiled and turned his head to press his cheek against Julian\u2019s shoulder. Julian turned his chin to try to kiss the top of his head, an almost unconscious gesture, but he couldn\u2019t reach due to the way they were cuffed. He sighed, an exasperated sound that Julian rarely made, and he looked out the window, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Ty sat in the front seat, muttering to himself, his knee bouncing so quickly it was more a vibration. That Red Bull hadn\u2019t done the man much good, and it had only had an hour to wear off. Cameron was almost amused by the dichotomy of the two federal agents. Zane was so calm and steady and dark, taking things in stride, tolerantly handling any adversity that came their way until Julian\u2019s escape attempt. And then Ty seemed the complete opposite. He was wired to the sky, and he struck Cameron as a big floppy puppy, cracking jokes, attention bouncing from one thing to another, patience thin as a wafer. Ty was the Omega to Zane\u2019s Alpha.</p><p>They were both handsome, and while Zane was more Cameron\u2019s type than Ty was, there was something about Ty\u2019s rugged exterior that made him more approachable and attractive.</p><p>They certainly were the odd couple of partners, although Zane was the one who felt like a threat to Cameron now that he\u2019d been exposed to them both. Julian obviously felt the same way. Cameron could still feel the tension invested in his tall frame. \u201cCan\u2019t you relax just a little? You\u2019re so wound up,\u201d he whispered, looking up at Julian.</p><p>Julian turned and cocked his head to meet his eyes, then smiled. \u201cNo more than usual,\u201d he murmured, his voice low and gruff.</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d Cameron said, wishing he could get close enough to touch him with something besides his foot or his nose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. Just do as they tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cQuit with the whispering,\u201d Ty said in a sharp voice.</p><p>Cameron could see the reflection of his eyes in the rearview mirror, looking back at them. \u201cSo you can scoff at us for having a quiet moment? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said with a sniff as he tried to cuddle closer against Julian.</p><p>\u201cKid, I don\u2019t think you really understand the situation, here, so let me make it perfectly clear,\u201d Ty said, voice going harder and hazel eyes flashing with anger. \u201cYou and your boyfriend are federal prisoners, and you do exactly what we tell you, when we tell you, without the attitude and without the cute little remarks. One coffee in my lap is all the free pass you get, and we don\u2019t have to fucking be nice about it. You whisper, I leave you on the side of the road and he rolls in the trunk. Got it?\u201d</p> <p>Cameron stared, wide-eyed. He nodded, suitably chastised and feeling stupid for his forays into the acerbic. He looked up at Julian. \u201cDo you think Zane would really have shot you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Julian said, sounding confident. Ty was nodding in the front seat as he looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was the nice one,\u201d Cameron said under his breath.</p><p>Julian put his lips to Cameron\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cNext time I\u2019ll dump the coffee on him instead.\u201d</p><p>Cameron sighed in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re deliberately causing trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Julian shushed him as he glanced toward the front seat. Ty was rolling his eyes and rubbing at his temple. Cameron shifted closer to Julian and tilted his head until they could push their mouths together for a small kiss. Julian whispered against Cameron\u2019s lips, turning his head to hide the movement of his mouth from the mirror. \u201cWe have to get away from them before we reach Washington,\u201d he murmured. He kissed Cameron again to mask the words.</p><p>The kiss made Cameron\u2019s pulse race, just like Julian\u2019s touch always did. Cameron hummed to let Julian know he understood. He cursed the handcuffs; he wanted to shift himself further into Julian\u2019s arms and wished he could crawl into his lap, Ty watching be damned. He felt Julian smile against his lips. He\u2019d obviously picked up on Cameron\u2019s desire to do so.</p><p>\u201cChrist, please stop,\u201d Ty said from the front seat, voice plaintive.</p><p>Cameron pulled back and smiled at Julian.</p><p>Julian was looking at him in the same adoring way he always did, but he was also smirking. There was a hint of malicious enjoyment in his black eyes. \u201cDo you object to all public displays of affection, Agent Grady? Or is it the fact that we\u2019re both men?\u201d he asked without looking away from Cameron.</p><p>Ty answered with the loud slide action of his 9mm service weapon. \u201cIf you really must know, I\u2019m of the opinion that it\u2019s rude to make out in a man\u2019s backseat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, technically, it\u2019s not your backseat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the road too long and I miss getting laid in my own bed. Don\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>Julian laughed and kissed Cameron again for good measure. Cameron shook his head afterward and settled down, turning a somewhat apologetic look toward Ty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been away from home so long,\u201d he said, sincere. He wouldn\u2019t apologize for the kisses though.</p><p>\u201cMy own fault,\u201d Ty said, voice curt.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cameron could see Ty\u2019s eyes in the mirror, looking at him evilly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too sober for you, Jiminy Cricket,\u201d Ty muttered. He looked out the window again and shook his head.</p><p>Julian hummed. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose asking for a separate room would go over well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Ty said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with two beds,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cCan you see Ty and Zane getting any sleep in a double bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy and Zane will be just fine,\u201d Ty said in a falsely cheerful voice. \u201cCross will be sleeping in handcuffs on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinky,\u201d Julian said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cameron asked, sitting up, peering at Ty through narrowed eyes.</p><p>Ty held up a third pair of handcuffs that clinked as he waved them.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Cameron said with a frown. So much for a comfortable night.</p><p>The passenger door popped open and a cold blast of wind assaulted them. Zane leaned over to peer inside at his partner. \u201cYou can just park right here. We\u2019re going in the front and up to the second floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took so long?\u201d Ty asked. If Zane was surprised to see Ty sitting there with his gun and his handcuffs in his lap, he didn\u2019t show it. It made Cameron wonder about the sanity of both men.</p><p>\u201cIt took her ten minutes to decide they didn\u2019t have any connecting rooms available. So, one room,\u201d Zane said as he gathered the bags out of the floorboard.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Ty muttered as he pushed open his door and got out of the car.</p><p>Julian ducked his head to peer out the window at them. \u201cLuck is with us tonight,\u201d he whispered to Cameron.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith one room it will be easier to disable them and get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill them, are you?\u201d Cameron asked, shifting uneasily in the seat. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re just doing their jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless they make me,\u201d Julian said as he looked back at Cameron. \u201cThe threat from Grady is negligible, but Garrett will kill both of us if he thinks he\u2019s justified. Remember that before you get too attached to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always tell me I trust too easily,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHe just seemed like such a... nice guy.\u201d He shivered, though, remembering how Zane\u2019s face had been so cold and blank as he\u2019d shot the asphalt at Julian\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not. Neither of them are.\u201d</p><p>His words were punctuated by Ty opening the back door and waving at Julian. \u201cCome on, O\u2019Doul.\u201d</p><p>That worried Cameron a lot, to think that men in law enforcement could be as bad as the criminals they chased. Not that he thought of himself and Julian as criminals, although technically, he supposed Julian really was. Or used to be. Or might have been.</p><p>As he climbed out of the car, he watched Zane, the wind riffling his hair, his gun gripped in a gloved hand. Cameron\u2019s eyes shifted to his lover. Julian and Zane looked similar enough that it was a little eerie in the harsh parking lot lights\u2014tall, broad-shouldered, dark-haired....</p><p>When Ty stalked around the car to join his partner, all gruff attitude, hard muscle, and broad shoulders, Cameron barely quashed the urge to cringe away. He and Julian were in more trouble than he wanted to believe, and now he felt really stupid for ever joking around with the two men.</p><p>Ty pushed Julian against the car, a hand in the center of his shoulders, and he kept the hand there as he turned to face Zane. Zane stepped closer until they were right in front of each other. Each kept his eyes over the other\u2019s shoulder\u2014Zane watching Julian, Ty watching Cameron and the parking lot\u2014as they spoke. Ty tilted his head so he was murmuring into Zane\u2019s ear. It had an oddly intimate feel as they stood there, and Julian was craning his head to watch them. Cameron wondered if he could make out anything they were saying.</p><p>Whatever they\u2019d been discussing was decided, and Ty patted Zane\u2019s belly before stepping away from Julian and moving toward Cameron. \u201cCome on, kid, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said as he held his hand out toward Cameron, waving him forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Julian?\u201d Cameron asked, dragging his feet.</p><p>\u201cHe and Zane are going to get to know each other down here. Come on,\u201d Ty said as he moved a step closer and took Cameron\u2019s elbow. He didn\u2019t tug on him, though, appearing willing to give him a chance to go of his own accord.</p><p>Cameron looked from Julian to Zane and back before nodding reluctantly. \u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured. Ty handed him his bag and shouldered his own as they started walking toward the front door.</p><p>When they got to the entrance, Cameron glanced back over his shoulder to where Julian and Zane still stood next to the car.</p><p>Julian had turned around, and he stood with his cuffed hands clasped in front of him. He nodded at Cameron.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay,\u201d Ty said in an oddly gentle voice as he pulled the door open and held it for Cameron.</p><p>Cameron didn\u2019t feel reassured, but he walked inside anyway. The interior of the hotel had the same feel as the exterior: too much brass, too much glass, and way too much disco fever.</p><p>They passed the front desk and headed on to the large set of stairs in the center of the entry hall. There was no elevator. Ty led him to the room just to the right of the steps and keyed the electronic lock, then pulled Cameron into the room as he flipped on the light.</p><p>Cameron couldn\u2019t think of a reason Ty would bring him up here alone unless Zane was going to do something to Julian. \u201cAren\u2019t they coming up too?\u201d he asked as he stood just inside the door.</p><p>\u201cAfter we\u2019re done,\u201d Ty said in an offhanded manner. The door closed behind them, and Ty pulled Cameron further into the room, turning on lights as he went.</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d Cameron felt a pang of alarm. Maybe Ty was going to do something to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sit down,\u201d Ty said, distracted as he pointed at one of the two beds in the room and looked around. He walked to the window and peered out, then pulled the heavy curtains closed.</p><p>Cameron frowned but perched on the foot of the bed closest to the door as he tracked Ty\u2019s movement through the room.</p><p>Ty inspected the window and its frame before crouching to look at the air conditioning unit under it. He gripped the face of the unit and tugged at it. He picked up the chair and pushed at the small desk in the corner. He shoved at the miniature refrigerator with his toes and got down on the ground to look at the bottom of the safe attached to the wall. He turned the television on its swiveling stand, pulled out all the drawers in the room, plucked out the Bible, and flipped through the pages. He turned to look at Cameron as he held the book upside down and shook it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Cameron asked. \u201cI thought the Red Bull was wearing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for something solid. And I\u2019m making sure there\u2019s nothing in here your boyfriend can use to kill or maim us,\u201d Ty said as he dropped the Bible back in the drawer. He knelt just behind Cameron and looked under each bed, then he slid his hands under the mattress.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need anything to kill or maim you,\u201d Cameron said as he realized he felt uncomfortable with Ty kneeling so close to him.</p><p>Rather than being impressed or intimidated, Ty just laughed. \u201cI know,\u201d he said as he pushed himself to his feet.</p><p>\u201cSo why bother with the search?\u201d</p><p>Ty sat down beside him on the double bed, too close to him. Yeah, he definitely made Cameron uncomfortable, like patrons at the restaurant that got too flirtatious. Only Ty hadn\u2019t done anything even remotely like that, so Cameron couldn\u2019t figure out what it was that made him uneasy. Maybe Ty was just one of those people who exuded that sort of feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou ever seen two big dogs fight over a bone?\u201d</p><p>Cameron shrank back. \u201cNo. But I know what you\u2019re getting at.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cIn theory, the one with the spikes on his collar has the advantage. But really it\u2019s the one who ain\u2019t worried about protecting a puppy hiding behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now I\u2019m a puppy.\u201d Then it hit him. \u201cWait. You\u2019re not talking about you, are you? You\u2019re talking about them, out there alone, fighting over... something?\u201d Cameron\u2019s voice had risen as he started to panic.</p><p>Ty shook his head and began rubbing at the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s a general metaphor. Don\u2019t take it literally,\u201d he said, but then he waved his hand. \u201cLook, all I\u2019m saying is you coming with him, it put him at a disadvantage. But you keep your dog on a leash, I\u2019ll keep mine on one too.\u201d</p><p>Cameron looked at him, uneasy. Then he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and stood.</p><p>The nerves faded once Ty wasn\u2019t beside him anymore. Yeah, it was definitely just a feeling Ty gave off.</p><p>Ty took his phone out of his pocket and dialed. Then he said, \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d He looked down at Cameron as he put the phone away. \u201cYou\u2019ll have that bed. Don\u2019t move,\u201d he said as he turned and headed toward the bathroom.</p><p>Cameron opened his mouth to object but swallowed it instead, shaking his head as Ty disappeared into the bathroom. The handcuffs comment made sense now. Well, he was in for a surprise, then, because if Julian ended up sitting on the floor handcuffed to a table leg or safe or mini refrigerator, then Cameron would be sitting right there next to him.</p><p>Cameron mulled over what Ty had said, and the unusual discomfort of the situation, until the door to the room opened and Julian walked in. He still appeared calm and stoic, but Cameron recognized the tension in his shoulders. As soon as he saw Cameron, though, he relaxed. Obviously he\u2019d been having the same flashes of alarm Cameron had experienced when Ty took him up here alone, and that made Cameron feel both a little better and a little worse.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice chat?\u201d Cameron asked, putting on a smile he didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was enlightening,\u201d Julian said, drawling the words out in amusement.</p><p>He took a step toward Cameron, but Ty appeared out of the bathroom before Julian could get past the door, and snapped the spare handcuffs onto one of Julian\u2019s wrists. Then he grabbed the back of Julian\u2019s coat, almost as if he were scruffing a cat, and dragged him into the bathroom. There was a brief and noisy struggle, complete with bangs and crashes, during which Cameron heard Julian say a few choice words he\u2019d never heard his lover utter. A few moments later, Ty stepped out of the bathroom, primly adjusting his clothing as he gave Zane a dashing smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane\u2019s lips were pressed together hard. Cameron would have sworn that he was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cSecure?\u201d Zane asked with difficulty.</p><p>\u201cUnless he decides to rip the shower enclosure out of the wall... yes.\u201d</p> <p>After hearing what had come out of Julian\u2019s mouth, Cameron wasn\u2019t too sure Ty should be so happy with himself.</p><p>Julian\u2019s dry voice drifted out of the bathroom. \u201cYou\u2019re an imbecile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I ain\u2019t handcuffed to a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to sit with Julian,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said in a pleasant voice.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Cameron asked, standing and holding up his handcuffed hands.</p><p>\u201cBecause we fucking said so,\u201d Ty said. \u201cGet in bed. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged out of his coat and hung it in the closet before picking up his duffel. \u201cYou get in bed too,\u201d he told Ty with a jerk of his head toward the second bed. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at Zane as if he wanted to object, but he kept his mouth shut. He stripped off the T-shirt he\u2019d changed into earlier and toed off his boots. He fell into the bed in just his jeans and burrowed his head under one of the pillows. He reminded Cameron of a very large dog throwing itself to the ground to take a nap.</p><p>He wondered how Ty planned to just go to sleep on command after drinking an entire Red Bull, but as he watched, Ty didn\u2019t move, and soon his breathing evened out. Cameron stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep,\u201d he said without thinking.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he does that.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t seem to be paying either of them much attention; he\u2019d moved to the table in the corner and was pulling a stack of papers out of his messenger bag. He sat in the corner, running his hand through his hair to leave it unruly, fingers playing with his beard as he got to work. He looked a little more relaxed but still dark and dangerous. Rakish, even.</p><p>The gun went on the table right next to the papers. Only then did he glance back up at Cameron and raise an eyebrow.</p><p>Cameron wondered if it was too late to ask for a bathroom break.</p><p>AFTER an hour of writing down notes by hand, Zane caught himself staring across the room at Ty, who was sprawled on the bed nearest the bathroom, head under a pillow, body loose and relaxed. Zane doubted he was; Ty usually knew where he was even asleep. He could only remember one or two occasions when he\u2019d done something while Ty was asleep and hadn\u2019t woken him.</p><p>Just being able to see him was reassuring in ways Zane would have avoided exploring in the past, but now he could admit why. He loved his exasperating partner beyond all reason. He saw him as a lifeline he had desperately needed, an inspiration in so many ways.</p><p>Several minutes passed before Zane tore his gaze away from Ty\u2019s half-naked body to glance around the room. Cameron was asleep as well, curled up under the blanket in the other bed. He looked young and innocent, though he couldn\u2019t really be, what with spending so much time with a man such as Julian Cross. Zane looked to the bathroom. It had been quiet in there as well. With a sigh, he pushed back from the table to stand and stretch. He had kinks all up and down his back after the flight and the car ride combined with the tension of the situation.</p><p>\u201cCome lay down,\u201d Ty murmured in a low, hoarse voice, muffled by the thin pillow. He hadn\u2019t moved. Zane wondered how he did that sometimes, sensed things without seeing them. Zane had never mastered that art, even while being blinded from his injury several weeks ago.</p> <p>Zane glanced at Cameron before walking over to stand at Ty\u2019s bedside and lifting the pillow off his head. \u201cYou should be asleep,\u201d he said as he set his gun on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not,\u201d Ty whispered. \u201cCome lay down with me.\u201d</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t going to pass on a second request, not while all was quiet. He moved around to the foot of the bed and crawled up beside him, settling on his side and scooting up against Ty to lie in the crook of his arm. When he settled his cheek on Ty\u2019s shoulder, he felt a warm calm soak into him as he pressed close to Ty\u2019s exposed skin.</p><p>Ty growled and rolled, wrapping Zane up in his arms. \u201cYou need rest,\u201d he said. He lowered his voice and moved his lips against Zane\u2019s skin. \u201cAnd I need you.\u201d</p><p>Zane slid his arm up and around Ty\u2019s neck as Ty pulled him close. It was about four a.m., and he\u2019d been awake for almost twenty-four hours. But being this close to Ty after days apart wasn\u2019t conducive to sleep. \u201cBaby,\u201d he whispered against Ty\u2019s throat before pressing his lips to the soft, warm skin.</p><p>Ty hummed and ran his hand up and down Zane\u2019s side, tugging at his shirt. He pushed his chin forward and kissed him. Zane sighed against his lips and inhaled Ty\u2019s scent, letting it flood through him. The sandalwood was still there, and Zane would have to remember to ask where it had come from. It was intoxicating, and he was barely hanging on to the thought that one of their prisoners was sleeping not even ten feet away. But one kiss\u2014just one\u2014he had to have it, and he tightened his arm around Ty\u2019s neck to deepen it.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands gripped him hard, and he pushed Zane back just enough to be able to kiss him harder. \u201cIs that kid asleep?\u201d he asked in a quiet rush.</p><p>\u201cSeems to be,\u201d Zane said under his breath as he tried to recapture Ty\u2019s lips. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d But he pawed at Ty anyway.</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d His name was no more than Ty\u2019s breath against his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t care if we should or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I thought we got this out of our systems,\u201d Zane whispered, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment as his gut clenched with desire.</p><p>Ty kissed him again, pulling him until their bodies touched all over. \u201cWe can be quiet.\u201d</p><p>Zane had to smother his laugh in Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cNo we can\u2019t,\u201d he muttered with absolute certainty.</p><p>Ty pulled back and looked at him with one eyebrow raised. \u201cNot even a little?\u201d he asked with true disappointment.</p><p>\u201cA little? You think I\u2019m going to stop at just a little?\u201d Zane shook his head and kissed Ty. He ached for Ty, inside and out, but this just wasn\u2019t the time. A professional hit man was locked up in the bathroom, and another prisoner was in the next bed. It would have been comedic if it didn\u2019t suck so much. \u201cI want you more than anything,\u201d he murmured against Ty\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t possibly imagine all the things I\u2019m going to do to you. But for that, we need to be at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d Ty pulled his head back and sighed.</p><p>Zane nodded regretfully. \u201cBut for now we have this,\u201d he whispered, burrowing in close.</p><p>Ty sighed again and pulled Zane closer, scooting up until he could rest his chin on top of Zane\u2019s head and Zane was snuggled up against his chest. \u201cGo to sleep if I can\u2019t grope you. I\u2019ll stay awake.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted but didn\u2019t twitch a muscle to move. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a pretty picture for Cameron to see if he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Ty held his breath for a few moments and then let it out in an irritated rush. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand out from under Zane\u2019s neck and rolled over, and then sat up and rolled his head from side to side. The immediate chill made Zane shiver, and he wrapped his arms around himself, watching Ty. He wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. He didn\u2019t want to sleep. He wanted to be awake, to soak Ty in. He reached out to trail his fingers down Ty\u2019s arm.</p><p>Ty turned his arm and let Zane\u2019s fingers glide over his palm. He pushed himself off the bed and stretched, then turned and leaned over Zane, pulling the comforter up over him as he kissed him. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed, warmed by Ty\u2019s quiet affection, and reached for his gun. Then he pulled one of the pillows partway under his chest and tucked the hand holding the gun underneath it, a security measure made second nature after his time undercover in the seedy Miami underbelly. Even the past several months sleeping unarmed with Ty hadn\u2019t made the position feel strange. \u201cDon\u2019t kill Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises,\u201d Ty muttered. He moved away and clicked off the light Zane had been using.</p><p>It made the room mostly dark, just the light spilling under the room door to see by, and Zane watched Ty\u2019s silhouette for long minutes before closing his eyes. He\u2019d just rest for a little bit.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he slept, but there was gray light coming through the curtains when a noise awakened him.</p><p>There was a bang and a rattle like plastic rolling across tile, and then Ty shouted: \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>Zane was out of the bed and at the bathroom door, gun in hand, in three seconds flat, pulse racing.</p><p>Ty stood in the middle of the bathroom, glaring down at Julian and holding a roll of toilet paper in his hand. Julian sat in the bathtub, handcuffed to the safety rail on the shower enclosure. He was looking at Ty like he thought he had lost his mind. Zane narrowed his eyes as he sized up the scene. He glanced at the wall where the toilet paper should have been, then back at Ty\u2019s hands, before turning a questioning look on Julian.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Ty said again.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re blathering on about,\u201d Julian said, the epitome of calm. \u201cAgent Garrett, I believe he needs more rest. Or perhaps it\u2019s time for his medication,\u201d he said, mimicking someone drinking.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Where\u2019s what?\u201d Zane asked as he studied Julian and the cuffs. They looked intact.</p><p>Ty whirled around to look at him. His entire body was tense. His eyes were a sparkling green, and they flashed angrily. Zane\u2019s breath caught before he could help himself. His partner was stunning when he was like this. \u201cThe toilet paper holder,\u201d Ty said in quick bursts of words. He turned back on Julian. \u201cHand it over or I\u2019ll search for it myself.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced around again, and he caught sight of the two plastic halves of the holder on the floor behind the toilet and next to the sink. He looked back at Julian and had to repress a smile. The man was clever, and an excellent liar. Zane didn\u2019t figure he would have thought of that himself. \u201cYou took the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to take the spring, but it didn\u2019t have one,\u201d Julian told him. He didn\u2019t seem at all perturbed to have been caught.</p><p>Ty growled and reached into the tub to grab Julian\u2019s neck and yank him to his feet.</p><p>Zane put his hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou can\u2019t just strip him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d Ty said, and he pushed Julian face-first against the shower wall, then stepped into the tub with him.</p><p>Julian cleared his throat as he tried to reposition his hands in a way that his wrists weren\u2019t being torqued by the handcuffs, but he didn\u2019t protest the rough treatment.</p><p>Zane was torn between the urge to laugh and the more professional need to pull Ty off their prisoner. He also wasn\u2019t fond of watching Ty manhandle anyone like that unless it was him. He realized he was more tired than he\u2019d thought if the sight of Ty searching a criminal had him jealous.</p><p>\u201cGrady.\u201d</p><p>Ty was already patting Julian down. Quite thoroughly. He glanced back at Zane and jerked his head. He continued the pat down, and Julian moved his head so he could glance over his shoulder at them. He didn\u2019t show any emotion, merely looked at Ty.</p><p>\u201cIn most countries you\u2019d have to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>Zane stifled a sigh and took a step back. It wasn\u2019t exactly kosher, what Ty was doing, but the assignment gave them unusual latitude to deal with such a dangerous asset. And maybe it would help Ty work off some of that extra energy. He turned in the doorway to glance out into the main room. Cameron was sitting up, turned toward the bathroom, peering Zane\u2019s way with a worried look on his face.</p><p>Zane heard Ty whuff from within the bathroom, and by the time he looked back, Ty had shoved Julian\u2019s face against the shower wall and was holding him there by the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cWatch the elbows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your fingers,\u201d Julian snapped.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to TSA training, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant the other set of cuffs?\u201d Zane asked, hoping to appease his cranky partner. \u201cYou could spread his arms out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill someone please tell me the safe word?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>Zane snorted and leaned against the door, but he was watching Ty carefully. Something about Julian seemed to rub him wrong, and Ty\u2019s short patience was nonexistent with this man.</p><p>A moment later Ty reached around and slid his fingers under his belt.</p><p>\u201cAgent Garrett, I really must protest,\u201d Julian said, though his voice was still calm.</p><p>Yeah, Zane wanted to protest too. Too much of Ty\u2019s bare skin was too close to another man for Zane\u2019s taste.</p><p>Julian started to speak again, but his words were choked off as Ty moved his hand further under his belt. Julian did react then, throwing his head to the side and beginning to fight as Ty pulled at the waistband of his pants.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Ty yanked something out of Julian\u2019s pants and held it up. It was a long, thin piece of metal. It had once been a spiral, but it had been straightened out. Julian cursed. Ty put a hand in the center of his back and shoved him against the wall, holding him there as he stepped out of the shower.</p><p>\u201cBravo,\u201d Zane said, shaking his head. He wasn\u2019t sure whom he was congratulating, though.</p><p>Ty waved the straightened spring at him and then tossed it into the sink on the other side of the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cClever bastard,\u201d Julian muttered, sounding almost amused. \u201cDo you have any idea how difficult that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this what the whole trip is going to be like?\u201d Zane asked with a wave of his gun at the spring.</p><p>\u201cI would wager so, yes,\u201d Julian said with a nod. \u201cPerhaps if you allowed me\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty snapped. \u201cSit down, shut up, stop trying to escape.\u201d He turned to Zane. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded toward the open room.</p><p>\u201cGo get him.\u201d</p> <p>That got Julian\u2019s attention. He straightened, still standing in the bathtub, and he pulled at the handcuffs that looped around the safety bar. \u201cNo need to bring him into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought him into this,\u201d Zane said. He took two steps out of the room and waved Cameron over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Cameron asked as he climbed off the bed and moved to join Zane at the door.</p><p>Ty stepped to the side so Cameron could see Julian. They hadn\u2019t let Cameron see him at all since locking him in the bathroom, and now Cameron\u2019s brow creased as he took in the scene. Zane knew it was a disturbing image, Julian disheveled, standing in the bathtub cuffed to the shower rail, and Ty bare-chested and fuming.</p><p>\u201cJulian? Are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>Julian smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, love. Agent Grady just needed a cuddle. And possibly a piece of my spleen.\u201d</p><p>Ty held up the piece of metal and tapped it against the sink counter. Cameron looked from it to Julian and back. He didn\u2019t look like he was making the connection.</p><p>\u201cWhen we left you said the only way you\u2019d come along without a fuss was with your boyfriend,\u201d Ty said, but it wasn\u2019t clear which one he was talking to since he was looking at the floor near his feet. \u201cBut since you\u2019re making a fuss anyway, I don\u2019t see why we have to hold up our end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>Julian raised his chin and his black eyes flashed, but he didn\u2019t react otherwise. When Zane had first seen Julian\u2019s reaction to Cameron in the apartment, he\u2019d been sure Cameron would be the best way to control him. It was a combination of how the man softened when he looked at his lover but bristled, even the tiniest bit, when there was any threat toward him.</p><p>Cameron looked back and forth between them as if he was watching a tennis match. Zane had to admire how he seemed to be holding up under the stress. Many civilians would have fallen apart by now, especially in the face of Ty\u2019s impressive rage. \u201cJulian?\u201d His voice was low and cautious.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him, talk to me,\u201d he said to Cameron in a low, barely controlled voice that would have scared just about anyone. It almost scared Zane. It did the trick, because Cameron shrank away from him even as he looked at him. Ty pushed away from the sink and stepped toward Cameron, holding up the spring. \u201cHe tries one more time to escape, and I promise you, you\u2019ll never see each other again.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron stared at him, eyes wide and chest heaving as he breathed hard.</p><p>\u201cNow, go whisper about that some,\u201d Ty said, voice downright cruel.</p><p>Cameron had gone white, and Zane caught a tremble in his hands before he gripped them into fists. But he nodded jerkily. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Ty said, and he stepped out of the bathroom. He pulled Zane with him and closed the door behind them.</p><p>Zane turned and went along as Ty walked toward the window. If that wasn\u2019t enough to calm Julian down, they\u2019d have to tranquilize him.</p><p>They might have to tranquilize Ty too, if what Zane had just seen wasn\u2019t an act of some sort.</p><p>Ty paced toward the window and then turned back to Zane, looking troubled and no longer even remotely angry. Zane was impressed by his lover\u2019s ability to turn that on and off so quickly. He\u2019d known Ty was a chameleon based on his performance as an Englishman on that cruise ship job they\u2019d worked, but Zane had never seen Ty turn emotions on and off like that. \u201cI feel like a monster, threatening that kid.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised one brow, surprised. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>Ty looked at him oddly. \u201cBecause he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Because he\u2019s got stars in his eyes, and he can\u2019t help it that he\u2019s in love with that jackhole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe chose to be here. He had to know what he was getting into. I can\u2019t imagine living with Cross is good for anyone\u2019s health.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and looked down at the mangled spring. He spun it around between his fingers. \u201cThis guy, man. If he\u2019d been able to retie his shoelaces, I\u2019d have never noticed,\u201d he said in disgust as he tossed the wire into the trash.</p><p>Zane shook his head and set his gun on the dresser in front of the TV, in easy reach. \u201cHe used his toes to get to it?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>\u201cClever. Like someone else I know.\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at him before the expression softened. \u201cPlease don\u2019t compare me to the criminal.\u201d</p><p>Zane watched him affectionately. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, Cameron will keep him in line from now on.\u201d</p><p>Glancing back at the bathroom door, Zane set his hands on his hips as he considered. \u201cMaybe if we leave them together in there another few hours, we could get some more sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cSleep. We\u2019ll leave them to it.\u201d He grabbed up his shirt from the floor and pulled it over his head, then stepped over to Zane and kissed him. Zane took advantage of the chance, though, and slid his hands under the shirt before Ty even got it pulled all the way down.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy patting down Cross?\u201d Zane asked before nipping at Ty\u2019s earlobe.</p><p>Ty grunted distractedly, not picking up on Zane\u2019s teasing tone. \u201cHe got me a good one in the ribs. It\u2019s like he has extra hands.\u201d</p><p>Zane moved to slide his hands over Ty\u2019s ribs. \u201cYou bested him, though,\u201d he murmured, dragging his arm around Ty\u2019s waist and pulling their bodies flush.</p><p>Ty pushed away and looked at him oddly again. He shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a pissing contest, Zane. I just want to get rid of him as quick as we can. Guy makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can tell,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cYou saying he doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d put you up against him any day.\u201d He dropped his chin, rubbing his bearded cheek against Ty\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to start something out here?\u201d Ty asked in a warm voice.</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d Zane muttered, splaying his hand flat along Ty\u2019s shoulder blades and rubbing the warm skin.</p><p>Ty kissed his cheek and moved away. \u201cThen cut it out. And shave that damn thing off in the morning, huh?\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed, but he allowed Ty to push him away. He wanted to be close, but they couldn\u2019t get distracted. Muttering under his breath, he walked over to the desk and his papers.</p><p>Ty went to the bathroom door and leaned against it, sliding to the floor with a soft groan. He was apparently intending to sit there the rest of the morning. After a roll of his eyes, Zane snatched up a pillow and flung it at him.</p><p>A moment later, he heard Ty\u2019s soft \u201cThanks, Zane.\u201d</p><p>JULIAN was surprised when the two FBI agents left Cameron with him in the bathroom. But he knew what they were thinking, and on the surface it made sense. He tugged at the handcuffs and raised one hand toward Cameron.</p><p>His lover climbed into the bathtub next to him and slid their hands together, lacing their fingers. \u201cHave you been stuck like this all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was sitting,\u201d Julian answered, keeping his tone light. He slid the chain up the diagonal safety rail and spread his arms as wide as they would go, gesturing for Cameron to duck under. Cameron did, moving to stand in the circle of Julian\u2019s arms and reaching up to slide his hands around Julian\u2019s neck, tipping his head back to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cAside from threatening you, how have they been treating you?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. Haven\u2019t said a word to me, really. I was sleeping until I heard Ty yell at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just overly excitable.\u201d Julian kissed him. It was hard to pull him closer with the safety bar restraining his arms like it was. \u201cAre you going to give me my lecture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need to?\u201d Cameron asked, meeting his eyes.</p><p>Julian sighed and looked over at the door. \u201cIf we make it to DC, we\u2019ll never see each other again anyway.\u201d He looked into Cameron\u2019s eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re using threats to you to keep me under control. But if I\u2019m reading them correctly, Grady won\u2019t hurt either of us unless we force him, and he won\u2019t let Garrett hurt you. Nothing is a bigger threat than what they\u2019re delivering us to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Julian hesitated. He had spent most of their time together trying to shield Cameron from the worst of it. But now they were being dragged across the country, possibly to their deaths. Cameron deserved to know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the CIA, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCIA? I thought Ty and Zane were FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what they are. But it\u2019s sure as hell not the FBI who wants to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Cameron\u2019s arms tightened around Julian\u2019s neck. \u201cI won\u2019t let them take you away from me if I can do anything to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look intimidated and docile whenever they threaten you. Let them think it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to act,\u201d Cameron murmured as he laid his cheek against Julian\u2019s chest. \u201cThey are intimidating.\u201d</p><p>Julian snorted before he could stop himself. He cleared his throat to cover it. He leaned back and looked down at Cameron. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing anything sharp or pointy, by any chance, are you?\u201d</p><p>Cameron frowned and let his arms slide down. \u201cSharp or pointy? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He looked down at himself. He didn\u2019t wear jewelry\u2014the only jewelry Julian had ever seen him wear was the Warrior\u2019s Cross pendant Julian had given him when they\u2019d first met. But that necklace was long gone.</p><p>\u201cZippers? Shoelaces?\u201d Julian asked as he looked down Cameron\u2019s body. He wasn\u2019t wearing shoes. And in reality, Julian couldn\u2019t imagine that he could manage to pick the lock with a zipper pull. \u201cDamn, that spring was so perfect,\u201d he muttered in irritation.</p><p>\u201cYou about got yourself shot. Zane was up out of that bed with that gun so fast, it scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he\u2019s not accustomed to Grady shouting at random for no reason. They sleep with their weapons? That\u2019s good to know. If one of them is going to try to kill me, it will be Garrett. But no worries,\u201d he said as he pulled Cameron as close as he could. \u201cWe\u2019ll get out of this.\u201d</p><p>Cameron leaned against him again, tucking his head under Julian\u2019s chin. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re such a good liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain whether that\u2019s a compliment or an insult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Cameron said before tipping his head back again and kissing Julian\u2019s chin.</p><p>Julian grinned. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Cameron gave him a tremulous smile. \u201cI know. I love you too.\u201d He went up on tiptoe to kiss Julian fervently.</p><p>Julian had to bend to indulge in the kiss since he couldn\u2019t pull Cameron closer. He smiled against Cameron\u2019s lips. \u201cWe\u2019ve never tried this with handcuffs,\u201d he said in a suggestive, teasing voice.</p><p>Cameron laughed. \u201cInteresting idea. You can\u2019t pick me up, flip me over, or hold me down.\u201d He opened his eyes, and they sparkled mischievously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d</p><p>The arched eyebrow Cameron gave him in reply was a clear dare, and Cameron\u2019s hands sliding down his chest to his belt buckle even more so.</p><p>Julian\u2019s smile was predatory as he stepped closer and pushed Cameron against the shower wall. He gasped and looked down between them. \u201cMy belt!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked, plucking at it.</p><p>\u201cThey left it on me,\u201d Julian told him with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSo, that means I can put it in your mouth for you to bite on in a couple minutes?\u201d</p><p>That got Julian\u2019s attention, and he looked back up with a grin. \u201cDo you care if we make noise and they know what we\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>A blush crept up Cameron\u2019s cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make a difference in what they do with us, right?\u201d His fingers manipulated Julian\u2019s belt buckle as he looked up into Julian\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this really stupid?\u201d Cameron licked his lips as he unbuttoned Julian\u2019s pants.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing stupid in this room is sitting outside our door,\u201d Julian said, raising his voice just enough.</p><p>\u201cBlow me, Cross,\u201d came Ty\u2019s disembodied voice from outside the door.</p><p>TY PRESSED his shoulders against the door to stretch his sore muscles, and he let his bare feet slide on the carpet until his legs were splayed in front of him. He sat there without any compunction about looking dejected in the dark.</p><p>Once he heard the unmistakable sounds coming from within the bathroom, he grunted in annoyance and rolled to his hands and knees to get off the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do they think this is, some stupidass romantic comedy?\u201d he growled to Zane. He called through the door, \u201cI have a gun and I like to use it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only going to egg Cross on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Ty mumbled as he walked toward the two beds. \u201cHe reminds me of you. Parts of him, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up from the papers. The soft glow of the table lamp cast odd shadows, making his face appear gaunt. \u201cOf me? How? Besides Cameron\u2019s \u2018tall, dark, and handsome\u2019 line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean he\u2019s outwardly stoic and fun to poke. Reminds me of when we first met.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and leaned back in his chair. \u201cMuch better than what you said about me back then.\u201d</p><p>Ty moved closer and sat on the edge of the bed near Zane, looking at him with nothing but affection. He was close enough to smell Zane\u2019s deodorant and the underlying scents of his shampoo and sweat, and combined with the trademark smells of a hotel room, it stirred all sorts of memories and emotions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou ever think about that first week?\u201d he asked with a fond smile.</p><p>\u201cSome parts of it, yeah,\u201d Zane said, edging up one shoulder as he spun the chair so he faced Ty, their knees bumping. \u201cUsually when you\u2019re being particularly frustrating.\u201d He tipped his head to one side as his eyes raked Ty up and down. \u201cOr particularly desirable.\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned forward. \u201cThose couple of days in that hotel room with you,\u201d he said, voice low and intimate, \u201cevery time I looked at you I got butterflies. I couldn\u2019t decide if it was a good feeling or if I hated you for it.\u201d</p> <p>Zane chuckled. \u201cOh, I was damn sure you hated me. And it was certainly reciprocated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really hate me?\u201d Ty asked, not necessarily offended, but curious.</p><p>\u201cTo immense proportions,\u201d Zane said with a nod, but then he rolled his eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t last, though. You were....\u201d He drew in a deep breath and held it as he considered his words. He ended up shrugging. \u201cHurricane Ty. Blew me away.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s smile grew warmer, and he reached out to take Zane\u2019s hand in his. \u201cSometimes I wish we could go back there and smack ourselves in the heads. But then I remind myself it wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\u201d</p><p>Zane squeezed his hand. \u201cFor me, there was no going back after you kissed me.\u201d</p> <p>Ty looked up from their joined hands and met Zane\u2019s eyes. On his mini sabbatical he\u2019d begun pondering what life might be like when neither of them worked at the FBI anymore; when they could walk down the street hand in hand and not care who saw; when they were no longer being shot at, blown up, or sent cross-country as errand boys. It was on the tip of his tongue to ask Zane if he thought they could be without their jobs and not go crazy.</p><p>But Ty knew he couldn\u2019t do it. Not yet. He had been born and bred to be a spearpoint. Zane was the only kink in the plan he\u2019d always had, but Ty found that he didn\u2019t care. The moment Zane had kissed him, Ty had known he would throw that plan out the window.</p><p>Just remembering the terror and thrill of that moment made Ty\u2019s stomach flutter. He couldn\u2019t help himself\u2014he reached out and slid his fingers along the back of Zane\u2019s neck and pulled him closer, leaning in to kiss him. Zane sighed and relaxed into Ty\u2019s arms as he rubbed his lips against Ty\u2019s, then placed a tiny kiss at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just do one thing easy, huh?\u201d Ty asked, frustrated by all the obstacles they seemed to deal with every day, the least of which was their own stunning inability to communicate with each other.</p><p>Zane raised his fingers to touch Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, though it was with equal resignation. \u201cExcept this,\u201d he whispered before kissing Ty again.</p><p>Ty hummed. \u201cYou have always been easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d Zane said, but he softened the words with a smile.</p><p>A noise from the bathroom drew Ty\u2019s attention just long enough for him to miss the next intended kiss. He sighed and pressed his nose and mouth to Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cI know I\u2019m not easy,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cI knew what I was getting when I realized I loved you. I don\u2019t expect\u2014don\u2019t want you to change, no matter how crazy you make me sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you crazy,\u201d Ty growled as he stood up. He leaned over Zane, propping his arms on the chair and forcing Zane to sit back as he straddled his lap and kissed him, long and hard. Zane hummed in approval and gripped his hips. He sighed when Ty straightened.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty patted Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cThat will never get old.\u201d</p><p>Another, louder sound from the bathroom caused him to growl in annoyance, and he stood and stepped away from Zane. \u201cI better go take up my post again.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, letting his hands drag away from Ty\u2019s hips. He stifled a yawn and turned back to the desk. Ty stood there for a moment longer, watching his lover in the garish light.</p> <p>If there was one thing in the world Ty was willing to give up everything for, it was sitting right there in front of him.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>JULIAN was secured in the back of the sedan as Ty fiddled with the GPS on the dash. Ty had spent a solid half an hour devising the most evil ways he could come up with to make sure Julian couldn\u2019t even get his hands together, much less pick any locks. They were waiting for Zane to finish checking them out, and Ty was keeping one eye on the two men in the back as he punched in the appropriate directions in the GPS.</p><p>With every button he pushed, the GPS unit offered suggestions. He shook his head at the list of Washingtons that it offered, eyes scanning for the right one. Movement in the rearview mirror caught his attention as he found the appropriate Washington, and he glanced up as he pushed the button, narrowing his eyes at his prisoners.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you two get enough of that last night?\u201d he asked in a low growl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to restore blood flow to my fingers,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll restore your blood flow pretty damn quick if you try one more thing,\u201d Ty said, voice low and serious.</p><p>Julian rolled his eyes and sighed, shifting his shoulder and wiggling his fingers, which were hanging in the air. One hand was cuffed to the handle above the door, the other to the floorboard, wound around his leg first so he had to lean forward. Cameron was restrained in similar fashion. They had to be uncomfortable as hell, but Ty wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>He and Zane had discussed trying to head back to Chicago and find a flight, but a call in to Burns had informed them that a blizzard was heading their way and flights were being grounded left and right. They\u2019d have better luck driving, and if they left right now they\u2019d get ahead of the snowstorm and miss it entirely, even if they were having difficulties with their prisoners.</p><p>A few moments later, Zane joined them and Ty pulled out of the parking space.</p><p>\u201cIn point one miles, turn left on Willowcreek Road.\u201d</p><p>Zane was still shivering from the cold as the GPS began giving instructions, even though the car was finally beginning to warm. They weren\u2019t even out of the parking lot of the hotel yet and the GPS lady was bossing them around. The little arrow on the screen of the unit was pointing the wrong way, and they weren\u2019t facing anything resembling Willowcreek Road.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do better than this, honey,\u201d Ty told the little unit stuck to the dash.</p><p>\u201cI should get my phone out,\u201d Zane said as he settled in the passenger seat, newspaper on his lap, covered cup of coffee in hand. \u201cRecord you talking to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to what, your phone?\u201d Ty asked as he turned the car toward the exit to the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cIn point one miles, turn left on Willowcreek Road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe GPS,\u201d Zane said, gesturing toward it with his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more fun to listen to than you are. At least she knows what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of dig her,\u201d Ty said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the shine will wear off when all she does is bitch at you for seven hundred miles,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s different from you, how?\u201d</p><p>When Zane turned to meet his eyes, Ty winked at him. Zane looked away, a smile forming.</p><p>\u201cIn point two miles, turn left on entrance ramp to Interstate 80/90, Indiana East-West Toll Road. In point one mile, stay left on Interstate 80/90 East, Indiana East-West Toll Road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoosen up, honey,\u201d Ty said to it.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop talking to the inanimate object,\u201d Julian said from the back seat.</p><p>\u201cYou can give that up,\u201d Zane said as he opened the newspaper. He didn\u2019t look at Ty, but he was still smirking. \u201cHe talks to his guns too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fits,\u201d Julian said under his breath.</p><p>Ty snorted at them both but remained silent as he followed the directions the GPS gave him. He took the toll ticket as they went through the entrance, handing it to Zane as they got on the toll road. As the miles began to roll by, Ty couldn\u2019t have been more relieved that he and Zane had managed to steal those few hours in Chicago. He wanted to reach out and touch his partner, rest his hand on Zane\u2019s knee, brush his fingers against his shoulder, anything. He refrained, though, the professional side of him winning out.</p><p>Zane seemed content as he read his paper and sipped at his coffee. Of course, Zane always seemed content. That was one of the things Ty loved about him. He was rock steady most of the time, dry and unflappable. A solid wall against which Ty\u2019s changing moods battered. Traits that made the moments Zane lost his composure even more entertaining.</p><p>They stopped at a travel plaza roughly an hour after leaving the hotel in order to get breakfast. As Zane took care of whatever the hell it was Zane did in travel plazas, Ty sat in the driver\u2019s seat, fidgeting. He wasn\u2019t going to be driving the next leg, but it was easier to see the two men sitting in the back in the rearview mirror from that side of the car, and to react with his dominant right hand if they put up a fight.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get over the tension that had settled in his shoulders or the remnants of the Red Bull, and it was manifesting in a great deal of twitching, shifting, and drumming his fingers on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cIntelligence operatives often pick food or travel areas as their cover, Cameron,\u201d Julian said from the backseat, where he sat examining his neatly manicured nails as his hand hung above his head. \u201cRestaurants, gas stations. Lots of people in and out to mask suspicious behavior. A place like this, it must make Agent Grady very nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry talking without making noise for a while,\u201d Ty said, his eyes still on Zane, who had not turned back toward the window at all.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Cameron asked him.</p><p>\u201cI get fidgety if I sit too long,\u201d Ty answered almost against his will. He\u2019d found that no matter what Cameron asked him, he seemed physically incapable of lying to the guy.</p><p>Cameron nodded, looking almost like he felt sorry for Ty. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be able to, like, be still and hide? On... surveillance or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that kind of thing anymore.\u201d Ty looked at Cameron with one eyebrow raised and a slight smirk. \u201cWe have cameras for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Cameron said, heavy on the sarcasm. \u201cSo what does a federal agent do if he\u2019s not watching other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cause all kinds of trouble. Terrorize innocent civilians, arrest the wrong people, take advantage of government healthcare.\u201d</p><p>Ty saw Julian put a finger to his own temple and pull the imaginary trigger.</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head. Wouldn\u2019t that save them all a lot of trouble? He began to shake his knee side to side, starting the sedan rocking. He heard Julian sigh from the back seat.</p><p>\u201cI understand why you can\u2019t sit still, Agent Grady.\u201d He sounded almost as if he were offering a consolation prize.</p><p>\u201cI kind of doubt that.\u201d Mentally sparring with Julian Cross had long ago lost its luster.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you there?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>Ty\u2019s movements slowed, then stilled as his breaths came harder. The hair on his arms rose as a chill went through him.</p><p>\u201cYou scream \u2018prisoner of war\u2019, Agent Grady,\u201d Julian said, his voice low and almost sympathetic. \u201cBut you\u2019re too young to have been captured in the Gulf. That means Special Forces, black ops. Navy SEAL?\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard, ashamed to see that his fingers gripping the steering wheel were turning white. \u201cI was Force Recon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe batshit insane ones. Of course, that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cAgent Grady was a Marine. Force Recon is their answer to the SEALs or Army Rangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d Cameron said as his eyes cut toward Ty.</p><p>\u201cIt is indeed. Save for the fact that most Marines are slightly insane before they live through the hell of combat. Was it Afghanistan, then?\u201d</p><p>Ty kept his eyes front and center, not looking in the mirror because he knew this man would be able to read him.</p><p>\u201cCaptured in Afghanistan, I\u2019d wager. How long were you held?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was the same bullshit line Ty always gave when the subject came up. That operation was still classified. The answer, though, the answer only he, Nick O\u2019Flaherty, and that weird little guy from Homeland Security knew, was twenty-three days, nine hours, and fifty-one minutes.</p><p>Ty glanced up to see Julian\u2019s reflection. His dark eyes seemed sympathetic. Ty looked to Cameron in the mirror\u2014the young man had gone pale with the implication. Even though Ty had denied it, they both knew what Julian had said was true. Ty nodded, not intending to discuss the matter any further.</p><p>Maybe now Julian Cross would realize that Ty knew something about trying to escape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M DRIVING. I get to choose the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty said as he continued to flip through the radio, searching for a station.</p><p>Cameron raised a brow as Zane smacked Ty\u2019s fingers and then hit the preset button, returning the radio to the classic rock station.</p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d Ty said as he pushed the button next to it and turned the dial to find the station he\u2019d just had it on. \u201cPay attention to the road.\u201d</p><p>Zane hit the first button again. \u201cSit back, copilot. You had sports talk all morning.\u201d He sounded calm, though Cameron couldn\u2019t see how he maintained it. Dealing with Ty on a regular basis had to be grounds for anger management classes. Or homicidal tendencies. Maybe that was what was wrong with Zane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo did you,\u201d Ty said as he hit another button at random. Cameron could see a smirk on his face as he looked at Zane. It was obvious now that he didn\u2019t care what they were listening to, he was just pushing buttons. Since Cameron was sitting behind Zane, he couldn\u2019t really see Zane\u2019s face to gauge his reaction, but his next poke at the first button didn\u2019t seem angry.</p><p>Cameron glanced at Julian. \u201cYou and Preston have such a different relationship than them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many ways that statement is correct,\u201d Julian said in a bored voice. He wasn\u2019t paying the two agents much attention. Or didn\u2019t appear to be.</p> <p>Ty pushed another button and turned up the volume. Zane hit the first button again but didn\u2019t mess with the volume. Cameron tipped his head to look into the rearview mirror at Zane\u2019s reflection. He couldn\u2019t be sure, but there might have been a smile on Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been partners?\u201d Cameron asked. There was absolutely nothing about the landscape passing by to hold his interest after the first five minutes, and Julian was sulking or plotting, or both, so he might as well try to talk to them. Julian had told him to try and converse as much as possible; it would put their guard down, enable Julian to glean information, and make Ty and Zane less likely to hurt Cameron.</p><p>Ty jabbed at another button and put his hand over the radio controls so Zane couldn\u2019t touch them. \u201cToo damn long,\u201d he said to Cameron.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d Zane said in a tone that was practically cheerful, and Cameron couldn\u2019t help but grin as Zane used the button on the steering wheel to turn the station.</p><p>Julian turned his head to look at Zane\u2019s reflection in the rearview mirror, and then at Ty.</p> <p>Ty was watching Zane, eyes narrowed. He finally retaliated by turning off the radio and huffing at his partner.</p><p>\u201cCome on, how long?\u201d Cameron asked again. If he had anything going for him, it was that he was persistent. Julian could attest to that.</p><p>\u201cAbout eight months,\u201d Ty said as he continued to eye Zane.</p><p>\u201cEleven months,\u201d Zane corrected.</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Cameron said, doubtful of the veracity of either statement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been eight months, official. By your logic it\u2019s almost two years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was a short break in there,\u201d Zane said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get along very well on our first assignment.\u201d</p><p>Cameron snorted. \u201cAnd how is that different from now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard him,\u201d Ty said with a sarcastic edge to his words. \u201cI love him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can tell,\u201d Cameron said, looking between them. Zane was actually smiling. It looked like he enjoyed needling his partner as much as his partner enjoyed needling him. \u201cWhy stay together if you didn\u2019t get along very well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were assigned, Cameron. They don\u2019t get to pick and choose,\u201d Julian said in a gentle voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, but surely their boss wouldn\u2019t make them work together if they hated each other,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThey do carry guns, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we look like we hate each other?\u201d Zane asked.</p> <p>Cameron held up his hand and waggled it from side to side in a so-so motion. \u201cSometimes, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t tell what you look like with that beard,\u201d Ty said as he turned his head to look at Zane. Cameron could see him smirking again.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head turned toward Ty, and Cameron imagined it was so Zane could glare at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a lumberjack.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged one shoulder. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m a lumberjack and I\u2019m okay,\u2019\u201d he answered in a low singsong voice.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Ty said with real urgency.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Julian added.</p><p>Zane chuckled, and to Cameron\u2019s ear it sounded a little on the evil side. \u201cYou want to sing instead?\u201d Zane asked as he glanced sideways at his partner.</p><p>\u201cIf I sing, I\u2019ll sing whatever I damn well want to. Might as well listen to my radio station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Zane said, and again Cameron wondered about his apparent saintly level of patience.</p><p>After leaning back, Cameron looked over at Julian. \u201cThey almost sound like you and Blake, sometimes. When Blake really gets on a roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you continue to compare me with either of them in any scenario?\u201d Julian asked as he looked at Cameron earnestly.</p><p>Cameron shrugged. \u201cI have a small frame of reference for people who kill things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sing for hundreds of people sitting in the stands at a ballgame, but you won\u2019t sing now,\u201d Zane was saying.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to sing,\u201d Ty said, incredulous as he glared at Zane.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Cameron leaned toward the middle of the seat so he could peer through at Zane. He looked relaxed, left hand loose on the wheel, right hand free and resting on his thigh. A year ago, Cameron wouldn\u2019t have thought anything about that. Now, it occurred to him that Zane was probably keeping his hand free so he could draw his gun. Cameron frowned and sat back.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Garrett, I\u2019m not singing,\u201d Ty said as he jabbed at the radio.</p><p>\u201cHow in the world did they get you to sing, anyway?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cSing where?\u201d Cameron added, and then belatedly doubted the wisdom of making Ty any twitchier.</p><p>Ty looked at Zane pointedly. He glanced over his shoulder at Cameron. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about baseball games,\u201d he said to Cameron, and then he looked at Zane and spoke in a lower voice. \u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeason\u2019s suspended,\u201d Zane said. \u201cCity\u2019s refurbishing that field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Zane lifted one shoulder. \u201cThey called while you were gone about what to do with the Bronco.\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and hung his head. \u201cAre they releasing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I had them keep her in the impound lot so you could see her one last time,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that,\u201d Ty said with a determination that was almost frightening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking like somebody died,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Ty said without moving.</p><p>Zane glanced up to make eye contact with Cameron in the rearview mirror, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMy condolences,\u201d Cameron murmured, a little mystified. He looked over at Julian, brow raised.</p><p>Julian shrugged, a difficult action the way he was restrained, and he whirled his finger around his temple. Cameron sighed and glanced at Ty. He was starting to think Julian was right about Ty being crazy. Maybe Zane too, if he thought any of what they\u2019d just talked about made any sense.</p><p>\u201cCan I choose to ride in the boot, now?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty and Zane both answered.</p><p>ZANE stepped out of the second travel plaza facility of the day with Cameron in tow, taking a deep breath of the freezing air. It had begun to snow, dropping fat flakes that were already beginning to pile up.</p><p>Zane shivered and glanced back inside. It was too cold to wait for Ty and Julian out here. With a steaming hot coffee in one hand and Cameron\u2019s arm in the other, he started for the car. He caught a glimpse of a hulking black SUV parked near the gas pumps, and something about it caught Zane\u2019s attention enough to warrant a second glance. He slowed, staring hard at it. Even as he did so, the car started, its lights blinking on, and it pulled away from the gas pump it had been using and headed for the exit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cameron asked as he watched the car drive away.</p><p>Zane pursed his lips. \u201cNothing. Come on, it\u2019s freezing.\u201d</p><p>The car didn\u2019t give him a bad feeling, and it was the first time he\u2019d even thought about a suspicious vehicle on their tail. It was probably nothing to worry about. They headed back to the car, and Zane secured Cameron with a little bit less vehemence than Ty had that morning. He got in the passenger side and started the car, sighing in relief as the warm air touched his skin.</p><p>They had stopped for gas and something to keep Ty\u2019s hands busy, and Zane had been so close to buying a stress ball he\u2019d found inside that he still regretted not making the purchase. Ty loved road trips, but he really needed to be the one driving. He wasn\u2019t cut out for the idle, easy passage of time that was required of passengers.</p><p>Soon enough, Ty and Julian returned. Ty shoved Julian into the backseat and clanked his handcuffs into place. They were arguing. Again. Zane turned in his seat to watch them.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to search you every time you take a piss. Refuse!\u201d Ty was saying through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do it, Agent Grady. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d Julian was watching as Ty went through the ever-increasingly complicated ritual of tying him down. If this kept up, Julian really would be riding in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cThen stop trying to escape!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have one modicum of respect for me if I didn\u2019t try to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any for you now! The only thing I care about is getting your sorry ass to DC so I can go home.\u201d</p><p>Julian sighed as Ty slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d Zane asked him.</p><p>\u201cThat is a trade secret, Agent Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes and turned back around in his seat as Ty threw himself into the car.</p><p>\u201cYou want to drive?\u201d Zane asked as soon as Ty sat in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Ty said in a rush of relief.</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They didn\u2019t have any Cheetos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTragic,\u201d Zane said as he took the lid off his coffee. \u201cThe coffee is fantastic, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like coffee, Zane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is very good,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThey don\u2019t over roast the beans like Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed in contentment as he took a sip.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty muttered as he jabbed at the GPS and hit the button that would continue their previous course.</p><p>The suction cup that attached the unit to the dash popped up, and the unit jumped off the dash into Ty\u2019s lap. He flailed briefly as he fought with the charging wire, trying to disentangle it and retrieve the unit as it slid down his leg and tangled in the steering column.</p><p>Julian chuckled drily from the back seat. \u201cLooks like she likes you too.\u201d</p><p>JULIAN\u2019S fingers had long ago lost all feeling, and the tingling sensation was marching its way down his arm toward his shoulder by the time the snow got heavy enough that the two FBI agents were discussing stopping.</p><p>\u201cI think we can make it out of the storm,\u201d Zane was saying even as Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Zane, if there\u2019s one thing West Virginia knows, it\u2019s snow. This is a car killer, and we\u2019re in a Crown Vic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying we should stop for the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let the snow pile up around us as Cross tries repeatedly to kill us and escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not when you put it that way, Zane. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to die in a snow storm in the middle of Indiana,\u201d Cameron said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cI said it would kill the car, not us,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... sort of the same thing, though,\u201d Zane pointed out. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have winter coats.\u201d</p><p>Julian could clearly see the glare Ty shot at Zane</p><p>Julian glanced to Cameron and met his lover\u2019s eyes. Cameron still looked worried and overwhelmed, and Julian had been trying his best to remain outwardly calm for his benefit. It was getting harder to do, though, the longer this charade went on. Both attempts at escape had been foiled, and he had to admit, he was a little surprised. He smiled and gave Cameron a wry roll of his eyes despite his concern.</p><p>He was torn over what he wanted Ty and Zane to do. Every mile they drove brought them closer to DC and the danger that lay in wait there. But while stopping in the snow storm would afford him and Cameron the chance at escaping, how far could they realistically get in a whiteout blizzard like this?</p><p>Eventually, the snow was falling so fast and thick that it didn\u2019t matter what any of them wanted to do. Ty could barely see to drive the car, and as soon as they caught wind of an exit off the toll road that had a hotel, Ty headed for it. It took them half an hour to get from the exit to the hotel, inching along in the driving snow. Every minute that passed, the agents grew edgier and meaner.</p><p>\u201cI could get out and walk and get us a room before the car could get there,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cZane, shut up,\u201d Ty said through gritted teeth. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel. Julian supposed it was partly instinct and mostly dumb luck that he was able to navigate at all. He was tense, though, and for someone wound as tight as Ty already was, making him more so wasn\u2019t going to help anyone.</p><p>Julian and Cameron wisely kept their mouths shut.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to drive for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane, seriously, stop talking to me right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane cleared his throat and shrugged a shoulder, looking out the window.</p><p>Julian glanced over at Cameron again, trying to gauge how well he was holding up. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Cameron shook his head, eyes darting to the front to see if either agent was looking at him. Julian knew that Cameron was ashamed to admit to his fear in front of Ty and Zane.</p><p>The anger flared so unexpectedly that Julian gave a sharp gasp as it burned through him. Who were these two clowns to make Cameron feel like that? Who the hell did these assholes think they were dealing with? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had to take several long, deep breaths to calm himself. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, love. There\u2019s no shame in being frightened.\u201d</p><p>Cameron looked at him, eyes pleading, expression miserable. Julian\u2019s chest twisted and the anger banked to a slower burn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>Ty threw the car in park and rested both hands on the steering wheel. When Julian glanced at him, he had his eyes closed, visibly trying to relax after the stressful drive.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re in a parking lot,\u201d the agent muttered.</p><p>Zane cleared his throat again and looked back at them as he popped the car door open. \u201cI\u2019ll go see about a room.\u201d</p><p>He left them with Ty in the car, and Ty reached to turn the car off, instantly throwing the car into an otherworldly silence. The chill began to seep into Julian\u2019s bones as soon as the heat turned off.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we at least have some heat while we wait?\u201d Cameron asked, voice wavering.</p> <p>Ty shook his head. \u201cIf we get stuck we\u2019ll need to conserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuck? Is that really a possibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty said in a louder voice.</p><p>\u201cAgent Grady,\u201d Julian said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not stupid, Cross, he deserves the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot from you,\u201d Julian growled, barely able to rein in his temper. What it was about Ty that caused him to lose control so easily, he could not fathom.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s sure as hell not getting it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m sitting right here,\u201d Cameron muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think your boyfriend does, Jacobs?\u201d Ty asked him, his hazel eyes seeming to pierce right through the mirror as he looked at Cameron.</p><p>Cameron swallowed hard. \u201cHe deals in antiques.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head, muttering to himself as he looked out into the wall of white around them. Occasionally they could see the motel\u2019s sign, the neon like a beacon of salvation amidst the world of white. But the chill and the silence were still oppressive.</p><p>Julian stared into the falling snowflakes, reflected blue in the moonlight, clamping down on the angry words running through his mind, trying to remain outwardly calm, for his own sake as much as Cameron\u2019s.</p><p>The passenger door popped open, and Zane stuck his head in. His hair was wet with melting snow, and his shoulders were covered with flakes. \u201cWe got the last room at the inn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMust be our lucky day,\u201d Ty muttered as he got out of the car and both doors slammed.</p><p>Julian met Cameron\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die before anything happens to you,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Cameron whispered.</p><p>\u201cWE LOST them,\u201d Agent X reported to his superior without emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you lost them? How can you lose two FBI agents with a prisoner who don\u2019t know they\u2019re being tailed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we need to consider the possibility that they\u2019ve caught wind of us,\u201d Agent X said. \u201cThey went through security at Midway like they were supposed to, but I believe they caused a commotion in order to flee. We never picked them up at O\u2019Hare, and we later got reports of an FBI sedan being stolen. The GPS tracking on the sedan has been disabled. They\u2019re avoiding official channels, zigzagging and scrambling. It\u2019s classic maneuvering.\u201d</p><p>His superior sighed. \u201cYes, it would appear they know we\u2019re after them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe picked up their trail when they used a credit card at a hotel in Portage, Indiana. And again when they got on the toll road. They\u2019re trying to make the trip overland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems imprudent, to go to all that trouble and then use a credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said they know we\u2019re after them, not that they\u2019re particularly smart. But we lost them again when they took an unexpected detour off the toll road into Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in Michigan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?</p><p>\u201cA lot of snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Find them, understand? Our one true advantage was the element of surprise. I know Richard Burns, he\u2019s not an idiot. If he knows we\u2019re coming, make no mistake, he\u2019s put his best operatives on this. Whatever they\u2019re doing, it has a purpose. Julian Cross cannot make it to DC. Do what you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir.\u201d</p><p>RICHARD BURNS sat in his darkened office, eyes on a computer monitor, brow furrowed. Years ago he had installed a special tracking device in Ty Grady\u2019s wristwatch for times like this. Ty could turn it on and off at will and only employed it when he was working a special assignment or in trouble, if he was able. Burns could also ping it remotely when he needed to. It was on now. Ty had turned it on moments after getting Burns\u2019 initial call.</p><p>His signal had popped up just west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and made its way to Chicago just as Ty had been ordered. Now it was near the state line of Michigan and Indiana, holding steady.</p><p>Burns didn\u2019t understand why. Jonas exited the private washroom in Burns\u2019 office, having just showered, and he came to stand over Burns\u2019 shoulder, watching the computer screen in consternation.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they heading north? Are they evading someone?\u201d</p><p>Burns shook his head and clicked a button that moved the grid onto one of two flat-screen televisions on the panel on the far wall. \u201cThey would have called in if they\u2019d picked up anyone following them or run into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Burns glanced at the other television on the wall, displaying a map from Weather Underground. Massive snowstorms were moving across the Great Lakes, the same weather system Burns had warned Ty and Zane about that morning. It was much more massive than he had thought, and Burns narrowed his eyes at the screen again. With the two maps side by side, it was apparent what was going on.</p><p>Ty was lost in the snow. Burns found himself smiling fondly, a laugh escaping as he rubbed at the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lost. Probably has no idea he\u2019s in Michigan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost? Does your man know how important this op is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether I send him to Chicago to retrieve a wet works operative or to Kentucky to get me some goddamned fried chicken, he does his job and he does it well.\u201d</p><p>Jonas, of course, knew Ty Grady. He\u2019d known Ty since he was born. But Jonas didn\u2019t know Ty was the one Burns had sent on this mission, and he didn\u2019t plan to tell Jonas that either, not unless he had to.</p><p>Burns had also debated over the benefits of telling Ty and Zane what they were getting into, and in the end he had decided it was best to leave them need-to-know. He didn\u2019t know who had followed Jonas\u2019 steps here or who had ears on him, and in the end, the less they knew, the less likely they were to be killed if they were captured.</p><p>Burns also knew that if they were aware of the whole story, they would fight and die for a cause that wasn\u2019t theirs simply because Ty would do anything for Jonas, just like he\u2019d do anything for Burns or his father. Burns couldn\u2019t let that happen. Jonas was practically family\u2014a man Ty knew and respected as a dear friend of his father\u2014but Burns wouldn\u2019t risk Ty or Zane for him. Better they be innocent bystanders, blindly following orders, than complicit in what was happening.</p><p>Jonas looked at him for a long minute, then nodded and turned away. His hand moved to the pocket where he\u2019d been keeping that burner phone, a nervous gesture Burns had noticed more than once.</p><p>\u201cDo you want someone to get in touch with Trish?\u201d Burns asked, recognizing the restless maneuvering of a husband who was beyond late for dinner.</p><p>Jonas shook his head. \u201cThe less she knows, the better.\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded. It was the mantra of every dark operative in history.</p><p>He looked back at the screen, a stab of guilt going through him as he stared at the blue dot that was Ty and Zane. Those boys had given up too much for this kind of work. Far too much.</p><p>They had stopped moving, and Burns guessed they had bedded down in the blizzard despite the early hour. A blizzard wouldn\u2019t stop the men coming after them once the CIA caught their scent, though. Nor would it stop Julian Cross.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>THEY had the honeymoon suite. Two rooms with the bedroom in the back, no windows, and one door in and out. To escape that bedroom, you had to go through the other half of the suite. It was so perfect that Zane was afraid to find out what the catch was.</p><p>As soon as they entered the room, Zane went to the heater and cranked it up. Cameron kept his head down, fleeing for the bathroom. He was upset, but Zane couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>Ty escorted Julian through the room to the bedroom, Zane trailing behind them to help secure Julian to whatever they could find. Ty had fished a handful of bungee cords out of the trunk with something close to unholy glee.</p><p>\u201cAntiques dealer, huh?\u201d Ty asked Julian, voice laced with amusement and contempt as he tossed his jacket onto the bed. He was still irritable and tense from the drive, and the target of his ire appeared to be Julian. Zane wondered what had been said in the car when he was gone to up the level of animosity between them.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t strive to be original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the kid?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Julian asked, shoulders stiff.</p><p>Zane looked up at his partner as he flipped through channels on the muted television, trying to find the Weather Channel and wondering what it was about Julian Cross that annoyed Ty so. Ty had told him that parts of Julian reminded him of Zane. Well, parts of Ty and Julian reminded Zane of the way he and Ty had treated each other when they first met. The tension was palpable, but there was an added layer to it that Zane really didn\u2019t want to ponder.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to get him killed, dragging him all over the place like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m dragging him anywhere,\u201d Julian said, utterly calm.</p><p>\u201cHe has no idea what you do or who you are. You\u2019re doing nothing but putting him in danger,\u201d Ty said. \u201cYou really think he\u2019d come willingly if he knew the truth about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And sometimes it\u2019s safer that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafer, my ass. Ignorance is not bliss, you know.\u201d</p><p>Cameron chose that moment to step out of the bathroom, unaware that he was the subject of their conversation.</p><p>Julian looked Ty up and down. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019ve never lied to a loved one?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his eyebrows and shook his head, an entirely insolent look that would have made Zane want to smack him if it had been aimed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never kept something from your partner to keep him safe?\u201d Julian asked, voice growing colder.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Ty answered without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>Julian\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he took a step closer. He and Ty were too close now. Close enough that they couldn\u2019t even look each other up and down without leaning away. Cameron shot Zane a nervous glance, and Zane stood, tensing.</p><p>Julian\u2019s voice was low and mocking when he spoke to Ty. \u201cYou\u2019ve never lied to someone to keep them safe? Wife? Mother? Boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty said, not reacting to Julian\u2019s last word.</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019ve never done it. I\u2019ll believe that out of someone like you. But have you ever lied to someone you loved because you were following orders, Special Agent Grady?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t flinch, didn\u2019t react in any way other than a jump in the muscles of his jaw. \u201cNo.\u201d His voice had dropped dangerously.</p><p>The hair on the back of Zane\u2019s neck began to prickle because he knew damn well that was a lie, and Ty had managed it seamlessly.</p><p>Julian narrowed his eyes. They stood toe to toe, glaring evilly at each other, neither willing to cross that line and attack, whether verbally or physically. Zane stood back, watching them through wide eyes. He had no desire whatsoever to mix it up with Julian Cross, but if this continued he\u2019d be happy to sit the man down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an excellent liar, Agent Grady,\u201d Julian whispered, his voice deceptively calm and borderline seductive. He leaned just a little closer, close enough he could have touched their noses together. He cocked his head. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t recognize you? My memory is not as selective as yours.\u201d</p><p>Zane straightened as Julian\u2019s words registered. He looked back and forth between the two men. They knew each other? What the hell?</p><p>\u201cJulian, what are you talking about?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>Looking at Ty, Zane could see that he had stopped breathing and gone still, like a snake about to strike.</p><p>Julian continued, his voice disturbingly intimate. \u201cWhen last I saw you, you were speaking flawless French, plying a wealthy Parisian with drinks, and selling... antiques. Do you remember me now?\u201d</p><p>Outwardly Ty didn\u2019t react. His face remained impassive and stony, revealing nothing. That alone was enough to tell Zane that what Julian said was the truth. But Zane hadn\u2019t picked up on the fact that Ty knew Julian. It must have been at least a few years ago, or Ty would have remembered. And Ty hadn\u2019t been to Paris since Zane had known him.</p><p>Unless Ty had been to Paris, and did remember, but hadn\u2019t let on that he did. A heavy ball of doubt settled in Zane\u2019s gut.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ty finally said.</p><p>Julian continued to stare at him, and Ty still hadn\u2019t moved. Julian raised his chin, snorting. \u201cWhat sort of man must it take to make even his eyes lie?\u201d he asked, the words dripping with disdain and scorn. As far as he\u2019d experienced, Zane knew Julian got a good read on people. But what had he seen in Ty to make him say something that cruel? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty continued to look at Julian, the anger and combativeness leaching out of his expression to leave him staring impassively. Not only had he gotten control of his temper, it had disappeared. Zane had never seen his partner like this.</p><p>\u201cYou call me a monster,\u201d Julian said, voice low. \u201cAt least I know what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you are you too,\u201d Ty whispered back, not acknowledging the hit in any way.</p> <p>The room fell into tense silence. Zane shifted his eyes toward Ty and waited. But Ty stood staring at Julian, face expressionless and body relaxed. He neither looked Zane\u2019s way nor even acknowledged that he and Cameron were there. It was like waiting for two dogs to fight, sensing that they were about to lunge and being helpless to stop it. Zane walked in a half circle to put himself in Ty\u2019s line of sight, perhaps six feet away. Until Ty came out of whatever headspace this was, it was better not to get too close.</p><p>Julian sensed him moving, and he gave Ty one last disdainful look and moved to sit beside Cameron on the end of the king-size bed.</p><p>All three of them watched Ty expectantly, and Ty stood glaring at them all. It was time for some kind of explanation. Zane could imagine Julian making something like that up; it would serve the purpose of driving a wedge of suspicion between Ty and Zane if they began fighting over it. It was a classic psychological technique. But Zane\u2019s gut told him that it felt like the truth.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes moved to meet his. His jaw tightened and he squared his shoulders, as if expecting Zane to launch his own attack. Instead, Zane slid one hand into a pocket and held out the other, palm up. He didn\u2019t want to fight about it. He just wanted to know; to know if Ty was in danger, to know if they were in danger because of this. As much as being kept in the dark pissed him off, Zane knew better than to demand answers from his lover and partner, especially in front of Julian and Cameron. That was a quick trip to an ass-kicking. Or worse, a stonewalling.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Ty said, his voice grim.</p> <p>Zane tried to keep his voice calm. \u201cDo you want to fight? Because I don\u2019t. But there\u2019s a lot of numbers not adding up, and you know me and numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight,\u201d Ty answered. His eyes shifted to Julian again, a spark of anger in them.</p><p>\u201cThen forget about him and focus on me,\u201d Zane said, letting his hand start to lower.</p><p>Ty looked back and raised his chin. \u201cI swear to you, Zane, I\u2019d never seen him before this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloody liar,\u201d Julian muttered.</p><p>When Zane met those hazel eyes, he tried to see what Julian must have seen, but he just didn\u2019t. All he saw was the man he knew and loved telling him the truth. Everything in Zane confirmed it. \u201cThen that means he\u2019s seen you. In Paris?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him lie to you, Agent Garrett,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Zane snapped.</p><p>Ty lowered his head, but his eyes remained on Zane\u2019s. It gave him a predatory look.</p><p>Zane knew that Ty was wound up too tight about this for it to be a simple matter. \u201cThis is one of those things you can\u2019t tell me about. That\u2019s crystal clear.\u201d</p><p>Ty exhaled sharply and turned away, running his hand through his hair as he headed for the door. Ty always aimed for open space when he was agitated, windows and doors and balconies. Like he was making certain he had an escape route. Only now it struck Zane as Ty wanting to get away from him.</p><p>Zane took a step to go after him.</p><p>Ty swept his hand out and grabbed the lamp off the dresser, then turned, ripping the cord from the base, and threw it against the nearest wall with a wordless shout of frustration that was lost in the shattering of the ceramic.</p> <p>Zane flinched but didn\u2019t move. Julian stood but remained by the bed, where Cameron sat cringing away from the debris. Zane took a step toward them. It registered with him that he was afraid of what Ty was going to do, because Zane couldn\u2019t tell, and he\u2019d gotten pretty adept at that. This was just one of so many unspoken truths between them. Maybe Ty feared them as much as Zane did.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Zane!\u201d Ty shouted as he continued to pace like a caged animal. As he ranted he waved one hand in the air, pointing accusingly at Zane and Julian and even Cameron as he did so. \u201cWhat are the fucking odds of him knowing me? I worked that job for eighteen months without so much as a hint of trouble, and now of all people it\u2019s that fucking Irishman that\u2019s going to get that cover blown. Why couldn\u2019t you have just let me shoot him like I wanted to in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s brows rose higher the longer Ty ranted, and that rigid ball in his chest relaxed. If Ty could yell, it would be okay. It always was. What he was saying didn\u2019t help Zane feel any better, though. \u201cNothing\u2019s blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is blown! Forget whatever Burns wants with him, Zane! He knows me from Paris, and he just made me as a Fed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he going to tell? Who\u2019ll believe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Julian said, affronted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t borrow trouble. We have enough as it is,\u201d Zane continued as he waved a hand at Julian.</p><p>Ty was silent; Zane couldn\u2019t even hear him breathing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t consider a year and a half of work thrown away before you know for sure,\u201d Zane said. \u201cYou\u2019re too fucking good at... whatever the hell it is you\u2019ve been doing... to just chuck it because of one asshole with a bad accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Julian repeated.</p><p>Zane turned to face him as Julian took a step toward him. He realized their mistake too late. They had let themselves get pulled into an argument and dropped their guard before Julian was fully secured.</p><p>He attacked without further warning, launching himself at Zane and knocking them both to the ground. Zane heard Cameron cry out. Julian\u2019s body was solid and heavy on his as Zane hit the ground hard. Zane rolled as soon as his back hit the floor, flipping them over and kicking Julian over his head. He barely had time to gain his knees before Julian hit him from behind. They rolled across the floor.</p><p>Zane landed on his back again, Julian pinning him. He managed a jab to Zane\u2019s ribs, and he pulled his fist back again, aiming for a blow to Zane\u2019s temple that was sure to knock out the lights.</p><p>Zane flicked a wrist and a knife shot from its sheath. He palmed it, prepared to do real damage to Julian\u2019s midsection.</p><p>Ty stepped into his vision, catching Julian\u2019s fist in one palm before it could land against Zane\u2019s face. He twisted Julian\u2019s arm, and Julian arched his back and shouted in pain and anger. Ty turned gracefully until he was kneeling behind Julian with one arm wrapped around his neck, the other twisting Julian\u2019s hand back and up.</p><p>\u201cStop! Please!\u201d Cameron cried as he stood up and stepped forward.</p><p>Zane pushed himself off the floor and grabbed Cameron, holding him back as they both watched Julian struggle against Ty\u2019s arms.</p><p>Ty clasped his hands together over Julian\u2019s shoulder, closing the choke hold as Julian tried to reach his face to find something tender to jab his thumb into. Ty closed his eyes and lowered his head, hiding his face against Julian\u2019s neck, making it almost seem intimate. They were too close for Julian to hurt Ty enough to loosen his grip. His elbows landed uselessly on hard muscle, his fists hit Ty\u2019s hips instead of his groin. Ty was too heavy and too low for Julian to flip over his shoulder.</p><p>Zane realized that Ty was whispering to Julian as he tightened the chokehold. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he was repeating to Julian even as he rendered him unconscious.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s killing him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>There was something fascinating and morbidly beautiful about watching it, though. Ty held tight to the larger man, wrapping him up, head bowed and expression calm when he opened his eyes again. It was perhaps the first time Zane had ever seen Ty\u2019s eyes go blank like that; he seemed almost meditative. Zen-like.</p><p>Julian tried to duck his head, attempting to open his airway, but Ty had closed the hold too quickly. After a few more seconds of struggling, Julian\u2019s body went limp. Ty continued to hold him for another few breaths, and then he released him and let him thump to the ground. When he stood he looked up at them, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes. Everything about Ty, from his body to the look in his eyes, felt calm and still.</p><p>It was like seeing a new person.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Cameron whispered. Zane let him go. He fell on Julian, taking his face between his hands and calling to him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ty muttered. He stood stock-still, staring at Zane. The stillness was unnerving; Ty was never still. He fidgeted and paced and vibrated and bounced and twitched and rocked when there was no other outlet for all the nervous energy he stored up. But now he was so still it was like looking at a statue.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes and counted heartbeats, just breathing, trying to hold onto composure that was cracking. Ty was scaring him, and Zane had no idea what to do about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ty said, the words stirring the tension in the air and cutting through it.</p><p>Zane blinked his eyes open and raised his head to look at Ty. He was still standing motionless, hands at his sides. He was looking down and his lips were parted, tongue pushing against the corner of his mouth as if he was deep in thought. Zane had seen the expression before, right before copiers started blowing up. He statistically had a very small percentage of heading that off, but Zane didn\u2019t know if he was up to it with so much uncertainty suddenly flowing between them.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Zane said with forced lightness, \u201cthe extent of my French is voulez-vous coucher avec moi and m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, so I hope you won\u2019t consider me a threat.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at him, his expression one of clear calculation. It passed and his shoulders slumped. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Zane, come on. You had to know the kind of stuff I was up to on some level. And I haven\u2019t worked a job since we got assigned together.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cOf course I did, Ty.\u201d He was sure Ty had no idea how much Zane knew about that kind of stuff. He shifted his weight back and forth, trying to shake off the discomfort this entire week had caused.</p><p>\u201cWill someone please tell me what just happened?\u201d Cameron shouted, his voice high and wavering.</p><p>Ty shook his head, looking down at Cameron and Julian\u2019s limp form. \u201cHe\u2019ll be awake in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood choke. Cut off blood flow to his brain. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said in a whisper.</p><p>Ty looked back at him, his expression softening. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too.\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cEither for letting the secrets go on so long or for pushing about it now, I\u2019m not sure. Either way, it puts you in a bad spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, can one of you please help me here!\u201d Cameron said as he lifted Julian\u2019s head off the ground.</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and bent to shoo Cameron\u2019s hands away. \u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>Zane moved closer, bending to help Ty lift the unconscious prisoner onto the bed. The man was solid and a deadweight, way too heavy for his frame. \u201cJesus, he\u2019s made of granite,\u201d Zane said in a strained voice.</p><p>Ty grunted in agreement as they flopped him onto the bed. \u201cBungee cords,\u201d he said, breathless.</p><p>Zane went to get them, and he could hear Cameron\u2019s tremulous voice, asking Ty questions and demanding more satisfactory answers than Ty was giving.</p><p>\u201cYou know if it was you, you\u2019d be trying to escape too!\u201d he was shouting as Zane came back into the room.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously as he squared his shoulders on Cameron, and Zane stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cCool it. Get comfortable. We\u2019ll tie you two up together tonight,\u201d he said, hoping the consolation prize would keep Cameron from squawking all night about his \u201cdead\u201d boyfriend. They made a cursory job of tying Julian and Cameron down, then Zane grabbed Ty\u2019s elbow and dragged him out of the room.</p><p>\u201cOkay, talk,\u201d he demanded, unwilling to let it stew any longer.</p><p>Ty nodded, and his eyes shifted to the side to glance at the bedroom door before he looked back at Zane. \u201cThis is one of the things I wanted to tell you when we got home,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my call to be able to tell you before. I wanted to, Zane, I don\u2019t like keeping secrets. But I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s so different about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, I wasn\u2019t the one who spilled it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted. What about when we got home?\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. \u201cWhile I was on the road I decided I didn\u2019t give a damn anymore. I\u2019m not keeping anything from you from now on. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s classified.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Zane started doing a Snoopy dance at Ty\u2019s words. He studied Ty for a long moment before saying, \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s what made it so hard.\u201d He stood there for another moment, leaning forward as if perched on a precipice. Then he shook himself and reached for his gun. He drew it out of its holster and checked the magazine as he strode toward the bedroom. Zane blinked after him for a moment before jumping in front of him. He took Ty by the arm and swung him around, getting between him and the door. \u201cWhoa, Bulldog. That\u2019s not going to help.\u201d Zane paused. \u201cWell, okay, it would help you feel better. But it wouldn\u2019t help the situation here and now, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t help any situation later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Ty said in a calm voice.</p><p>\u201cI am sure you do,\u201d Zane said, keeping one hand on Ty\u2019s forearm, not holding, not squeezing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill him, Zane, just threaten them both until I feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief, but please listen. You would have to shoot his ass to kingdom come to scare him when he wakes up, and then we\u2019d have a worse mess. Can\u2019t we just... settle this first, and then you can deal with him about the other? Hell, maybe that\u2019s why Burns wants him to begin with! Maybe that\u2019s why he sent you.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him mutinously for a long moment, long enough that Zane began to suspect his gentle persuasion might not work.</p> <p>But then Ty rolled his eyes and sighed, sliding his gun back home. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he mumbled. Zane felt his heart start back up, and he sagged against the wall as Ty glanced around the room and spoke. \u201cI need to put a call into Burns. This just went over our pay grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zane said, regretting the need for Ty to go anywhere right then. \u201cSay hi to him for me.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned away from him with a nod, going to grab his coat off the bed. He was almost to the door when he stopped and turned. \u201cZane. Nothing else has been a lie.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d say Ty had lied to him at all\u2014Zane didn\u2019t consider lies of omission lies\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to get into a long, circular logic puzzle with Ty, of all people. His head would explode.</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p> <p>Ty stood there for a heartbeat longer; then he advanced on Zane just like Julian had on him earlier. He took Zane\u2019s face between his hands and he kissed him, pushing him back against the wall and holding him there, his lips demanding against Zane\u2019s. Then it was over as suddenly as it had begun, Hurricane Ty passing by. When he stepped back again, he jerked his head in a nod. Then he turned and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWHAT do you mean you know he knows me?\u201d Ty asked Burns in outrage.</p><p>\u201cOf course I know he knows you! Why do you think I sent you after him? He\u2019s listed as a possible contact on one of your old jobs.\u201d</p><p>Burns could hear Ty making a sputtering noise on the other end of the line that may or may not have been a minor hissy fit.</p><p>\u201cYou dealt with him in France!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I have the reports. His name was different, but this is the same guy. Julian Cross is a CIA codename. You worked together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Dick! I have never seen this man in my life! I would remember that!\u201d</p><p>Burns frowned, confused. Ty sounded genuinely upset and offended. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell join the fucking club!\u201d Ty hollered on the other end of the line. \u201cThe guy from Paris that I worked with, the guy in that report, was a French guy, six one, white-blond hair. He was not a six-foot-five asshole Irishman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat complicates things.\u201d</p><p>Burns could hear another series of sounds, culminating in a string of curses.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure the man you have is Julian Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Dick, he doesn\u2019t have a fucking bar code I can scan!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t change your objective,\u201d Burns tried in a loud, authoritative voice, trying to pull Ty back on point. \u201cYou still need to get him to DC, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty demanded in frustration. \u201cWhat\u2019s this really about?\u201d</p><p>Burns hesitated. \u201cNeed-to-know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you have to do to get Cross here alive.\u201d</p><p>Ty was mutinously silent. Finally, Burns heard him exhale, a bid for calm. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said in a soft, composed voice.</p><p>ZANE sat watching Julian, waiting for him to wake and thinking about Ty and what had just happened. Zane had never seen his partner, his lover, react to violence in such a cold and calculating way. It was a new side to Ty. Was that how he\u2019d been able to handle himself all these years, by simply turning off his emotion and essentially finding a happy place when he worked? Zane shook his head. He tried not to dwell on what it would take to do that.</p><p>When Ty came back from making his call, he found Zane in the bedroom and stood at his side, looking down at the two men on the bed. They had used the twisted bungee cords to tie Julian down and handcuffed Cameron to him to give them just enough contact to keep them from trying to escape when Julian awoke. Not that they\u2019d go far in a blizzard.</p><p>Cameron had his nose buried against the back of Julian\u2019s shoulder and was looking up at them with one eye and hiding the other.</p><p>\u201cEvery time you two try something, it\u2019s one more bullet I put in his head in my dreams,\u201d Ty told Cameron. This time, Zane knew he wasn\u2019t acting.</p><p>Julian groaned. Cameron nodded, eyes wide. He scooted closer to Julian, looking genuinely upset.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Zane felt compelled to say. \u201cHe\u2019ll wake up in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ty was already moving away from the bed and into the outer room. Zane stopped to turn the television to a different channel for Cameron before he followed, wondering what sort of damage control was needed here.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to kill him back there.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to face him. \u201cNext time I will,\u201d he said, his voice cold and determined.</p><p>A shiver ran down Zane\u2019s spine, and he had to admit, a part of him liked it. \u201cWhat is it about him that gets you so riled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him, Zane. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a threat to both of us. You\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s capable of, and I have to tell you, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying yet. I think he\u2019s just a fucking raptor testing the fences. When I look at him, I see him hurting you.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s chest twisted in a way that wasn\u2019t unpleasant. He knew that feeling, being so protective and so desperate to keep his loved ones safe that it clouded his world. \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you here watching my back,\u201d Zane said with a serene smile. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d felt so calm inside in years. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got yours.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a deep breath as he looked into Zane\u2019s eyes. Zane wondered what Ty saw when he looked into him like that. One day he would ask him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty finally said on a deep exhale.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple hours to wind down, get some real sleep.\u201d Zane waved his hand at the pullout couch.</p><p>Ty nodded, his movements not nearly as jerky or tense. He seemed to be coming to terms with what Zane had said, trying to assimilate it. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute. I just need a quick shower,\u201d he said as he pulled off his shirt and headed for the bathroom. The shower began running a moment later.</p><p>Zane turned and shut the bedroom door behind him. There was no telling when the storm would break. More privacy and space was better than less with the combined personalities in this little escapade.</p><p>He took the time to pull the couch out; then he went to the bedroom and stood beside the bed, looking down at the two men. Julian was awake, and he stared up at him evilly, his dark eyes glazed. Zane reached to take his pulse, checking it against his watch to make sure it was fast enough.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Julian whispered.</p><p>Zane stared at him, investigating the feeling the threat gave him. He found himself smiling. \u201cI look forward to your next attempt. He\u2019ll tear you apart.\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t respond, and Zane couldn\u2019t read him. He left the prisoners, closing the door and balancing one of the glasses from the small wet bar on the doorknob. Then he sought out his partner in the shower.</p><p>After watching Ty through the wavering plastic for a long moment, Zane reached out and pushed open the curtain. Ty jerked when the shower curtain squealed on its hooks. It was obvious that Zane had startled him, which was an unusual occurrence in itself. Zane stripped as Ty watched him, then stepped inside and closed the curtain behind him. Moving close, he raised a hand and slid it through Ty\u2019s hair, sluicing the water drops away.</p><p>Ty raised his head and lifted his face toward the ceiling. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t want to talk about what had happened. He didn\u2019t want anything but his lover to be relaxed and normal\u2014as \u201cnormal\u201d as Ty got, anyway. \u201cAre you really okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just... there are some things I need to tell you, Zane. And I want you to know from me, not by finding out from someone else like this. But I can\u2019t... I\u2019m just wrestling with what\u2019s more important to me, my integrity or... you.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him, taken aback by the subject. He\u2019d thought Ty had been bothered by the fight. He\u2019d had no idea this was what Ty had been thinking. But then, Zane supposed that was part of Ty\u2019s charm, the jumbled ball of yarn inside his brain that no one could unravel.</p><p>He took a deep breath to steady himself. \u201cI think you need to go with what you can sleep with at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled wanly as he reached for the soap. \u201cI don\u2019t mean fuck at night, I mean sleep with. Whatever keeps your mind at rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart did a happy skip as he met Ty\u2019s eyes. He would never get tired of moments like this, when Ty proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Zane was the most important thing in his world. \u201cTell me?\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips, watching Zane even as the water beat down on them both. For once his expression wasn\u2019t guarded when Zane started asking questions. \u201cBurns uses me on jobs he can\u2019t put the Bureau on but the CIA doesn\u2019t list as priority. We call them Misfits.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know that he used to use you the same way.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes shot up to meet Ty\u2019s, wide and shocked. Ty was looking at him, holding his breath. He nodded. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Tanner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Tanner told you?\u201d Zane asked, aghast. Jack Tanner had been one of his instructors in the academy. He had single-handedly prevented Zane from dropping out and turned him into the agent he had become.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty said. \u201cYou told me he used to eat dinner at your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Zane said, confused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how he pulled me too. And then knowing what I do about Burns and the way he treats you... I put two and two together.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s mouth was dry as he stared at Ty. \u201cHow... Jesus, Ty. Why didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve had so much trouble with your past and getting over it,\u201d he murmured as he let his hands snake around Zane\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019d rather you live in the present.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard. Ty was right, for the most part. Those were days he didn\u2019t want to relive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking to talk about it. I just figure it\u2019s out there now. It\u2019s not something we need to hide or skirt around anymore.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, feeling dizzy. He couldn\u2019t believe Ty had put that together with so little to go on, but then he supposed Ty never did get enough credit for being as smart as he was. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Zane leaned over enough to catch Ty\u2019s lips in a gentle kiss. It didn\u2019t last long. \u201cI know you love me. And you know I love you. The rest will wait a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels good to say that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Zane dragged one finger along Ty\u2019s lower lip. \u201cYeah. And I intend to keep saying it. Often.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled wanly, but then he looked away as if he was struggling with what to say next. Or perhaps wrestling with a difficult decision.</p><p>\u201cTell me?\u201d Zane murmured as he rubbed Ty\u2019s back, trying to soothe him. It was like working with a spooked horse, and it had been decades since Zane had tried to rein one in.</p><p>Ty hesitated before sighing. \u201cBurns sent me\u2014us\u2014because he thought I knew Cross,\u201d he said in a low, tense voice. \u201cIt was in a report that he was a contact from a Paris job six years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t working under the name Julian Cross, but that\u2019s the name the CIA put in the file. I\u2019m telling you right now, though, the man from Paris was not Cross. Not this Cross, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned, mulling that over. \u201cSo either who we have isn\u2019t the original Cross, or the CIA guy you worked with said he was Cross but wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know our Cross is connected somehow, because he knew me,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s like the Dread Pirate Roberts.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at Zane warily.</p><p>Zane nodded and cocked his head at Ty. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just waiting for you to bust out the \u2018double cross\u2019 pun so we can get it over with.\u201d</p><p>One corner of Zane\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cWant me to come up with one real quick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop it.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and pressed his lips to Ty\u2019s cheek. Ty\u2019s body was still tense against his, and Zane could feel that there was still more his lover wanted to say. He reached up to put his hand against Ty\u2019s cheek, looking into his eyes, feeling that tangle of warmth spread in his chest like it always did when Ty looked at him like that. \u201cWhat else, baby?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and wrapped his arms around Zane\u2019s neck instead, kissing him messily. They were still kissing when the water began to cool and Ty pulled away to meet Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drop these two bozos off, then disappear for a night or two between DC and home, okay?\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything you want to know. And I\u2019ll make it up to you for bolting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane nodded and smiled, fighting down his racing pulse as he looked into Ty\u2019s eyes. Now that was something to really look forward to.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cWHAT mile marker are we near?\u201d Zane asked as he peered at the map they\u2019d bought that morning.</p> <p>\u201c129.3,\u201d Ty answered without cracking a smile or taking his eyes off the road.</p><p>Zane glanced at him and rolled his eyes. He set the map on the floorboard and took up his crossword puzzle book. A moment later they came upon a green mile marker. It read Mile 130.</p><p>Cameron watched it pass, and then leaned sideways to look at Ty in the rearview mirror. \u201cHow are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Ty asked in a bored voice.</p><p>Cameron huffed and glanced at Julian, who was watching Ty with one eyebrow raised.</p> <p>Ty tried to hide his smirk. He\u2019d been doing it for a solid hour, and not one of them had managed to figure out how. Ty was once again behind the wheel, trying not to zone out as the road stretched out before them in a seemingly endless roll of pavement, snow, and Holiday Inns.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s either doing complex math equations in his head, or he\u2019s got GPS embedded in his ass,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Cameron huffed and Ty allowed himself to grin. He glanced at Zane, his only real source of amusement, and he smirked as he turned his attention to the road.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s a quiz,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the last set of questions they asked before I got accepted for Recon.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up from his crossword puzzle to give Ty a sideways glance. \u201cAre you this bored?\u201d he asked in a knowing tone.</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cJust trying to pass the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI live to be your favorite source of entertainment,\u201d Zane drawled. \u201cWhat are the questions?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him again, raising an eyebrow. Zane gave him an innocent look. Ty huffed at him, but he was still smiling when he asked the first question. \u201cHow do you put a giraffe in a refrigerator?\u201d</p><p>Cameron groaned in the backseat. \u201cIf the answer involves knives I want out of the car.\u201d</p><p>Zane tipped his head to the side, his brows drawn together. He opened his mouth to reply, paused and narrowed his eyes at Ty, then hummed. \u201cOpen the door and stuff it in.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at him, trying to hide his smile. \u201cVery good. How do you put an elephant in a refrigerator?\u201d</p><p>Zane leaned his head back against the headrest as he drummed his fingers on his thigh. \u201cI feel like this is a trick question. Same answer, though.\u201d</p><p>Ty was shaking his head. \u201cYou have to take the giraffe out first.\u201d He glanced in the rearview mirror at their prisoners. Julian was watching them, head cocked as he listened. Ty continued. \u201cThe Lion King is hosting an animal convention. All the animals attend except one. Which one is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord,\u201d Zane said under his breath as he shook his head and looked out the window. A soft laugh from behind them drew his attention, and he looked over his shoulder to see Cameron biting his lip, trying not to smile.</p> <p>Zane wrinkled his nose and looked back at Ty. \u201cIt\u2019s like those tests in grade school with a whole long list of questions to answer, and all you had to do was get to question three, sign your name, and turn it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d Ty asked all of them.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to participate on the grounds that I hate you both,\u201d Julian murmured.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should know this,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIs it the animal the Lion King is serving for dinner?\u201d Cameron asked, a wry undertone to his voice.</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe elephant isn\u2019t there,\u201d Julian finally said in an irritated voice. \u201cBecause you just stuffed it into the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ty said as he tried not to smile. \u201cLast question. There\u2019s a river you have to cross that\u2019s patrolled by crocodiles, and you don\u2019t have a boat. How do you get across?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk the crocodile for a ride,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSwim,\u201d Zane said instead.</p><p>Ty turned his chin and looked at him for his reasoning.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the crocodiles?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cThe crocodiles aren\u2019t there. They\u2019re at the convention,\u201d Zane said with a shrug, and Cameron scowled at him.</p><p>Ty grinned before looking back at the road.</p><p>\u201cYou realize those are questions they ask schoolchildren to test their reasoning skills, yes?\u201d Julian provided sardonically.</p><p>Ty nodded, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cSo did you get them all right when they asked you?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cFor their purposes, you weren\u2019t supposed to get them right. They said they accepted me because my answers were wrong but precisely what they wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I cannot imagine what you came up with,\u201d Zane said, shaking his head. \u201cYou figured I\u2019d pick it apart logically. Which is the total opposite of what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what you\u2019d do,\u201d Ty told him fondly.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d asked the last question first? I\u2019d have said shoot the crocodiles,\u201d Zane admitted.</p><p>Ty shook his head, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGrady\u2019s answer was build a bridge,\u201d Julian murmured from the back seat.</p><p>Ty looked up at the mirror, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know that, Julian?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>Julian looked up, meeting Ty\u2019s eyes in the mirror. \u201cBecause it\u2019s what I would have said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes lingered on the mirror before he was able to tear his attention away and focus on the road again. He shifted in his seat, unsettled and wishing he\u2019d never said anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat mile are we at now?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>Ty\u2019s gaze darted to the side of the road, seeking out a structure. They came upon an overpass, and he found one of the tiny blue signs he\u2019d noticed that told the mile to the exact decimal. \u201c142.7.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, they came upon another mile marker.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell is he doing that?\u201d Cameron asked as Zane chuckled.</p><p>Ty looked into the mirror, only to find Julian\u2019s dark eyes already watching him. He could tell that Julian knew exactly how he was doing it.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you two end up together, anyway?\u201d Zane asked, oblivious to Ty\u2019s sudden discomfort and Julian\u2019s eyes boring a hole into his soul.</p><p>\u201cI was his waiter,\u201d Cameron answered.</p><p>\u201cHow... romantic,\u201d Ty said as he honestly tried to find a more appropriate word.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Cameron murmured.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a look. Ty supposed no one would call the way they met romantic either. Love was love, though. Ty wanted desperately to reach out to Zane and touch him. He refrained, tightening his fingers on the steering wheel instead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the most important thing in my life,\u201d Julian said, his low voice echoing what Ty was thinking.</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Julian raised one finger, all the movement Ty\u2019s method of restraint allowed him. \u201cLove isn\u2019t a gentle thing. I\u2019ve found it carries a club and a bullwhip and doesn\u2019t care when or who it strikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy knight in shining plate armor,\u201d Cameron murmured.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t try to hold back his soft laugh, though it trailed off. Ty glanced over to find Zane looking at him wistfully. \u201cKind of like getting pushed off a cliff,\u201d he said without taking his eyes off Ty.</p><p>Julian was silent for a moment, merely watching Ty and Zane. Observing them. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it a problem. Loving Cameron is easy. He\u2019s the reason I try so very hard every day not to be killed,\u201d he said with a hint of what might have been humor.</p><p>\u201cAnd the danger it puts him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost lost him to it when I tried to shield him from it,\u201d Julian answered unflinchingly, not even hesitating to say the words as Cameron watched him. \u201cI kept things from him, things I knew would scare him. When he found out the true dangers of being with me, he was indeed scared and angry with me for keeping them secret, and he sent me away. We got a second chance. Now we deal in truth. He is his own man, he makes his own decisions. My conscience is clear on that note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept when he\u2019s about to freeze to death in a blizzard,\u201d Ty murmured while trying to ignore the sword chopping at his own conscience.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane whispered, shaking his head.</p><p>Ty huffed at him.</p><p>It was a few minutes before Zane finally asked, \u201cHow did you know that you loved him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult to say,\u201d Julian answered thoughtfully. \u201cA number of things, really. The biggest, however, was the excruciating pain it caused me to think of life without him in it.\u201d</p><p>Cameron was smiling, watching Julian like he was the only thing in the world.</p><p>Julian laughed. \u201cSomething that torturous can only be love.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted, carefully avoiding looking at Ty.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re familiar with it,\u201d Julian observed drily.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane again, unable to keep his lips from curving into a smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said as he turned around and eased back into his seat. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m familiar with it.\u201d</p><p>TY PULLED the FBI sedan into the parking lot of the Commodore Perry Travel Plaza just as the sun was setting. It wasn\u2019t snowing, but even on the Ohio turnpike there was at least six inches of snow, and when the frigid wind kicked up, the top dusting flew in their faces and stung anything that wasn\u2019t covered.</p><p>They bowed their heads as they fought through the cold to the brand-new travel plaza building. It was mostly empty inside, with lots of open lobby space in a hexagonal shape around a center convenience shop.</p><p>Zane held tighter to Julian\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cOoh, Starbucks,\u201d Cameron said as he leaned toward the row of shops to their right.</p><p>\u201cI thought they over roasted their beans,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>Cameron snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get some gum or something,\u201d Julian said to Zane as Ty led Cameron toward the restrooms.</p><p>Zane glanced at him and hummed as he studied the narrow aisles of the convenience store. \u201cTry anything in there and I\u2019ll put you down.\u201d</p><p>Julian gave him a single nod.</p><p>Zane walked him over to the store, giving the restrooms a last glance. He and Julian meandered through the aisles of the convenience store, Zane watching Julian and Julian looking for something he didn\u2019t seem to be finding. When he reached for a pack of gum, his linked hands knocked over an entire row of condom and tampon boxes.</p><p>Julian cursed under his breath, glancing at the clerk as he lifted his hands to show Zane that they were empty. Zane sighed and glanced at the clerk as well. She was watching them with a wary frown. Zane waved at her and smiled, and when he looked back at Julian, the man was stooping to pick up the boxes. Zane watched his movements closely, making certain he wasn\u2019t doing anything nefarious. Then he plucked a pack of gum off the rack and led Julian to the desk.</p><p>Five minutes and a bathroom break later, they met Ty and Cameron in line for coffee.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane spared himself a moment to just stare at his partner. He nodded before Ty could grow worried. They locked eyes, and Ty began to smile before he looked away.</p><p>They could not get home soon enough.</p><p>They filled the car with gas, Zane letting Julian stand in the cold wind to stretch his legs so he\u2019d stop complaining, and then they hit the road again. An hour later they were closing in on Cleveland. Zane watched the Erie County water tower pass by, and he realized he was growing drowsy. He rubbed at his eyes and glanced at Ty.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty jerked his head to the side and nodded. \u201cCouple more hours we\u2019ll get something to eat, some caffeine. I think we can get to DC tonight if we both drive.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d Ty whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll wake you when it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. That\u2019s sweet,\u201d Julian said in a wry voice.</p><p>Ty and Zane both ignored him.</p><p>Zane reached to lay his chair back, preferably on top of Julian\u2019s head, but as soon as his fingers found the button, the car made a sputtering sound.</p><p>Ty raised his hand off the wheel and looked at the gauges.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Cameron asked. The car jerked and began to slow.</p><p>Ty managed to get the car off the highway before it died completely. It chugged and grumbled and lurched to a stop. The engine went quiet, throwing the car into the otherworldly silence of a landscape covered with snow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty said in irritation.</p><p>\u201cDid our car just die?\u201d Cameron asked, an edge of panic to his voice. \u201cAre we going to freeze now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty answered as he ran his hand over his chin.</p><p>Zane looked around them. The moon was out in full force, reflecting off the blanket of snow. They could see for miles, and it wasn\u2019t a comforting view. There was nothing around them. There wasn\u2019t even a glow of lights in the night sky that would signify a shopping center or small town within a few miles. \u201cFucking Ohio,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Ty exhaled, and the slowly cooling air frosted with his breath. \u201cCross,\u201d he said, voice deceptively calm. \u201cWhat did you do to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched the vehicle, Agent Grady.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at Zane, clenching his jaw. \u201cWhat did he do in that travel place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot some gum. Knocked over some condoms. Took a piss, and stood in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Ty rubbed his eyes, lowering his head. \u201cDid you put a condom in the gas tank?\u201d he asked Julian. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julian was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou put a condom in the gas tank.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned to look back at Julian. \u201cHow do you even do that?\u201d</p> <p>Julian looked away, meeting Cameron\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf we start freezing, we\u2019re eating Cameron first,\u201d Ty grunted before unbuckling his seatbelt and climbing out of the car.</p><p>JULIAN had to restrain a smirk as the two FBI agents got out of the car. He could feel the cold seeping through the glass of the windows, and while it wasn\u2019t ideal to be stuck where they were, it would have to serve.</p><p>\u201cDid you really kill the car?\u201d Cameron asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou have to give me some credit for being subversive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, freezing to death in the middle of Ohio really turns me on.\u201d</p><p>Julian grinned, chuckling as he looked out the window at Ty and Zane. They stood at the front of the car, Zane calm as he spoke, Ty gesticulating wildly instead of using words. They were discussing something quite heatedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they fighting about?\u201d</p><p>Julian could take his guesses. \u201cI would say Grady wants to shoot me. Garrett is telling him no, too much paperwork. Then Grady will move on to how to get help. Garrett will suggest calling for a rental, Grady will be more... illegal, and likely want to go steal one.\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed.</p><p>\u201cListen, Cam. When I make my move, I want you to aim for the pressure points like I taught you and then run.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJulian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, love. These men are delivering us to our end. Either I\u2019ll be killed, or I\u2019ll be conscripted back into service, and either way, you won\u2019t be allowed to come with me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Cameron met his eyes, swallowing hard as he nodded.</p><p>Julian let his eyes linger on his lover for a few moments, and then looked back at Ty and Zane. To his surprise, Ty had turned and was walking off across the white field of snow toward a side road on the other side of a fence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d he whispered as he watched Ty put a hand on a fencepost and leap over the barbed wire.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p><p>The front door popped open and Zane slid into the passenger seat. He brought a gust of cold air with him before he shut the door.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to let him walk off into the snow?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back,\u201d Zane assured them, as calm and steady as ever.</p><p>Julian looked from him to the retreating figure of his partner in the distance. This hadn\u2019t gone to plan at all. Julian had anticipated a rental being called, exchanging vehicles, the two agents being distracted and irritated enough that he could get the drop on them as he was transferred. He hadn\u2019t expected Ty to storm off into the darkness alone.</p><p>\u201cAgent Garrett, while I don\u2019t pretend to particularly like your partner, I have to express some concern over this plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern is noted,\u201d Zane said, his voice stilted and curt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s below freezing out there, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian,\u201d Cameron whispered.</p><p>Julian glanced at him and licked his lips, trying to force his shoulders to relax. He wanted to get away, but he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for the death of either of these men. They were only doing as they\u2019d been ordered, just like Julian had done for so many years.</p><p>Zane turned his head to look back at them. \u201cIf either of you knew Ty like I do, you\u2019d be more worried about us freezing than him.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, a pair of headlights flashed behind them, rousting all of them from a cold-induced doze. Julian craned his neck to watch the car approach. It slowed as it neared them, revealing itself to be a truck or SUV of some sort. Julian would have guessed it was an older vehicle from the shape of the headlights. The driver flashed the lights again before pulling up behind their sedan. The lights didn\u2019t shut off, and Julian could barely make out the figure that stepped out of the SUV and walked toward them.</p><p>Ty opened the driver\u2019s side door and ducked in to look at them. \u201cGot us a ride,\u201d he said, voice hoarse and gruff.</p><p>Zane got out of the car and slammed the door. The trunk opened, and Julian could feel them removing things from the back to transfer. Julian flexed his fingers, trying to get the blood pumping. If they could catch Ty and Zane by surprise now, after the effects of the cold had made them slower and less aware, then they might be able to take whatever vehicle Ty had found and make a clean getaway.</p><p>His fingers were stiff and cold. His whole body was. He also realized, somewhat belatedly, that his mind wasn\u2019t working at full speed either. Ty and Zane weren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019d gotten cold and sleepy.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked, his voice sluggish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid my plan has backfired. I didn\u2019t expect the exchange to take so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d Cameron whispered.</p><p>The trunk slammed. Julian turned his head just in time to see Ty and Zane standing in the light of the headlights, Zane\u2019s hands on Ty\u2019s face. For a brief moment, Julian thought they were kissing. He closed his eyes and shook his head. When he opened his eyes again, Zane was merely feeling Ty\u2019s cheeks, apparently to check that he was warm.</p><p>\u201cI believe... I might be hallucinating,\u201d Julian muttered as he tried to shift enough to get his blood flowing.</p><p>Cameron didn\u2019t respond, he merely looked at Julian, his eyes glazing over. The door popped open at Julian\u2019s elbow, and Ty reached in to unlock his handcuffs. Ty pulled him out of the car, and the blast of cold was enough to make Julian gasp.</p><p>\u201cCold, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ty asked through gritted teeth as he pushed Julian chest-first against the sedan.</p><p>Julian waited until Zane had freed Cameron. Then he rammed his elbow into Ty, catching him on the chin. Ty stumbled back and Julian turned, finally having gotten the drop on the man. He swung at him and Ty leaned away from his fist, dodging the blow. Instead of squaring against him to prepare for the brawl, Ty lunged at him. He jumped, turning sideways in the air, kicking out at Julian. He wrapped his arm around Julian\u2019s neck. One foot went between Julian\u2019s legs, the other on the outside of his knee. Then he wrenched his body sideways as he fell, wrapping Julian up and taking him to the ground.</p><p>By the time they hit the snow, Julian was completely immobilized, his legs tangled in Ty\u2019s, in a headlock as he struggled to free himself.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay,\u201d Ty called back, his voice freakishly calm as Julian tried to find a pressure point or something to fight back with. \u201cGet the kid in the car. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Julian gritted his teeth. \u201cWhy is an ex-Recon Marine trained in Russian Sambo?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t answer, merely tightened his hold on Julian so he couldn\u2019t speak as they both shivered with the cold seeping into them.</p><p>ZANE hastily secured Cameron in the sedan before rushing over to the other side of the car, his gun drawn.</p><p>Both men were on the ground, Ty wrapped around Julian and restraining him with his body. It looked a little too much like they were spooning.</p><p>Zane grumbled under his breath and bent over them. \u201cQuit messing around. I\u2019m freezing,\u201d he told them, and then he put the muzzle of his gun to Julian\u2019s forehead and grabbed him by his collar.</p><p>They stood him up, Zane keeping his gun on him as Ty bullied him over to the other vehicle.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know where Ty had found the old Bronco II, but Zane was glad he had. Ty used every bit of bungee cord, rope, and handcuffs they had to strap Julian down in the back of the Bronco. Then they moved Cameron over and tied him down too.</p><p>When they were finally all in the car, the heat chugging, Zane felt like he could breathe easily again. He glanced at Ty.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find this thing?\u201d he asked, unable to keep from being amused.</p><p>\u201cOld barn near that water tower we passed. It had a cracked cylinder head. I found one to replace it in a Ranger nearby and hotwired it. It won\u2019t go far, but it\u2019ll get us to a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him for a second before glancing behind them. Both of their prisoners were tied down, blocked by the rear seat. Zane reached out and set his hand on Ty\u2019s thigh, squeezing. \u201cNicely done,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty set his hand on Zane\u2019s, letting their fingers lace together. He looked at Zane and gave him a tense smile. Zane didn\u2019t move his hand as they drove on into the night.</p><p>\u201cWE FOUND the car, sir,\u201d Agent X told his boss as he stood on the side of the road in the freezing cold.</p><p>\u201cThey dumped it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It appears it broke down. I suspect the gas tank is the culprit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe engine is fine. The car won\u2019t start. I believe Cross sabotaged it. They left the keys in it, and there are signs of a struggle on the side of the road. Another car was here, possibly a truck or SUV. I believe they stole the car and switched over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. They took their toll ticket. They have to have it to get off the highway. As soon as it comes up, we\u2019ll know what exit they\u2019ve taken and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Keep me apprised. We have to get Cross before they deliver him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>TWENTY minutes after Ty had dropped them off and told them he was going to stash the stolen car, Ty still wasn\u2019t back. How long did it take to dump a broken-down Bronco in rural Macedonia, Ohio? Zane sighed and looked at Cameron, who was sitting uneasily on the other bed, looking toward the bathroom where Ty had left Julian cuffed to the plumbing again.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Zane said gruffly, waving a hand toward the bathroom.</p><p>Cameron blinked at him and then smiled gratefully. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and he hurried to join Julian.</p><p>\u201cLeave the door open,\u201d Zane said as Cameron disappeared inside. \u201cJust remember I can shoot him before he can get to the door.\u201d</p><p>Zane took off his jacket and slung it into the sink of the tiny kitchenette before thumping down on the end of the bed. He was tired. This trip was testing his patience. And what the hell was taking Ty so goddamn long?</p><p>It was another ten minutes, maybe more, before there was a scratch at the door and Zane heard the key card swipe. Ty pushed into the room, face flushed from the cold, flecks of snow melting on his shoulders. He was carrying a small paper bag.</p><p>He looked around the room as he stepped in. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth and swallowed the sharp remark that was his gut response. \u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>Ty nodded curtly. \u201cThat won\u2019t hold him all night,\u201d he said, not even bothering to try explaining why walking a mile or two in the snow had taken him nearly an hour to manage. Zane played the whole prospective explanation and resulting argument through in his head and decided to just not go there. Ty had done a lot of walking in the snow tonight.</p><p>\u201cOur options are rather limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you come up with?\u201d Ty asked. He shrugged out of his coat, then tossed it onto the tiny table between the television and the kitchenette.</p><p>\u201cI thought about cuffing him to the underpinning of the bed, but it\u2019s junk. He\u2019d probably break it,\u201d Zane answered.</p><p>Ty stared at him, waiting for him to continue, and Zane resisted the urge to snap at him. Tempers were getting shorter, and it didn\u2019t help that they couldn\u2019t touch or even speak openly to each other in front of their prisoners. Zane reminded himself to stay calm. \u201cWe could attach him to the refrigerator. Even if he did get out, he wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere fast.\u201d</p><p>Ty was nodding slowly as Zane spoke. \u201cHow?\u201d he asked in a flat voice.</p><p>Zane shrugged, mind churning. \u201cUse his belt and the chill grate? Fasten it behind his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd essentially give him a nice sharp metal weapon when he gets lose,\u201d Ty said, sounding disgusted. He picked up the bag he\u2019d been carrying and opened it up to extract a gas station box of Benadryl. He held it up, looking at Zane grimly. \u201cHow many of these things would it take to put you down?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at the package, then up at Ty, and it was all too clear how far Ty had been pushed: too far. \u201cAbsolutely not. You\u2019re not drugging him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s not smothering one of us in our sleep,\u201d Ty said, voice sharp and serious. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, Zane, but I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m too fucking tired, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to fall asleep tonight, let down my guard, and not wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. If you need to sleep, sleep. I can stay awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. You are just as exhausted as I am!\u201d Ty tossed the box of Benadryl onto the table and pulled his gun out of its holster to check the clip.</p><p>Zane took in a deep breath through his nose, hanging on to his patience with everything he had. \u201cYou do need sleep, because you\u2019d never try this in your right mind. Knock him out, tie him up, hell, strip him nude, but you\u2019re not drugging him.\u201d What if Cross had some crazy reaction to the drugs like Ty often did, and died? Burns would forgive them some surface damage to the asset, but dead wouldn\u2019t go over well at all.</p><p>Ty rammed the clip home, the noise unmistakable in the otherwise quiet hotel room. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Plan B then,\u201d he said in a deceptively calm voice. He pushed away from the table and headed for the bathroom, gun still in his hand.</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t sure what was worse. He was certain\u2014all right, almost certain\u2014Ty wouldn\u2019t just shoot Julian. Well, kind of certain. Maybe. \u201cGrady... what are you going to do?\u201d he called, hearing the dread in his own voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty didn\u2019t answer him. Zane heard him push the door open and bark at Cameron to get out. Zane rubbed a hand over his eyes and waited, using the time to list possible worst-case scenarios, the fallout, how much paperwork would be involved, and if any said scenarios would afford him and Ty some peace and quiet sooner rather than later. Now that he thought about it, drugging Cross just a little might not be such a bad idea.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. He was sleep-deprived; just the fact that he had that thought was proof.</p><p>Ty grabbed Cameron by the arm and shoved him out into the suite. Zane watched the man stumble into the table, knocking over the box of Benadryl.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Cameron asked, rubbing his hip.</p><p>Zane just shook his head. \u201cBetter stay out of the way,\u201d he said, jerking a thumb back toward the bed. Cameron nodded, keeping his eyes on the bathroom door.</p><p>A moment later Ty dragged Julian out of the bathroom, quite the noisy affair since Julian was threatening Ty with all matter of bodily harm if he touched Cameron again. Zane was pretty sure the only reason Julian didn\u2019t fight back was the gun in Ty\u2019s hand. Cameron had to hop out of the way as Ty propelled Julian forward and slammed him into the table, shoving at him from behind and pressing his face and chest to the tabletop.</p><p>Ty had done that to Zane a few times. Only he\u2019d never pressed a gun barrel to the base of Zane\u2019s skull like he did to Julian\u2019s right now. It occurred to Zane that he should probably rein Ty in any time now. He was supposed to be the rules lawyer of the two of them, the one who kept his partner from blithely charging into serious trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t cripple him,\u201d Zane said in place of further caution.</p> <p>Julian turned his head just enough to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. For the first time since they\u2019d picked him up in Chicago, the man looked worried. He didn\u2019t look scared like a normal person would be in that situation, but he did seem to be acknowledging that Ty had reached the end of his rope and just might shoot him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d already freed himself,\u201d Ty told Zane through gritted teeth. He was using his entire body to keep Julian pinned under him.</p><p>Zane glanced at Cameron, who gave him big, innocent doe eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re next,\u201d he warned the younger man. Cameron shrank back, guilt written all over him.</p><p>Ty gave the room one last scathing glance, obviously looking for something to secure Julian to that would keep him the entire night. But Zane knew there was nothing in the room that would alleviate Ty\u2019s concern, or his, enough to let them sleep.</p><p>Ty knew it too. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out his spare handcuffs, pushing into Julian from behind with the sharp part of his elbow. Julian winced but didn\u2019t make a sound as Ty put the handcuffs onto one of his wrists. Ty yanked the arm behind him, and Julian did gasp in complaint as his arm was jerked around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to enjoy this about as much as I am,\u201d Ty snarled at him. Then he slapped the other half of the cuffs onto his own wrist with a loud clink.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened as he fought down a spate of hysterical laughter. What kind of fickle bitch was Karma that they kept getting these insane cases? He was about to comment when Cameron beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? Sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cam, we\u2019re gonna slow dance!\u201d Ty shouted. He tossed his gun to Zane, where Julian couldn\u2019t reach it, and he took a step back and jerked Julian\u2019s arm to make him stand as well.</p><p>Zane caught the weapon out of pure reflex. Out of all the things Ty could have chosen to do, this hadn\u2019t made Zane\u2019s top ten. He was about to offer a crass comment when the deep shadows under Ty\u2019s eyes arrested him, and Zane just nodded his consent.</p><p>The way Ty and Julian fought reminded Zane of him and Ty when they\u2019d first met. What had sparked them to go from hating each other like these two did, to loving each other like they did now? Some random tumble of Fate, a fly-by jumble of chance. Zane didn\u2019t know, but he thanked God for it every day.</p><p>Ty and Julian stood toe to toe, now locked together for the night. Ty held up the keys to the handcuffs so Julian could see them, then tossed them to Zane as well. Zane was tired of having things thrown at him. He pocketed the keys and shoved Ty\u2019s gun in the back of his waistband.</p><p>\u201cUnless you smother me in my sleep and gnaw off my arm, I don\u2019t really see you getting out of this one,\u201d Ty said to Julian.</p><p>Julian was breathing heavily, obviously trying to calm himself. Then his shoulders sagged, and he nodded minutely. \u201cA truce for the night,\u201d he said, voice soft. \u201cI won\u2019t break your arm to get away, and you won\u2019t break my neck in the middle of a war flashback.\u201d</p> <p>Ty\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked back to Cameron, still standing off to the side like a spectator at a cockfight. \u201cI guess you two are taking that bed,\u201d Zane said, hating the thought. He and Ty would barely fit on the double bed together, and they were friendly, to say the least. There\u2019d be no way two big men like Ty and Julian could do it without contact.</p><p>When he looked back, Ty was staring at him. He looked like he hadn\u2019t slept in a week, worse than he\u2019d looked before he\u2019d bolted in Baltimore just weeks ago. He hadn\u2019t given details, but his trek through the snow to find a car had to have been harrowing.</p><p>Julian was messing with the sleeve of his shirt, and when he raised his arm, he pulled Ty\u2019s hand with it. Julian looked at Ty and flailed his hands in a rare display of frustration. \u201cI finally get to sleep in a bed, and I can\u2019t even get out of my shirt now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty growled, and he pushed Julian toward the bed. He gave Zane one last glance, and Zane met his eyes long enough to nod, hoping it conveyed his tacit acceptance of the situation. He didn\u2019t have to like it; he just had to get to tomorrow.</p><p>CAMERON shot straight up, pulse going into overdrive, when a piercing alarm blared in the darkness now lit by red lights flashing from small boxes on the ceiling. It was so loud he had to cover his ears, and he panted for breath, trying to wake up and remember where he was and why Julian wasn\u2019t with him.</p><p>There was a shout and a cry of pain from the next bed over, followed by a thump loud enough to be heard over the blaring alarm.</p><p>He saw a tall shadow move in front of him, and he relaxed. \u201cJulian?\u201d he called out, trying to be heard over the wailing alarm.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Julian who Cameron saw when the shadow stopped at the foot of the sagging bed. Cameron\u2019s brain finally kicked in with the details: it was Zane standing in front of him; they were in a scary-ass motel somewhere in Ohio; and Julian was in the next bed, sleeping while cuffed to Ty.</p><p>Cameron started trying to push himself out of the hollow in the center of the drooping mattress, but Zane was already flipping on the light. It took some wiggling and a push to get off the creaky bed, and Cameron was finally able to see Ty and Julian. Or at least see where they were supposed to be.</p><p>Ty was sprawled sideways across the double bed, lying on his belly, arm stretched over the edge of the bed to the point that his muscles were straining and taut under his thin T-shirt. Cameron could see Julian\u2019s hand sticking up over the edge of the mattress, fingers limp and attached to the handcuffs on Ty\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Cameron winced and hurried over to crouch next to Julian, who was sprawled on the floor, arm turned back at an awkward angle. \u201cJulian, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Julian groaned and turned his shoulders, trying to get off the floor while still in that position. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he muttered as he reached for Cameron.</p><p>Cameron leaned over to slide an arm around Julian\u2019s waist and give him some leverage to clamber to his feet. When Cameron looked up, Zane was standing right there, looking at the cuffs.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Zane said, grabbing Julian\u2019s cuffed wrist and holding it still, stopping the yanking motion. \u201cTy? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty said in a strained voice. He pushed to his hands and knees and shook his head. \u201cTried to go opposite ways.\u201d</p><p>Julian rubbed his shoulder and winced. The chain between them clanked accusingly. \u201cApparently I either weigh more than he does or I got out faster,\u201d he muttered with a hint of a smirk.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you fell on your ass.\u201d</p><p>Before anyone could answer, the alarm shut off just as suddenly as it had started.</p><p>They all stood in the ensuing silence, Ty\u2019s harsh breathing really the only sound to be heard.</p><p>Julian moved his arm, rotating his shoulder, and Ty allowed his hand to go with the motion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Julian grumbled.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cShould we check to see if there\u2019s a real fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall the front desk,\u201d Ty suggested. He was still frowning, and he looked oddly haunted by the events of the evening. Julian\u2019s words about having flashbacks now seemed like more than mockery between the two men.</p><p>Zane moved to the phone and called the front desk. After a moment of listening, he hung up. \u201cThere\u2019s a short somewhere. They\u2019ve got people coming to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will that take?\u201d Cameron asked, reluctantly pulling away from Julian to let him work out the kink in his shoulder. He\u2019d no more than gotten the last word out when the alarm shrieked again for about five seconds and quit.</p><p>\u201cAnswers that question,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Ty sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed at his eyes. Julian was forced to take a step closer, hovering over him and looking mutinous.</p><p>\u201cSit down and chill,\u201d Zane told Julian. \u201cOr I can break out the bungee cords and fasten your wrists to your ankles. It\u2019s great for the circulation.\u201d</p><p>Julian turned his head to look at Zane, and Cameron recognized the look in his eyes. His lover was about to kill something. A glance at Zane revealed the same look, and it made Cameron very nervous. Zane and Julian seemed far too much alike for his comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cuff him to me?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not a resistant force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly trying to keep him here,\u201d Zane said as he paced over to the window and looked out through the gauzy curtains.</p><p>\u201cBut he....\u201d Cameron stopped, looked up at the intensity on Julian\u2019s face, and then nodded. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty still had his head down, rubbing at his eyes. He sniffed but offered nothing to the conversation.</p><p>Zane looked over his shoulder at them, his eyes flickering from person to person. \u201cIt\u2019s 4 a.m. Get some more sleep,\u201d he said before walking past the bed to the light switch. \u201cCome on, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Zane\u2014\u201d Cameron started.</p><p>Julian\u2019s hand reached out to catch at him in the dark. \u201cCam,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>Cameron turned back to his lover.</p><p>Julian pulled him closer, pressing his lips to Cameron\u2019s ear. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered. His words were followed by another blast of the malfunctioning fire alarm. Ty gave a jerk.</p><p>Cameron winced as he felt Julian\u2019s arm jerked. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said.</p><p>Julian nodded and let go of him. \u201cGood night, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Ty grunted.</p><p>In a fit of frustration, Cameron huffed at Ty. \u201cDon\u2019t you have someone who misses you? Someone you miss?\u201d The alarm cut off again.</p><p>Ty looked up at him, and there was an odd flash in his eyes as the light reflected in them. It instantly made Cameron nervous. Ty stood to tower over him. \u201cYou know what? I do,\u201d Ty said. \u201cAnd the longer you two fuck around and draw this out, the longer I\u2019m away, the longer I go without being with the person I love. So how about you take your goddamn simpering advice on romance and stick it up your ass!\u201d</p><p>Cameron felt a pang of both shame and pain in the face of Ty\u2019s blunt honesty and obvious frustration. He\u2019d never thought about the lives the two agents had been pulled away from to do this. He backed up until he bumped into something, only to turn around and find out he\u2019d run into Zane, who was watching his partner, a slight smile pulling at his lips. Cameron shook his head and detoured around him, unable to say a thing in response.</p><p>Zane flicked the light off, and the room fell into silence. As soon as Cameron settled on the bed, the alarm cranked to life again. He curled up on his side, pulling a pillow over his head.</p><p>JULIAN waited until Zane had shut out the light again. Then he sat gingerly on the edge of the bed next to Ty. He was hesitant to speak at all; the agent\u2019s outburst had caught him just as off guard as it had Cameron. He absolutely loathed the moments where enemies became men with emotions and feelings.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said awkwardly, wincing in the dark.</p><p>Ty sighed loudly. The silence stretched on until Julian was fairly certain that both Cameron and Zane had dozed off once more.</p><p>Julian strained for something to say to the man that would border on polite, or even civil. But he was still fighting the almost overwhelming urge to throttle him. He cleared his throat and shifted, taking Ty\u2019s arm with him as he turned. \u201cThe last time I found myself handcuffed to someone and we had to sleep, we found it was actually more comfortable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sleep on your sides on the opposite arm, yeah,\u201d Ty said with a solemn nod.</p><p>Julian found himself staring in the low light, surprised. \u201cYou and your partner, you\u2019re not really the average field agents, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane is not an average anything,\u201d Ty said, voice soft and hoarse.</p><p>Julian frowned, confused by the answer at first, but he realized what Ty was doing. The man was as good at avoiding an answer as Julian was. Only he did it with such good ole boy, backwater sincerity that it probably worked better than Julian\u2019s methods. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ve just discovered why you and I hate each other so much.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. You and I were the same person at one juncture. You took one path, I another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re my evil twin?\u201d Ty asked. His voice was too tired to have any sarcasm in it.</p><p>Julian pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cFuck it, just.... You take this side, I\u2019ll take that one, see if we can keep our arms from going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Julian lay down obediently, disturbed and distracted by his new realizations. Outwardly he and Zane Garrett were very alike. But perhaps deeper down, Julian and Ty Grady were more alike than either man was comfortable with.</p><p>As if to accentuate his thoughts, the fire alarm blared to life again, and he and Ty both shot up in the bed before either could curtail the instinct. They sat in bed together, tense and looking at each other in the darkness, until the alarm cut off.</p> <p>\u201cI hate Ohio,\u201d Ty muttered before he flopped back to the bed.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Zane and Cameron both said from the other bed.</p><p>ZANE examined himself in the bathroom mirror as he towel-dried his hair and then tossed the towel onto the counter. Placing both hands on the vanity, he leaned forward, taking in the beard and exhausted eyes. Ty was right: the beard didn\u2019t suit him.</p><p>He was also convinced that going on short sleep for days on end with his mileage was not conducive to his health or his looks.</p><p>\u201cLooking good, Garrett,\u201d he mumbled. He picked up and shook out his new Henley before sliding an arm into it. He was putting the same clothes back on, but they weren\u2019t a mess. And after a shower he felt much better. He mentally patted himself on the back for picking up some deodorant, toothbrushes, and toothpaste when he was at that drug store in Chicago. It seemed like weeks ago.</p><p>They were coming up on four days that they\u2019d been on the road. They had been long days, and even Ty\u2019s normally amusing antics were wearing on his nerves. Having to constantly keep his gun pretty much trained on Julian didn\u2019t help. Zane was thankful he\u2019d gotten at least a little bit of time alone with Ty and some sleep, or he\u2019d really be going nuts.</p> <p>He smoothed down the shirt before opening the bathroom door. He was surprised to find not only Ty but also Julian standing right there at the door when it opened. Before he could react, Ty reached out and grabbed his arm, yanking him forward and snapping one half of a pair of handcuffs on his wrist.</p><p>He found himself handcuffed to their prisoner, who was looking at him with a sardonic smile.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Ty said happily.</p><p>Zane stared at him, incredulous, before reaching out and popping him upside the back of the head. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Ty danced away from him so he wouldn\u2019t risk another smack. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything solid to attach him to, and you won\u2019t let me drug him,\u201d he said as he rubbed at his head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re, you know... solid enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can cuff him to the damn toilet for all I care, but not to me!\u201d He pulled his wrist up and shook it along with Julian\u2019s arm. \u201cGive me the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must agree,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>The smile still on Ty\u2019s face made Zane want to wipe it away. Whether with a voracious kiss or a serious kick to the teeth, Zane hadn\u2019t yet decided.</p> <p>Ty held up the keys to the cuffs and shook his head as he put them into his jeans pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you something from Wendy\u2019s,\u201d he told them in what might have passed for a consoling tone.</p><p>Zane swiped out at Ty, but his partner took another step back and Zane was attached to the immovable object that was Julian, so he couldn\u2019t grab Ty before he edged around to the door. Cameron waited there already, looking uncertain and almost amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat if they kill each other?\u201d Cameron asked Ty. He sounded serious. Zane glanced at Julian, feeling the annoyance bubble just below a boil. He was probably right to be worried.</p><p>Ty idly scratched at his chin, looking at them. He glanced sideways at Cameron. \u201cShould we place bets?\u201d</p><p>Zane could hear Julian grinding his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Zane cut himself off before delivering a threat that wouldn\u2019t come from a partner. A working partner.</p><p>Cameron peered at Julian for a long moment before tipping his head to one side and considering Zane as well. \u201cI bet there won\u2019t be blood when we come back. And if I win, Julian and I get a night uncuffed in a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron!\u201d Julian said, sounding shocked.</p><p>Ty considered for a moment, then reached out to shake Cameron\u2019s hand. \u201cBet.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shrugged and looked at Julian apologetically. \u201cNow, don\u2019t throw the bet,\u201d he said, lips pressing down like he was hiding a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou two are real comedians,\u201d Zane said, lifting his hand to point at Ty in accusation before remembering it was attached to Julian, and he shook it with a frustrated growl before looking at Ty through narrowed eyes. \u201cYou know that threat you make when I really piss you off with the puns? That\u2019s coming your way. Big time.\u201d Meaning Ty wouldn\u2019t be getting fucked for some time to come.</p><p>Ty smirked, as if he looked forward to the challenge. \u201cHow\u2019s the Benadryl option looking now, Nurse Ratched?\u201d he asked. Then he jerked his head at the door, and he and Cameron exited before Zane or Julian could threaten them again.</p><p>Julian was silent for a long while, eyes narrowed, staring at the door. Zane figured they were having equally homicidal thoughts, not that it made him feel any better. If Ty didn\u2019t bring him back a damn Frosty, he was tearing a piece out of his ass, and not in a way Ty would enjoy.</p><p>Maybe. Zane wrinkled his nose. He knew damn well he\u2019d be all over Ty as soon as they had at least half an hour uninterrupted time alone. He could fuck Ty twice in that amount of time if he was really motivated, and Zane was really motivated now. Just the fact that sex was his first thought instead of throttling his partner was evidence enough.</p><p>Julian finally cleared his throat and moved his hand, making the handcuffs jangle. He looked sideways at Zane, his expression speculative.</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow and waited for what was sure to be a sarcastic remark veiled in icy politeness. It was Julian\u2019s style.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really starting to hate him,\u201d Julian said instead.</p><p>Zane snorted, thinking of last night and his thoughts about Ty and Julian mirroring himself and Ty when they first met. \u201cYeah, I know what you mean,\u201d he muttered. He raised their cuffed wrists and frowned at them.</p><p>\u201cI could pick it if we had something suitable,\u201d Julian said as he turned his wrist over, taking Zane\u2019s arm with it.</p><p>\u201cSo could I, but Grady knows that too,\u201d Zane said as he looked around the room, casting about for options. \u201cHe\u2019s very thorough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was forced to drag along behind him as he rid the room of every single shiny thing,\u201d Julian said. He looked around the room anyway, trying to find something Ty might have missed. \u201cShall we sit?\u201d he finally asked dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee he won\u2019t be getting takeout,\u201d Zane said under his breath as he turned in place and looked at seating options. There were the beds, one chair at the table, and the low dresser in a pinch. And as much as he wanted to be cranky, Zane knew being an asshole wouldn\u2019t make the time pass any faster. \u201cSure. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d Julian said under his breath as he took a step toward the closest one. Zane followed grudgingly, glad there wasn\u2019t anyone else here to see this. Eyes narrowing, Zane looked to the desk, where he\u2019d left his gun. It was gone.</p><p>\u201cHe took my gun!\u201d Zane said in outrage. That son of a bitch! He knew how Zane felt about being unarmed.</p><p>\u201cYou could pose that he took my gun,\u201d Julian countered with a hint of amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s already got more than his fair share,\u201d Zane said as he thumped down next to Julian on the edge of the bed.</p><p>Julian sat straight and proper, his back and shoulders rigid. He didn\u2019t feel tense, though. Merely sitting there to wait. Zane wondered if he\u2019d looked like that, all stick up his ass, when he\u2019d met Ty. With a sniff, he stretched out his legs toward the dresser and looked at the clock.</p><p>Julian\u2019s lack of movement was almost a novelty after so many months of being close to Ty. It was like sitting beside a stone statue. When he finally did move, it was to cock his head and look at the door.</p><p>\u201cI believe they\u2019re back,\u201d he said, voice laced with surprise.</p><p>Zane frowned as he glanced up. It hadn\u2019t even been enough time to get there on foot, much less have food and be back. \u201cHe must have forgotten something.\u201d But that didn\u2019t sit right. Ty wouldn\u2019t have forgotten something when he\u2019d planned like this. Zane pulled back his legs to stand, feeling uneasy.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d gained his feet, the flimsy door was kicked in and a burst of cold air flowed into the room as two men charged in. Zane didn\u2019t even think; he snatched Cameron\u2019s leather Dopp kit up from the dresser and backhanded it as hard as he could at the first man\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know who they were or what they wanted, but their method of entry was enough reason to take them out first and ask questions later. Leatherface threw up his hands with a yelp, and the Dopp kit stopped his headlong charge as it busted open, scattering its contents all over.</p><p>Zane\u2019s actions pulled Julian off-balance, and they stumbled as he fell into Zane. Julian righted himself just in time to pull a hand up and block a punch from a second man; then he kicked out and sent the attacker sprawling to the floor. That put Julian between Zane and Leatherface, so Zane rammed the heel of his shoes into Rugburn\u2019s gut.</p><p>Julian turned with his movement, their backs against each other. He was jerked back when the handcuffs and Zane\u2019s arm kept him from moving further, but he managed a roundhouse punch at Leatherface before he was pulled the other way and stumbled at Zane\u2019s side. Zane grunted as their shoulders collided, and he purposely dropped his left arm so Julian could move it. But the few seconds of distraction gave Rugburn a window of opportunity, and he raised a leg to kick out, his shoe catching Zane\u2019s jaw. The recoil sent Zane stumbling back a step, jerking the chain taut between him and Julian, and the backs of Zane\u2019s knees hit the other bed.</p><p>Rugburn stood to attack again, but Julian pulled Zane\u2019s arm, and the chain between them, hard at his neck. They caught him just right, and there was a sickening crunch as Rugburn crumpled to the floor.</p><p>But Leatherface had gained his feet. He held a gun pointed at Zane\u2019s face, his eyes narrowing as he looked at them each in turn.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you is Cross?\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped, his free hand curled into a fist, and gave Leatherface a once-over. Suit and tie, leather shoes, standard holster under his suit jacket, plain brown trench coat. His appearance screamed government agent, though Zane doubted that. Why would another agent break in on their assignment? Which meant freelancers, especially since they were looking for Cross.</p><p>Julian pointed at Zane in answer to the question. Zane smacked his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re interfering in an FBI investigation. I suggest you stand down,\u201d he told Leatherface.</p><p>The man shook his head. \u201cThis is a national security matter.\u201d He turned the gun toward Julian. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Julian struck out at him so quickly it was easy to think it was imagined. He grabbed the gun and pulled the slide, his free hand moving in a flash, and the gun fell apart in Leatherface\u2019s hand. Julian swung at him with the slide, hitting him in the temple and dropping him in a heap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing too close,\u201d he said to the unconscious man.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but admire Julian\u2019s speedy reaction. He\u2019d have to remember that trick with the slide. \u201cThat was... impressive,\u201d he said as he touched his hurting chin. His fingers came away bloody from his lip.</p><p>Julian turned to look at him. He stared for a moment and then sighed. \u201cCam lost his bet. Let\u2019s see if one of these two has a set of handcuff keys, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNational security,\u201d Zane muttered as he crouched down next to the man they\u2019d hit across the throat and checked for a pulse.</p><p>Julian had to bend over and hang his arm so Zane could do it. \u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he may wish he was when he wakes up,\u201d Zane said, eyeing the vivid bruise already coming up across the man\u2019s throat. He started searching the pockets of the man\u2019s trench and came up with a wallet. What he saw when he flipped it open made his stomach turn.</p><p>Julian hummed. \u201cTold you,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cWe should go find Cameron and Grady.\u201d</p><p>Zane studied the Langley entry ID, and from what he could tell, it was legit. He dropped it, pulled the man\u2019s gun and set it on the floor next to him, then dug out a set of keys. \u201cYou going to tell me what\u2019s really going on now?\u201d he asked as he reached over to claim the ammunition cartridge from the other gun. They were both standard-issue Glocks, the same as his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather wait to see if I can escape from you first,\u201d Julian answered candidly.</p><p>\u201cYou probably could,\u201d Zane said as he picked up the gun and stood, keys also in hand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help Cameron. Or the fact that the CIA wants your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. So unlock us and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned and calmly pressed the business end of the gun against Julian\u2019s midsection, the pommel brushing his own, they stood so close. \u201cIf they came at us here, we can be sure they went after Ty and Cameron too.\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t seem perturbed by the gun barrel in his belly. He glanced around the room and pursed his lips. \u201cCameron\u2019s bag is still mostly packed. Grab it and we\u2019ll go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane nodded but pulled Julian over to the table instead, gathering their things as quickly as possible. \u201cGet his stuff.\u201d</p><p>Julian did so, and he looked wryly at their joined hands. Zane wasn\u2019t about to unlock him now. \u201cDarling, I didn\u2019t know you cared,\u201d he said to Zane in a voice that was smooth as velvet. The irony was not lost in the tone, though.</p><p>\u201cYou give new meaning to ball and chain. Come on,\u201d Zane said as he looked out the broken doorframe.</p> <p>The corridor was clear, although Zane could hear the elevator moving with a whirr. He stepped out into the causeway, and Julian followed along, not offering another comment on their linked hands. After a mere moment\u2019s thought, Zane turned away from the elevator to walk swiftly to the stairs at the far end of the balcony. It could be Ty and Cameron in the elevator. Or not.</p><p>Again, Julian trailed along quietly, cooperating to the point that it was suspicious. At the stairwell door, Zane turned a serious, measuring look on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Julian whispered. \u201cI\u2019m being good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what bothers me,\u201d Zane muttered. With a shake of his head, he led the way through the door into the concrete stairwell.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t be quiet as they thundered down the stairs, but they were past the need for stealth now. Speed was their friend.</p> <p>Zane stuck his head out of the stairwell when they got to the ground level, and seeing no one around, he pulled Julian with him and they hurried toward the main office.</p><p>They reached the entrance to the hotel, a wild cast to their eyes as they looked around for any more suspicious men in suits.</p><p>As they stood there, a sleek black sedan came tearing into the parking lot, taking the hairpin turn and sliding up to a stop right in front of Zane and Julian.</p><p>Zane took a step back, wishing he had unlocked the handcuffs in the room. They had a better chance of splitting up and dividing their assailants than they did of fighting them off. He felt Julian coiling beside him, readying himself for their final stand. Zane pulled his gun.</p><p>The heavily tinted driver\u2019s side window slid down, and it took Zane a moment to realize he was looking at his partner.</p><p>\u201cPlaytime\u2019s over, kids!\u201d Ty called to them, voice urgent and gruff. \u201cI put them down, but I didn\u2019t take them out. They\u2019ll be after their car.\u201d</p> <p>Zane and Julian shared a look. They rushed for the back door, both of them diving into the car. Ty hit the gas before they could even get the door shut.</p><p>Cameron sat in the front seat, looking back at them with wide eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo guys jumped us on the way to get food,\u201d Cameron answered. \u201cTy is like... a ninja on crack. He beat them up pretty spectacularly. Then we stole their car.\u201d</p><p>Julian let out a pent-up breath.</p><p>\u201cThis CIA issue stuff is really nice,\u201d Ty told them as he fiddled with the buttons. \u201cWhy the hell can\u2019t the Bureau spring for rides like this?\u201d</p><p>Zane reached into his pocket and extracted the handcuff keys. \u201cTy,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, you can kick my ass later,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cTwo suits get after you too?</p> <p>\u201cAll over us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re not the only ones after MacGuffin back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously going to call me names after you almost got all of us killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be called names, how about telling us a real one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow me, Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds Scottish.\u201d</p><p>Julian lunged with one hand, fully intending to throttle Ty even if he was driving. Zane reached out and caught his hand, restraining him.</p><p>\u201cLet me do it, Garrett, it would make our lives so much easier!\u201d Julian said through gritted teeth as he struggled to free his hand. There was no trace of the calm and controlled Julian Cross they\u2019d met in Chicago.</p><p>Ty had that effect on just about everyone.</p><p>Zane pushed Julian back against the seat to calm him. He held up his hand and growled. \u201cIf anyone is strangling the life out of my partner today, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d</p><p>Julian huffed but finally nodded. \u201cAs long as I get to watch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>WHILE Ty was safely hidden away under the CIA vehicle, dismantling the GPS, Zane and Julian discussed their options. Cameron sat and listened, as he always did. They finally made the decision that they needed to get to DC as fast as possible, and to Cameron\u2019s surprise, Julian agreed that making it to DC was now what they wanted to do, rather than escaping.</p><p>\u201cThe enemy is too powerful. We need someone on our side. These two and their boss will have to do until we find someone bigger,\u201d he explained to Cameron.</p><p>It made sense, in a very Julian sort of way.</p><p>They headed for the nearest airport, which happened to be Pittsburgh. Ty and Zane didn\u2019t flash their badges this time, going for low-key as they went through the security checks. They had ditched their guns and wallets. Julian behaved himself, staying close to Cameron. It all went smoothly, which immediately put all of them on edge.</p><p>While standing in line with Zane to get a sandwich, Cameron watched as Julian moved around the sizeable shopping area in the airport, Ty trailing only a few steps behind him. Julian had assured the FBI agents that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere, but Ty didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>Cameron couldn\u2019t help but watch his lover. When other people noticed Julian, they tended to do one of three things: stare at him, hustle away, or some odd, jerky combination of the two. Cameron shook his head as a couple of teenage girls stopped and watched him pass.</p><p>\u201cI really feel for people sometimes,\u201d Cameron said once Julian was within hearing.</p><p>Julian raised an eyebrow and gave Cameron a fond smile. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, don\u2019t make him talk about his feelings,\u201d Ty muttered as he joined them.</p><p>Cameron shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re like a shark. You walk around and all the little minnows go swimming away.\u201d</p><p>Julian hummed and glanced around the room. Ty began to snicker quietly, and Julian looked over his shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Ty said as their eyes met. \u201cYour boyfriend just called you a shark. That\u2019s a besotted burn.\u201d</p><p>Cameron saw Julian just barely roll his eyes as he looked away from Ty and back at him. Cameron edged up a shoulder. He heard Zane laugh behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhile I appreciate the spirit of the observation, there is a flaw in your theory,\u201d Julian told him, voice lowering as he took a step closer.</p><p>Cameron tried not to grin. \u201cReally? Because you do like to bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord, TMI,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cThis whole trip has been TMI, Zane,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>Julian ignored both of their comments, returning them with a mere smile before he explained. \u201cA shark, while frightening to us, is not a threat to the minnow at first sight. We know what a shark can do, the minnow doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Ty rubbed his eyes. \u201cOh God, now I\u2019m actually agreeing with him.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shifted his weight to peer around Julian at Ty. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up and waved a hand at the airport around them. \u201cSharks eat fish, right? Or seals or... whatever. But if a seal is afraid of a shark on sight, then the shark will never get close enough to the seal to do anything.\u201d</p><p>Julian was nodding, looking moderately surprised that Ty knew what he\u2019d been talking about. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is if the prey recognized the predator as a danger, they would instantly flee. So the shark regulates its behavior. The majority of the time, a shark swims peacefully through schools of its prey, never causing trouble, never being pegged as a danger, barely noticed by the very things it hunts.\u201d</p><p>Cameron looked back and forth between them. \u201cSo... if you\u2019re not a shark, then what are you?\u201d</p><p>Julian winced, and to Cameron\u2019s surprise, he flushed as he looked down at his shoes. \u201cI\u2019ve always associated myself more with a lion,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy that,\u201d Ty said as he stepped away from the counter so Cameron could see him more fully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced,\u201d Cameron said, crossing his arms. He looked over his shoulder at Zane. \u201cDoes Julian look like a lion to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to answer that question on the grounds that it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Zane said, mimicking Julian\u2019s way of speech, before stepping up to order his food.</p><p>Cameron turned back to Julian. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig cats are the only predators on earth who are known to kill for fun,\u201d Ty provided almost merrily.</p><p>\u201cMeow Mix,\u201d Zane said over his shoulder in a flat tone.</p><p>\u201cYou said that before, at the apartment,\u201d Cameron remembered. \u201cWhen Ty picked up Wesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, he picked up Wesson?\u201d</p><p>Cameron nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrady has a codependent relationship with big cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne tried to eat me,\u201d Ty said, the answer flippant.</p><p>\u201cActually, that explains so much,\u201d Zane muttered to himself, looking between Ty and Julian.</p><p>Cameron rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy a lion, Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re large and territorial. They\u2019re feared on sight no matter if they\u2019re hunting or sunning on a rock. They take advantage of environmental factors to hunt and kill their prey. And they occasionally go rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd start killing for fun,\u201d Ty finished with a flourish of his hand.</p><p>Cameron turned up his nose. \u201cAnd what about you, Mr. Killing for Fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t kill for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant what are you? A bulldog?\u201d</p><p>Zane let out a sharp bark of laughter. Ty grunted at them both, no longer enjoying the game now that he was the focus.</p><p>Julian turned to look at him. He nodded as if coming to a decision. \u201cYou see, Cameron, of us all, Agent Grady is the real shark.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at Julian in outrage.</p><p>Cameron narrowed his eyes, studying Ty, trying to fit the description Julian gave earlier to what he\u2019d seen of Ty. Julian and Zane both turned heads with their imposing dark looks and brooding auras. They were both somber and controlled. Like sharks patrolling their territory as they weaved through a crowd. Ty, though, sort of struck Cameron as a playful puppy in comparison, flopping along, cracking jokes, handsome face usually open and smiling.</p><p>Maybe Julian was right.</p><p>\u201cDo you play poker?\u201d Cameron asked Ty.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Ty answered distractedly, still looking at Julian. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean, I\u2019m the shark? I\u2019m not a shark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shark,\u201d Zane said as he turned away from the counter with a drink in hand, though his words sounded begrudged.</p><p>Ty gave him a wounded look, and Cameron almost felt sorry for him.</p><p>Julian nodded, satisfied. \u201cOf all of us, he\u2019s the one someone in trouble would approach for help,\u201d he told Cameron. He waved a hand at Ty. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem outwardly dangerous, in fact, quite the opposite. So the wounded little fishies just swim right up to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Ty grunted, shoulders tightening.</p><p>\u201cBut he has probably killed more people than myself and Agent Garrett combined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being mean,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cYou remember what Clancy said. You go around bitching and people still like you because you\u2019re charming. You can\u2019t help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping, Zane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Ty\u2019s a big cat too,\u201d Cameron said, not comfortable with the talk of kill counts and still feeling sorry for Ty and the wounded look in his eyes. Maybe Ty really was a shark, dangerous and dashing and still managing to make Cameron feel sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Julian murmured, still looking at Ty. \u201cHe\u2019s a shark.\u201d</p><p>Cameron glanced to Zane. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in the year of the horse,\u201d Zane said. He was leaning against the counter, waiting for their order.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a horse,\u201d Ty told him, sounding truly offended by the entire conversation now.</p><p>\u201cI think maybe... a bear. A big grizzly bear,\u201d Cameron said as he studied Zane.</p><p>\u201cA bear fits,\u201d Julian agreed.</p><p>\u201cA bear?\u201d Zane shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, looking at Zane with narrowed eyes. \u201cOh!\u201d he said suddenly, pointing at his partner. \u201cHe\u2019s an elephant!\u201d</p><p>Julian looked back at Ty and then at Zane, almost laughing, but then he nodded in surprise again. \u201cThat\u2019s... disturbingly fitting.\u201d</p><p>Cameron had to laugh when he saw the look on Zane\u2019s face. He was staring at his partner in clear disbelief. \u201cAn elephant?\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re killers, man,\u201d Ty told him, voice trembling with laughter.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to agree with him,\u201d Julian murmured, waving at Ty with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cAn elephant?\u201d Zane repeated. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey lose their tempers and trample and gore and cause mayhem all the time,\u201d Ty said, his voice flippant but his eyes glittering.</p><p>Zane crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes, glowering.</p><p>Cameron cleared his throat and whistled as he turned to look at Julian. Julian was trying desperately not to smile.</p><p>\u201cElephants are unpredictable creatures,\u201d Ty told Zane, voice lower and mockingly earnest.</p><p>Zane cocked his head to one side. \u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>Cameron edged away from Zane and reached down to pick up the second tray of food they\u2019d been waiting for. \u201cHow do you two know so much about killer animals, anyway? I know you don\u2019t watch Discovery Channel, Julian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julian licked his lips, sharing a look with Ty that was oddly familiar, as if they shared a secret. \u201cStudying the way animals stalk is an effective way to... sell antiques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cameron drew out, keeping his eyes on Julian and shaking his head.</p><p>Zane groaned and rubbed his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Simba, go buy me some lemonade while I find a table,\u201d Cameron said, hooking his arm through Julian\u2019s.</p><p>Ty and Zane remained behind them for only the briefest of moments, glaring at each other, before Ty broke away to trail behind them. Cameron got the very distinct feeling that they were communicating silently and that they would be discussing elephants the next time they were alone.</p><p>When Ty joined Cameron at the table, it was just the two of them. Zane had gone off to find a restroom, and Julian was waiting in line for a lemonade.</p><p>Cameron sat in the metal chair with his club sandwich as he watched Julian. It was always interesting to observe him interacting with strangers, whether he was a lion or a shark or a teddy bear. He was much the same as when Cameron had met him: mostly silent, otherwise soft-spoken and succinct. It had made for a challenge when Cameron served as his waiter at Tuesdays, the gourmet restaurant where they\u2019d met. It still made him smile, thinking about how he\u2019d been so sure Julian hadn\u2019t even known he existed.</p><p>Ty thumped down beside him and huffed, breaking his reverie. \u201cYou know how you can tell when someone\u2019s really in love?\u201d Ty asked him out of the blue, his tone casual. He glanced sideways at Cameron, one eyebrow raised. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting here, watching him do something completely mundane, and you\u2019re grinning like an idiot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Cameron asked with a light laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, you make my teeth hurt,\u201d Ty grumbled, though Cameron could see the barest hint of something beneath the gruff exterior, perhaps amusement.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re just as sentimental as I am. You hide it better,\u201d Cameron claimed, remembering Ty\u2019s snappy response about being away from his loved ones. \u201cI just don\u2019t have to hide it at all. It\u2019s really freeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d Ty murmured. Though his eyes still followed Julian\u2019s movements, they seemed to be staring off into the distance as well, as if he was seeing someone or something else. Cameron wondered, as he looked at Ty, what sort of person a man like him would love. Ty shook it off and glanced down, then looked away as if he sensed Cameron\u2019s eyes still on him.</p><p>Cameron took a bite of his sandwich. \u201cDon\u2019t you get tired of it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis tough guy image?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t look at him, but Cameron could see his eyes gaining distance again. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he answered, voice matter-of-fact and melancholy.</p> <p>A glance showed Cameron that Julian was accepting the cups from the lady at the counter. Ty would totally clam up once Julian walked over. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Julian was able to adapt,\u201d Cameron offered, hoping Ty might be able to see it could be done. \u201cYou just have to love the right person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I don\u2019t?\u201d Ty asked in an oddly distant voice.</p><p>Cameron was brought up short, staring at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cI have a finely tuned macho bullshit detector, and it\u2019s shrieking,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou get a lot of macho bullshit from your boyfriend over there?\u201d Ty asked in what seemed to be sincere curiosity. But with Ty, it was hard to tell what was said in seriousness and what wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Cameron shifted uncomfortably. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d he asked, watching Ty.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Bullshit? I work for the government, man.\u201d Ty laughed and shook his head.</p><p>Cameron repressed a smile. \u201cNo. That Julian and I are lovers.\u201d</p><p>Ty was already shaking his head, as if he\u2019d known all along that was what Cameron had been referring to. \u201cNow who\u2019s making generalizations? Just because I wear flannel doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an asshole.\u201d His knee was no longer bouncing, and he seemed to have finally relaxed a little as he sat there. \u201cGuy\u2019s willing to charge into a room full of guns to protect you and then drag you across the country in handcuffs to keep you with him. Seems like a keeper to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a keeper,\u201d Cameron agreed, even though Ty\u2019s words were sarcastic. He cleared his throat. \u201cAnd Julian is indeed a master of macho bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he seems the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it,\u201d Ty said. He didn\u2019t seem to take it as an insult, or anything else, really. Just a fact. That alone intrigued Cameron. The more Cameron got to know Ty, the more he realized that the guy seemed to have absolutely no shame.</p><p>\u201cSo you met him at a restaurant,\u201d Ty said almost to himself.</p><p>Cameron nodded. \u201cTuesdays is a very nice restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuesdays,\u201d Ty repeated. He mulled over the name for a while and then nodded. \u201cI can see why that name would draw a man like that. Wait, wait, let me guess,\u201d he said in amusement as he held out his hand to Cameron. \u201cMan that named it was a friend of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d Cameron asked in shock, his hand straying to rub at his throat, where the necklace Julian had given him used to hang before it was lost. He still missed its reassuring weight, if not the symbolism of it.</p><p>\u201cEuropean criminals. They love their mythology. Tuesday was Mars, the god of war. That restaurant is like a beacon to anyone wanting to deal.\u201d</p><p>Cameron almost laughed. He\u2019d had to Google the information when neither Julian nor Blake would tell him. \u201cYou know more than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what a federal agent does when he\u2019s not watching other people,\u201d Ty told him with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cRead up on European mythology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shook his head, amused that he was constantly being surprised by both Ty and Zane. They were anything but what they appeared on the surface.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t speak again. He didn\u2019t even move, not a twitch of a muscle or bat of an eye. Cameron frowned and tipped his head, then tried to follow Ty\u2019s line of sight. But it didn\u2019t seem that he was looking at anything but the blank terminal walls over by the restrooms. Cameron sat back and took another bite of sandwich, turning his chin to offer Julian a smile as he joined them at the tiny table.</p><p>For once Ty didn\u2019t have anything snappy or clever to say to Julian. He was still sitting stock-still, now staring at the food counter where Julian had been standing.</p><p>Julian sat fluidly next to Cameron and handed him his lemonade. He glanced at the agent in mild surprise when he wasn\u2019t greeted with at least a derisive grunt, and Cameron saw him do a double take when he looked at Ty.</p><p>Cameron looked from Julian to Ty and back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty inhaled deeply and turned to look at them. He shifted his shoulders so that he was facing Julian directly, and he met Julian\u2019s eyes with a look so grim that it almost scared Cameron. \u201cTo my five thirty,\u201d Ty said to Julian, almost under his breath. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s black eyes carefully drifted to gaze over Ty\u2019s right shoulder. Outwardly he didn\u2019t change, he still looked relaxed and somber, but Cameron could almost feel the alteration come over the table when Julian spotted whatever Ty had pointed out to him.</p><p>They met each other\u2019s gaze again and sat staring at each other across the table.</p><p>Cameron cleared his throat. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When Julian looked at him, there was a hint of apprehension in his lover\u2019s eyes. That alone terrified Cameron, and he had to try to swallow twice to get the last bite of his sandwich down.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and stood. \u201cCome on,\u201d he prompted as he slid one arm into his jacket and used the motion to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Zane?\u201d Cameron asked as he stood, abandoning his pretzel and drink on the table. They left the tray of barely touched food.</p><p>\u201cTake your things,\u201d Julian said under his breath. He held his cup in his hand, looking down as he stirred it with his straw.</p><p>\u201cZane should be okay, we\u2019ll circle back for him if we can,\u201d Ty answered as he led them out of the caf\u00e9\u2019s sitting area and into the crowded concourse. After Cameron shouldered his bag, Julian took Cameron\u2019s hand and followed, not even hinting that he might try to escape while Ty was distracted.</p><p>Cameron tried to ignore the tension and dread curling in his gut. If he wasn\u2019t safe with Julian and Ty, he wouldn\u2019t be safe anywhere. But it wasn\u2019t himself he worried for. He caught himself before he could glance behind them to check for Zane. Soon he\u2019d be coming out to find them gone.</p><p>When Cameron gave in and turned his chin, he saw a man in a dark suit step away from a magazine rack and begin making his way after them. Another man moved out of the alcove of a service door, and yet another got up from a table at a deli further down the causeway.</p><p>\u201cJulian,\u201d Cameron whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, love,\u201d Julian murmured, voice tight.</p><p>Ahead of them, Ty stopped abruptly. Julian drew up and pulled Cameron closer to him. Three more men in various shades of dark suit had materialized ahead of them. Julian turned to face behind them, putting Cameron between himself and Ty.</p><p>\u201cFBI?\u201d Julian asked doubtfully, though there was a hint of hope as well.</p><p>\u201cWrong letters,\u201d Ty answered.</p><p>Cameron didn\u2019t like not being able to see, but taking a quick look made him more scared, not less. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Ty actually reached back and put a hand on Cameron\u2019s arm, turning just enough to look behind them. Cameron heard his breath catch. \u201cYou\u2019re not meant to get to DC, are you?\u201d he whispered to Julian.</p><p>Julian glanced behind him, and Cameron saw him lick his lips in a rare show of nerves. \u201cI\u2019m the last living witness to a high-level CIA man who was using CIA assets to carry out murder for hire. I\u2019m the only person left who can identify him.\u201d</p><p>Ty cursed. \u201cThey\u2019re not here to take you into custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Cameron froze as one of the dark-suited men brushed up against a passing traveler. His jacket moved, revealing a gun stuck into the waistband of his pants. \u201cOh. We\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go, love,\u201d Julian said, voice grim.</p><p>Ty was looking over the heads of the crowd milling around them, and Cameron could practically feel the man coiling against him, like a snake cornered and about to strike.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t shoot us in the middle of the terminal and all these people,\u201d Cameron insisted. He cast around, desperate.</p><p>Ty turned around and grabbed Julian by the arm, yanking him closer until they were almost nose to nose. He didn\u2019t say a thing; they merely stared at each other for a moment before Ty let him go and turned to dart into the tiny gift shop several yards away.</p><p>Cameron gaped. Had Ty just cut and run on them? \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><p>The six men were closing in, and the crowd seemed to teem with danger now that Cameron was aware of them. Julian squeezed his hand, squaring his shoulders like a lion might fluff its mane, trying to appear bigger as it was attacked.</p><p>A second later Ty came strolling out of the gift shop with a brown paper bag held to his lips. He was blowing it full of air. He calmly held it up, then shouted at the top of his voice, \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d and slammed the paper bag into his open palm.</p><p>Utter chaos ensued. Shrieks and yells filled the air, and the crowd stampeded every which way, creating a jumble of confusion and fear. Mothers snatched their children up and ran. Senior citizens ducked behind pillars and newsstands.</p><p>Cameron didn\u2019t think Ty could have caused more of a ruckus if he\u2019d gotten up on a table and danced naked in front of the arrivals and departures sign. Apparently, disorder was Ty\u2019s specialty.</p><p>A moment later Ty was at Cameron\u2019s side, urging both him and Julian to move through the panicking crowd. He and Julian both ducked to hide their height, but it didn\u2019t take long until they were confronted with a charcoal suit amidst the zigzagging crowd.</p><p>Ty reached out for the man, who was drawing his gun, and he pulled him closer by his shoulder. He shoved the heel of his hand into the man\u2019s chin, snapping his head back, then rounded on him with his left and sent him to the ground. His actions were remarkably quick and powerful, all done in a split second and hard to follow. Cameron had only ever seen Julian move like that. Ty held up something he\u2019d taken from the man, showing it to Julian over his shoulder. Julian still held Cameron\u2019s hand as they vaulted over the fallen man and broke into a run.</p><p>Cameron chanced a glance over his shoulder as Julian dragged him down the concourse, looking back at the mess and the agents coming out this side of the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re still coming!\u201d</p><p>The crowd was too thick, and there were just too many men after them for Cameron to see how they could get away. The exits were a logjam of people and confused airport security. There seemed to be nowhere to go.</p><p>Julian glanced back and turned, putting himself between Cameron and the pursuers. Ty was looking around the concourse, and Cameron caught a glimpse of the wild cast to his oddly colored eyes. He looked like a cornered animal, wily and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trapped,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>After a last look at their paltry options, Ty pointed a finger into Julian\u2019s chest, then waved them toward the exits. \u201cGo,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo! Find Zane. I\u2019ll hold them off.\u201d Then he turned his back on them, facing the men coming after them with a roll of his shoulders and a tilt of his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julian took a step back, momentarily stunned, but then he gripped Cameron\u2019s hand harder and pulled him, turning and running, leaving Ty behind them to stem the tide of the oncoming suits. Cameron managed to glance back in time to see Ty launch himself into the first man; then they were obscured by the panicking crowd around them.</p><p>\u201cBut... Julian! They\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll kill us, Cam!\u201d</p> <p>Stopping him was impossible against Julian\u2019s size and determination. They darted in and out of pockets of confused people, weaving their way through the masses and finally finding a side hallway that had an emergency exit at the end. Julian started toward it, but he hesitated, glancing over his shoulder. Cameron jumped on the vacillation.</p><p>\u201cJulian, I know you two didn\u2019t get along, but please! He and Zane could have just given you to them, but instead they\u2019re trying to help us,\u201d Cameron said, pulling on Julian\u2019s hand, the upset getting stronger the longer they were away. Every second was a second Ty could be dying. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to die for trying to help us.\u201d</p><p>Julian met his eyes, and Cameron could see the indecision there. Then he shook his head and turned for the exit.</p><p>\u201cPlease! He\u2019d come back for you, and you know it!\u201d</p><p>Julian stopped and turned again, an anguished expression passing over his face. \u201cGoddammit all to hell, Cam,\u201d he finally growled, the words rolling out beautifully in his Irish accent. \u201cStay here.\u201d And with that he launched himself back into the crowd.</p> <p>Now both desperately afraid and insanely relieved, Cameron followed despite what Julian had said. The concourse had cleared some, but the space where they\u2019d left Ty to make his last stand was a jumble of people and suitcases and caf\u00e9 chairs. Tables were overturned, magazines littered the floor, and the contents of suitcases were strewn about where they\u2019d been dropped.</p><p>Two men lay on the floor as well, one bleeding and motionless, the other writhing and screaming as he held his arm at an odd angle.</p><p>They reached the melee just in time to witness an impressive roundhouse kick to a charcoal suit\u2019s head that sent the man sprawling. But then a gun was pulled behind Ty, drawing his attention long enough for two more suits to swamp him. He disappeared under a hail of fists and expensive wool and silk. Cameron could see Ty lashing out, being held down and fighting like a wild horse trying not to be roped. He was kicked in the ribs, stomped on the side of the head as he tried and failed to roll away. Another gun was pulled and put to the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cameron yelled just as Julian went for the gun, knocking it and its owner to the ground. Zane appeared on the other side of the dog pile, wading in as if they weren\u2019t outnumbered and weaponless.</p><p>Julian\u2019s movements were quick and efficient, hands grabbing the suit\u2019s neck and chin and twisting with a vicious, sickening crunch. He shoved the man aside and reached to the bottom of the pile, pulling Ty out by his collar like he was scruffing a kitten.</p><p>\u201cHow did I know this commotion was your doing?\u201d Zane yelled at them.</p> <p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Cameron called. Before he could get more words out, he was shocked into crying out when someone grabbed him from behind. He immediately started to struggle against whoever held him. \u201cJulian!\u201d Cameron called out in real terror.</p><p>Julian looked up, dropped Ty\u2019s nearly limp body back into the fray, and raised the gun he\u2019d confiscated. The shot was deafening, and the warm spray on Cameron\u2019s ear and cheek was evidence that Julian\u2019s aim was true. The hands released him, and the bulk that had been behind him fell away. Cameron reflexively lifted his hand to wipe at the splatter across his cheek.</p><p>Then Julian reached back down and grabbed Ty again, jerking him off the floor. \u201cCome on!\u201d he shouted at Zane. Zane knocked down the man with whom he\u2019d been grappling with a vicious punch to the midsection, grabbed a gun off one of the unconscious men, and was only a couple of steps behind them as they ran toward Cameron, Julian dragging Ty with him.</p><p>The gunshot had caused more panic, and now TSA and other airport security were starting to appear, rushing into the wrecked causeway, trying to get people out of the way and assess the situation.</p><p>Julian wrapped his arm around Ty and supported some of his weight, ducking his head and hiding his face as they made their way past the overwhelmed security checkpoint. They followed the crowd, letting it sweep them toward the exits. Cameron ducked under Zane\u2019s arm to hide as they shuffled out. Zane flashed his badge at the man who tried to stop them to hasten their exit.</p><p>\u201cThere. Government-issue SUV at the curb,\u201d Julian said as he pointed through the glass doors. \u201cI managed to get the keys off one of them.\u201d</p><p>Zane headed that way without even questioning it, and he went to the back door to try the handle. It popped open, and Julian shoved Ty inside and then climbed in after him, leaving the front for Cameron and Zane. Cameron scrambled in through the driver\u2019s side and over the console. Zane glanced around them before climbing in, calmly shutting the door and driving away into traffic.</p><p>Cameron turned in his seat to look at the two men in the back. \u201cTy? Are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeels like somebody shoved a boot between my ribs,\u201d Ty answered, voice strained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually exactly what happened,\u201d Cameron told him.</p><p>Ty hissed and then growled at Julian. \u201cQuit touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure you\u2019re not dying,\u201d Julian shot back.</p><p>\u201cWell, that hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to poke it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay nice,\u201d Zane said, but there was too much edge in his tone for it to be funny.</p><p>Cameron watched how he kept checking the rearview mirror. He wondered if Zane was checking for a tail or trying to get a look at his roughed-up partner.</p><p>\u201cWill we get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Zane said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take them some time to figure out who\u2019s where and what\u2019s missing, enough time for us to get somewhere and disable the GPS in this thing. But it won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fucking stupid,\u201d Ty muttered from the backseat. \u201cI told you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, unfortunately my conscience is a little more willful than most,\u201d Julian grumbled, and Cameron knew his lover was talking about him.</p><p>\u201cThey were CIA again, Zane,\u201d Ty said, voice soft and hoarse. He pulled a badge from his coat, waving it at them. He had lifted it from one of the men in the airport. \u201cI identified myself and they didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue cell,\u201d Julian murmured. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to be acting under his orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose orders?\u201d</p><p>Julian took a moment to explain what was going on to Zane, and it was mostly news to Cameron too.</p><p>\u201cBurns must be protecting someone,\u201d Ty said, voice still strained. \u201cOr investigating on the down low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue or not, they\u2019ve had the resources and the manpower to stay on us this long. I don\u2019t see that mess stopping them from keeping after us,\u201d Zane said as he shifted his attention back and forth from traffic and the rearview.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get somewhere safe. Unexpected,\u201d Ty said. Cameron couldn\u2019t see him, but he sounded worn and beaten.</p><p>\u201cAnd soon. Your partner is bleeding,\u201d Julian informed Zane without a hint of sympathy.</p><p>Zane finally looked over his shoulder back at Ty. \u201cHow serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, that\u2019s not my blood,\u201d Ty murmured. His voice sounded weak.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said, his voice brooking no humorous pushover. Cameron heard leather squeak, and when he looked, he saw Zane\u2019s hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles were white.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not my blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see it,\u201d Julian demanded, and a moment later there were sounds of a scuffle from the back seat.</p><p>\u201cI am AB positive and this is distinctly type O blood!\u201d Ty finally shouted at him. \u201cLook at the little Os!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Grady, can you not take one fucking thing seriously?\u201d Julian yelled back in utter frustration. Cameron wondered what it was about Ty that made Julian lose his composure so easily. If he weren\u2019t so secure in their relationship, he might actually be jealous of it.</p><p>Cameron gasped as the SUV jerked over to the shoulder of the road and came to a sudden stop. Zane threw it into park and turned in his seat. \u201cEnough!\u201d he shouted, grabbing Ty\u2019s wrist when it flailed within reach. Cameron shrank back, leaning against the passenger-side door as Zane growled. \u201cGrady, give me a clear answer, dammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bleeding!\u201d Ty insisted, sounding a mixture of exasperated and hurt that Zane didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cWould you put the car back in drive before we\u2019re strafed by CIA fighter jets or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to fucking God,\u201d Zane cursed under his breath as he let go, turned back around, and got the SUV moving again.</p><p>Cameron leaned his head back against the leather headrest and closed his eyes. This was like National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation, but with death, property destruction, and an Irish accent. He groaned and covered his face with one hand, only to touch sticky blood all down his cheek and jawline. He groaned again. The second time it sounded pitiful, even to his ears.</p><p>There was a tense silence for several seconds, and then Ty opened his mouth one last time. \u201cI think the kid is bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHO are these people?\u201d Agent X asked his superior in utter frustration.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve finally discerned their identities. They\u2019re FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal FBI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear so. Richard Burns is pulling no punches when it comes to old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wish us to continue? They killed two of my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stole two of your vehicles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mourn the cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019re certain we know the names of the men involved, it will be easier to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and looked around the concourse of Pittsburgh International Airport. FBI agents. They had done this with two prisoners in tow and no weapons. He was beginning to wish he\u2019d been sent to Alaska instead of this assignment.</p><p>\u201cOKAY, if this is the CIA, what else are they doing?\u201d Ty asked Julian as soon as they were satisfied that they\u2019d lost any tails and disassembled the GPS in their stolen car.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know they were pinging the GPS in the bureau car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I thought you dismantled that,\u201d Cameron said as he turned around.</p><p>\u201cBureau issue vehicles have two types of GPS. The backup is covert, meaning it\u2019s passive,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cThe Agency was pinging us with their remote systems,\u201d Julian explained.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d Zane said as he looked in the mirror at Julian.</p><p>\u201cWell, at the time I was hoping to pit the sides against each other and escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he\u2019s honest,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>Zane glared at both of them for a moment.</p><p>Cameron waved a hand. \u201cOkay, I get how they found us in the car you stole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorrowed,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, psychopath. But how did they find us after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny number of ways,\u201d Julian said in a troubled voice. \u201cCredit cards. The tolls when we passed through. Our cell phones. Depending on how high this goes, they could have even diverted a satellite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow high does it go?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name, I just know his voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said cell phones,\u201d Ty murmured</p><p>\u201cYes. You turned the GPS off, but again, if it goes high enough, they can turn it back on remotely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But do they have the firepower to listen in on calls?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Julian said with a simple nod.</p><p>Ty looked from Julian to Zane, and Zane had to take his eyes off the road long enough to meet Ty\u2019s eyes in the mirror. He could tell Ty was formulating a plan, and the fear behind those hazel eyes told Zane that Ty didn\u2019t like what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked with a growing sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re picking up on our calls, maybe we can call for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I believe you lost me as well,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not the only one,\u201d Cameron muttered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re big, we\u2019re little. Their strength is the information they gather and how they do it. We have to turn that against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA skewer,\u201d Julian said in a surprised voice.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cChess. A skewer is a chess move. Use their strength against them. Their queen is opposite our rook. They\u2019re supported by their knight, and we only have a pawn. But if their queen takes our rook, our pawn takes their queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that English?\u201d Ty asked in exasperation.</p><p>Zane looked up at the mirror to see Julian again. He was a fascinating person once he opened up enough to allow them insight into his mind. Zane was glad he was on their side now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m agreeing with you, you wanker,\u201d Julian snapped.</p><p>\u201cWell, stop, it\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Julian grunted and sat back with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how to play chess,\u201d Ty said in a flat voice. Zane glanced at his partner. Talk about fascinating, though, Zane didn\u2019t have to go further than Ty. Zane would never get tired of watching the way Ty\u2019s mind worked. \u201cBut yeah, I guess, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about. We need a pawn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA rook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to make a phone call to someone and make the Agency think we\u2019re heading there for help,\u201d Zane surmised, voice grim.</p> <p>\u201cBasically. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where would we go instead? To DC?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>Ty nodded, remaining silent as the sound of the tires on asphalt seeped into the quiet car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sound, in theory,\u201d Julian said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWho would you call? I mean....\u201d Cameron trailed off, sounding troubled. \u201cWhoever you call will be in just as much danger as we are.\u201d</p> <p>Ty was still looking into Zane\u2019s eyes. Zane nodded, knowing exactly what his partner was thinking.</p><p>\u201cI know a few guys who can handle themselves.\u201d</p><p>Zane waited a breath. He knew Ty was talking about his Recon team. And probably Nick fucking O\u2019Flaherty.</p><p>\u201cCall one of them.\u201d</p><p>JULIAN sat in the backseat of the stolen CIA Tahoe, watching Ty as he made the call. He was surprised when Ty spoke in French. He was quite fluent, even using a convincing accent. He sounded almost like a native speaker.</p><p>Julian blinked at him in shock, looking at the two men in the front seat to see if either of them was surprised. Cameron glanced back, but he didn\u2019t seem to comprehend anything other than it was a foreign language and it was far too dainty for a man like Ty to speak. Zane glanced up, eyes on Ty more than the road.</p> <p>Julian had known Ty could speak French. He hadn\u2019t seen him in Paris like he\u2019d led them to believe, but he knew from a reliable source that he had indeed been there. It was still a shock to hear him speak it. Julian knew enough of the language to decipher that Ty was basically telling the other man, \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble, we\u2019re coming to you to lay low.\u201d</p><p>Ty switched the phone from one ear to the other, clearing his throat. He spoke in English. \u201cAnd Digger? Make sure you have coconuts when we get there, okay? Lots of them.\u201d</p><p>Julian could hear the tinny voice on the phone responding, and then Ty ended the call. He glanced at Julian and narrowed his eyes as he rolled down the window. The frigid wind whipped through the car, ruffling Julian\u2019s hair, tugging at his coat. Ty tossed the phone out the window and rolled it back up.</p><p>Julian stared at him, and Ty ignored him like only children and felines were typically capable of doing.</p><p>\u201cCoconuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... Monty Python. Coconuts were the fake horse. It\u2019ll make sense to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was telling him it was a ruse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Zane asked in a solemn voice. The heavy sense of impending doom hung over them, making everything sedate and surreal.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cI feel like I just threw one of my best friends under a bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the bayou would handle it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Julian looked between them. For the first time, the two FBI agents were beginning to take on an air of defeat. He had formed a grudging respect for both men, and he wasn\u2019t so blind that he couldn\u2019t see what they\u2019d done. They could easily have handed him and Cameron over when they realized they were being followed and were outgunned. They had no vested interest in getting Julian to DC, other than they had orders. They were fighting and running and risking their lives simply because Julian and Cameron now needed their help. There was no other reason for it.</p><p>\u201cI might know someone who can help us get to DC,\u201d he said after a few more moments of silence to ponder it.</p><p>He saw Zane\u2019s dark eyes looking at him in the mirror, and Ty was looking at him as well, messing around with his belt as if something was jabbing him.</p><p>\u201cHe retired several years ago, bought a... an antique store in Gettysburg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real antique store, or the kind that can help us?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cA real one, unfortunately. But I believe he could still help us. He flew biplanes, it was his hobby. He would loan us one for a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoan us one?\u201d Zane asked as he kept his eyes on the road.</p><p>\u201cA biplane? What are we supposed to do, duct tape ourselves to the wings all the way to DC?\u201d Ty grunted. \u201cI\u2019m not a fucking Wright brother, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but this will all be over when I get to DC. Two of us could go, the other stay with Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you fly a plane?\u201d Ty asked with an incredulous glance at Julian.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was hoping you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I can fly a plane?\u201d Ty snapped, getting more irritable the more he messed with his ribcage.</p><p>Julian pursed his lips as he looked at Ty. \u201cI just assumed, since you enjoyed the TSA so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s stop right there,\u201d Zane said hastily.</p><p>\u201cJulian, would your friend be able to find a bigger plane for us? One he could fly?\u201d Cameron asked as he turned in his seat.</p><p>Julian shrugged. \u201cWe could ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go ask him,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Julian said, his tone making it clear he was reaching the end of his patience. \u201cWe\u2019ll solve this like men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, MacGuffin, a duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Julian held out both hands, one palm flat, the other held over it in a fist. \u201cRock, paper, scissors. Two out of three.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and held out his fist, apparently willing to play. Julian hit his palm three times, and Ty kept time with his fist in the air. But when Julian threw a paper, Ty reached into his jacket with his other hand and pulled his gun, aiming it at Julian.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d Zane said in exasperation from the front seat.</p><p>\u201cGlock, paper, scissors. I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an ass,\u201d Julian muttered.</p><p>\u201cTy, put your gun away,\u201d Zane muttered, less sarcastic than his partner. \u201cTo Gettysburg, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. And when we get there you can shave that fucking ferret\u2019s nest off your face,\u201d Ty said to Zane as he shoved the gun back into his coat.</p><p>\u201cAnd on the way we\u2019ll get some Cheetos and Dr Pepper for Ty\u2019s blood sugar,\u201d Zane added, unperturbed.</p><p>In the front seat, Cameron clapped a hand over his mouth so no one would hear him snort.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>CAMERON looked up at Julian as they rode the elevator in the Gettysburg Hotel up to the third floor. \u201cDo you think this man you used to know is still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think so. If he\u2019s not, he\u2019s dead, and that would distress me a little,\u201d Julian answered, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cDid you know him well? He was a friend?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cMore an acquaintance. A coworker.\u201d Julian glanced sideways at Cameron and smiled. \u201cHe retired of his own volition. That doesn\u2019t happen often to people I know.\u201d</p><p>Cameron rolled his eyes and smiled as the elevator doors opened. \u201cI imagine not, though I like to dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk when you dream,\u201d Julian said in a low voice, fighting hard to keep the smile out of his voice. He took Cameron\u2019s elbow and let his fingers drift down his lover\u2019s arm as they stepped out of the elevator. Ty and Zane had let them go alone to scout the area. Julian knew they were testing him to see if they could trust him, and he also knew that Ty hadn\u2019t made it out of that brawl as easy as he was leading them to believe. He was hurt, and Zane had sequestered him in the hotel room as soon as they\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cWe have a room to ourselves tonight,\u201d Julian murmured to Cameron with a smirk. \u201cI\u2019m quite looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy and Zane will still be next door,\u201d Cameron said, but his smile didn\u2019t fade. If anything, it grew wider.</p><p>\u201cLike I care at this point.\u201d Julian allowed himself to grin as they came to the door of the first room. He gave Cameron a wink as he rapped his knuckles on the door three times.</p><p>\u201cYou never cared,\u201d Cameron murmured with a laugh. \u201cAbout what they think, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI maintain they\u2019re both idiots,\u201d Julian muttered, albeit more fondly than he would have a day ago.</p><p>The door opened. \u201cI heard that,\u201d Zane said as he stepped back to let them in the room.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Julian waved for Cameron to go in first, then followed with a smirk at Zane as he passed.</p><p>Zane shut the door behind them a little harder than strictly necessary, and he stalked past them to thump down in the chair at the desk. His face was set in a deep frown as he glared at Ty, who sat sprawled in a wingback chair near the bed, bottle of water in hand. He\u2019d been bitching about the lack of Dr Pepper for a few days now. He was apparently going through some sort of caffeine withdrawal, and he refused to drink Coke or Pepsi or even Red Bull. They were going to have to force something caffeinated down his throat soon, or he was going to kill them all.</p><p>Julian raised one eyebrow at Zane but didn\u2019t comment on his crankiness. The room was thick with tension that almost buzzed between the two FBI agents.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find out?\u201d Ty demanded of Julian.</p><p>\u201cWell, dinner is quite pricey in the tavern downstairs, there\u2019s a ghost walk that begins at eight o\u2019clock a few blocks away, and the young lady at the front desk is unnaturally friendly. I believe her to be a clone of some sort.\u201d</p><p>Ty pinched the bridge of his nose, as if desperately trying to keep himself from shooting Julian where he stood.</p><p>Cameron thumped Julian\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we found out,\u201d Julian said with a shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of construction in town. And it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been here, so it will take me some time to orient myself. I\u2019m afraid I was confounded when I arrived at Nestor\u2019s shop to find that it was no longer Nestor\u2019s shop. He\u2019s moved location, and while I did find the new building and leave him a message, it will be morning before we hear anything from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning. Great,\u201d Ty said as he stood.</p><p>\u201cWe could all do with a night to sleep,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m antsy, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re high on exhaustion and Cheetos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne walk around the block isn\u2019t going to kill any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s looking for us out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to interject an opinion yet?\u201d Julian asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cNo. Shut up,\u201d Ty snapped.</p><p>\u201cWe need more information and more sleep before going back out. You can\u2019t just run around blind,\u201d Zane stated, his voice dropping into an angry growl.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to bitch at me about running blind,\u201d Ty muttered as he sat back down with a thump.</p><p>\u201cTy, put on your big girl panties and stop bitching, okay?\u201d Zane growled, sitting up straighter. Julian noticed one of his hands clutching in and out of a fist. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re leaving this room tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys\u2014\u201d Cameron started. Julian reached out to touch Cameron\u2019s shoulder and stop him. He\u2019d seen discussions like this in his line of work, and they sometimes ended bloody. With these two it seemed prudent to stay out of the argument.</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell?\u201d Ty repeated incredulously. \u201cWhat are you now, the stroll police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait for Cross\u2019 contact and at least wait until dark to go wandering around,\u201d Zane said with finality. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>Julian cleared his throat. \u201cReally, we won\u2019t hear from him until morning. Until then....\u201d Julian shrugged and trailed off as he tried to gauge the tension between the two men. Zane\u2019s back was ramrod stiff as he sat unmoving, and he hadn\u2019t taken his eyes off Ty. Ty was the exact opposite, antsy and agitated, appearing to be moving even as he sat relatively still.</p><p>Cameron shifted closer to Julian, taking his elbow as he waited for the ensuing fight.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when mother and father fight,\u201d Julian said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ty snapped at him, then turned on Zane, who stood to meet him. \u201cSit down, take a bubble bath or something. I need to take a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d Zane lashed out without warning and hit the water bottle, sending it skidding across the carpet and splattering at Julian\u2019s feet. \u201cI\u2019m gonna end up in the fucking madhouse because of you!\u201d He reached out and grabbed Ty\u2019s wrist, pulling him closer. \u201cLoving you is going to make me fucking insane! I said no, and I mean it!\u201d</p><p>Ty froze. Julian could only see half his face, but he appeared to be staring at Zane, mouth hanging open.</p><p>Julian realized he was doing the same thing. After several heartbeats, Zane closed his eyes and exhaled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did you say loving him?\u201d Julian blurted incredulously. He pointed at Ty. \u201cHim? You and him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian....\u201d Cameron tugged on his arm, trying to get him to leave the room, and Julian went along as he continued to gape at them.</p><p>Ty and Zane just stood there, frozen, Zane with his head bowed, Ty staring at him.</p><p>\u201cI did not see that coming,\u201d Julian said to Cameron under his breath.</p><p>\u201cGood to know you can still be surprised,\u201d Cameron whispered. \u201cNow come on.\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded and turned with Cameron, glancing back at their companions. \u201cWe\u2019ll just be... somewhere else,\u201d he told them as he reached for the door.</p><p>There was no answer as Julian closed the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Cameron said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Julian murmured. He looked at Cameron speculatively, not sure how to parse the information they\u2019d just been made privy to and not certain what to do now that they had an entire night to themselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cameron looked back at the door. There wasn\u2019t any sound coming through it. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd drink,\u201d Julian added, nodding. He smiled suddenly, giving Cameron a sly sideways glance. \u201cOr. We could just turn in for the night. In our own room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is next door, and you\u2019ll be tempted to eavesdrop,\u201d Cameron said, waving at the room down the hall. \u201cCompromise,\u201d he said, looking up to meet Julian\u2019s eyes with an answering smile. \u201cDrink, then room. Just... give them a little time.\u201d</p> <p>Julian gave an exaggerated roll of his eyes as he slipped his arm around Cameron\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re an insufferable romantic, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He glanced back at the door. \u201cI wonder if they\u2019ll be done in time to realize joining that ghost tour is the best way to reconnoiter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an insufferable predator,\u201d Cameron said, tongue-in-cheek.</p><p>\u201cAnd you love me for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>ZANE squeezed his eyes shut as he waited for Ty to say something, but Ty smiled slowly and took a step toward him. \u201cYou totally just outed us to the criminals,\u201d he said as he pointed a finger at Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou make me insane, do you know that?\u201d Zane blurted again with a wave of one hand. \u201cDo you do it on purpose just to see me lose it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Ty said with a smirk.</p><p>Zane sighed in utter frustration.</p><p>Ty bit his lip, watching his lover just because he could. He firmly believed that being able to rile Zane like he could was one of the aspects of their relationship that had saved Zane from tumbling back into his destructive past. Every now and then, Zane just needed to feel like he was alive. Everyone should be able to feel that. And if annoying him to the point of homicide was what it took, Ty was up to the challenge.</p> <p>\u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d he asked after Zane was silent for a time.</p><p>Zane shook his head, his eyes drifting to the door of the room.</p><p>Ty gaped at him and pointed at the door. \u201cFrom the criminals?\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted, caught Ty\u2019s hand, and kissed his fingers. \u201cApparently some \u2018criminals\u2019 have better sense than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re modeling your love life on that of a trained assassin,\u201d Ty laid out in disbelief. \u201cI swear to God, if he pulled some Jedi mind trick on you and they\u2019re off escaping right now, I will put a bullet in his Irish ass!\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed, the sound almost desperate as he swiped a hand over his face. \u201cWell, now what do we do?\u201d he asked, dejected. They had gone months without breaking their cover in front of anyone. It had almost been a source of pride for them. Just another undercover assignment.</p><p>Ty shook his head, looking at Zane again as unusual warmth began to spread through him. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they know. I don\u2019t care if anyone knows anymore.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at him sharply. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p> <p>Ty shrugged. They both knew what their options would be if their relationship was discovered at work. It had nothing to do with them being gay and everything to do with the FBI\u2019s unofficial policy on fraternizing. \u201cI think we take our chances when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d just reassign us partners within the work group. We\u2019d still be working together. You\u2019d end up with Freddy, they\u2019d probably put me with Scott. It wouldn\u2019t be too bad. We could actually... you could get rid of your crappy apartment and we could live together.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him, his dark eyes taking on an almost molten appearance. Ty\u2019s breath caught in his throat as he tried and failed to continue speaking. Deuce had asked him once what it was about Zane that had first drawn him in. He\u2019d been a broken man, an addict who was hopelessly lost in the past, drifting through life alone with little purpose and even less faith that it could get better.</p><p>Anyone with any sense would have steered clear. But from the first moment Ty had really looked into Zane\u2019s eyes, he\u2019d seen behind them, into the man Zane was capable of being. He\u2019d seen a phoenix waiting to rise from the ashes, and he still did. Every time he looked into Zane, he saw something extraordinary.</p><p>Zane shook his head, his breaths coming harder as they stared at each other. \u201cWhat if you live with me and you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty said in frustration. He held up one hand. \u201cIn the time you\u2019ve been with me, have I ever changed my mind after deciding something? Even when we both knew I was wrong?\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled weakly and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Ty said, the quiet words devoid of any self-consciousness or his usual bravado. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been able to say that before with such conviction. I can\u2019t remember a time that you weren\u2019t the first thing I thought of, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I don\u2019t care what stands in our way.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath hitched, and he reached out for Ty. He caught Ty\u2019s face gently between his hands and kissed him, drawing it out until finally releasing his lips to run his nose along Ty\u2019s cheek. Ty closed his eyes, feeling the calm that Zane\u2019s touch always instilled in him sweep over him. He pushed his nose against Zane\u2019s as he slid his fingers into his hair. If he and Zane had any say in the workings of fate, Zane would be the last person he ever touched like this.</p><p>Zane let out a shaky breath and whispered. \u201cWill you... will you make love to me?\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled and took Zane\u2019s face in his hands to kiss him. \u201cBaby,\u201d he started, a thousand things going through his mind to say, every one of them a typical smartass Grady remark. He looked into Zane\u2019s sincere eyes and his smile softened. Zane\u2019s occasional purple prose was all part of his charm. Sometimes Ty even let him slide without poking fun at him. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned and gave him another gentle kiss, lapping at his lips to get Ty to part them. His hands settled atop Ty\u2019s shoulders before sliding down his chest, catching on the soft material of Ty\u2019s T-shirt, and around his torso to hug him close. Ty gave him a gentle tug, trying to get him to swing around and lie back with him on one of the antique double beds. Zane pulled back from their kiss and pulled off his Henley, tossing it to the floor, before reaching to slide his hands under Ty\u2019s T-shirt to strip it off him. There were two soft thuds on the carpet\u2014Zane toeing off his shoes\u2014then he shifted onto the mattress, pulling up his legs as he lay on his side alongside Ty.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Ty whispered against Zane\u2019s lips. He had never felt this sort of heat and longing for another person. He didn\u2019t know how Zane did it, but Ty knew that there would never be anyone else for him. He wanted Zane to feel that too, to have that assurance both physically and emotionally. He would do whatever he had to do to make sure that Zane knew he was his.</p><p>He slid his hand into Zane\u2019s hair, gripping the curls at the base of his neck and using them to pull Zane\u2019s head back, just to be able to kiss him harder. Zane\u2019s lips were soft and gave under his as he drove the kiss. They lay wrapped around one another, and when he shifted more, Zane broke off the kiss with a gasp and rocked their groins together despite the layers of thin cloth between them. The look in Zane\u2019s eyes told Ty that he was on the right path. Zane\u2019s reply was lost between Ty\u2019s lips, but he dragged his legs apart so Ty could settle between them.</p><p>Ty groaned as Zane wrapped around him. He broke the kiss and pushed himself up, bracing himself with one hand as he used the other to tug at Zane\u2019s undershirt. \u201cGet these off,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t hesitate. He pulled the shirt off as Ty pawed at it, and started unfastening his pants, hurrying to arch his back and start shoving them down over his hips along with his briefs. Ty had to crawl backward to let him get them off, and he pushed his own jeans and boxers down his thighs and got rid of them before he knelt between Zane\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Zane invited, holding out one arm to pull Ty back close against his warm skin.</p><p>Ty took his hand and kissed his fingers, then his palm, then his wrist. He tugged at Zane\u2019s hand, trying to get him to sit up instead. Zane did, sucking in a breath and sitting up without pulling his hand away, and it put him right in the circle of Ty\u2019s arms. Ty slid his fingers between Zane\u2019s as he kissed him. He had to lean over him to get closer, raising himself up on his knees. Zane spread his legs wider, propping up his knees and moving his feet out as Ty moved closer to him. A new wave of possessiveness and desire swept through Ty as he looked down at his lover. He ran his hand through Zane\u2019s hair, gripping the curls again to yank his head back and kiss him.</p><p>It only took a few seconds for him to tighten his grip and force Zane back down to the mattress. He used Zane\u2019s body to pull himself up and closer, settling between Zane\u2019s legs, pushing his hips against Zane\u2019s inner thighs, rubbing his hard cock against Zane\u2019s with a groan. Zane exhaled harshly as he shifted his legs further apart, making room for Ty as he slid both hands over Ty\u2019s shoulders and down his back and all over what skin he could reach. Not gripping or pinching or squeezing, just touching. He was murmuring too, desperate words that sounded like I love you.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand went to the back of Zane\u2019s thigh, pulling at it to settle Zane\u2019s raised leg against his hip. He kissed him languidly, taking care to slide his lips and tongue against Zane\u2019s, wanting to give them both the chance to taste and feel each other before they lost all self-control. He rocked his hips almost unconsciously, rubbing their groins together as they kissed. Zane sighed against his lips as he followed Ty\u2019s lead and relaxed under him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this,\u201d Zane said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had this, Zane,\u201d Ty said as he took a brief moment to push up and adjust his position.</p><p>\u201cNot this,\u201d Zane argued. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this.\u201d</p><p>Ty brushed his nose against Zane\u2019s, nodding in understanding. \u201cWe have it now.\u201d</p><p>He settled lower between Zane\u2019s legs, the head of his cock pushing against Zane\u2019s ass. He pulled at Zane\u2019s thigh again as he laid himself out over him and dove into another, more demanding kiss. Zane curled his arms around Ty even as he shifted under the weight, trying to create friction between them.</p><p>Ty groaned appreciatively, his hand sliding up Zane\u2019s leg to grip and pull at his hip. \u201cLube in my bag or yours?\u201d he asked breathlessly, cursing himself for not thinking of that a little earlier in the process of making them both almost painfully aroused.</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d Zane answered with a soft laugh. As he spoke, his hand smoothed down his belly toward his erect cock.</p><p>Ty reached to stop him, knowing that if Zane started touching himself, they\u2019d never make it to the lubricant. And he desperately wanted to be inside Zane tonight. He pulled Zane\u2019s hand up and held it down against the mattress.</p><p>\u201cTwo seconds,\u201d he said as he rose and looked down at Zane hungrily. \u201cDon\u2019t start without me.\u201d</p><p>He caught the wicked smile before Zane hid it. Ty rolled backward and crawled to the end of the bed, leaning over to grab his bag and pull out the leather toiletry bag he carried with him.</p><p>\u201cWant you in me, baby,\u201d Zane said from behind him.</p><p>Ty grunted and tossed the bag to the head of the bed as he crawled back up between Zane\u2019s legs. He let his hands slide over Zane\u2019s body, fingers digging into the hard ridges of muscle and soaking up the warmth of his skin, and Zane lifted up into his touch. Ty bowed his head to kiss at Zane\u2019s stomach, sliding his hand up to his chest and following its path until he was back where he\u2019d started, between Zane\u2019s spread legs and kissing him. Zane moaned and hooked his calf over the back of Ty\u2019s thigh, his hand settling on Ty\u2019s waist for leverage as he tipped his hips up into Ty\u2019s.</p><p>Ty growled and pushed himself up, muttering as he reached for the bag and fumbled inside it. Zane gave another obscenely sexy moan as he continued to rub their bodies together, moving his hand to the other side of Ty\u2019s waist. Ty finally pushed the bag over and toppled all the contents out, finding what he needed from the pile and then using his forearm to sweep everything else off the double bed to the carpeted floor.</p><p>Zane laughed at his haste, but the heat and desire in his eyes were still shining.</p><p>Ty pushed up, looking at Zane and rolling his hips down as he watched their bodies moving together. \u201cFuck, Zane,\u201d he hissed as he bent down to nip at Zane\u2019s lips.</p><p>Zane nodded as he licked along Ty\u2019s full bottom lip. \u201cWant me to turn over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty growled. He leaned on his elbow, using his other hand to slide between them and down Zane\u2019s body. \u201cI want you right here,\u201d he told Zane, stealing one last sloppy kiss before pushing back to his knees.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hands dragged down Ty\u2019s body as Ty moved. Ty ran one hand along the inside of Zane\u2019s thigh, unable to keep himself from touching. He enjoyed the play of muscle under soft skin, the occasional imperfection of a scar under his fingertips, the way Zane tensed and writhed beneath his hands. He became distracted by the drag of his fingertips against Zane\u2019s thigh. Zane quivered under him as he caressed. He was extra sensitive there, right at the juncture of his thigh and hip, not quite ticklish, and it was one of Ty\u2019s favorite places to touch and grip and dig his fingers into when they fucked. Ty ducked his head to kiss the spot he\u2019d been stroking. Zane groaned and his eyes fell closed as he tipped his head back, and his hands closed into fists in the sheets.</p><p>Ty grabbed the back of his thigh hard and folded Zane\u2019s leg up as he leaned over him, bending just enough to kiss the inside of his knee. He reached for the little bottle of lubricant and pressed it into Zane\u2019s hand. Then he sat back and let his hand slide under Zane\u2019s other knee, his fingers gently stroking the very top of his calf, enjoying the sight of Zane\u2019s legs splayed around his hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane blinked his eyes open to look at Ty as he lifted the bottle and shook it a couple times before popping the top open. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked as he squeezed some of the lube onto his fingers.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you\u2019re ready,\u201d Ty murmured. His hand moved up Zane\u2019s leg, not tugging or pulling, merely skimming over it until he reached his hip. \u201cThis is going to take a while.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard and reached for Ty, long fingers closing around his cock. Ty jutted his hips out, pushing into Zane\u2019s hand as he watched. Zane took his sweet time, spreading the slick lubricant all over, palming the head, dragging his fingers against Ty\u2019s balls. Ty reached to slide his fingers along Zane\u2019s, not guiding him, just enjoying the stroke of his hand.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane whispered, desperate and needy.</p><p>Ty moved both their hands and pushed up to his knees, wrapping one arm around Zane\u2019s leg to lift it again as he pushed Zane flat to his back. Zane reached for Ty with one hand, palm brushing against his bicep, fingers glancing off his shoulder; his other hand curled around his own shin to pull it closer to his chest.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t have to ask him if he was ready. That touch to his shoulder told him everything he needed to know. He kissed him, taking his time with it, enjoying the last moments of anticipation before he reached between them and guided himself into Zane. He rocked in place until the slick head of his cock slipped past the muscles that fought him; then he gave one languorous push.</p><p>Zane gasped out, his hand uselessly grasping for Ty\u2019s hip.</p><p>Ty lowered his head and let out a harsh sigh, resting his nose against Zane\u2019s chin as he flexed his hips and pushed deeper into him. The shift of Zane\u2019s body under him, the arch of Zane\u2019s back, the shortness of his breath, it all combined to keep him shuddering as Ty filled him up. His exhaled breath was warm against Ty\u2019s cheek as Zane started to moan.</p><p>Ty lifted his head and kissed him hungrily, sliding his fingers into Zane\u2019s hair and merely rocking his hips, wanting to make this last as long as possible. Zane calmed under him, joining in the rocking motion as their tongues slid together, and he wrapped his arms around Ty\u2019s neck to hold him close. It was slow and sensual, nothing but their gasping breaths and the wet slide of their kisses.</p><p>Zane lifted his knee higher, gasping when it pulled Ty deeper. Ty groaned, unable to continue merely rocking his hips any longer. His hand left Zane\u2019s hair to slide up the back of his leg instead, fingers digging in as he pulled back and thrust in.</p><p>Zane shivered under him and choked on a low cry of Ty\u2019s name. \u201cPlease, baby, you gotta... move. Harder.\u201d</p><p>Ty kissed him again, tightening his hold simply because he could. He continued the slow, even thrusts, enjoying the slide of their bodies rather than trying to reach the end too soon. Zane\u2019s fingers tightened on Ty\u2019s arms, but Ty stayed steady. The tension released, and Zane resorted to making needy noises in his throat and rolling his hips to meet each thrust.</p><p>Ty truly didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever done this. They\u2019d intended to several times, but neither of them had the strength of will to go slowly when the other was begging for harder and faster.</p><p>He pulled Zane\u2019s leg up further as his thrusts got longer, but he managed to maintain the sensual speed, driving into Zane deep and pulling out slow so he could feel Zane\u2019s muscles squeezing and pulling at him. He relished the slide every time he pulled back, and every time he pushed back in, it sent hot waves of pleasure and desire through him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Zane,\u201d Ty found himself whispering breathlessly as he pressed his face against Zane\u2019s neck.</p><p>Their bodies rocked with the languid rhythm. Zane\u2019s answer was a pleased hum.</p><p>Ty raised his head and searched out Zane\u2019s mouth. He picked up the rhythm, matching it with his tongue against Zane\u2019s. Zane\u2019s hum turned into a fully audible moan, and he started to move under Ty, rubbing against him all over as they kissed, rolling his hips and sliding his cock against Ty\u2019s belly.</p><p>Ty groaned against Zane\u2019s lips. He indulged in the kiss for a few more seconds before pushing himself up with both hands. Fucking Zane when he was really into it was a little like riding a mechanical bull. It was best to restrain him or Ty would end up on the floor.</p><p>He gripped Zane\u2019s hips, pulling back and tugging Zane with him. His hips rested on Ty\u2019s spread thighs, his legs splayed on either side of Ty. Ty let his hands roam over Zane\u2019s taut body as he rocked into him.</p><p>\u201cOh Christ, yes,\u201d Zane whispered. His back arched, and Ty dragged his fingers up Zane\u2019s belly.</p><p>He reached for the still-open lubricant with one hand and pulled himself almost entirely out, letting the head of his cock spread Zane\u2019s muscles wide. He held Zane\u2019s hip with the other hand and quickly poured a liberal amount on his own cock and on Zane, pushing slowly into him as he did it.</p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re gonna fuck me totally insane, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Zane asked, plaintive and breathless.</p> <p>Ty tossed the bottle aside and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s how I like you,\u201d he said, his voice tight and gruff. He took Zane\u2019s hips and pulled him closer, shoving into him hard as he settled him in his lap.</p><p>Zane\u2019s answer started as a huff, then rose into a higher yelp and gasp. \u201cPlease,\u201d he drew out, his voice heavy with arousal. It matched the pleasure written all over him.</p><p>Ty dug his fingers into the backs of Zane\u2019s thighs, dragging them down to his knees to wrap Zane\u2019s legs around him. Then he reached for Zane\u2019s slick cock, gripping it and spreading the lube with several slow pulls.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane hissed as he lifted his hips to push himself into Ty\u2019s hand.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and groaned loudly, letting Zane\u2019s movement do the work as he jacked him. He could hear Zane\u2019s labored, rough breathing and the rustle of the sheets as they moved. Zane\u2019s legs were tight around him, and then he felt the light brush of fingertips down his chest to his belly. He opened his eyes with difficulty, looking down at Zane\u2019s hand as it grazed him. He was distracted by the sight of his own cock pushing into Zane\u2019s ass, by his fingers wrapped around Zane, stroking him. His grip on Zane\u2019s hip tightened as he looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They were glazed and nearly black as they focused on him.</p><p>Zane kept moving his hand, gently stroking Ty\u2019s flushed skin. He said Ty\u2019s name softly, even reverently.</p><p>Ty moved, bending over him again to kiss him roughly. He snapped his hips as he moved, and he continued the sharp thrusts as he made the kiss hard and messy. Zane bucked under him, trying to get more, his slippery cock sliding along the firm muscles of Ty\u2019s abs. He finally growled, gripped Ty\u2019s ass, and pulled him down hard. The movement sank Ty\u2019s cock deep into him, their bodies slapping together. Zane\u2019s cry of pleasure was muffled by Ty\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Ty broke the kiss with a gasp and thrust in hard again several times just to watch Zane\u2019s face display all sorts of emotion Zane was usually really good at hiding: pleasure, arousal, urgency, even a little desperation in his furrowed brow, tightly closed eyes, and abused lower lip, teeth still sunk into it.</p><p>Ty slowed the pace again, bending to kiss at Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered, the words more a breath against Zane\u2019s lips than spoken.</p><p>Zane exhaled in a stutter and opened his eyes to look at Ty. He lifted his hand to trail his fingers over Ty\u2019s lips and cheekbone. Then he spoke, his words charged with emotion. \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>Ty kissed him gently again, then pushed himself back, rolling his hips to work his way in deeper. He pulled at Zane\u2019s hips and seated him once again in his lap.</p><p>He took Zane in hand again, stroking him faster this time as he picked up the speed of his own thrusts.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hands hit the mattress before settling on Ty\u2019s knees, gripping him. \u201cInsane now...,\u201d he said, panting. His breathing sped up as he quivered under Ty, and his hips were moving constantly, moving Ty inside him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d Ty urged in a breathless whisper.</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth as he stared at his lover, and Ty watched his eyes go unfocused as his breathing stopped and he stiffened. His cock pulsed in Ty\u2019s hand. Zane convulsed in a series of inarticulate moans, evidence of his orgasm spurting over Ty\u2019s fingers. Ty watched hungrily as he continued to stroke him, fighting hard against the urge to pound into him through his orgasm.</p><p>He groaned, though, gasping Zane\u2019s name as Zane\u2019s body pulsed around him. With each stroke, his fingers and Zane\u2019s stomach were covered and Zane\u2019s moans grew louder.</p><p>Ty swore. \u201cNext time I\u2019ll be sucking you off instead of watching it hit your belly,\u201d he growled, earning a desperate, plaintive groan from his lover in response.</p><p>Ty took mercy on him and brought his hand to a stop. He ran both hands all over Zane\u2019s body, smearing his come over him as he stared down at his face, dragging across his inner thighs and gripping his hips, then up his sides to squeeze his waist and pull him closer before running palms down to slide under his hips and lift him to pull him back fully into Ty\u2019s lap.</p><p>Zane opened his eyes as he tried to catch his breath, but with every touch, Ty could see Zane\u2019s overstimulated skin prickle with sensation, and the inhale broke off. \u201cBaby,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. He gripped Zane hard and rolled his hips, moving inside him with a slow groan. He ran his hands over the insides of Zane\u2019s thighs, looking down to watch himself pull almost completely out. He pushed at the backs of Zane\u2019s legs, forcing his knees up more toward his chest. Ty was still kneeling when he began to thrust his hips forward, head down and biting his lip as he watched the shaft slide in and out of Zane\u2019s tight ass. He loved to watch that.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucking gorgeous like this,\u201d Zane rasped, one hand moving to cover Ty\u2019s.</p><p>Ty looked up at him before he was forced to let his head fall with a moan. He\u2019d had every intention of finishing this as they\u2019d started, torturously slow and gentle. But it was becoming increasingly difficult.</p><p>He let Zane\u2019s legs go and leaned over him, holding himself up with both hands as he looked down at his lover. His hips were still rocking, his cock sinking deeper into Zane with each thrust.</p><p>\u201cCan you take more?\u201d he asked Zane breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said before moaning and biting his lip again. \u201cI\u2019m really getting to like this whole slow burn thing.\u201d</p><p>Ty ducked his head and groaned in agreement. He picked up the strength of his thrusts again, gasping and moaning as he drove himself closer to climax. But he managed to keep the languid pace he\u2019d set before. Both of them were damp with sweat even though the room was chilly, and everywhere Ty\u2019s skin touched Zane\u2019s seemed to be on fire. A drop of sweat rolled down Ty\u2019s nose and dropped to Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>His movements became sharper, tinged with frustration as the slow build of pleasure continued. Each thrust rocked Zane, driving their bodies harder together.</p><p>Zane lifted his legs enough to wrap them around Ty again, changing the angle of Ty\u2019s thrusts, and he gave a long, forlorn cry as Ty hit his prostate. \u201cOh, God baby, so, so good.\u201d</p><p>Ty watched Zane as he ramped up his thrusts, keeping the same angle and pounding him hard for a few seconds before going back to the slower, deeper thrusts.</p><p>He loved watching Zane get fucked.</p><p>He wanted to keep at him, fuck him just like this until Zane came again, until he emptied himself deep inside Zane over and over and left them both totally spent, but he didn\u2019t think he could do it. It was too tempting to let go and take him hard and fast when he was so close to coming himself.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he pleaded in a strained, harsh voice as he laid himself out over Zane again and pressed his forehead against Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d Zane begged again. He wrapped his arms around him tightly, tilting his hips back with each slow slide to try to take Ty deeper. \u201cPlease, give me more.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s will to draw it out snapped. He raised his head and wrapped his arms around Zane, gathering him close. He briefly allowed himself the pleasure of fucking him, hard and fast, nearly pulling out of him each time before breaching him again and driving back into him. Zane cried out and dragged his fingernails down Ty\u2019s back as their bodies slapped together.</p><p>When Ty felt the orgasm almost on him, he stopped and held Zane close to him, breaths harsh and body screaming for release. When it ebbed, he rolled them until he was on his back and Zane sat astride him, Ty\u2019s cock still buried inside him.</p><p>It took a moment for Zane to get his balance, but he settled his weight on his knees and shifted on Ty\u2019s cock. He reached out to take each of Ty\u2019s hands, holding them captive as he began to rock forward and back, searching for the perfect angle.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and pushed his hips up, groaning. Zane kept up the steady movement, occasionally grinding down but not speeding up. \u201cMy turn to make you insane,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ty opened his eyes to look up at his lover. He could see the shiny parts of Zane\u2019s skin that were covered in sweat, lubricant, and come. He licked his lips and panted out a pent-up breath. Zane riding him like this was possibly the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever seen. His muscles were tense and his hips rolled sinuously, his thighs squeezing Ty, his cock half-hard again.</p><p>Zane continued to move his hips until he found the right position again. He put both hands on Ty\u2019s chest, fingernails dragging, and he rolled his hips in circles, using Ty\u2019s cock to massage his prostate and drive Ty insane as he watched.</p><p>Ty sat up the moment Zane stopped moving. He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, no matter how much fun it was to watch Zane\u2019s hips roll like that. He wrapped his arms around Zane\u2019s waist and looked up at him, trying to thrust up into him from that position. He was so close to release his hands were shaking as he pressed his palms against Zane\u2019s back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t ride me properly, I\u2019m gonna have to flip you back over,\u201d he said before reaching up to jerk Zane\u2019s head down for a demanding, desperate, possessive kiss.</p><p>Zane hunched over to help with the kiss and without warning pushed up from his knees nearly off Ty\u2019s cock before slamming himself down, taking Ty\u2019s cock all the way with one smooth motion. \u201cProperly?\u201d he growled when he broke the kiss.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands gripped Zane\u2019s waist, and he called out, encouraging his lover for more. He fell back again, hands sliding to Zane\u2019s hips. He loved to feel the supple movements of Zane\u2019s hips when they were fucking. Zane had never ridden him before, but they would definitely be doing this again.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so hot,\u201d he groaned, pushing his hips up to shove his cock hard into Zane.</p><p>Zane started moving again, up and down, and then he\u2019d sit flat and shift his hips forward, dragging himself along Ty\u2019s cock, before pushing back hard. Then he leaned over, braced himself on one hand, and started riding Ty in earnest, his balls and half-hard cock pinned between them.</p><p>Ty cried out and bucked his hips. He pulled his feet up to give him more leverage and tried to meet Zane\u2019s movements with his own. Their damp bodies slapped together, and he could feel himself pushing past that tight ring of muscle with almost every one of Zane\u2019s movements. It didn\u2019t take long for him to curl upward, the orgasm seeming to start in his toes and work itself through him.</p><p>His fingers grasped at Zane\u2019s shoulder and side urgently as he shoved his cock deep into him one last time, and Zane kept moving, riding him hard through the pulses of his orgasm. Ty finally cried out, a hoarse, desperate sound, fingernails digging into Zane\u2019s skin as he bucked his hips.</p><p>He shuddered as Zane finally slowed and leaned over to kiss him.</p> <p>Ty\u2019s fingers shook as he reached for him. His entire body did. He kissed Zane with tangible relief, wrapping his arms around him and holding him. Zane sighed and settled over him, pressing his chest against Ty\u2019s sweaty skin and placing gentle kisses at his temple.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t even try to calm his breathing, just let himself pant and gasp for air as he hugged Zane to him, then closed his eyes. \u201cThat was fun,\u201d he said, breathless.</p><p>Zane\u2019s soft rumble of laughter reverberated through both their chests, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a really big towel,\u201d Ty murmured as he turned his head to press his mouth against Zane\u2019s temple.</p><p>Zane chuckled again and sighed. \u201cShower.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed a negative. \u201cThen I won\u2019t smell like you when I wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Zane pushed himself up on one elbow so he could look at Ty. \u201cThat\u2019s... ridiculously romantic.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d</p><p>Zane nipped at Ty\u2019s bottom lip to stop the laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached up to kiss him again, slow and careful. \u201cBetter let me up,\u201d he finally said with real regret.</p><p>Zane\u2019s fingers tightened on his arms for a moment before relaxing and releasing him. \u201cFor now,\u201d Zane allowed before climbing off him.</p><p>Ty lay there for a moment, still recovering. Then he sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, fighting down the light-headedness that he knew would come after mind-blowing sex. \u201cBack in a minute,\u201d he said, and he headed for the door to the bathroom on unsteady legs.</p><p>He felt pretty confident in letting Julian and Cameron stay on their own for the night. After the noise he and Zane had made, the other two men could have no doubt what they\u2019d been up to, and they were smart enough not to bother Ty and Zane tonight.</p><p>Ty smiled to himself. That, or they had used the golden opportunity to finally escape. At this point, he really didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>THE soft click of the door brought Cameron out of his doze, and he opened sleepy eyes as the bed dipped on the other side. It was Julian, back from a patrol of the hotel, most likely. Cameron smiled. Julian\u2019s protective instinct was one of his most endearing traits. He slid his hand out from under the pillow to reach for Julian\u2019s. Julian\u2019s cool fingers glided across his palm in the darkness. He felt Julian move, sliding himself into the bed with his usual careful movements.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d he whispered, almost at Cameron\u2019s ear.</p><p>Cameron hummed as he scooted toward Julian\u2019s warmth. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d he murmured before yawning.</p><p>Julian\u2019s arms wrapped around him, pulling him closer. He sighed as he settled Cameron against his chest and rested his chin on top of Cameron\u2019s head. It was the same contented sound he almost always made when he held Cameron to him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve made several attempts to contact Preston, but he\u2019s... simply gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cameron woke up a little, though he nestled as close as he could get, inhaling Julian\u2019s warm, spicy scent. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it means he\u2019s smart and he\u2019s cut and run before he can be dragged into this too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Preston wouldn\u2019t run. I have an awful feeling.\u201d</p><p>Cameron wrapped around him with a frown, knowing there wasn\u2019t much he could do to alleviate the worry or stress.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t heard from the other room in a while, and Cameron found himself smiling as he thought about the two tough, acerbic FBI agents. \u201cIt\u2019s so cute. They\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like watching two kittens fight with machetes,\u201d Julian muttered.</p><p>\u201cJulian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s weird!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. They\u2019re perfect for each other. Poor Zane, though,\u201d Cameron murmured. \u201cIn love with Ty Grady.\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine how frustrating that would be. Then Julian inhaled, and Cameron chuckled slightly. Yeah, he could, actually. \u201cDid I tell you that Ty cuddled Wesson when he was at the apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cuddled him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe picked him up and cuddled him like a baby. I should have known right then that he was just as evil as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. You mentioned he picked him up. And Wesson let him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe purred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then begged for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little harlot.\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed, hiding his face against Julian\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy opinion of them both has been slightly altered, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Julian admitted. \u201cGrady\u2019s still a complete wanker, of course, but....\u201d</p><p>Cameron blinked his eyes open and pulled back to see Julian\u2019s face. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twice as terrifying, working with someone you love. A mistake could cost you everything. It makes what they do that much more... impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do with me, sweetheart,\u201d Cameron said gently.</p><p>Julian laughed. \u201cNo, I can trust you to be smart and stay out of trouble. You\u2019re not... in the thick of things, usually.\u201d</p><p>Cameron swatted at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou are everything to me,\u201d Julian whispered in his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou know you are impossible to resist,\u201d Cameron said with a sniff, cuddling back into his arms. He sighed and added, \u201cI think I must have loved you before you spoke a word to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll part of my charm.\u201d</p><p>Cameron smiled and tipped his head back so he could kiss Julian\u2019s jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re so humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich adds to my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHustler,\u201d Cameron said as he reached up with one hand to tip Julian\u2019s chin down toward him.</p><p>Julian kissed him hard suddenly, holding him tight and delving into the passionate kiss. Cameron inhaled through his nose but snaked one arm up and around Julian\u2019s neck as he gave himself over. Julian could be disconcertingly tender, at odds with his demeanor and size, but he could also be demanding and rough, and Cameron loved it both ways.</p><p>Julian broke the kiss but didn\u2019t loosen his hold on Cameron as he took a deep breath. \u201cHave I told you lately how lucky I am to have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cameron answered as his chest began to ache. It did that around Julian an awful lot.</p><p>\u201cI should tell you every day,\u201d Julian whispered to him. \u201cSeeing those two struggling to love each other and forced to hide it from the world....\u201d He shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cYou\u2019re everything to me, Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Cameron smiled as his pulse sped. \u201cI\u2019m a lucky man. I love you, Julian. If I didn\u2019t stop when you died on me, it\u2019ll never change.\u201d</p><p>Julian kissed him again, his long fingers spreading over Cameron\u2019s back as he tightened his arms around him. Cameron sank into his embrace, pushing away any thoughts of danger or separation. They were together right now, and that was what was important.</p><p>ZANE watched the sun go down and the room fill with darkness in the few minutes Ty was in the bathroom. He stretched on the bed, enjoying the slide of lube and come between his thighs. Muscle fatigue complemented by satiation lulled him into quiet thoughts as he waited for his lover to return. He tucked his arm behind his head and stared up at the ceiling as his mind wandered around reflections and memories of Ty\u2014no big surprise there; that was where his mind almost always wandered.</p><p>The bathroom door creaked as Ty pushed it open, but that was all the noise he made as he crept through the darkness. Zane could barely see him, but the dim light picked up on his naked skin and the white towel he held in his hand.</p><p>It was always fun\u2014and arousing\u2014to watch Ty move, naked or not. He was like a wild cat, all lean, economic, smooth movement that was hypnotizing. He came closer to the bed, steps careful, eyes still adjusting to the darkness. He crawled up the bed and over Zane without a word, taking care not to rub against his sticky belly. He kissed him soundly before climbing off him and laying the towel on Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked in a low whisper.</p><p>Zane nodded and moved one hand to put the damp towel to use, but he kept his eyes on Ty. He just didn\u2019t want to look away.</p><p>Ty shook his head, grinning so that Zane could see the white of his teeth. He shifted, stretching out his shoulders before rolling onto his side and propping his head on his hand as he looked at Zane. It would be a trick for them to sleep in the double bed without one or both of them ending up on the floor at least once. But Zane figured he might just curl up around Ty close enough that it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Zane finished with the towel and tossed it to the floor. When he glanced back, that grin was still in place on Ty\u2019s lips. Zane snorted, enjoying the sparkle in Ty\u2019s eyes. He reached out and let his fingers coast down Ty\u2019s cheek to drift over the compass rose at his neck. \u201cYou know how to break me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing on my mind,\u201d Ty murmured. He scooted forward and pressed his lips to Zane\u2019s. He didn\u2019t try to deepen the kiss or grope Zane like he usually did. It was a simple, sweet gesture, one that he ended all too soon as he rolled onto his back once more.</p><p>He put one arm under his head and stretched the other out under Zane\u2019s neck. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>Zane shifted to curl against Ty\u2019s warm body under the curve of his arm. He slid his hand over Ty\u2019s waist and settled his arm there so he could hold Ty as well.</p><p>Ty turned his head enough to nuzzle his nose and mouth against Zane\u2019s. He wrapped his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulders and held him close, bringing his other hand to his waist to rest on Zane\u2019s hand there. He was silent, his body loose and still. Zane had rarely ever felt Ty when he was truly relaxed. Even in sleep or after drinking, his muscles always seemed to be tight and tense, his body ready for action.</p><p>Zane hummed. \u201cWish I had this effect on you more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat effect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one,\u201d Zane said as he slid his hand up Ty\u2019s torso until he could trace Ty\u2019s lax features with his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re so relaxed. It\u2019s quite a sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always relaxed,\u201d Ty mumbled, though the smile in his voice told Zane he was merely poking fun at himself. He hugged Zane closer, kissing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cIs this the result of your little sabbatical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly. Mostly it\u2019s my dangerous lack of caffeine right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled, and he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhere\u2019d the sandalwood come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeuce. His crazy yoga girlfriend has gotten him on board the scent therapy stuff. It\u2019s supposed to relieve stress. I don\u2019t know if it works; I just think it smells good.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed, and Ty chuckled along with him. The warmth soaking through Zane was heady and addictive. He couldn\u2019t remember being this content to just be still and next to Ty, although it was always pleasant. Now it meant even more, because Zane knew exactly how special this was.</p><p>He would never have imagined, even after their first night together, when Ty had held him all night, that they could ever have this.</p><p>\u201cI was sure, when we met, that you were a straight-arrow ladies\u2019 man,\u201d Zane said. He pressed a soft kiss to the hollow of Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Ty laughed. \u201cYou were half-right.\u201d</p><p>Zane pushed himself up so he could look at Ty. \u201cHow\u2019s that work?\u201d he asked, a smile pulling at his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf-straight? Half ladies?\u201d Zane poked at Ty\u2019s belly, his finger hitting hard muscle. \u201cYou\u2019ve never mentioned any other men.\u201d</p><p>Ty shifted again and reached up to run his hand down Zane\u2019s arm, letting his fingers play over Zane\u2019s muscles. \u201cI think it\u2019s been pretty half and half, who I\u2019m attracted to. Most of the other men I\u2019ve been with have been one-time hookups,\u201d he admitted, words careful, as if he were trying to gauge Zane\u2019s reaction as he said it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane wasn\u2019t quite sure what problem Ty thought he\u2019d have with it; that pretty much described him too. \u201cAre you expecting... shock?\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve just never asked me about this kind of stuff, I keep expecting your head to spin or something.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. He shrugged the shoulder he wasn\u2019t lying on. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve obviously switch-hit and bounced around. It\u2019d be pretty shitty of me to judge you for the same.\u201d</p> <p>Ty nodded. \u201cWell... you know I haven\u2019t been a saint. Most of the people I\u2019ve been with have been... let\u2019s just say I remember the majority by the names of the bar or city I met them in,\u201d he said, unembarrassed by the fact. Ty had never tried to present himself to Zane as anything but what he was. That honesty was oddly assuring to Zane now that they were exclusive.</p><p>\u201cWas there ever anyone serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d Ty answered. \u201cA couple women I didn\u2019t love but I could see myself with long-term, one in particular, but....\u201d He cleared his throat and shook his head. \u201cThe connection never felt right. It was always so much more natural with a guy. I was always scared to get too involved with the guys I met, though. There was only one I ever let myself fall hard for, before you.\u201d</p><p>It was fascinating, watching Ty from so close when his expressions were so open and honest. Zane tried to follow his eyes, but Ty clearly felt a little awkward with all the sharing, and he continued to stare at the ceiling. \u201cI get the feeling it\u2019s been a while,\u201d Zane said, moving his hand over Ty\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cI was young,\u201d Ty said with a nod. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we really loved each other or not. I\u2019m not sure if you even know what love is at seventeen. Felt like it at the time. Enough to scare us. We decided we had to get away from each other before we fell too hard.\u201d He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cThat\u2019s why I joined the Marines, you know. I never told anyone that.\u201d</p> <p>Zane blinked in surprise. \u201cReally? I thought you were following the family tradition. Semper fi and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just made it easy to explain. No one asked any questions; they all just assumed I was following in Dad\u2019s footsteps. I had thought about it before, it was something I knew I wanted to do, knew I\u2019d be good at. But suddenly it was an escape route too.\u201d</p><p>Zane trailed his finger down Ty\u2019s chest as he listened, raptly watching Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSee, my senior year in high school we were playing in a big rivalry game homecoming weekend. I was on defense. I don\u2019t remember why, I almost never played defense. But I was that night, and I sacked the other team\u2019s quarterback. He was a senior too, played all the same sports, so I knew him a little bit from all the games we\u2019d played against each other. I broke his leg.\u201d</p><p>He winced with the memory, and Zane smiled. It was always fascinating to find out what Ty sympathized with.</p><p>\u201cHis last home game and he had to be carried off the field on a little cart. The next day I went to see him, tell him I was sorry. It was his left leg, full cast up to his thigh, so he couldn\u2019t drive a stick, couldn\u2019t get around. I felt guilty, so....\u201d He laughed suddenly at the memory. \u201cI wrote my phone number on his cast and told him to call me whenever he needed to go somewhere. We ended up... we spent a lot of time together. Hit it off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he your first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Ty reached up and idly twirled his finger through Zane\u2019s hair. \u201cHis name was David.\u201d</p><p>Zane tipped his head to the side to be closer to Ty\u2019s fingers. It was a remarkably intimate action, and he loved that Ty was doing it, seemingly without thinking about it. He smiled at the idea of a teenage Ty flirting with a guy he\u2019d literally maimed the night before, writing his number on the guy\u2019s cast to get him to call him. It was sweet, in a very Grady sort of way. \u201cHave you seen him since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple times,\u201d Ty answered with a nod. \u201cHe\u2019s a lawyer down in Richmond.\u201d</p><p>Zane reached to touch Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cDoes it bother you to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ty waited a moment before answering in a surprised voice. \u201cNot really. I guess it\u2019s just been a secret for so long....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d he turn out?\u201d Zane asked, not wanting to press his lover on the topic of secrets. \u201cBachelor? Married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong-term relationship with a guy he met in college,\u201d Ty answered wryly. His smile fell and he shook his head, closing his eyes as he continued to play with Zane\u2019s hair. \u201cHe\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever run from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeing attracted to another man at that time in your life, I\u2019m sure it was a shock to deal with,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI probably would have run too.\u201d</p><p>The only thing Zane had known when he\u2019d been that age was Becky. How would he have handled it if those feelings had been for another guy? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cAm I the first guy you\u2019ve been involved with? I mean, beyond the ones you left in the alley.\u201d</p><p>Zane pressed his index finger on the slight wrinkles between Ty\u2019s brows and rubbed, trying to get him to open his eyes. Ty batted at his hand, then caught it and kissed it, trapping it against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t even consider being with a guy until after Becky was gone, but up to that point I hadn\u2019t considered being with anyone.\u201d It came out so easily, he surprised himself. Usually thinking about Becky at least echoed some sort of pain. But here with Ty, it didn\u2019t hurt. It was a chapter in his life that was finally over.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you start?\u201d Ty asked him as he held Zane\u2019s hand firmly to his chest to keep him from poking at his face again.</p><p>\u201cLust,\u201d Zane answered. \u201cIt was while I was undercover in Miami, working a smuggling operation from Colombia. We were treated to our choice of escorts, and there was this... well, he was the first one that caught my eye and I couldn\u2019t look away. I figured what the hell, new experiences. After a few times I figured out I enjoyed being with a guy more than any woman I\u2019d been with. It was fun, a good way to blow off steam, really hot.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, remaining quiet as he rubbed his thumb back and forth over Zane\u2019s hand. He could feel Ty relaxing against him again, body loosening and growing more languid as he held him close. Zane smiled and shifted to lie down again, this time settling his cheek on Ty\u2019s breastbone. \u201cSo tell me about the one woman. One woman among so many,\u201d he quipped.</p><p>Ty immediately groaned and jerked under him. \u201cI was hoping that would slip past you,\u201d he said, only partly joking.</p><p>\u201cNot hardly,\u201d Zane drawled. He pressed his lips to Ty\u2019s skin for a moment. \u201cTell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat. \u201cHer name was Ava,\u201d he said in defeat. \u201cI met her when I was in New Orleans. I almost proposed to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zane blurted, lifting his head to look at Ty.</p><p>Ty smiled and shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI could never convince myself it was a good idea. I was right. It didn\u2019t stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Zane admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ty asked, shifting uncomfortably but meeting Zane\u2019s eyes anyway.</p><p>\u201cBecause you stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips together, looking at Zane worriedly for a moment before reaching up and sliding his palm against Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cI didn\u2019t love her. And I wasn\u2019t the one who ended it,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zane whispered, even though deep down he really wasn\u2019t. Ty shook his head. Zane studied him for a long moment. \u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight before Katrina hit,\u201d Ty murmured, frowning as he tried to remember how many years ago that had been.</p><p>\u201cFive years this summer.\u201d Zane said. He paused, swallowing hard before asking, \u201cDo you... does it still hurt?\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed before he could stop himself. He clapped his hand over his mouth as if he was trying to hide the reaction, and he shook his head.</p><p>Zane pushed up to look down at him, not sure how to interpret that reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ty said hastily, reaching for Zane\u2019s arm to stop him from pulling away. \u201cIt\u2019s just your choice of words is....\u201d He laughed again and took Zane\u2019s hand, pulling it to the side of his stomach, just under his ribs, to let Zane\u2019s fingers rest against his skin. \u201cYou feel that scar there?\u201d he asked as he placed Zane\u2019s fingers along a faded scar Zane had noticed before.</p><p>Zane frowned and nodded, feeling the smooth raised line of scar tissue under his fingertips. It went from the front of Ty\u2019s hip to the back, like he\u2019d been grazed. Then his eyes widened. \u201cShe did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrew a butcher\u2019s knife at me,\u201d Ty told him, voice tinged with an odd mixture of amusement and irritation. \u201cHer aim was usually better, so I\u2019m pretty sure she missed on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pretty set on ending it, then.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and inhaled deeply as he relaxed back into bed. \u201cIt was my fault. She didn\u2019t know I was a Fed,\u201d he said with true regret. \u201cBy the time I realized I might have real feelings for her, I was stuck. Couldn\u2019t figure out how to tell her and not blow my cover. She didn\u2019t even know my last name. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, I guess... I just hoped she\u2019d still care for me after the case was over and I could come clean to her. But then, when Katrina was bearing down, they pulled everyone, UC or not, to help with evacuation and prepare for search and rescue. I went to her and told her to leave, that I\u2019d found a transport for her and her family to get out safely. She refused until I promised I\u2019d go with them. But I couldn\u2019t leave. I had to tell her why just to get her on the helicopter.\u201d</p><p>It was an easy question to ask why she\u2019d been upset, but it wasn\u2019t one Zane needed an answer to. It was difficult when you lived a life undercover, and many people didn\u2019t take kindly to such thorough lies, even for the best of reasons. Ty had given up someone he thought he could love to save her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... I was sort of afraid she\u2019d try again with a knife that was easier to throw,\u201d Ty answered, laughing. He bit his lip, looking up at Zane with eyes that shined even in the dim light. \u201cNo. The hurricane hit. The city just got... wiped off the map, pretty much. For days we did nothing but survive. Pull people out of the water, kids and animals and old people. Me and everyone else down there cried ourselves to sleep whenever we got the chance. All I could do was make sure they were all okay, everyone I\u2019d known, you know, undercover. But every UC in New Orleans that got blown had to be transferred after the search and rescue became body recovery and they started getting people out. They didn\u2019t give us a chance to linger. That\u2019s how I ended up in Baltimore. I never saw her again after that night.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t understand. If Ty had really cared for her, or even thought he might have loved her, how had he given her up so easily?</p><p>Ty shifted and looked at Zane with a sigh. \u201cYou look... disturbed. You\u2019re wondering why I didn\u2019t try harder to get her back, right?\u201d Ty nodded, as if answering his own question. \u201cI cared about her, I did. But after a week or two I realized that she wasn\u2019t the first thing I thought of when I woke up. And when something would happen during the day, she wasn\u2019t the first person I thought I needed to tell it to.\u201d He looked at Zane and smiled. \u201cNot like you. I wasn\u2019t in love with her. She deserved someone who was.\u201d</p><p>Zane considered what to say. He wasn\u2019t going to give Ty platitudes; they\u2019d be dismissed anyway. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. But I\u2019m not sorry it happened. I wouldn\u2019t have you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled him closer. \u201cFunny how life works, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said as he eased into Ty\u2019s arms. They\u2019d both lost a lot along the way. He needed to remember that.</p><p>The warmth of Ty\u2019s body next to Zane\u2019s and his easy breathing were both calming and familiar, and Zane found himself sinking into him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay with all that?\u201d Ty finally asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your past. Can\u2019t be changed any more than mine can. I\u2019m fine with it. Unless we vacation there for Mardi Gras, then I might be on the lookout. I was there once with Becky. We loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever go back I\u2019ll have to do it locked and loaded,\u201d Ty said. \u201cI left too many pissed off loose ends down there, including one Cajun daddy who really liked voodoo.\u201d</p><p>Zane barked a laugh before he could stop himself. He knew how superstitious Ty was, and something about him being afraid of the voodoo-wielding father of a former flame was intensely amusing.</p><p>Ty rolled to his side to face Zane. He reached up to touch Zane\u2019s chin with his fingertips. \u201cWe still have a lot to learn about each other.\u201d</p><p>Zane figured that was a hell of an understatement. He smiled as Ty\u2019s lips brushed his. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ty grinned against Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes, the warmth of contentment stealing over him as they wrapped around each other and settled down to try to sleep. \u201cShould we set an alarm?\u201d Zane asked after a quiet minute. Ty\u2019s breathing had settled into a rhythm, low and even; Zane thought he might even have dropped off to sleep.</p><p>But Ty shook his head in immediate answer. He patted his chest before sliding his hand back over Zane\u2019s. \u201cAlarm\u2019s built-in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane smiled as he buried his face against Ty\u2019s chest. He drifted off to sleep, the warmth of Ty\u2019s body and the fading smell of sandalwood filling him with a sense of tranquility he had rarely experienced.</p><p>Zane estimated that it was several hours later, still well before dawn, when he awoke to the mattress dipping and Ty getting out of bed.</p><p>He had to move carefully in the dark as he rummaged for his clothing and got dressed. It was painfully obvious that he was trying to be silent, trying not to wake Zane. Zane lay listening, almost dozing. Ty sat at the table in the corner and pulled on his boots, and when he stood, he bent over the table for a moment, writing a note.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, Ty, not again,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Ty jumped and turned to look at him. \u201cJackass,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zane asked as he pushed up onto one elbow.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen the battlefield in the moonlight?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him, a smile forming as he nodded. \u201cLet me get dressed.\u201d</p><p>CAMERON didn\u2019t even get a chance to gasp for breath. He grabbed for the arms surrounding him and slapped a hand over the fingers that covered his mouth, trying to wake up as he felt himself being yanked up from the pillow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, love,\u201d Julian\u2019s soft voice assured him as he pulled him out of bed. There was an undercurrent of something else in his tone, though, something frightened and urgent. \u201cStay quiet.\u201d</p><p>Cameron nodded and drew a shaky breath when Julian moved his hand away from his mouth. He got his feet under him as Julian released him a moment later, but Cameron had no intention of moving an inch away. Something had spooked Julian, and that was never a good thing.</p><p>Julian was tense and silent, his dark eyes riveted on the door to the room and his ear cocked toward the wall that separated their room from Ty and Zane\u2019s. They could easily hear through the walls; they\u2019d found that out earlier.</p> <p>Julian had no weapon on him. If there was a threat now, they\u2019d be facing it unarmed. \u201cGet your shoes on,\u201d Julian whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p><p>Stepping away from the safety of his lover\u2019s hulking presence was more difficult than Cameron imagined it would be. He shoved his feet into his running shoes and crouched to tie them. Pulling the laces tight, he glanced up at Julian, trying to get a feel for the situation.</p><p>Julian stood stock-still, barely even breathing as he stared hard at the door. He wasn\u2019t looking directly at it, more to the side of it, as if trying to see it out of the corner of his eye. The soft sound of voices filtered through the thick walls, and Julian moved suddenly, whipping his head to the right to look around the room. Cameron stepped back as Julian practically pounced on the desk several feet away, picking up the desk lamp and yanking the power cord out of the base. He reached into the lampshade and unscrewed the lightbulb, then pulled the cord out of the wall. Looking from Julian to the door and back, Cameron scooted out of the way, putting Julian and the heavy wooden armoire of electronics between himself and the door.</p><p>\u201cCam,\u201d Julian hissed, barely audible in the darkness. \u201cFix the pillows on the bed, make it look like someone sleeping. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>Cameron rushed the three steps to the bed, grabbing some of the pillows they\u2019d tossed onto the floor and making columns on the bed. He pulled the comforter up and was hurriedly shoving it down between the pillows when he heard a voice outside the door. He didn\u2019t even think; one of the first things Julian had taught him was to hide. Cameron turned, took one step to the side, and crouched down behind the solid armchair and ottoman to the left side of the bed, curling his frame up behind it so he was out of sight. He hoped.</p><p>\u201cThe other room was empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to be here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>There was more that Cameron couldn\u2019t make out. A moment later, the door to the bedroom splintered at the knob. There was another bang, and Cameron squeezed into a tighter ball as the door flew open. A shaft of light from the hallway fell upon the bed, and he saw the shadow of a man with a gun in his hand cast against the wall above the headboard not four feet away from him. The man didn\u2019t fire, though.</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d he heard the attacker say, obviously realizing the ruse.</p><p>Another heartbeat later, Cameron heard the struggle start, and he knew that Julian had attacked the man. Cameron pried open his eyes and peered around the back of the chair.</p><p>Julian\u2019s back was to the wall beside the door. He had the cord of the lamp wrapped around the stranger\u2019s neck, twisting it from behind as the man struggled against him. Another man came through the doorway, gun drawn, and Julian reached out with one hand and slammed the lightbulb into the second man\u2019s face as he stepped through the doorway. He gave a bloodcurdling scream as he fell back out of the room, and Julian kicked the door shut as he tightened the cord around the first gunman\u2019s neck.</p><p>Cameron knew he was probably best off where he was, but he shifted to a crouch rather than staying on his knees so when Julian called he\u2019d be ready to go.</p><p>The stranger sank to his knees, gasping for breath in the darkness as Julian held the ends of the cord tight. Cameron was grateful he couldn\u2019t see the dying man\u2019s face. The body fell to the ground with a thud, but Julian continued to kneel over him, pulling the cord tight. Shots punched through the thick door over his head, and Julian flinched and covered his head, rolling away from the door.</p><p>\u201cCam, stay down!\u201d he called in a harsh whisper.</p><p>More noises came from outside, shouts and breaking glass, bangs and more shouting, and Cameron covered his head instinctively. Gunfire roared, two, three, maybe four shots. Then all was silent for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cTwo men down.\u201d The voice was sharp, clipped, and familiar, close to the door. Then, louder, \u201cCross? Are you in there?\u201d Cameron let out his breath. That was Zane.</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t answer. Cameron could hear him breathing hard, somewhere in the darkness near the door. \u201cCross? Cameron?\u201d Zane tried again, his voice still flat. Cameron bit his lip. Julian would have said something if he wanted to, so Cameron kept his mouth shut. Then he heard the busted door swing open and he glanced around the chair back.</p><p>As soon as the agent\u2019s shadow entered the doorway, Julian moved. He wrapped an arm around Zane\u2019s neck, holding the broken bit of lightbulb to his throat as he used Zane\u2019s body to shield him from whoever else was outside.</p><p>A second later, the light flipped on and Ty moved into the room with his gun drawn, eyes on Julian and Zane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fighting you, Cross,\u201d Zane said, keeping both hands down and out to his sides.</p><p>\u201cLet him go, MacGuffin, we just saved your ass,\u201d Ty told him, the gun not wavering.</p><p>\u201cNo one could possibly know we were here. No one but your men. Check their badges,\u201d Julian ordered. He didn\u2019t let up on the pressure he was exerting on Zane\u2019s neck.</p><p>Ty held up his hand to calm Julian and bent down, rummaging through the dead man\u2019s pockets as he kept his eyes and gun on Julian. Cameron shifted behind the chair, staying down for now.</p><p>A moment later Ty pulled a badge and held it up, looking at it in shock as he flipped it open. It read FBI in big blue letters.</p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Julian shouted. \u201cThey\u2019re your people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not our people,\u201d Zane said. \u201cLet up, Cross. We both know I could have shot you twice before you had me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t, your fault,\u201d Julian said. \u201cGrady, the gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d Ty said as he continued to pat the dead man\u2019s pockets. He pulled out a clear spiral cord from behind the man\u2019s ear and whistled as he held it up. \u201cThese aren\u2019t Bureau issue.\u201d</p><p>Julian relaxed his grip on Zane as he looked at the earpiece. Cameron stood, wondering if he\u2019d ever seen a man so close to Julian\u2019s size next to him. From the back, or maybe the side, he just might mistake Zane Garrett for Julian, and that was still disconcerting even after all this time with him.</p><p>\u201cWe knew there was something more to this,\u201d Zane reminded them, his back still against Julian\u2019s chest, though he didn\u2019t seem particularly fazed by the bloody broken glass at his throat. \u201cI think it might be a little more important to be leaving right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Julian said instantly. He dropped the lightbulb and turned to look back for Cameron.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they find us? That\u2019s so fucking random,\u201d Ty asked as he stood. He sounded pissed.</p><p>As Zane and Ty kept talking, Cameron tuned them out. He\u2019d be along for the ride regardless of his input. His eyes strayed from Julian, over to the mess of the bed, across the littered floor between them, to the crumpled body of a dead man with a lamp cord wrapped around his throat. Cameron let out a shaky breath. He knew that life with Julian was like this sometimes, but that didn\u2019t mean it was easy to handle or understand.</p><p>Julian moved toward him and hugged him fiercely, seeming to sense that was what he needed. And it was, to be held close and comforted. Cameron sighed and tipped his head back to find Julian\u2019s eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cameron did not look down at the body nearby but instead toward the two men searching the other bodies, words flying rapid-fire between them. He hadn\u2019t been paying attention to know if Ty and Zane were working or insulting each other. For all he knew, it could be the same thing with them. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Julian agreed as he looked back at the two agents. He squeezed Cameron\u2019s arm. \u201cGet dressed, Cameron, okay? We\u2019re leaving as soon as these two idiots figure this out.\u201d</p><p>Cameron nodded. He wanted to ask questions, but the set of Julian\u2019s shoulders told him that now was not the time.</p><p>TY GROWLED as they stripped the dead bodies of all the weaponry they could find. He didn\u2019t like being in the dark, and he felt decidedly shadowed right now.</p><p>\u201cWhoever they are, they\u2019ve got top-notch gear,\u201d Zane said as he pulled a backup gun off one of the fallen agents.</p><p>Ty nodded unhappily. \u201cYeah, like their tricked-out fucking CIA spy cars. What could they possibly have tracked? We\u2019ve tossed everything we have.\u201d</p><p>Julian stepped toward them, holding a gun he\u2019d taken from one of the men before Ty or Zane could get to it. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d he announced. He held up the gun. \u201cWith or without you.\u201d</p><p>Cameron stopped behind Julian, their smallest bag over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSimmer down, Cross, all right?\u201d Ty muttered as he picked up the dead man\u2019s fake badge again. He stared at it, the FBI logo emblazoning itself into his mind. \u201cAh, shit,\u201d he hissed as he stood up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked as he stood as well. He checked the ammunition in the gun in his hand and snapped the cartridge back in place before looking at Ty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, they\u2019ve been tracking me,\u201d Ty said as he pulled at the nylon strap of his wristwatch.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d Julian demanded as he stepped forward.</p><p>Ty held up the watch. It was a Citizen Promaster Eco-drive dive watch with a black nylon band and a chrome and matte black face. He wore it everywhere he went, never even taking it off to sleep or shower. Richard Burns had given it to him when he\u2019d graduated from the Academy.</p><p>Julian shrugged impatiently as he looked at it.</p><p>\u201cIt has a tracking device in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt what?\u201d Zane blurted.</p><p>Ty glanced at him, apologetic. \u201cBurns had a tracker put in it so he could follow me on assignments. I only activate it when I\u2019m dark or think I\u2019m going to die, but it can be pinged remotely in case I go off grid and he needs to find me.\u201d</p><p>Zane was staring at him, wide-eyed.</p><p>Ty shrugged and dropped the watch, raising his booted foot to stomp it. Julian grabbed his arm before he could bring his foot down.</p><p>\u201cLeave it. They may think it\u2019s you lying dead on the floor and give us some extra time.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, and he spared one last glance for the watch on the expensive rug before he followed the others out.</p><p>\u201cWas it a special watch, Ty?\u201d Cameron asked as they made their way down the back stairwell of the hotel.</p><p>Ty shook his head, too troubled to answer. Burns was the only one who knew that tracking device was there. How had the CIA known to ping it?</p><p>\u201cMY MAN just went offline,\u201d Burns said, voice grim as he leaned against the desk and stared at the large screen on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat could do that?\u201d Jonas asked as he stood to join Burns.</p><p>\u201cWell, he could have turned it off. But he wouldn\u2019t, not when he\u2019s in the wind like this. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you turn it back on remotely?\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded and went to his computer. A few clicks later and the tracking device in Ty\u2019s watch came back to life, the blue dot flickering before it gained strength. It was still in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It had been there for over twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t moved,\u201d Jonas observed, brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Burns whispered. \u201cHe took the watch off.\u201d</p><p>Jonas turned, looking at him in alarm. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe figured out that we weren\u2019t the only ones using it.\u201d Burns slammed his hand down on his desk.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know how he thinks. Someone must have found them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no way of tracking them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Jonas asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTheir orders were to get Cross here to me. We have to trust them to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, I don\u2019t trust anyone that much.\u201d</p><p>Burns met his friend\u2019s eyes and smiled. \u201cLuckily, I do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>TY KNEW the names of the valet and the concierge, so it didn\u2019t take anything for them to make it inside the swank Regatta building in downtown Philadelphia. They rode the elevator all the way to the eighteenth floor, to the penthouse suites. Instead of knocking on 1802, though, Ty pulled out a small lock picking set and bent toward the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cYou could just knock,\u201d Zane said as Ty fiddled with the lock.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d There was a click and Ty opened the door. \u201cLet\u2019s hope he hasn\u2019t changed his code,\u201d he said as he slipped in and disappeared.</p><p>Zane sighed and turned to glance at Julian and Cameron. Both men had been quiet since leaving Gettysburg. They all had. Ty especially had been concerned about the watch he\u2019d left behind, but Zane couldn\u2019t decide if he felt guilty for having been the reason they\u2019d been found or if there was something more troubling him. Knowing Ty, he felt guilty about something.</p><p>It was clear now that someone very powerful did not want Julian Cross to get to Washington. Zane had to wonder why Burns hadn\u2019t told them what they faced, but that was just how Burns worked.</p> <p>There was a small sound within the condo, a sweeping sound and a barely audible click. Zane had enough time to turn his head and peer through the doorway before he saw a shadowed figure moving inside. He moved to stand with his back against the hallway wall, next to the open door, chin turned to the side to watch for movement. It wasn\u2019t that he was scared of who was inside\u2014quite the opposite. He just knew the Gradys well. He didn\u2019t want to get shot, smacked, or stabbed, accidentally or otherwise.</p><p>There was silence for a few moments, and then a sudden shout, and the sound of a scuffle ensued.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Ty cried out finally. \u201cDeacon, it\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>When Zane peered around the doorframe, he could barely make out the scene in the dim light from the moon through the windows. Ty lay on the floor with his hands held out in front of his face, his younger brother standing over him wielding a wooden baseball bat, raised and ready to swing it down again. A sharp bark of laughter escaped before Zane could stifle it, and he leaned against the doorframe, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Deuce Grady said as he lowered his bat and looked down at his brother, who was still cowering on the floor. He looked over at the doorway and then back down at Ty. \u201cWhat the hell, man? You have a key!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d Zane beckoned for Julian and Cameron to come closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he had a key,\u201d he said, giving up on hiding the somewhat strained laughter bubbling in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cMan\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Julian muttered.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019m inclined to agree,\u201d Zane said under his breath.</p><p>Inside, Deuce was helping Ty to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t have it with me and I was trying not to wake you,\u201d Ty hissed, keeping his voice down. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to draw attention in case anyone was watching. Garrett, quit laughing and get them in here.\u201d</p><p>Zane stepped into the penthouse and looked around. It opened into a grand foyer with high ceilings and large windows that displayed a huge terrace with views of the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Delaware River. There was marble flooring, and directly to the right of the entrance was a designer kitchen all in sleek, cool colors. There was a den and a solarium, where it looked like Deuce had set up his office. It was a million-dollar home, Zane had no doubt.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Deuce. This is... nice,\u201d Zane said as he looked around the penthouse.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Deuce said, sounding confused by their sudden arrival but too polite to ask them what the hell they were doing there in the middle of the night. \u201cIt serves as my office too, so I can justify a little luxury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody cares, Slugger,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Deuce looked down at the baseball bat still in his hand and shrugged, unapologetic.</p> <p>Beside Zane, Julian cleared his throat and reached his hand out to Cameron, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and pulling him close.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, your version of a camping trip?\u201d Deuce asked Ty as he set the bat aside and moved to help with the bags they\u2019d carried in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve run into some... trouble,\u201d Ty said with a wince.</p><p>\u201cRun away from some trouble,\u201d Zane corrected as he shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Deuce said. He flipped on the kitchen light and turned to look them over. \u201cI don\u2019t see blood.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and stepped up to hug Ty\u2019s brother. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Deuce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say the same,\u201d Deuce said, though his voice was still warm and amused as he returned the hug. He glanced at his brother, who was unconsciously rubbing at his forearm where he\u2019d apparently blocked one of Deuce\u2019s swings with the bat.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Ty said as soon as Deuce looked at him. He cleared his throat and dropped his hands. \u201cThis is Julian Cross and Cameron Jacobs. They\u2019re in protective custody,\u201d he told Deuce as he waved his hand at the two men.</p><p>\u201cOh, now it\u2019s protective custody?\u201d Julian muttered. \u201cNo more get on your knees, let me bungee you to the roof of the car?\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at Julian and Cameron. \u201cGentlemen, this is my brother, Deacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Deuce. Protective custody,\u201d Deuce repeated. He glanced at the two men, then at Ty and Zane again speculatively. \u201cAnd your gimp brother got the drop on you with a baseball bat? Really, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Julian made a sound in the back of his throat that may have been a stifled laugh.</p><p>Cameron looked among them and rolled his eyes. \u201cCould you direct me to the bathroom, please?\u201d he asked Deuce.</p><p>Deuce turned and pointed toward the dark hallway. \u201cFirst door on the left.\u201d</p><p>Ty was grumbling and rubbing his forearm as he moved to the nearest chair and threw himself into it. \u201cWhere\u2019s uh... what was her name? Yoga girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivi,\u201d Deuce said with a smile. \u201cShe went home last night, had to feed her dog.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cBest to keep her away while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, let me just call her up and tell her I\u2019m harboring my brother, his partner, and their two federal fugitive buddies for a few days, take herself a spa weekend. That won\u2019t get me accused of anything nefarious.\u201d</p><p>Ty waved a hand through the air, obviously not caring.</p><p>Deuce glanced at him before turning his attention back to Zane and Julian. \u201cDare I ask what you\u2019ve done to deserve protective custody?\u201d he asked Julian.</p><p>\u201cI deal antiques,\u201d Julian answered in a soft voice.</p><p>Deuce nodded, looking Julian up and down. He turned his head to look at Ty speculatively. \u201cThat\u2019s a euphemism for \u2018I kill things\u2019, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s classified,\u201d Zane murmured as he pulled off his jacket and tossed it over one of the bags. Julian was silent and still behind him.</p><p>\u201cAll righty, then,\u201d Deuce said cheerfully. \u201cDo you need food, showers, or beds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeds,\u201d Ty answered, voice thin and exhausted. He had been taking the bulk of the driving, simply because he was the best suited to being able to keep himself awake and he\u2019d known where he was going as they\u2019d set out for Philadelphia. But he had reached the end of his stamina on the outskirts of the city.</p><p>After they\u2019d fled Gettysburg, they\u2019d basically had three options: head for DC as fast as they could and risk hitting a CIA roadblock, go home to Baltimore and hope the CIA wasn\u2019t sitting on their homes, or abscond to Philadelphia in the hopes that their pursuers wouldn\u2019t expect it. In the end they\u2019d decided that trying to get to DC would be suicide; every road in and out could be watched, and they couldn\u2019t risk driving into the hornet\u2019s nest. Baltimore had been viable, but they\u2019d feared it would be watched too. Since the CIA had known to find Ty\u2019s tracking device, they obviously knew who Ty and Zane were now and where their home was. They would spend a few nights in Philadelphia, as long as they dared, and then try to sneak their way back to DC somehow. They just needed a night\u2019s sleep before they could figure out how to do it.</p><p>Ty was rubbing his eyes. \u201cThose two can take the guest bed. Zane and I will fight over the couch.\u201d</p><p>Deuce just nodded. \u201cCome help me unearth the air mattress, we\u2019ll toss it in the floor here,\u201d he said as he jerked his head at Ty and turned to head down the hall.</p><p>Ty pushed himself out of his chair and followed.</p><p>Julian waited until both men were out of sight before taking a step further into the room to look at Zane. \u201cWhich one of them is adopted?\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. He knew on the surface, the two Grady brothers seemed very different. While Deuce did look a lot like Ty\u2014he was an inch or so taller, much less broad, his hair was lighter, and his eyes were greener\u2014their personalities could not have been more different. Ty was often abrasive and blunt, wielding sarcasm like a weapon, while Deuce was more diplomatic and kind, finding the gentlest ways of saying even the harshest of things. They had completely different tastes in everything from clothing to decorating to the cars they liked to drive. Their similar looks and quick wit were really the only things they seemed to share. Zane knew better, though. Deep down in their psyches, both brothers were really just waiting to get old enough to sit on a porch and bang things with a shovel.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to meet the rest of the family.\u201d He arched his back, listening to the audible pops of his spine as he stretched within the confines of his gun holster. \u201cBut they\u2019re good people,\u201d he added, looking at Julian. \u201cDeuce is one of the best.\u201d</p><p>Julian merely looked back at him. Finally, he nodded almost imperceptibly. \u201cI decided I liked him the moment he hit Grady with a baseball bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeuce doesn\u2019t take shit from anybody, Ty included. Or maybe Ty especially.\u201d He shrugged and leaned over to pick up one of the bags, and his mind moved on to more serious concerns as he looked back at Julian. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here for a day, get some rest and food. Let me know if you and Cameron need anything.\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded again, swallowing hard as his eye strayed to the hallway where Cameron had disappeared. It was easy to see that Julian was worried now. Before, he\u2019d either thought he could keep the situation under control or he\u2019d been masking his apprehension well.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere we touch down now will be a hot zone,\u201d he said, his voice still soft and barely audible. \u201cAgent Grady\u2019s brother will be in danger as well if we stay too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy is well aware,\u201d Zane said, though he shared Julian\u2019s concern, at least for Deuce.</p><p>The low light mostly masked Julian\u2019s reaction, but he seemed tense and reserved, as if he wanted to say something he was keeping himself from saying.</p><p>Ty\u2019s voice filtered down the hallway. \u201cHow are you going to hit me with a bat I freaking gave you for your birthday? That shit\u2019s commemorative.\u201d</p><p>Deuce\u2019s response was muffled by his laughter.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in God, Agent Garrett?\u201d Julian asked suddenly, his eyes on the hallway.</p><p>The question caught Zane off guard, but he wasn\u2019t sure that was Julian\u2019s goal. Religion didn\u2019t have much place in Zane\u2019s life anymore, like a lot of other things. But did he believe?</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly. Zane figured he\u2019d have long ago been in the ground if it wasn\u2019t for some higher power watching out for him.</p><p>Julian was nodding. \u201cYou should. It\u2019s a bloody miracle your partner has lived this long,\u201d he murmured. He began moving toward the kitchen. \u201cMan\u2019s an idiot,\u201d he muttered under his breath as he passed Zane.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t laugh this time. In years past he had sat uncounted times in the dark of night, smoking, shooting up, drinking, wondering if the coming morning would be the one when he didn\u2019t wake up. Sometimes he\u2019d even prayed for it.</p><p>But not since Ty. Yeah, he believed in miracles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I knew it was you,\u201d he heard Deuce insisting as he came back down the hall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Grandpa said when he broke my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, you deserved it.\u201d Deuce emerged from the hallway carrying a plastic storage box that probably contained the air mattress he\u2019d mentioned. Ty dropped an armload of bedding on the floor. Deuce set the box on the couch and looked at Zane, then glanced around to see where Julian had gone. He gestured between Ty and Zane, and his voice was pitched low when he asked, \u201cY\u2019all need separate places to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked away his preoccupation. He could muse over divine intervention another time. \u201cNo, they know everything. And one of us needs to keep watch anyway.\u201d</p><p>Deuce inclined his head, looking at Zane carefully before nodding. He turned to look at Ty, but Zane couldn\u2019t see Deuce\u2019s expression when he looked back at his brother.</p><p>Ty was ignoring Deuce\u2019s pointed queries, or at least pretending to, taking the lid off the storage box and poking around inside.</p><p>\u201cThis thing got a pump?\u201d he asked as he pulled the heavy air mattress out.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty, you have to blow it up,\u201d Deuce answered in a flat voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll take turns, should have it done by August.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Ty muttered as Deuce moved past him to head back down the hall, presumably for the pump.</p><p>Zane watched as Ty messed with the mattress. \u201cThis is where you came, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up as he laid the mattress out and knelt to spread it flat. He nodded before Zane could say more. \u201cHe always knows how to talk me off the ledge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Zane turned in a half circle and then sat on the couch nearby. A part of Zane, a very small, dark part, had been worried that Ty had fled to Boston and Nick O\u2019Flaherty when he ran from Baltimore.</p><p>Ty merely nodded as he stretched to flip over the last corner of the air mattress. He stood carefully, obviously sore and stiff, and he rolled his shoulders and neck as he straightened. He turned and jumped when he found Julian standing in the doorway to the kitchen, watching them.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Ty hissed at him. \u201cStop doing that!\u201d</p> <p>Julian\u2019s lips twitched in what might have been a smirk. Zane couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly vindicated. Ty did that to him all the time.</p><p>\u201cTell your brother not to touch the handle of the front door,\u201d Julian said as he stepped over the flattened mattress and moved to sit in a leather club chair close by.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Cameron holding up?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Julian shrugged, looking down the dark hallway. \u201cAbout as expected. I think he\u2019s still in the washroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you rig a doorknob with kitchen utensils?\u201d Ty asked, still exasperated but also sounding a little too keen to learn a new trick.</p><p>\u201cA large percentage of accidental deaths occur in the kitchen. It\u2019s a dangerous place,\u201d Julian drawled, almost seeming to enjoy himself.</p><p>Zane turned his attention to Julian. \u201cWill you still be with us in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s eyes cut over to Zane, but nothing else moved. \u201cIf I still intended to run, I would have done so already. The time for escaping cleanly has long passed. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the more weapons and people who know how to use them, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding baseball bats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all been in situations where we longed for something as appropriate as a baseball bat.\u201d</p> <p>Zane nodded as Deuce came back down the hall. He stopped and tilted his head at Julian. \u201cI believe your friend needs you,\u201d he murmured, his voice gentle and soft. He sounded almost like the psychiatrist he really was.</p><p>Julian stood immediately and moved toward the hallway. \u201cGood night, gentlemen,\u201d he said as he left the room.</p><p>Zane watched him go, feeling confident that he could trust the man to keep his word. He seemed to have reached a decision to stick with them after the Pittsburgh airport, after Ty sacrificed himself to let them escape. Besides, Zane knew Cameron needed downtime, and Julian would probably move heaven and earth to give it to him. Zane turned his gaze to Ty and figured he understood. His partner was exhausted. They all needed time to rest.</p><p>Deuce had moved to help Ty plug in the electric pump. His limp was less pronounced than it had been the last time Zane had seen him, but he still let Ty do all the kneeling as they hooked the pump up and turned it on. Deuce was still wearing the boxers in which he\u2019d been sleeping, and for the first time Zane could see the railroad track scars on his leg and knee.</p><p>He stood with his hands on his hips as Ty knelt beside him, both of them watching the air mattress inflate with their heads tilted to the side, like a pair of puppies trying to figure out a strange noise. Zane had to smile. He could really see the resemblance. How their mother had raised them both without having a nervous breakdown was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ty, can we talk for a minute?\u201d Deuce asked after a moment.</p><p>Ty glanced up at him and then over at Zane with a nod. \u201cYou got this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Zane nodded and gestured for them to go on. He watched them curiously as Ty followed Deuce down the hall to his bedroom, then turned his attention back to the air mattress and flipped the pump back on. The noise would make it impossible to overhear what they were saying, and Zane knew better than to allow himself the temptation of eavesdropping anymore.</p> <p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S up?\u201d Ty asked as he watched Deuce close the door to his bedroom. Deuce wasn\u2019t exactly a private person, and he knew Zane better than he did most people, so Ty couldn\u2019t fathom what he had to say that couldn\u2019t have been said in the living room.</p><p>Deuce turned to look at him, crossing his arms over his chest and covering his mouth with his hand. Ty recognized the signs all too well.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Deuce shook his head. \u201cNo, I just... I need your advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ty said the word carefully as he studied his brother. He glanced around Deuce\u2019s bedroom. It was immaculate, as usual, all flat and modern and... weird. He pointed at a tray on top of the dresser. \u201cSeriously, is that a blunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t anticipating the FBI breaking down my door tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s fair. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Deuce took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s about Livi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoga girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really has a real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said with a smirk.</p><p>Deuce rolled his eyes and paced toward the window. \u201cWhat did you think of her when you met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cute,\u201d Ty answered, confused by the question but willing to go along with Deuce\u2019s unique way of getting around to a point. He\u2019d spent a day with Deuce after leaving Baltimore, and he\u2019d met his girlfriend when she\u2019d dropped by. \u201cShe was genuine and smart and probably very bendy. Good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re getting at. I met her for like five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Deuce stared at him, looking almost ill, and Ty stood waiting for him to continue. They stood in silence for a few moments, Deuce fidgeting and Ty forcing himself to be patient.</p><p>\u201cDeacon,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Deuce blurted in a rush of relief. Ty couldn\u2019t mask the surprise, and Deuce read him well. \u201cBefore you say anything, yes, I love her. Yes, I\u2019m excited as hell. And yes, she\u2019s very bendy.\u201d For the first time, Deuce cracked a smile. He seemed to be trying to contain his excitement, but Ty recognized it anyway.</p><p>Ty nearly laughed in relief. He waved a hand through the air and stepped closer to hug his brother. \u201cCongratulations, Deacon,\u201d he said as Deuce clapped him on the back.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Deuce said as he pushed away and took Ty by his shoulders to meet his eyes. \u201cThe problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does there have to be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s always a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Ty asked with a growing sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cLivi wants to be married before our families find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to tell her parents she\u2019s pregnant before we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of a time-sensitive condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat leaves you, what, like a month? Maybe less?\u201d</p><p>Deuce nodded.</p><p>Ty blinked at his brother as the problem hit him. He gasped and pointed at Deuce\u2019s face. \u201cYou want to elope!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Deuce said in relief.</p><p>\u201cDeacon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to Ma, she\u2019ll kill you. She\u2019ll kill me! Not to mention seriously bad relations with your future in-laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you see my problem,\u201d Deuce said as he waved a hand through the air and sat on the end of his bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming this wasn\u2019t planned. How does that happen, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve been doing dudes for too long if I need to answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Ty murmured with a frown. He grimaced and shook his head, bypassing half a dozen smartass remarks as he sat down beside Deuce. He really gave the question some thought, as much thought as he was capable of when being hunted down like a dog by the CIA.</p><p>\u201cI mean... Deacon, if this is what you really want to do, then I\u2019ll cover your play. I\u2019ll do whatever you need to take the heat off after. Unless you do it without me there, and in that case I\u2019ll disown you.\u201d</p><p>Deuce smiled and nodded, and he put his arm around Ty\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI knew I could count on you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cBut... if you\u2019re asking for my advice?\u201d</p><p>Deuce nodded.</p><p>\u201cWait. Tell everyone, let them be excited about a baby, let them know you\u2019re committed to her whether you\u2019re married or not, and go from there. Don\u2019t go... sneaking around and trying to hide things from your families. You\u2019ll... you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>Deuce looked at him in silence, his eyes sympathetic and warm. If anyone understood how well Ty knew what he was talking about, it was his brother. \u201cThanks, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, and they sat in silence for a long time, long enough that the pump to the air mattress stopped its loud whine and the light coming under the bedroom door turned off.</p><p>Deuce took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a daddy.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled as he watched his brother\u2019s profile in the dim light. He could hear the mixture of excitement and fear in Deuce\u2019s voice. Then the smile faded as cold realization began to seep through him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a daddy,\u201d he echoed, almost to himself. He stood suddenly, looking around the room and patting his jeans as if he\u2019d lost something.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Ty said as he looked at Deuce with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone tracks us here, I mean they shouldn\u2019t, but if they do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, it\u2019s okay. I knew someone was after you when you broke into my house. I know it\u2019s a risk for you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s not just about you now, and this isn\u2019t just someone after us.\u201d Ty was already heading for the bedroom door.</p><p>Deuce hopped up to follow him, barely able to keep up on his bad leg. \u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t up for discussion, Deuce, it really isn\u2019t,\u201d Ty said. He banged on the bedroom door as he passed by, and Zane had turned the lights on again by the time they got to the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zane asked as soon as he saw Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here, we need to move.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked between the two of them, seeking some clue in Deuce\u2019s face before he met Ty\u2019s eyes again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being ridiculous,\u201d Deuce told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d Julian asked from behind them.</p><p>Ty turned to look at him. He was still wearing his jeans and T-shirt, but it was obvious that he\u2019d been asleep.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay. We need to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No! One of you, talk some sense into him,\u201d Deuce said to them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zane asked again, more insistent. Ty met his eyes and tilted his head toward Deuce. It wasn\u2019t his secret to tell, and he hoped Zane would just trust him.</p><p>Deuce sighed in exasperation. \u201cMy girlfriend is pregnant. We found out yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Julian snorted. \u201cThat is the most remarkable non sequitur I think I\u2019ve ever heard. You\u2019re right, he is Grady\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Cameron jabbed Julian in the ribs, causing him to double over and groan pitifully.</p><p>Ty glared at him for a minute, but he could see that Zane knew exactly why Ty wanted to leave. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you we\u2019re jeopardizing by being here now,\u201d Zane said, looking from Deuce to Ty. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a family. He\u2019s right, we have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Deuce said as he stepped closer to Zane. \u201cI know damn well that if Ty thought there was any danger to me with you coming here, he wouldn\u2019t have come to start with.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked between them again. Ty held his breath as they waited for Zane to respond. He silently pleaded with his partner to back him up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Deuce. He\u2019s right,\u201d Zane finally said with a shake of his head. Ty sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cJust stay for the night, okay? You\u2019re all exhausted; you\u2019re barely functioning. And hell, if someone\u2019s going to be coming to kill me, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you\u2019d stick around with your guns and pointy things \u2019til morning, you know?\u201d Deuce said in exasperation.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and met Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fair point,\u201d Julian murmured.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said to Deuce.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Deuce said with a bright smile. He reached out and hugged his brother, holding onto him tightly. \u201cGo to bed, okay? Be here in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>ZANE had to look away as Deuce hugged Ty tighter. He could sympathize with the feeling, knowing Ty was in danger and wanting desperately to hold on to him and keep him safe.</p><p>When he finally let Ty go, he turned and hugged Zane as well. Zane smiled as he looked over Deuce\u2019s shoulder at Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re keeping you up, Deuce,\u201d Zane murmured as he pondered the two brothers and patted Deuce\u2019s back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to bed? I\u2019m sure Ty knows where things are if we need anything else.\u201d</p><p>Deuce let him go and looked him over, then looked at Ty, who was nodding in agreement.</p><p>\u201cJust stick to your regular schedule in the morning, but don\u2019t touch the front door,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ty gestured helplessly to Julian.</p><p>\u201cJust trust him; don\u2019t touch it,\u201d Julian said with a curt nod. They all stared at him. \u201cTrade secret.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. He reached to the small of his back and took out the backup gun he\u2019d taken off one of the bodies, checking it before handing it to Deuce. \u201cPut that under your pillow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deuce looked down at it with a heavy sigh but didn\u2019t take it. \u201cYeah, okay. But you can keep that. My regular schedule doesn\u2019t involve shooting myself in the ass in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed and then clapped a hand over his mouth. Ty snorted and shook his head. Deuce looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes again, a worried frown creasing his brow.</p><p>Zane offered him a weak smile.</p> <p>Deuce nodded and looked back at Ty as he turned toward the hallway. \u201cGood night,\u201d he said as he left them.</p><p>Ty turned his head to watch his brother limp toward his bedroom.</p><p>Julian and Cameron stood there awkwardly for a moment. \u201cWell. Good night, then.\u201d</p><p>Cameron gave them both a weak smile as he turned and followed Julian back into the guest bedroom.</p><p>Ty poked at the mattress with his foot.</p> <p>Zane glanced toward the dark hallway, then leaned forward to reach out and touch Ty\u2019s lightly bruised jaw. \u201cHe got you,\u201d he murmured, his fingers feather light as they ghosted over the slight stubble. \u201cYou okay otherwise?\u201d He\u2019d not even gotten a chance to ask since the fight at the hotel some hours ago.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Ty asked with another weak attempt at a smile. \u201cI\u2019m terrified, Zane. Everyone in the world I care about is mixed up in this now. I sent CIA cleaner teams to one of my friends and then led them right to my brother.\u201d</p><p>Gut clenching painfully, Zane slid his hand along Ty\u2019s neck. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever heard Ty so freely admit to fear. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m suddenly going to be an uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Ty. It\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and looked back down at the mattress, poking at the corner of the sheets with his toes, unwilling to look at him.</p> <p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>Ty met Zane\u2019s eyes and swallowed hard. He reached out without a word and slid his arms around Zane\u2019s neck. Zane pulled him close, surprised. He held him and Ty hugged him tight, still not speaking. Then he kissed Zane\u2019s neck and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s fix these sheets and go to bed, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the sheets?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty barked a laugh and shook his head.</p><p>They remade the bed quickly, Ty\u2019s corners still somehow perfect even on an air mattress on the floor. He stood to grab the heavy quilt and laid it out over the bed, then tossed the two pillows back onto the head of it.</p><p>He toed off his shoes and unbuckled his belt, then slid his jeans off and folded them neatly to set them on the couch. \u201cYou want couch side or floor side?\u201d he asked Zane before pulling his shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cFloor side.\u201d If he wasn\u2019t going to be sitting up, he wanted to at least be able to move immediately. All he really wanted was to hold Ty to him.</p> <p>Ty moved closer to him, sliding his hand against Zane\u2019s face before he bent and crawled onto the bed. Zane\u2019s eyes followed Ty\u2019s every movement; he didn\u2019t notice any hitches or winces that would indicate hidden injuries. It was rare enough for Ty to admit to being scared; Zane didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be hiding injuries now. He simply looked exhausted, just like the rest of them.</p><p>He stretched out under the covers and rolled onto one side, curling up again and facing the couch next to the mattress.</p><p>Zane had already stripped down to his boxers before the commotion. He turned off the light and stood in place to let his eyes adjust, watching the lump in the dark that was Ty as he waited.</p><p>Even in the darkness, Zane could tell Ty was still tense as he lay there. He had every right to be; he\u2019d just learned that his brother was going to be a father, the same brother he could possibly have put in danger simply by coming here.</p><p>Zane finally moved and knelt next to the mattress before climbing onto it carefully, trying not to rock Ty too much.</p><p>Ty immediately reached back for him, resting his hand on whatever was closest as Zane moved behind him. The gesture settled Zane, and he scooted close enough to spoon up against him, sliding one arm under Ty\u2019s neck and draping the other over his waist. Ty scooted back into him, fitting against him perfectly. Calm began to seep through Zane\u2019s mind and body.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered, intending to say it as much as possible, at every opportunity, for the rest of his life.</p><p>Ty patted his hip a few times in response; then he was still and quiet. He wasn\u2019t rocking or jiggling a leg or tossing and turning like he often did when he was lying in bed before sleep overtook him. He was just still and calm as his breathing evened out. It was a little disconcerting.</p><p>Zane kissed his shoulder again before letting his head settle on the pillow. He sank into the darkness as he listened to Ty\u2019s breathing and the quiet sounds of the condo at night. He hoped the next day could be even half this peaceful.</p><p>THE distant ringing of a phone rousted Ty, but he was still lying in the warm cocoon of blankets and Zane\u2019s arms, staring at the ceiling, when Deuce skidded into the living room.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d Deuce said in a panicked voice.</p><p>Ty shot up, rolling over Zane and clambering to his feet gracelessly, spurred on by the tone of Deuce\u2019s words. Zane flailed and wound up rolling off the bed with him. Ty left him on the floor as he stood. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivi\u2019s on her way, you have to fix that doorknob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the lobby, Ty!\u201d</p><p>Ty sprinted for the kitchen, almost dreading what sort of contraption he would see attached to the doorknob. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell her not to come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the doorman, she didn\u2019t call ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, call her and tell her to wait in the hall!\u201d Ty said as he knelt in front of the doorknob. \u201cWhat the shit is this?\u201d It was so innocuous that he almost reached up to touch it. A row of connected straws wrapped around the base of the knob and led to the nearby coffee maker like a string. The knob itself was covered in tin foil, and Ty could see foil sticking out from inside several of the straws. \u201cI....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, come on, take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer phone\u2019s not picking up, she must be in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zane asked from the doorway to the kitchen. His hair was mussed, and he still looked half-asleep. A moment later Julian joined them.</p><p>\u201cCross! How do we dismantle this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarefully,\u201d Julian answered, voice calm and quiet. \u201cThe current\u2019s in the foil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we cut it?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Julian hummed, not sounding optimistic.</p><p>\u201cGround yourself,\u201d Zane said as he brought his boots over and clunked them down beside Ty\u2019s knee.</p><p>In the moment of calm while Ty was sliding his feet into the boots, they heard the elevator ding in the hallway outside.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Deuce said as he held the phone to his ear. \u201cCome on, baby, answer the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me some oven mitts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to shock the shit out of yourself,\u201d Julian murmured. \u201cI want to take this moment to thank you profusely for letting me watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Ty and Zane both shouted at him.</p><p>Zane handed Ty the kitchen shears, and Ty tapped the end of one of the straws with the blade. Sparks flew, and he could feel the current running through the straws.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Zane cried, as if he hadn\u2019t really thought it would work.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping!\u201d Ty told him, his voice wavering.</p><p>\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was just really... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we bask in its glory after we dismantle it?\u201d Deuce growled as he dialed Livi\u2019s number again. \u201cIt\u2019s going straight to voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI....\u201d Ty winced as he pulled the oven mitts on.</p><p>\u201cTy! You\u2019re about to electrocute my girlfriend!\u201d</p><p>They heard keys jingle outside the door.</p><p>\u201cLivi, don\u2019t touch the door!\u201d Deuce called.</p><p>\u201cDeacon?\u201d a dainty voice said on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cAnswer your goddamn phone! Ty, cut it.\u201d</p><p>The hair on Ty\u2019s arms rose as he held the scissors up to the straws. \u201cOh, God, this is gonna hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on in there?\u201d Livi asked, and the keys jangled again.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Ty saw Cameron dart through the kitchen to the coffee maker on the counter. He reached behind it and yanked the plug out of the wall. The buzzing sensation on Ty\u2019s arms ceased, and then he heard Livi\u2019s key slide into the lock on the other side.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, that would have been easier. Well done, Cam,\u201d Julian said in a pleased voice.</p><p>The door opened before Ty could scramble away, smacking him square in the cheek and sending him sprawling backward.</p><p>He lay on the tile floor, holding his face as Livi walked into the condo. \u201cOh my goodness, Ty! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d the woman said as she put both hands to her mouth and bent over him. Livi was a beautiful girl, possibly less so just then since Ty could see two of her. She had intelligent robin\u2019s-egg-blue eyes and hair so blonde it seemed white when the sun hit it. She was lithe and athletic, everything Ty thought a yoga instructor would probably be. She also led with her shoulder when she opened a door.</p><p>Zane took his arm and hefted him to his feet. Ty shook his head to clear the gauze. \u201cSo nice to see you again,\u201d he muttered to her. She still had her fingers over her lips, staring at him with big blue eyes.</p><p>She turned and looked at Deuce, giving him a helpless gesture. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivi, you remember my brother, Ty. This is his partner, Zane Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Zane offered in a low voice that sent a shiver up Ty\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cAnd these are their... friends, Julian and Cameron,\u201d Deuce said as he waved at the other two men.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Cameron mumbled.</p><p>She greeted them each, overwhelmed by the surprise, then looked at the doorknob and the string of straws, shaking her head. \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a security measure. We\u2019re running from the CIA,\u201d Ty told her, not even attempting to spare her. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, kill him, specifically,\u201d Zane added as he pointed at Julian.</p><p>\u201cI sell antiques,\u201d Julian said, monotone.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, looking amongst them and then at Deuce. \u201cIs this some sort of boys\u2019 weekend that I\u2019m not supposed to intrude on? Because I can totally leave before they hurt themselves trying to lie convincingly.\u201d</p><p>Deuce gave her a warm smile and shook his head. \u201cI think the only one lying is him,\u201d he said, pointing at Julian.</p><p>\u201cSO, I\u2019M... I\u2019m sorry, tell me again?\u201d Livi stuttered as they all sat in the living room of Deuce\u2019s condo.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re serious,\u201d Ty told her. \u201cThe CIA is trying to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop that? Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more accurate to say they\u2019re trying to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>Julian rolled his eyes. \u201cI believe what Agent Garrett is trying to point out is that you are likely in no danger because of our presence here.\u201d</p><p>Livi nodded, looking at him dubiously.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lying,\u201d Cameron said, his voice remarkably offhand. \u201cYou are in danger because we\u2019re here, they\u2019re trying to protect you so you won\u2019t worry. They do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam!\u201d Julian said, stunned into gaping at his lover.</p><p>Ty smacked his forehead and covered his face with his hand.</p><p>\u201cWow, you guys are... I could make a mint off your therapy,\u201d Deuce muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I really am\u2014I\u2019m just tired of this macho bullshit!\u201d Cameron said as he waved a hand at them. He turned to Julian. \u201cCan you honestly look at me and tell me you\u2019re not scared?\u201d</p><p>Julian tried to respond, but his mouth was still hanging open.</p><p>Cameron looked at Ty and Zane where they sat together on a square ottoman. \u201cAnd you two, you\u2019re just ridiculous! You\u2019re so busy bitching at each other and trying to look like you don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re throwing your lives away waiting for it to be the right time to admit you\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron!\u201d Julian finally managed to say, waving at Deacon and Livi as if Cameron might not remember they were there.</p><p>Cameron cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Livi glanced over at Ty and Zane, then looked at Deuce. \u201cSo when you said partner, you meant like working partner? Because that didn\u2019t really come across so much as they were a couple.\u201d</p><p>Zane pinched the bridge of his nose, but he appeared to be smiling.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ty asked, sounding concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou scream \u2018we\u2019re screwing\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that we\u2019ve got that cleared up,\u201d Deuce said as he stood. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane looked at each other, and then both men glanced at Julian. Zane was shaking his head, but Ty\u2019s eyes moved from Julian to Cameron.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do, Cam?\u201d Ty asked in a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re right. People like us, sometimes we can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. We were all trying to figure out how to dismantle that freaking doorknob when none of us thought to just pull the plug.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cameron nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t asked you, not once, what you thought we should do,\u201d Ty continued.</p><p>Julian tore his eyes away from the FBI agents and looked at his lover. Ty was right. They\u2019d been pulling Cameron along without so much as a thought to what he might want or think.</p> <p>Cameron met his eyes, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... we can\u2019t fly or ride a train. You\u2019ve been saying that driving into DC is suicide. So why not get there another way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother way,\u201d Julian repeated.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Ty muttered.</p> <p>\u201cWater,\u201d Zane said, sounding surprised and irritated that none of them had thought of it before.</p><p>Julian slid his arm around Cameron\u2019s waist, squeezing him.</p><p>\u201cGetting our hands on a boat won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Ty said, sounding grim. \u201cWe\u2019d have to take a smuggler\u2019s line down the coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoid the Coast Guard, and slip into port without a course plotted or papers,\u201d Zane added. \u201cThat\u2019s if we can find a boat.\u201d</p><p>Livi perked up and smiled. \u201cDaddy has a boat.\u201d</p><p>Deuce cleared his throat. \u201cI think they\u2019re thinking more inconspicuous than your dad\u2019s yacht, honey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh wait, I think they took it to St. Vincent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYacht?\u201d Ty said with a smirk at his brother.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smart, beautiful, and loaded. What\u2019s not to love?\u201d Deuce drawled, matching the smirk with one of his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a trust fund baby\u2014both of you shut up,\u201d Livi said.</p><p>Zane was smiling at her and Ty was shaking his head, eyes focused on the pure-white carpet. \u201cI know someone who has a boat.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at his partner, one eyebrow raised. Ty glanced sideways at him and winced.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 15</p><p>THEY used Livi and her incomparable charm to gain access to the private port on the Delaware River where her father kept his yacht. She sweet-talked one of the skippers into letting them take a small boat out for a \u201cjoy ride,\u201d and in less than an hour they had set sail down the Delaware toward open water.</p><p>By the time night fell, they had reached the coordinates they\u2019d been given. They anchored there, bobbing in the choppy water, to wait.</p><p>Zane and the others thanked Deuce and Livi for their help and then went out on the cockpit to let Ty say goodbye. Zane watched through the window as he hugged Livi. She put her hand to her belly in a gesture Zane knew meant Ty was telling her he was happy for them. Zane\u2019s lips twitched in a smile. He liked Livi, and he couldn\u2019t wait to hear about her meeting Ty and Deuce\u2019s family. It also made him sad, though; he wouldn\u2019t be introduced to Ty\u2019s family in the same way she would be any time soon.</p><p>Ty gave Deuce a tight hug, holding onto him for longer than he usually did as he spoke to him. Then he handed Deuce the last of their cash, and Zane knew he was telling his brother to get out of town for a few days and not to use his credit cards.</p><p>Zane had to fight back a jangle of nerves. He had to believe that the CIA agents after them wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone unless they were in the path of Julian Cross. Deuce would be fine. He hoped.</p><p>A beacon of light on the water caught his eye, and he squinted into the moonless night.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d he called as a completely different type of nervousness settled over him. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>When Ty had mentioned Nick O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s name, saying his old Recon buddy had a boat they could use, Zane had sort of expected a dinghy. He had imagined Nick inhabiting some seedy apartment over an Irish pub in South Boston. That was the impression he\u2019d gotten from Ty\u2019s oldest friend when he was blind and could only hear him speak. So he was surprised when a sleek sixty-foot Outer Reef 580 Motoryacht glided into the view of the little boat\u2019s running lights.</p><p>Julian whistled from the railing where he was watching the yacht. \u201cNot cheap. I thought you said your friend was a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Ty said as he checked the magazine in his gun.</p><p>\u201cIs he on the take?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up to glare at him. He didn\u2019t answer, instead heading for the stern of the boat to call out to Nick and help him secure the gangplank they would use to switch boats.</p><p>Zane was scowling as he watched Ty and the shadowed figure on the other boat. Julian was right; that was not a bargain basement way to live. Zane found himself wondering how Nick afforded it.</p><p>He drew a steadying breath and then rolled his eyes. He shouldn\u2019t be nervous. Nick knew who he was, even if Zane had never laid eyes on Nick. He watched as Ty spoke with the man, able to overhear them in the still night.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Nick\u2019s Boston accent said in amusement. \u201cStrippergram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let us in so we can steal your watch in the morning,\u201d Ty muttered. The sense of humor explained why this man and Ty had become such close friends, but it also made Zane want to hate him a little more.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get going if we intend to go unnoticed,\u201d Nick called out as soon as they had the gangplank secured.</p><p>They boarded the yacht one at a time, Zane\u2019s stomach in knots. Zane realized that he was desperately hoping that Mr. Nick O\u2019Flaherty was an unfortunate-looking individual.</p><p>It was a few seconds later, when they all gathered in the salon, that Zane truly got a look at Nick for the first time as he hurried past them toward the pilothouse. He looked about Ty\u2019s age, ruggedly handsome and clean-shaven with short strawberry-blond hair and ivy-green eyes. He was a few inches shorter than Zane, but then, most men were. He was built solidly, not as broad as Ty or Zane at the shoulders, but obviously fit. Damn him.</p><p>He wore faded jeans, a thick cable-knit sweater, and boots. The gun in his jeans told Zane he\u2019d been expecting trouble.</p><p>They followed him through the boat, Ty moving into the pilothouse with Nick as the others stood in the galley in the middle of the yacht.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, good to see you in one piece,\u201d Nick said with a nod as he slid into the pilot\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to see anything,\u201d Zane said, unable to look at Nick without thinking about how he had kissed the man Zane loved. He pushed that aside for now.</p><p>\u201cI think we got here clean,\u201d Ty said as he turned and waved for Julian and Cameron to join them.</p><p>\u201cSame. What the fuck have you guys gotten into?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Ty shrugged and looked around the pilothouse uneasily. Nick watched him and then turned in his seat to look at Zane.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t know how much Nick had been told, because Ty had spoken to him in Farsi on the phone. He stood in the galley of Nick\u2019s yacht, trying to think of anything to fill the awkward silence that didn\u2019t end with punching Nick in the face.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t come up with anything, and so they stood in silence as Cameron gave Nick a weak smile and stepped forward to shake his hand. \u201cI know you don\u2019t know us. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy says you need help. You got it.\u201d He offered his hand to Cameron, then to Julian when the Irishman moved closer, introducing himself to each of them.</p><p>Zane pursed his lips as he looked around the yacht. It was sumptuous, all black leather and lacquered teak wood, shining stainless steel and top-of-the-line everything. The furniture in the salon was all built-in, heavy and luxurious, with a large television in place on the wall that separated the salon from the galley. Stairs led from the galley to an upper deck. When Zane looked around, it didn\u2019t feel like it fit Nick at all. But then, he didn\u2019t know Nick very well.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Nick said with false cheer. \u201cTell me about the people trying to kill you this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe less you know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom?\u201d Zane asked before the conversation could devolve further.</p><p>Nick pointed toward the steps that led down, right beside where he sat. \u201cTake a right, that\u2019s the VIP head. Left is the master. Whichever.\u201d</p><p>Zane headed for the stairs, feeling like he was descending into the pit as he ducked and hunched his shoulders to make it down the curving stairwell. He discreetly looked around the lower cabins to try and get a feel for the man who\u2019d made a move on his lover just a few weeks ago.</p><p>The most prominent pictures on the walls were of Nick in uniform, surrounded by smiling Marines. Very similar to Ty\u2019s photos at home. Zane stopped and stared at one when he caught sight of a younger Ty. There were six men, all in various stages of dress, some standing, some kneeling, looking as if they had been roughhousing or playing during downtime while deployed on a carrier. Ty and Nick were front and center, wearing only pants and combat boots, both tanned from hours in the sun and salt air, their dog tags prominent on bare chests. All six men were grinning, arms around each other. Ty was holding a football, balancing it on the tip of his fingers as he displayed it for the camera.</p><p>Zane could hear Ty filling Nick in on the basics of what had happened, giving him the condensed version in typical Ty fashion. He turned toward the head before he could let himself get sucked into that vortex of uncertainty again. Ty may have looked happy in old pictures, but Zane knew Ty was happy now too.</p><p>When he returned, Nick and Ty were still discussing what needed to be done. Cameron was sitting in a corner booth that was tucked into the other side of the pilothouse, and Julian was looking askance at the low ceilings as if he might hit his head when he took a step.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take us to get to DC?\u201d Ty was asking Nick.</p><p>\u201cA day, two if we can only travel at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we need to keep a regular schedule. Travel by day, anchor at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded as he rubbed his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cHave you dumped your cells?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cCell phones, a few cars, credit cards, badges, guns, my watch. Everything we could think of that might have been bugged or can be tracked electronically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re not wearing tinfoil hats yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when we sleep,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou told me on the phone that you called Digger. Was that true, or were you trying to give me a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was true. I told him that we were coming to him so whoever was listening could overhear, and then let him know that it was a decoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoconuts?</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, somewhere in the bayou, Digger is preparing for the arrival of an unfriendly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn theory.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Julian and Zane and then rubbed his hand over his mouth. \u201cGod help the poor bastard that shows up on his doorstep,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Ty huffed a laugh. \u201cWe tried to lay low a couple places, but they kept finding us. I finally realized they were pinging the receiver in my watch. We headed to Philly, but... I can\u2019t risk Deacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Zane wondered if Nick had any qualms about Ty risking him. He didn\u2019t let on if he did.</p><p>\u201cI pulled out the limit from every ATM I passed while I was on duty, so I\u2019ve got a couple thousand for you. That\u2019s the best I can do, but I can give you my card when we make port.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Nick nodded and then glanced at the rest of them. \u201cYou all look like half-eaten sushi.\u201d</p><p>Zane found himself fighting back a smile, and he nodded instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a police officer?\u201d Cameron asked Nick, who nodded. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something you can do? Someone you can call to help us?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at him for a moment with a sympathetic frown, and then he glanced at Ty.</p><p>\u201cThe CIA is slightly out of his reach, love,\u201d Julian murmured. He put his hand on Cameron\u2019s shoulder and squeezed, trying to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick said, sounding sincere.</p><p>Ty met Zane\u2019s eyes, and Zane knew exactly what he was thinking. They were going to get Cameron out of this alive even if it killed them.</p><p>\u201cThese two need a bed together,\u201d Ty murmured to Nick as he waved a hand at Julian and Cameron.</p><p>Nick raised an eyebrow but nodded without commenting. \u201cYou can take my cabin,\u201d he told Julian. He stood, making sure Ty had the wheel first, and then he gestured for them to follow as he ducked down the stairs. Julian and Cameron followed with murmured good-nights to Ty and Zane.</p><p>Zane moved to sit in the booth near Ty. He wasn\u2019t sure what Ty wanted to do, though he expected visiting with Nick to be high on the list tonight. Zane didn\u2019t really want to visit with Nick, though, and he sure as hell didn\u2019t want Ty doing it. It bothered him enough that Ty knew his way around Nick\u2019s boat. But he had to trust Ty, and it had to start somewhere, so why not here?</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ty asked as he fiddled with the controls of the yacht.</p><p>Zane pursed his lips. \u201cEvery time I look at him I want to knock his lights out.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged as he kept his hand on the wheel and then glanced down the stairwell. \u201cSo do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, Zane. If it\u2019ll make you feel better, slug him.\u201d</p><p>Zane took in a deep breath, truly contemplating it. But he knew it wouldn\u2019t make anything better in the end, and he was suspicious of Ty\u2019s easy agreement.</p><p>Nick returned a few moments later.</p><p>\u201cVIP cabin\u2019s all set up,\u201d he told them as he stepped into the galley and opened the refrigerator. He still had his gun stuffed in the small of his back. \u201cClean sheets and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImprovement over last time,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou had a sheet last time. And it was sort of clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, on top of a pool float that was anchored to the flybridge,\u201d Ty said as he pointed up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were on a pool float because it squeaked when you moved; we had to make sure you were still breathing!\u201d</p><p>Ty gave a dismissive grunt and wave as he put the boat through its paces, apparently preparing to set it at anchor.</p><p>\u201cFew years in a suit and Princess is suddenly too good for a pool float,\u201d Nick whispered to Zane with a smirk as he handed them each a water bottle. \u201cI\u2019ve got food, beer, sodas, and water in the fridge. Garrett, help yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Zane said, half laughing, wondering how often Nick got away with calling Ty a princess. He resented that Nick was a likable guy. He really wanted to hate him and be rude to him.</p><p>\u201cGo on and sleep,\u201d Nick told them. \u201cI\u2019ll get us settled for the night and keep watch.\u201d</p><p>Ty left the wheel and stood. He looked from Nick to Zane, as if waiting to see if Zane was going to deck Nick. When Zane didn\u2019t move, Ty took a few steps toward Nick and took his forearm instead of his hand, gripping it hard. \u201cThanks, Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it,\u201d Nick said, and then he nodded at Zane and turned to slip into the pilot\u2019s seat.</p><p>Zane followed Ty down the stairs to the smaller of the two cabins. There was what appeared to be a queen-size bed tucked into the room, with wooden steps on either side to climb into it. Ty stuffed their bags onto a shelf that circled the bow-shaped room, then looked at Zane and smiled, albeit uncomfortably. He rubbed his hands up and down the material of his jeans just below the pockets, a nervous habit he only displayed when he couldn\u2019t find anything else to do with his hands.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Zane asked, dejected.</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really want to hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo hate him. You have every right. Being drunk is never an excuse to do stupid shit. You\u2019ll have to hate me too, though, \u2019cause I was there and I kissed him back.\u201d</p><p>The words hit Zane in the chest like a sledgehammer. He stared at Ty until he realized that he wasn\u2019t breathing and he cleared his throat. His voice was flat when he spoke. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Ty let out a pent-up breath, his shoulders slumping as he looked away from Zane, unable to meet his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Zane asked, his voice going lower, full of barely repressed anger that he was surprised to hear.</p><p>\u201cZane, come on, what\u2019s the point in that?\u201d Ty asked, sounding frustrated and angry and possibly a little scared by the question.</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes to scrutinize his lover. Ty had his lips pressed into a thin line and was staring at him with his hands on his hips, his eyes unreadable.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered, spitting out the word. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help the twisting sensation in his chest. He didn\u2019t want to think about that, and he certainly didn\u2019t want his very active imagination providing him with any visuals. He pressed his lips together hard and looked up at the low ceiling to let out a long breath. \u201cI kind of wish I hadn\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of wish I had lied,\u201d Ty said in a soft voice.</p><p>Zane shook his head. Ty stepped up to him, hesitant, as if he thought Zane might rebuff him. He reached out and touched Zane\u2019s cheek, stepping closer to brush his lips against Zane\u2019s chin.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. Ty was being just as brutally honest as he always was, even if it hurt him and even if it hurt Zane. There was something comforting in that. It didn\u2019t wipe away the knowledge that Nick O\u2019Flaherty was in love with Ty and had been for years or that Ty had shared and enjoyed a kiss with him.</p> <p>Zane set his forehead against Ty\u2019s cheekbone, letting his hands slide around Ty and pull him closer.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty whispered, uncertainty clouding his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay. I just hate that you\u2019re so close to him.\u201d</p><p>Ty jerked his head and pulled back. Zane let him go. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him since he left Baltimore, Zane. I used to talk to him at least once every day, even if it was just a random text, but that\u2019s stopped. He\u2019s leaving me alone out of respect for you, for us, and I have to tell you, baby, I miss him.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cBut if that\u2019s what you need, I\u2019ll do it. Do you understand? I\u2019ll do anything you need me to do. Because I have never felt like this about anything, and I\u2019m terrified of screwing up and losing it.\u201d</p><p>Zane held his breath, meeting Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s your best friend, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s you or him, there\u2019s no question who I\u2019ll choose.\u201d</p><p>Zane was ashamed of the effect those words had on him. He felt like doing the Snoopy dance around the room. Instead, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cLet it sit for a while. Okay? Let\u2019s just live through this first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane murmured, though his eyes were drawn up, to where Nick still was.</p><p>Ty was silent. Finally, he swallowed hard and shook his head. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried. Nick knows me pretty well. I think you\u2019d probably have to go to Deuce to find someone who knows me better.\u201d He looked up, as if measuring his words. \u201cHe knows what love means to me, when he\u2019s not drunk off his ass like we were that night. It never should have happened, and he knows it.\u201d</p><p>Zane had to deal with both a little spot of relief\u2014that Nick knew better than to push\u2014and a small spark of pain at the same time. It was true: he didn\u2019t know Ty as well as Deuce or Nick. Zane allowed himself a melancholy moment. Sometimes it seemed that Ty could read his mind, but Zane was still fighting through gauze when it came to Ty.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve known you a lot longer than I have,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of history there I\u2019m not connected to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Ty said gently. His voice was warm and affectionate, and his fingers slid up and down Zane\u2019s arm as he stepped closer and wrapped Zane up in a hug.</p><p>Zane huffed but smiled against Ty\u2019s shoulder. He liked that Ty knew him so well. It was like a splash of cold water to the face every time he started to sink into thinking he was a mystery. \u201cSo tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Ty said in a low whisper. Just like the first time he\u2019d answered with that, months ago in a tent, Zane\u2019s stomach did a happy flip. He steeled himself to ask the only thing he could think of just then.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell does Nick afford this boat?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s fingers came to a stop, and he seemed to be holding his breath as the muscles against Zane\u2019s body tightened. Then he sighed and relaxed again, his fingers dragging against Zane\u2019s neck as he stepped away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ty, this isn\u2019t city cop salary stuff. This isn\u2019t even saving every dime he made in the Marines and eating Ramen noodles every meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his home, it\u2019s where he lives. You ever asked yourself how I afford a historic row house in the middle of Fell\u2019s Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Zane said with a frown. \u201cI always figured you were just really adept at not spending money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Zane,\u201d Ty said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou never buy anything, you never have anything extravagant,\u201d Zane continued, mumbling as he began to feel sort of stupid for never wondering about it. \u201cHow can you afford it?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, looking up as if he could see the deck above them. He met Zane\u2019s eyes again before turning away. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, come on.\u201d</p><p>Ty picked up the nearest pillow and chucked it at him. Zane caught it and threw it back. \u201cYou brought it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a payoff, all right? When they kicked us out of the Marines, they had to make sure we wouldn\u2019t go crying to the press, so they paid us a lump sum and sent us on our way.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him, not exactly shocked but close enough to it to gape. Ty closed his eyes and turned his head away.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d they do it? What\u2019d you guys get into?\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to meet his eyes, then gave a curt shake of his head. \u201cThat\u2019s enough story time for one night. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHEY\u2019VE completely dropped off the grid again,\u201d Agent X said as he spoke to his superior.</p><p>\u201cHow is it possible that they keep evading you with two prisoners to keep under control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to believe that Cross isn\u2019t a prisoner, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hesitate to conjecture, sir, but... I believe he thinks they\u2019re trying to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would he think they\u2019re trying to help him when all they want to do is deliver him to the man who wants him dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t say. But why, sir, would they attempt to deliver him at all if they merely want him dead? Why not kill him in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible, I suppose. We\u2019ll try to take them alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting them down is becoming futile. I haven\u2019t heard anything from the team we sent to Louisiana. But we knew that was a ruse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back to DC, we\u2019ll sit on the Federal building. We know that\u2019s where they\u2019re going. I\u2019ll send a team to Blake Nichols in Chicago. Perhaps we can find some clarity in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Agent X hung up the phone, looking at it in frustration. If Randall Jonas got his hands on Julian Cross, the last shred of evidence against him would be gone. Jonas was responsible for too many deaths. They couldn\u2019t let these FBI assholes deliver Cross to his death too.</p><p>HOURS after crawling into bed with Ty, Zane still lay awake, staring at the stars through the windows, listening to the soothing sound of Ty\u2019s breathing. Ty\u2019s body was warm against his, something familiar in the midst of this absolute clusterfuck.</p><p>There was something incredibly romantic about where they were. The moon and stars were astounding out on the water, twinkling above them, unfettered by the lights of any city. He could hear the waves slapping against the hull, the creak of the boat as it bobbed at anchor. The gentle rocking under them would have been the perfect backdrop to curling up with his lover and making love all night long.</p><p>He shifted in bed, turning his head so he could look at Ty. He was trying not to think too hard about anything, but Ty was always at the forefront of his thoughts. Where the hell had the money come from? Why was Ty so uncomfortable with the subject? Was he telling the truth about the military paying them, or was that another classified cover? And then there was Nick.</p><p>When he\u2019d first found Ty in the airport in Chicago, Ty had said he wanted to talk about a lot of things when they got home, to get everything in the open. Ever since, Zane had pondered what Ty could possibly have in mind. Obviously, Nick had been one of those things. He was angry and hurt, even though Ty hadn\u2019t really done anything wrong but react to a kiss and then admit to liking it. He hated the bond Ty had with Nick, but he also hated to ask Ty to give it up.</p><p>A glass clinked from above, and Zane raised his head to listen. He heard another small sound, and he slid out from under the covers, trying not to disturb his partner as he clambered out of the oddly shaped bed. Ty usually woke at the drop of a hat unless he was truly exhausted. All the driving and running and fighting had used up everything Ty had in him. He didn\u2019t even toss his head when Zane got out of bed.</p><p>Zane stood at the end of the bed and looked down at him, wondering about the panic that Ty had been feeling that night weeks ago when he\u2019d left Zane asleep and bolted. Was there a force in nature that would make Zane walk away right now?</p><p>He shook his head, determined to let that stay in the past, and he grabbed his gun and headed up the stairs for the galley.</p><p>When he peered over the edge of the stair railing, he could see Nick standing in a weak pool of light coming from the sink. He cleared his throat to let Nick know he was there. Nick turned to look at him, glass in hand.</p><p>\u201cDid I wake you?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>Zane shook his head and climbed the rest of the steps, moving toward the little corner booth that was situated in the pilothouse. He set his gun on the tiny table and slid into a seat, turning to rest his elbow on the back so he could look into the galley. Nick had been really quiet, actually. Impressively so. Zane was just too attuned to noises in the night.</p><p>\u201cMind if I get a drink?\u201d Zane asked, his voice hoarse and dry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d Nick asked as he turned to the refrigerator behind him.</p><p>\u201cWater, tea, coffee, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Nick messed around in the refrigerator and finally pulled out a plastic bottle of water. He set the bottle and a glass of ice on the counter between them with a flourish and smirked. \u201cCaffeine\u2019ll keep you awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be awake anyway,\u201d Zane answered, but he pulled the bottle and glass toward him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Nick said with a nod. He picked up his own glass again and leaned his elbows on the countertop. \u201cWhat\u2019s keeping you up? Aside from the people trying to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep much. Even when people aren\u2019t trying to kill me,\u201d Zane said, smiling.</p><p>Nick was nodding, watching Zane, though he probably couldn\u2019t make out much since the only light in the room didn\u2019t reach the corner where he sat. Zane wondered what Nick might talk about, if asked, or if he might share something about Ty that Zane didn\u2019t know. Ty was their common ground. It was just talk between new friends, right? Only this friend knew Ty was with Zane, and he\u2019d had his tongue down Ty\u2019s throat a few weeks ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane shrugged that imagery off. He\u2019d have to deal with it soon, but he wanted to see what he could get out of Nick first.</p><p>\u201cI guess none of us sleep much. Ty\u2019s down there muttering in Farsi,\u201d he said as a way to break the ice.</p><p>\u201cHe does that still?\u201d Nick asked in amusement.</p> <p>\u201cOnly when he\u2019s asleep or really, really pissed off,\u201d Zane admitted, sliding the glass back and forth on the table near his gun. He kind of enjoyed the dig, letting Nick know that Zane was the one who held Ty at night. It might have been beneath him, but he didn\u2019t care. \u201cWhen he sleeps, he doesn\u2019t sleep quietly.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave that a melancholy smile. \u201cWe were all like that, to a degree. You can be disqualified from making Recon if you snore, but what they don\u2019t realize is that after half a year, every one of us talked in our sleep. Or screamed.\u201d</p><p>Zane emptied his glass and reached for the bottle to refill it. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s something I\u2019ve ever done. Talk in my sleep, I mean. Keep it bottled up, I guess.\u201d Not to mention that a large part of the time he\u2019d been undercover, he was sleeping with someone\u2014or someones\u2014he didn\u2019t want knowing who he really was.</p><p>\u201cNot healthy,\u201d Nick chastised, smiling and lifting his own glass to his lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you a friend of Deuce\u2019s too?\u201d Zane asked wryly.</p> <p>\u201cTy\u2019s brother? I\u2019ve met him a few times. I don\u2019t know, something about combining the Grady traits with psychological training didn\u2019t sit right with me. Made me nervous.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. \u201cGrady traits? Like blustering out of tight spots and courage under fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd being crazy enough to pull off the impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGummi bears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheetos. And that look, like he knows exactly what you\u2019re thinking and he finds it funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that,\u201d Zane muttered, setting down his half-full glass.</p> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Nick said, laughing and looking down at the ice in his glass again. \u201cGod, I miss him sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up at him, an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of his stomach. He didn\u2019t want to imagine what it was like to miss Ty.</p><p>Nick was silent too, watching Zane in the dim light again and drinking his water without further comment. Finally, Nick smiled and looked away with a shake of his head. \u201cTy told you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>It threw Zane for a moment, and he stared at Nick, wondering if he was headed for a showdown of some sort. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, still looking down at the glass he\u2019d set on the counter. \u201cI was hoping he\u2019d forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that night. As soon as he got home.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cHis brand of morality is pretty unique,\u201d he said as he looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He straightened and put both hands on the counter. \u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned, not sure how to handle the straightforward approach. \u201cAm I actually going to hear it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Nick answered with an easy shrug. \u201cDo you deserve it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane said, meeting Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Nick raised one eyebrow and cocked his head to the side. \u201cTy told me he was involved with you, that he loved you, and I should have respected that. I didn\u2019t, and for that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he offered, sounding sincere.</p><p>Zane nodded, noting how precisely Nick worded that apology. \u201cNow tell me how you really feel,\u201d he said, keeping his tone dry. He didn\u2019t want to start an argument, but he did want to know where Nick stood. And he did still want to slug him.</p><p>Nick snorted and gave him a grim smile. \u201cI think you\u2019re one lucky son of a bitch, and I kind of want to hate you. The hell of it is, I know Ty. He won\u2019t come looking for me unless you give him a good goddamn reason to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m lucky,\u201d Zane said as he realized that the little bundle of nerves he\u2019d always had to deal with when he thought about love and Ty just wasn\u2019t there. Was that confidence? Trust in his lover? Zane wasn\u2019t sure, but he liked it.</p><p>Nick lowered his head, shaking it minutely. \u201cIn that case, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry for making a move on your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>It sounded so absurd that Zane huffed a laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Nick stood for an awkward moment, obviously not sure what to say or do.</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t so damn much like him, I\u2019d probably have been able to hit you,\u201d Zane told him, wondering where the urge to share was coming from and kind of wishing it would stop.</p><p>Nick looked up at him, expression guarded. \u201cIf we can be friends, it\u2019d make our lives easier. And Ty\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell he\u2019s tense. I\u2019ve been wondering if that\u2019s because of me, or just life. But then, he never did like it when people tried to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes it when people try to kill them.\u201d</p><p>Nick smirked at that. He picked up his glass and turned to get more ice from the freezer. He moved deliberately, trying not to make any noise. He glanced toward the stairs again. When he turned back to the counter, he reached for his own bottle of water to refill his glass.</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019ve been on the run pretty much nonstop,\u201d he said to Zane. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be as exhausted as he is, why are you really up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced toward the stairwell, then back to Nick. \u201cHow close are you?\u201d he finally blurted out. \u201cI have no frame of reference, other than the oorah and your tongue down his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Uh... we met on the bus ride to Parris Island. Stuck together for the next... ten years, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been able to really talk to one of Ty\u2019s friends before, besides his brother. I guess I figured you might have some insight.\u201d</p><p>Nick was already shaking his head before Zane finished. \u201cJust treat him like you would when you unravel a slinky. That\u2019s the best I can give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disturbingly apt,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>Nick\u2019s lips twitched as he looked down at the glass in his hand. Zane looked at him, truly studying him. He was beginning to understand why this man was Ty\u2019s best friend, coming out and kissing him aside.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s smile fell, and he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of how many times over I owe him my life.\u201d He looked at Zane hard, narrowing his eyes in the darkness. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re dancing around,\u201d he said, confident in his assertion.</p><p>Zane sighed. He figured he must be really worn out if he wasn\u2019t hiding his emotions as well as usual. Nick was reading him, and Zane wasn\u2019t sure he cared. \u201cI\u2019m worried. This mess could go so bad so quickly, and you know him. He\u2019ll be right in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy was made for messes. He and the cockroaches will be the only things to survive the final meltdown.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked down at the almost empty glass he held and then set it carefully on the counter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on the cockroaches.\u201d</p><p>Nick was quiet, but Zane could feel his eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cYou and Ty... you were prisoners of war, weren\u2019t you?\u201d he said, looking up to meet Nick\u2019s eyes carefully.</p><p>Nick inhaled sharply and rubbed his hand over his mouth as he looked away.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering... I don\u2019t want to ask him details. He doesn\u2019t know I know.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked down at the counter and shook his head, then pushed away from the counter and paced away, running his hand through his hair.</p><p>Zane winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just, uh... it\u2019s still classified. Not something I really like to chat about,\u201d Nick stuttered. He was truly flustered, and Zane realized that it didn\u2019t suit him.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe it would help me understand you two better. Understand him better. I\u2019m sorry, I....\u201d Zane shrugged. He had worried about asking Ty the details, but he hadn\u2019t even considered the effect the mention of it would have on Nick. He realized that it had been cruel to bring it up. Despite wanting to hate this man, Zane found that he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Zane\u2019s words hung in the air between them. Zane wasn\u2019t sure if Nick would give him details. Zane wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted details, but he felt like it was something that had forged Ty into who he was now.</p><p>Nick returned to the counter, watching Zane, looking like a man with something heavy on his conscience. It was another look that didn\u2019t suit him, and Zane frowned as a shadow crossed Nick\u2019s face in the weak light.</p><p>\u201cWe were in captivity for over three weeks,\u201d he told Zane without being prompted again. \u201cTwenty-three days, nine hours, and fifty-one minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe were captured when our Chinook was taken down by an improvised rocket-assisted mortar. We\u2019re not really sure how it happened; one minute we were in the transport, the next we were both waking up in a cell. The investigators said that the five us who were in the middle of the helo were thrown. He and I were the only two taken. They think it was because we were further from the wreckage. I don\u2019t know. We were detained, questioned, and tortured for information.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. It was worse than he had imagined. He had guessed months ago that something had happened while Ty was in Afghanistan. Little clues had dropped over time, and Zane had collected them: Ty\u2019s incessant nightmares and nocturnal muttering. Fear of small, dark, enclosed spaces. Hating being restrained or even forced to sit still for long. Recognition of interrogation tools and techniques. The POW sticker on the Bronco. The words Zane had overheard when Ty had spoken to Nick. And then Nick had confirmed it.</p><p>But when Nick laid out the details, it was so much worse than Zane had feared. Almost three weeks in captivity, being drilled for answers and tortured.</p><p>Nick gave him a moment to let the reality sink in and possibly to give him a chance to stop the narrative. Then he continued. \u201cTy kept pissing them off by speaking in different accents every time they questioned him.\u201d He laughed. It was a bitter, thin sound. \u201cHe spent a whole day pretending he was Russian and telling them they were doing it wrong.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but smile. That sounded so much like the man Zane knew. Even in the midst of an ordeal like that, he was still Ty.</p><p>\u201cThey kept us together in a cell that wasn\u2019t big enough for either of us to stretch out in. But we had each other, kept each other sane. When they\u2019d come and drag Ty out, leave me there alone, that was the lowest I\u2019d get. They could torture me all they wanted, do whatever they wanted to me. But sitting in that cell alone, wondering if he was coming back... those times are where my nightmares go.\u201d Nick swallowed hard and looked away, his green eyes glistening as he tried to force the emotions back so he could continue. It affected Zane as well, and his chest already hurt in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cFinally they started getting desperate. They realized that we were drawing strength from each other. Instead of separating us, though, they tried to drive a wedge between us. They\u2019d take us out together, make us do the work. If we didn\u2019t hit hard enough, we had to hit again. If we didn\u2019t cut deep enough, we had to cut again. I don\u2019t know how long it really was, but we estimated it was about a week that we spent torturing each other, beating the shit out of each other at gunpoint.\u201d</p><p>Zane let his eyes fall closed. He had taken enough of Ty\u2019s punches in the past to know how bad that must have gotten. He and Nick both must have been beaten to a pulp.</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Nick murmured triumphantly. \u201cThey wanted us to resent each other, turn on each other. It just made us stronger, more determined to live through it together and escape. I don\u2019t think they really knew what to do with us. We wouldn\u2019t crack, we wouldn\u2019t die, they weren\u2019t willing to execute us. Ty wouldn\u2019t shut up.\u201d</p><p>His eyes began to peer off into a distance only he could see. Zane watched him, apprehension and nerves swamping him. He could sense that Nick hadn\u2019t reached the worst part yet.</p><p>\u201cThen they came up with something that would work.\u201d He looked up at Zane, his hard eyes coming back into focus, bright with anger and memory. \u201cOne day they strapped Ty down to this table. I could hear the noise from my cell, and I knew from the way he was fighting, he thought he was going to die.\u201d</p><p>The thought hit Zane hard, and he closed his eyes, wondering if he should ask Nick to stop. But morbid curiosity got the better of him, and he forced himself to open his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cWhen they got him tied down, they brought me in there with him. They had him bent over the table, a rope over his back to hold him down. His hands were handcuffed behind him. They put cuffs on me, and I thought for sure they were going to make me cut him open.\u201d Nick shook his head, raising his chin and glancing at the ceiling. \u201cThen they told me I could either tell them what I knew or I could fuck him on that table with a gun to both our heads. And if I didn\u2019t do it, they\u2019d do it for me.\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped breathing as he stared at Nick, suddenly frightened out of his mind. He\u2019d expected to hear about torture, but not that. Was that what had happened to Ty to make him hate being held down?</p><p>Nick sat silent, eyes on the window, fingers trembling on his glass as he recounted what had to be one of the most terrifying, difficult experiences in his life. In anyone\u2019s life. Zane dimly remembered that Ty told him once that they shouldn\u2019t compare wounds. Now it made terrible, crystal clear sense. He felt sick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick\u2019s voice wavered when he continued. \u201cI was ready to tell them everything. I would have. Anything they asked, I would have given it to them. Everything Ty and I had stood for and fought for, I was ready to hand it over just like that.\u201d His eyes welled and he closed them, possibly ashamed at the memory, but that just forced the tears out, and a pair tracked down his handsome face without him seeming to notice. \u201cBut Ty....\u201d</p><p>Zane knew without a doubt what Ty would have said, and he closed his eyes against the pain of it.</p><p>\u201cHe told me to do it.\u201d Nick nodded as he said it, as if affirming what Zane had already guessed. \u201cHe ordered me. Fucking pulled rank, like I cared at that point. He was still a Marine, and that\u2019s all he cared about. I couldn\u2019t process what they were going to make me do, what Ty was ordering me to do. I was standing next to this table, my best friend strapped down on it, a gun at my head, trying to decide whether I was a Marine with brass balls like Ty or a coward. And Ty told me to kiss him.\u201d He laughed suddenly, the sound oddly incongruous with the story he told. \u201cHe had to tell me twice. And when I did he slipped a key into my mouth.\u201d</p> <p>Zane\u2019s heart seemed to lurch back into beating.</p><p>Nick hummed deep in his throat, the sound both content and somehow ominous. \u201cWe didn\u2019t leave anyone in our path alive.\u201d</p><p>Zane could barely get in a breath to speak. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d His voice broke off, and he didn\u2019t try to continue. He didn\u2019t want to know, and yet he had to.</p><p>Nick\u2019s green eyes focused in on Zane again, as if he was just remembering that he\u2019d been telling Zane the story instead of reliving it by himself. His eyes flickered away, and he shook his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think either of us would have come back from that.\u201d</p><p>The relief almost knocked Zane over. He gripped the edge of the table with one hand to stay balanced. After what seemed like a silent forever, he spoke in a hoarse voice. \u201cThat explains a lot about you two.\u201d</p> <p>Nick nodded and swallowed hard. \u201cI was in love with him. I\u2019d already made up my mind to tell him after our tour was over. Consequences be damned, I just needed him to know. But after that....\u201d He shook his head and cleared his throat. \u201cThere are some friends you don\u2019t risk for your own peace of mind. Some things... at the time it wasn\u2019t worth the risk of losing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month when you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I\u2019d already lost him.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Nick asked. He leaned against the counter, body relaxed again as if he\u2019d taken a weight off his shoulders and handed it to Zane to carry. It struck Zane as singularly unfair. \u201cAm I still in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you still love him,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI know he loves you. Maybe not the kind of love you want, but.... What I want to know is what you plan to do about it.\u201d</p> <p>Nick sighed sharply, as if the question annoyed him. \u201cI\u2019ve known Ty for twenty years, Garrett. I was enthralled with him after the first week.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut time blunts these things. If you want us to stop caring about each other, you\u2019re shit out of luck. We did three tours in Hell, and that kind of thing bonds you to a person for life. But if you\u2019re asking if I intend to make another move on him, the answer\u2019s no. I\u2019ve regretted what I did every day since.\u201d He was still meeting Zane\u2019s eyes, unwavering, and somewhere deep down, Zane could feel the warrior in him, feel the dangerous, capable, upstanding person he could be if he wanted. He was like Ty in so many ways.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know Nick, but he knew Ty. He trusted Ty, and he knew Ty wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt him. But hearing the words from Nick, receiving the promise that he wouldn\u2019t make another advance, that he regretted doing it in the first place, it did ease some of the worry in Zane\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cGarrett. He\u2019s never looked at me like he looks at you,\u201d Nick said in a soft voice. \u201cHe\u2019s never looked at anything the way he looks at you. Besides. He hates the Sox. We\u2019d never work.\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of a dick, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast I could do,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>Zane stared at him for another minute, trying to wrap his mind around all the things Nick had told him, and telling himself that this man was and would always be a huge part of Ty\u2019s life.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to try to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a good idea,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back tonight.\u201d</p><p>Zane stood and carefully didn\u2019t examine the feeling those words gave him as he pushed his glass toward Nick. \u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured as he turned away. He made his way back down the steps to the cabin where Ty lay asleep, but Zane knew he wouldn\u2019t be sleeping easily tonight, not after learning what he had.</p><p>He crawled into bed, seeing his lover with new eyes as he pulled the covers up around their shoulders.</p><p>Ty muttered something in the foreign language Zane was becoming used to, and rolled away from him, pushing back at him so Zane would hold him. Zane scooted up behind him, wrapping him up and pressing against his warm body.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Zane asked, barely letting the words come out.</p><p>Ty hummed and pushed closer to Zane. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled, letting his fingers drag against Ty\u2019s skin. As conducive to romance as the setting may have been, all Zane wanted to do was hold Ty close and sleep with him in his arms.</p><p>Ty turned his head. \u201cDid you hear what you needed to hear?\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled him closer. \u201cI think so. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>THE next morning, Nick was guiding the yacht toward Washington, DC, and the rest of them were huddled in the booth where Zane had sat last night, trying to come up with a plan.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the big bad assassin, and I\u2019m not intimidated when you glower at me. You\u2019re not coming with me,\u201d Ty was saying to Julian as the two men went in verbal circles.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to be dragged along any longer. We will have a say in our next move, or I will leave you bound and gagged during the night for the Coast Guard to find,\u201d Julian growled.</p><p>Ty slammed his hand against the table and pointed a finger in Julian\u2019s face. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you talk like a normal person?\u201d he shouted in frustration.</p><p>Julian snorted in disdain and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cFine! When we make port, you come with me to headquarters, Cam stays somewhere safe with Garrett, and you start using contractions when you talk to me or I swear to God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Julian said in annoyance.</p><p>Ty grumbled as he grabbed up his coat and stalked toward the steps that led to the flybridge, where there were more places to sit in the open air. \u201cI need air,\u201d he snarled to the rest of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is wrong with the way I talk?\u201d Julian asked as he got up and followed him up the steps.</p><p>\u201cI hate you and shut up. Why are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause air is free,\u201d Julian shot back before they slammed the hatch door closed and muffled the rest of their argument.</p><p>Quiet reigned for a full minute before Zane started to chuckle, a wry smile on his face. He tipped his head sideways to look at Cameron. \u201cI really do think they enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shrugged. \u201cI know Julian does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReminds me of Thanksgiving with my parents,\u201d Nick muttered as he sat at the wheel, still examining the nautical chart he\u2019d been reading when Ty and Julian had started in on each other.</p><p>\u201cAs long as they both come back intact,\u201d Cameron said, pushing away his coffee cup and standing. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower.\u201d He disappeared down the steps</p><p>It left Zane acutely aware that he was sitting alone with Nick.</p><p>There was silence for a long moment. Even the rustle of the paper had stopped. Finally, Nick turned and looked at Zane over his shoulder. \u201cTy does love a good nemesis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy could start an argument with Gandhi if he put his mind to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have heard him and Sanchez go at it. Four different languages, neither of them ever understood the other. A Latino guy screaming in German and a mountain hick shooting off French back at him.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted.</p><p>\u201cHey, listen.... You said last night that you wanted to understand him better.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up at Nick and nodded.</p><p>Nick reached into his jacket and pulled out a CD case. \u201cI dug this up. It\u2019s uh... it\u2019s a bunch of videos we took while we were in service.\u201d He handed it to Zane. \u201cThought maybe you and Ty could watch it together.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him, momentarily stunned by the simple gesture. He recognized it as the peace offering it was. He reached out to take the CD case and looked from it to Nick. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and then turned his attention back to the charts and navigating the waters toward DC.</p><p>\u201cSidewinder, right? Where\u2019d the name come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what they called us. I think it was because no matter what they sent us into, we always managed to slither out of it.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. Yeah, that sounded like a team Ty would have led. \u201cDid Ty have a call sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s just pilots,\u201d Nick said after a minute or two. \u201cWe had nicknames. They changed every couple months depending on who moved in and out. But Ty was team leader, meant we just called him Six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a nickname?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cNone he\u2019d want me to repeat,\u201d Nick muttered, a smile in his voice. \u201cJust Six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU better damn well call me when you\u2019re safe,\u201d Nick told Ty as they stood around Julian, shielding him as he jimmied the lock on a car parked in the parking lot of the public marina where Nick had rented a slip.</p><p>\u201cSomeone will. Check on Deacon for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd go home. Don\u2019t stick around and get caught in any blowback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me, O. You\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed but he nodded.</p><p>Ty met his eyes for a few seconds. He didn\u2019t look scared. But he didn\u2019t look confident, either, and that made Nick nervous. Ty\u2019s biggest asset was his ability to make those around him think he was bulletproof.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need another gun?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fight, O. And if things go bad, we need someone who can tell what went down.\u201d</p><p>Nick felt a ball of cold steel settle in his chest. He hated being left on the sidelines, but Ty was right. He nodded, and Ty turned away from him to slide into the car Julian had unlocked. He sat in the driver\u2019s seat and reached between his legs to mess with the wires underneath the steering column, and in a matter of about thirty seconds, Ty had hotwired the car.</p><p>Nick waved as they drove off, the old blue Chevy Suburban lumbering through the parking lot and turning out of sight. Nick took a deep breath and tried to settle the nerves that prickled through his chest. Ty could handle himself, and Nick had seen enough of Zane Garrett to have formed a confident opinion of his skills as well. The man was formidable, a good match for Ty. And Julian Cross was a piece of toast that would always drop butter-side up, but Nick wasn\u2019t sure if being lucky would do them much good. Even the luckiest dog in the litter had its bad day.</p><p>He was turning to head back to the dock and his boat when he caught sight of a black SUV turning the corner on the other end of the parking lot. The windows were tinted, and there was nothing remarkable about it except for the thick antenna on the roof.</p><p>It stopped in the middle of the lane, and Nick stood there and looked at it for a few seconds. The SUV revved its engine, and Nick broke into a sprint for the gate to the dock as the SUV roared down the lane toward him. It hopped the curb and barreled down the sidewalk as Nick reached the gate and shouldered through it. He could hear the doors slamming behind him as he sprinted down the dock, and when he heard the gate give way, he leapt onto his boat and rolled to the deck so he could crawl inside without being open to gunfire.</p><p>There was nowhere to run; he would never get the 580 moving in time to escape. All he could do was buy enough time for Ty and the others to make it away cleanly. He scrabbled through storage compartments, tossing life preservers over his shoulder and finally hitting gold. He grabbed it and kissed it, murmuring to it as he scrambled to the galley, where he\u2019d have the most cover.</p><p>When two men in dark suits kicked down the heavy oak door in the salon, Nick stood behind the galley partition, aiming a double-barreled shotgun at them.</p><p>\u201cOh, son. You broke down the wrong door today,\u201d he said with sadistic glee before he opened fire.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>BLAKE NICHOLS walked onto the floor of his four-star restaurant and took a deep breath as he headed for the bar, where two men in expensive suits waited.</p><p>\u201cMr. Nichols?\u201d one of them said as he approached them. He reached into his suit and extracted a badge, flipping it open to show Blake his CIA credentials.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Blake asked, not reacting to the badge.</p><p>\u201cWe know you\u2019ve been in touch with a Mr. Randall Jonas. We need you to tell us what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Blake laughed, shaking his head at the audacity of the man. \u201cAnd why should I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re Julian Cross\u2019 friend. And we\u2019re trying to save his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross is the last man alive who can identify Randall Jonas as the architect of over fifty known murders. We have no other proof. Jonas destroyed it all before he escaped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEscaped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf those FBI agents deliver him to Jonas before we can intercede, Mr. Cross will be dead and Jonas will be free to access his account in the Cayman Islands and disappear.

He caught wind of the investigation, destroyed everything, and ran.\u201d</p><p>Blake narrowed his eyes, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWe know he sent a man named Arlo Lancaster here to Chicago a year and a half ago to kill Cross and you. Ever since he learned Cross was still alive, he\u2019s been trying to find him.

Either way, this ends in Julian Cross dying when he\u2019s delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, after seeing the threadbare evidence the CIA had compiled on Randall Jonas, Blake called Preston as his stomach tumbled. There wasn\u2019t enough to convict the man, but it was enough to convince Blake.</p><p>\u201cI delivered him right to the bastards,\u201d he spat out as soon as Preston answered his call.</p><p>\u201cAn honest mistake, sir, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Preston murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou make damn sure those FBI agents don\u2019t make it to their boss, you understand me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you have to. Jonas cannot get his hands on Julian, or Jules is a dead man.\u201d</p><p>Preston was silent for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was low and dangerous. \u201cUnderstood, sir.\u201d</p><p>BURNS stood as soon as he heard the commotion outside. For his assistant to be railing at someone like that, it had to be Ty. Relief flooded him. They hadn\u2019t heard from him in days. Burns had begun to face the very real fear that Ty and Zane might be dead. He heard the telltale response to his assistant in a gruff voice, and then the door to his office was shoved open.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just barge in like this whenever you want. Director Burns has a standing order not to be disturbed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo eat your granola, Nancy, don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d Ty shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nancy!\u201d Burns said in a stern voice as Ty shoved a man into the office and then slammed the door in her face.</p><p>Both men were disheveled and breathing hard, as if they\u2019d just run up the steps of eleven stories and not taken the elevator. At first glance, Burns thought he was looking at Zane, but when he looked at the man directly, he realized his mistake.</p> <p>\u201cDirector,\u201d Ty said to him in a sarcastic, hoarse voice. \u201cDoor-to-door delivery. Sorry we\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Dick, you didn\u2019t tell me you sent Earl\u2019s boy out there!\u201d Jonas blurted in outrage.</p><p>The man Burns now recognized as Julian Cross tensed and took a step back, face grim. His eyes darted to Jonas and back to Burns. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked. He turned on Ty, grabbing him by his shirt collar and slamming him against the door to Burns\u2019 office. \u201cYou lied to me!\u201d</p><p>Ty seemed shocked, staring at him in confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Jonas said, and Burns saw him draw a gun from the small of his back. It had a silencer on the end of it. Certainly not standard-issue.</p><p>Julian eased his grip on Ty\u2019s shirt and shoved him one last time against the door before turning to face Jonas.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Ty asked as he looked at Burns.</p><p>Burns met his eyes with a growing sense of apprehension. He wasn\u2019t sure he knew what was going on anymore. \u201cRandall. Put the gun away,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jonas shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you sent Earl\u2019s boy after him,\u201d he said again through gritted teeth.</p><p>Burns glanced back at Ty, who was standing with his hands out like he was balancing on a thin piece of rope.</p><p>\u201cYou want your mastermind?\u201d Julian asked in a disgusted voice. \u201cThere he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Burns blurted out as he looked between them.</p><p>Jonas glanced at him, his eyes hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Richard. You were my last chance to get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used me?\u201d Burns growled, taking one step forward in his anger. Jonas turned the gun on him, then back to Julian and Ty as he stepped further toward the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cDisarm yourself, Richard, or I shoot him right here.\u201d</p><p>Burns clamped his teeth together and carefully removed his weapon to set it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cNow you two,\u201d Jonas said to Julian and Ty. \u201cAll your weapons.\u201d</p><p>Ty still looked stunned. He had known Jonas since he was a little boy. He\u2019d spent family vacations with the man.</p><p>He took his standard-issue sidearm out of its holster and tossed it to the ground, eyes never leaving Jonas. Julian slid a gun from the belt of his trousers and tossed it away as well.</p><p>\u201cNo backups?\u201d Jonas asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said, sounding as if he hated himself for using the same term of respect he probably always had with Randall Jonas. Ty\u2019s habits were hard to break, though.</p><p>Jonas glanced at Burns again. Burns knew he was trying to decide whether to kill them all or try to convince Ty and Burns to go along with him in his scheming.</p><p>Ty took one step forward and slid over, putting himself between Julian and Jonas\u2019 gun.</p><p>\u201cStop moving, Tyler,\u201d Jonas said as he took a step back to match.</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t let you shoot him, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, I told you to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Burns whispered. He knew now how deep Jonas\u2019 betrayal went. He didn\u2019t know if Jonas had it in him to shoot the son of one of his oldest friends, a man he\u2019d literally rocked as a baby, but Burns didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>Ty lowered his head like a bull preparing to charge. \u201cI can\u2019t let you shoot him.\u201d</p><p>Julian moved behind Ty, shifting from one foot to another.</p><p>\u201cStop moving!\u201d Jonas shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to go through me,\u201d Ty said. His words wavered, like he knew how high the possibility was that Jonas would do just that.</p><p>Jonas\u2019 eyes narrowed, and the muzzle of his gun trembled. Burns held his breath, afraid to move for fear of setting Jonas off. He could not stand here and watch Ty be shot in front of him. He would not.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who can take me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe all can. Are you going to kill us all, right here in my office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to,\u201d Jonas said. His eyes hadn\u2019t left Ty and Julian.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you since we were eighteen!\u201d Burns shouted.</p><p>The crack of the bullet hitting the glass window behind them made them all jump. Burns dove to the ground as he tried to decide where the sniper\u2019s round had come from. The bulletproof glass had spiderwebbed in concentric patterns around the high-velocity round that was still lodged in it, just feet behind Jonas\u2019 head.</p><p>Jonas ducked and then brought his gun up to take his shot at Julian. Burns called out. Ty covered his head with both hands and spun out of the way, and Burns realized that Julian had grabbed him and shoved him, drawing a hidden gun from the small of Ty\u2019s back. He dove to the side as he fired. The boom of the Glock overpowered the dull thuds of the silencer.</p><p>Burns could do nothing but cover his head. Everyone scrambled for cover.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ!\u201d Ty cried as soon as the shooting hit a lull. \u201cYou prick! You shot me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly have shot you from this angle,\u201d Julian murmured from where he hunched behind an arm of the same sofa Jonas was using as cover.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Burns called out.</p><p>Another sniper round hit the window, close enough to the first bullet to crack the glass more. Eventually the sniper would get through.</p><p>Jonas lunged to his feet and sprayed a volley of bullets at the corner where Julian had taken cover. Burns scrambled for the weapon he had discarded, diving to the floor and rolling as he brought the gun up. Jonas had the gun trained on Julian, who had run out of bullets and was on his knees, hands held high. Burns raised his gun to fire, but his finger had barely brushed the trigger when Ty rammed Jonas from behind.</p><p>Jonas\u2019 gun went off, spraying ceiling plaster everywhere. They landed hard, Ty\u2019s bulk knocking the air from Jonas as he skidded face-first across the plush carpeting. Ty rammed an elbow into Jonas\u2019 back to keep him down.</p><p>Burns pushed to his feet and aimed his gun at Jonas. \u201cTy! Get him out of here!\u201d</p><p>Ty hesitated, looking from Burns to Jonas.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not safe until he\u2019s at Langley!\u201d Burns growled, jerking his head toward Cross. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled and struggled to his feet, holding a bloody hand to his side. Julian took his elbow, both of them staggering toward the door.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d Jonas groaned as he pushed off the floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, Richard. Don\u2019t let them get away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Burns gritted out as Ty and Julian fled from the office.</p><p>Jonas met his eyes, his body tensing. Burns looked into the depths, reliving every moment he\u2019d known Randall Jonas, from boot camp to the morning he\u2019d pulled Burns out of a fire in the jungle to the day he\u2019d been a groomsman at his wedding.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you.\u201d</p><p>Jonas twisted to look up at him. Burns tightened his hold on his gun, hand trembling as the betrayal sank in.</p><p>Jonas gave a derogatory snort and met Burns\u2019 eyes. \u201cThat just made you easy to use.\u201d</p><p>JULIAN heard the last gunshot, the sound deafening as they ran for the stairwell. Ty skidded to a halt, turning back. \u201cDick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had the upper hand,\u201d Julian said, grabbing Ty\u2019s elbow to pull him along. Ty hesitated, but when they saw agents flooding the hallways, he turned and ran with Julian to the emergency stairwell.</p><p>They stormed down the steps, every bang and clang of the stairwell putting Julian\u2019s teeth on edge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant, really,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cSend unsuspecting errand boys to do the dirty work. It\u2019s his signature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe this,\u201d Ty muttered. \u201cDoes this mean me and Zane were the bad guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>They hit the ground floor level, and Ty pushed through the door into the lobby. Sirens were going off; the entire federal building was mobilizing. Ty flashed his badge at a security guard who tried to stop them. When the guard stepped in front of them, unwilling to let them leave, Ty grabbed him by the hand, twisted it, and turned into his body, dropping the beefy guard with a move as graceful as a ballerina.</p><p>They darted past as other guards came after them.</p><p>\u201cZane is gonna kill me,\u201d Ty said as they burst through the doors and sprinted down the street into the sparse crowds of tourists.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one!\u201d Julian shouted as they darted between people and across the street. \u201cWe have a sniper to worry about now as well.\u201d</p><p>ZANE sat with Cameron at the caf\u00e9 they\u2019d designated as the rendezvous. He despised being left behind, but Ty had given a convincing argument that he and Julian would be able to slip through better just the two of them. They were also hoping, on some level, that Zane would serve as a decoy for anyone watching the building waiting for Cross to show up. He had walked up and down the sidewalk several times, hoping to draw attention, as Ty and Julian had slipped inside in a flower delivery van.</p><p>It was a lot easier to sneak into FBI headquarters if you were an actual FBI agent.</p><p>When he caught sight of two men running down the street, Zane sat forward and tensed, barely keeping himself from reaching for his gun.</p><p>When they got closer, he saw that it was Ty and Julian. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked as he peered into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cLooks like something went wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to move,\u201d Ty gasped as soon as they reached Zane and Cameron. From the looks of them, they had both sprinted there.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Jonas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?</p><p>\u201cJonas, he was the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s CIA, he had Burns pull us in, but he only wanted Cross to kill him,\u201d Ty stuttered.</p><p>\u201cTy, breathe.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, gulping air and holding to his side. Blood seeped through the material of his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sniper on a roof somewhere. We don\u2019t know whose side he\u2019s on, and we need to get out of sight,\u201d Julian said, rapid-fire and barely discernible with his thick accent.</p><p>Zane and Cameron moved, grabbing their last remaining bag of gear, Zane leading the way. There was nowhere to go that they would be able to hide. But they could duck into a restaurant or museum and be out of the sniper\u2019s sights. They headed for the massive complex of the Verizon Center, and Zane darted into The Greene Turtle as the others followed. Cameron was gasping for breath after the sprint, and Ty was leaning against the railing of the curving staircase that led down to the restaurant\u2019s basement, panting and holding his side.</p><p>\u201cCan I... help you?\u201d the hostess asked them.</p><p>\u201cTable for four, please,\u201d Cameron said, breathless, holding up four fingers. \u201cAway from the windows, if that\u2019s possible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, looking at them askance as she grabbed menus.</p><p>Zane took Ty\u2019s arm and began to lead him down the stairs. Julian followed, dragging Cameron with him as he explained to the waitress that they\u2019d be right back. They didn\u2019t want her growing suspicious enough to call the police on them, but Zane doubted Cameron\u2019s attempts had helped their cause.</p><p>The basement of the restaurant had two oddly situated bathrooms and a wide open space used for parties and probably hiding Jimmy Hoffa. They tumbled into that dark, cavernous space and collapsed against whatever was nearest them.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been hit,\u201d Zane said to Ty as he knelt next to where Ty had sunk against a wall.</p><p>\u201cIt grazed me. It\u2019s not bad.\u201d He met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at him worriedly, then glanced at Julian.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Julian snapped, the heat in his voice aimed at Ty.</p><p>\u201cYou shot from under my arm!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no possible way I hit you from that angle! It was a ricochet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go over the laws of physics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was going to shoot you, I would have shot you somewhere more memorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Zane shouted, putting both hands out to calm them.</p><p>Ty grunted at him and pressed his hand to his side, glaring at Julian.</p><p>Cameron hugged close to him, and Julian pulled him in and rested his chin on Cameron\u2019s head, closing his eyes as they embraced.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m out of ideas,\u201d Julian whispered.</p><p>Zane looked back at Ty. He shook his head, unable to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cBurns said to get him to Langley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be happening,\u201d a new voice said from the doorway.</p><p>All Zane could see was the outline of a man, a long-barreled rifle slung over his shoulder. As he watched, the man pulled the rifle down and aimed it at him and Ty.</p><p>\u201cPRESTON!\u201d Cameron called out in obvious relief.</p><p>When Ty scrambled to his feet, he found himself facing the matte black muzzle of a sniper\u2019s rifle. His heart stuttered and his body flooded with ice.</p><p>The muzzle lowered to reveal its owner as the man stepped into the pool of an emergency light, and Ty stared at the blond man in shock.</p><p>\u201cThank Christ. Preston, what took you so long?\u201d Julian grumbled as he rushed forward.</p> <p>\u201cTerribly sorry, sir,\u201d Preston drawled, smirking as he glanced around and met Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cHello, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t find his voice through the surprise.</p><p>Cameron glanced between them. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re acquainted,\u201d Preston answered as he hiked the rifle onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d Zane said as he stood next to Ty. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Preston raised one eyebrow at Zane but didn\u2019t answer him, instead meeting Ty\u2019s eyes and giving him an enigmatic smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Preston, Julian\u2019s driver,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cDriver,\u201d Zane said, voice wry. \u201cDo you sell antiques too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I kill people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston!\u201d Cameron said, appalled. \u201cI thought you were staying in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had other business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Ty finally found his voice, though he was still staring back at the man as if he\u2019d risen from the dead. \u201cHe was... French. You were French,\u201d he said accusingly.</p><p>Preston shrugged. \u201cSo were you. We both got what we were after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the guy from Paris that Burns thinks is Cross?\u201d Zane said, pointing at Preston. \u201cSo this is the guy all this has been about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, please keep up,\u201d Preston said with a curl of his lip.</p><p>Ty stood there, shaking his head, mind churning to connect the pieces.</p><p>Preston turned to Julian. \u201cSmith and Wesson are in your car, sir. Ready when you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your lady friend from the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>Cameron looked crestfallen, but Ty was too distracted by Preston\u2019s sudden appearance to feel sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cGrady and Preston were both after the same mark in Paris a few years ago,\u201d Julian said to Zane. \u201cThey met during what I hear was a drunken, debauched night of... selling antiques. That\u2019s how I knew Ty had been there. I never saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch unnecessary details,\u201d Preston murmured.</p><p>\u201cTy, seriously,\u201d Zane grunted.</p><p>\u201cHow is this my fault?\u201d Ty asked in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a history with every guy with a gun in the Northern hemisphere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like you don\u2019t have some winners back there you hope we never run into. Let\u2019s head to Miami and see what comes out of the woodwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like guys with guns!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Julian muttered as he rubbed at his eyes.</p><p>Zane crossed his arms over his chest and gave Ty a look that said they\u2019d be discussing this later. Ty rolled his eyes and pointed at Preston. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe learned that you were delivering Mr. Cross to the very man who wants him dead. I\u2019m here to kill you and rescue him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bit late for that,\u201d Julian muttered.</p><p>\u201cBulletproof glass, or I would have been right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Zane put a hand out and looked from Julian to Ty. \u201cSo wait a minute... we\u2019re the bad guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucks, right?\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Zane huffed. \u201cIf we\u2019re the bad guys, that means the CIA isn\u2019t trying to kill Cross. They\u2019ve been trying to save him from us!\u201d</p><p>Julian and Ty stared at him, then glanced at each other uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Cameron muttered as he rubbed his hands over his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is real life.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf the CIA and Preston and whoever else are trying to save him and not kill him, why don\u2019t we just drive him up to Langley and this is all over?\u201d Zane said, sounding almost excited.</p><p>Julian shook his head. \u201cPlease. If you deliver me to them, my life is over. Whether I\u2019m alive or dead, they will own me again.\u201d</p><p>Ty met the Irishman\u2019s eyes, a pang of familiarity running through him. He knew what that claustrophobic fear felt like. No one deserved to be pressed into service.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just... disappear?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>They all looked at him with the same mixture of sadness and contempt. There was no disappearing if you had something the CIA wanted.</p><p>\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t go in to clear all this up, they will never stop following you, Cam,\u201d Zane said. He looked at Julian. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d Preston said, stoic as ever.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Julian said immediately.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to argue over, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cPreston intends to turn himself into the CIA in my stead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why does it have to be one of us?\u201d Cameron asked, a little plaintive.</p><p>\u201cThe only solution is to give them Julian Cross,\u201d Ty murmured. \u201cOr run for the rest of your lives. And Preston is in their books as Julian Cross. Am I right? The two of you shared duties under one codename?\u201d</p><p>Preston nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder they thought you were Batman. You were two people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAntiques dealers don\u2019t play fair,\u201d Julian muttered, voice low and wry.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a difficult decision, gentlemen,\u201d Preston told them, voice devoid of emotion. He handed his rifle to Julian, who took it without question. Then he turned to Ty.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Julian pleaded, a rare show of emotion playing across his face as he stepped between them. \u201cPreston, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I really must insist that you not make this difficult,\u201d Preston whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, Preston,\u201d Cameron murmured, pain in his voice.</p><p>Julian was silent, the two old companions sharing a moment of understanding before Julian wrapped the blond man in a tight hug. Then he hung his head and stalked away like a wounded lion pacing in a cage, unable to meet Preston\u2019s eyes. Preston held his hands up to Ty to be handcuffed.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands down,\u201d Ty said in a hoarse voice, inexplicably touched by the show of loyalty between the two. They had obviously been partners for many years, and Preston was essentially giving up his freedom for Julian. Sure, he wasn\u2019t going to be imprisoned, but he would be under the thumb of his former employer all the same, unable to live the life he could otherwise. Most importantly, he was giving up ever seeing Julian again, because as soon as they did this, Cameron Jacobs and the man known as Julian Cross would disappear.</p><p>It was enough to earn Ty\u2019s respect.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane. \u201cThe CIA knows what Cross looks like,\u201d he said in a measured voice as his eyes traveled down Zane\u2019s body. \u201cWalking Preston in there won\u2019t work. We need to give them what they\u2019re looking for or we won\u2019t even make it through the door.\u201d</p><p>Zane tipped his head to one side, met Ty\u2019s gaze when it returned to his face, and then, with a twitch of his lips, nodded. \u201cYeah. Sure, that\u2019ll be fun, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What will be fun?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Preston and I are going to turn \u2018Cross\u2019 in to the CIA,\u201d Ty drawled with a growing smirk as he nodded to Zane.</p><p>Cameron\u2019s jaw dropped as he looked between Julian and Zane, obviously remembering that he was the one who originally said they looked so much alike. \u201cIsn\u2019t that going to be dangerous?\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded grimly. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re all grinning like idiots. Lucky bastards.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and flipped the gun around in his hand to hold the barrel and offer it to Preston. \u201cSpecial Agent Preston, your company-issue firearm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does have a certain ring to it,\u201d Preston murmured as he took the weapon. \u201cAll right, lads, say your good-byes,\u201d he urged as he headed for the door, obviously not intending to say his own.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Cameron said, stepping over to touch his elbow. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Zane patted his hand and glanced at Julian. \u201cKeep him on a leash, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cameron whispered.</p><p>Julian looked between them and nodded, his jaw tightening. He stepped forward and held out his hand to Zane. \u201cAgent Garrett. It\u2019s not easy to earn my respect. Well done.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Zane shook his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not often people like us get a second chance. Enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded tightly, and his eyes shifted to Ty. He held out his hand, and Ty didn\u2019t hesitate to reach out and take it. \u201cTake it easy, Killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Grady,\u201d Julian said solemnly. \u201cIf the world didn\u2019t have sharks, we couldn\u2019t have kittens either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make any sense,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d Ty said, meeting Julian\u2019s eyes and nodding.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even exist in remotely similar ecosystems,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>Julian smirked and let go of Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cYou are far too literal,\u201d he told Cameron as he wrapped an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, Ty,\u201d Cameron said, voice wavering as Julian led him further into the darkness of the large basement room.</p><p>Zane turned back to Ty, then stepped close enough to cup his cheek and kiss him thoroughly. Ty closed his eyes as Zane curled his other arm around him and pulled him close, and let himself get lost in it. He didn\u2019t care if Zane was staking out his territory like a stray dog. After today they might be spending quite a lot of time in jail; it might be his last chance to be staked out.</p><p>When Zane finally pulled away, leaving Ty wavering, Preston offered a low whistle.</p><p>Zane ignored him as he reached up to touch the compass rose, his fingertips lightly brushing Ty\u2019s skin as well. \u201cIn case we\u2019re wrong and I get shot on sight.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cWon\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>They looked to where Julian and Cameron had been, only to find them both gone.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a glance and shrugged. Their prisoners had finally escaped. Zane held the cuffs out to Ty with a smile. \u201cReady to go fuck with the Agency?\u201d</p><p>A cold ball of determination settled in the pit of Ty\u2019s stomach. He took the handcuffs and grinned wolfishly. \u201cThey messed with the wrong Feebs this time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>THEY didn\u2019t even make it past the gate guard at Langley.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not expected,\u201d the man said as he examined Ty\u2019s FBI credentials.</p><p>Ty pointed to the camera over the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGive the face recognition software some time. We\u2019ll wait.\u201d He pointed at his face and smiled as he looked into the camera; then he reached over and took Zane\u2019s head, yanking him sideways so the camera could see him as well.</p><p>Two minutes later, the guardhouse was surrounded.</p><p>They were escorted through the lobby, past the wall with no names, to an innocuous conference room where three men sat waiting for them.</p><p>They stood when Ty, Zane, and Preston were shoved into the room.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the big kahuna?\u201d Ty asked as he kept a tight grip on Zane\u2019s elbow. They had handcuffed Zane behind his back and frog-marched him into Langley like a criminal. Ty had enjoyed it a little too much.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the purpose of this?\u201d the man asked. His face was thin and sallow, and he had snow-white hair that seemed to stand on end. His suit probably cost more than Ty\u2019s whole wardrobe, and Ty didn\u2019t buy cheap. He was flanked by two younger men, Agent X and Agent Y, the former looking tired and amused, wearing a canvas jacket and jeans, the latter wearing thick-rimmed hipster glasses and a tie that was way too thin to be company issue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe heard you were looking for Julian Cross,\u201d Preston said, voice devoid of an accent.</p><p>\u201cThis is not Julian Cross,\u201d Agent X said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWe figured the beard was enough of a threat to national security to bring him in,\u201d Ty said as he waved a hand at Zane\u2019s face.</p> <p>Zane turned his head and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cRelease this man, please,\u201d the Big Kahuna said, and Agent Y stood to walk over to them. He unlocked Zane\u2019s hands and stepped back, looking at all three of them with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is Zane Garrett,\u201d the agent said as he turned to look at his superior.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty said as he turned to look at Zane. Zane was trying not to grin as Ty dragged his gaze up and down him. \u201cWow, he does kind of look like him.\u201d He poked Zane\u2019s stomach. \u201cSay something Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrish I was at home,\u201d Zane said, managing not to smile.</p> <p>The Big Kahuna stood and smoothed his hand down his tie. \u201cMr. Cross, we\u2019re pleased you came in. Randall Jonas has been a thorn in our side for a long while.\u201d He was looking at Preston.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m pleased to be here,\u201d Preston murmured.</p><p>Agent Y looked from Ty to Zane to Preston. \u201cSir, this is not Julian Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d Agent X said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat of Randall Jonas?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was shot while trying to escape.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShot?\u201d Ty said in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThe investigation has already concluded.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him, not able to really process that information.</p><p>The Big Kahuna smiled and waved a hand at Agent X. \u201cTake these men into custody. Let them see what it is to be on the wrong side of the Company.\u201d</p><p>TY SAT in a white-and-chrome padded room, his legs shackled to a table, his hands chained together to a ring on the tabletop. The jumpsuit he wore had no markings, buttons, or zippers. Not even a tag. He was wearing shoes with no socks, and nothing under the jumpsuit. They\u2019d taken everything from him, even the compass rose pendant Zane had given him.</p><p>He stared at his reflection in the mirror, knowing there was someone on the other side. He drummed his fingers on the table, trying to make the rhythm slow and measured to dispel the nerves that zinged through him. He\u2019d been held all night in this observation room, given only water in a Styrofoam cup. When he\u2019d told his guard that the CIA was killing the planet with Styrofoam, the man had left with his cup and never come back.</p><p>The door to his room opened with the loud clank of heavy metal, and Ty watched as two men in suits sauntered in and sat opposite him at the table.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Beaumont Tyler Grady, correct? Also known as Tyler Beaumont and... Sam Hill?\u201d</p> <p>Ty stared at the man, raising one eyebrow. \u201cWe meet again,\u201d he said, allowing himself a small smirk.</p><p>The agent looked up at him, and his partner glanced at him before looking back at Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe apologize for the necessity of the strip search. But it seems you have a reputation for... producing keys.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, that\u2019s not even the first one I\u2019ve had this week,\u201d he said, voice wry. He looked at Agent X and grinned widely. \u201cIt was the most fun, though, huh?\u201d</p><p>Agent Y blinked rapidly, as if trying to hide his reaction.</p><p>Ty grinned and pointed two fingers at Agent X. \u201cThis guy, man. He likes it rough,\u201d he said with a chuckle. He topped it with a suggestive wink at Agent X, pointing his thumb and pinky at himself and mouthing \u201ccall me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Agent Y murmured. Ty enjoyed that the man was uncomfortable, probably more than he should have. \u201cYour task was to retrieve and deliver a CIA asset by the name of Julian Cross, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019ve got this all wrong. I was sent to get milk. I got 2 percent instead of skim and everything went ballistic. I mean you\u2019d think I brought home soy milk or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady, you can drop the act now or you can do it next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week\u2019s no good for me. Do you have a calendar?\u201d</p><p>The two CIA agents sat stolid, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWow. Tough crowd.\u201d Ty hummed and looked down at his hands, beginning the tune to the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady, the sooner you answer our questions, the sooner you go home.\u201d</p><p>Ty stopped humming only to let it turn into a whistle.</p><p>The two agents waited for a few more moments, then stood and exited, closing the door behind them with an echo of finality.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t help the shiver that ran up his spine, but he looked up at the mirror with a grin, the hum turned into muttered words, and soon he was singing. He mangled the lyrics to the chorus, though, replacing the word \u201challelujah\u201d with \u201cparanoia\u201d and making up his own words to the rest of the song.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t finished the song before the door opened again. He glanced at the newcomer, relief washing over him. \u201cAm I glad to see you,\u201d he told Richard Burns.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I wish I could say the same,\u201d Burns growled as he tossed a pair of handcuff keys on the table. They slid past Ty\u2019s fingers, just out of reach. Ty tried to reach them with the tip of one finger as Burns sat opposite him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so unnecessary,\u201d Ty mumbled as he continued to try and reach the keys.</p><p>Burns sat snickering at him for a few moments before he finally took pity on him and reached out to cut through the zip tie and unlock the handcuffs. He handed Ty the keys so he could release his feet.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s settled down?\u201d Ty asked as he ducked under the table.</p><p>\u201cThat depends. The CIA currently has in its custody two FBI agents and one Boston police detective who is demanding they pay for the damage to his boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded. \u201cEmptied a double-barreled shotgun at a couple of Company lackeys, and then they arrested him. He spent all night claiming he thought they were the Men in Black coming to scan his brain.\u201d</p><p>Ty bit his lip so he wouldn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>\u201cThey returned him to his boat this morning, and he\u2019s on his way home. Safe.\u201d</p><p>Ty breathed a sigh of relief at that.</p><p>\u201cJulian Cross is responsible for the deaths of half a dozen CIA agents.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, pressing his lips tightly together. It was true that every man who\u2019d lost his life had fallen to the hands of Julian Cross. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. It was self-defense, though, he thought they were trying to kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware of that, Ty, but here\u2019s the problem the Company has right now. It seems the man you brought in was not, in fact, Julian Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Ty asked, feigning surprise as he sat back up and doing it badly just to annoy his superior. \u201cHuh. That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Burns hummed, meeting Ty\u2019s eyes and trying not to smile. \u201cYou want the CIA to believe that you mistook your partner for your prisoner, handcuffed him, and delivered him to Langley?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cI mean... he grew a beard. It was an honest mistake.\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, waiting for the other shoe to drop. A man appeared at the doorway, all clean-cut and dashing and looking official with his badge and gun. Ty looked Preston up and down in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve changed my code name to avoid further confusion,\u201d Preston said with a smile. \u201cThank you for escorting me safely from Chicago, Special Agent Grady.\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him, not sure what to say to that. So he just kept his mouth shut. Preston nodded and turned to go. Ty looked back at Burns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m filing this under my Rubik\u2019s Cube,\u201d Burns murmured. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Ty hopped up to follow. \u201cCan I get my things back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on it.\u201d</p><p>Ty grumbled but didn\u2019t ask again. The first person he saw when he exited the room was Zane, already dressed, freshly shaven, and ready to go. Ty pointed at him as he glared at Burns.</p><p>\u201cYou rescued him first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching you through the mirror for ten minutes,\u201d Zane told him, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been training rookies off you, Ty,\u201d Burns said as he walked away.</p><p>Ty glared after him, then glanced at Zane with a grin and threw himself at his partner to hug him before Zane could dodge him. Zane laughed and closed his arms around Ty, returning the enthusiastic embrace.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Agent X said as he approached them. Ty let go of Zane\u2019s neck and turned to look at the man. He held a bundle of Ty\u2019s clothing and possessions. \u201cYou did an impressive job this week.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a glance. \u201cThank you, I guess,\u201d Zane said warily.</p><p>\u201cThe Agency would like to extend an invitation to both of you.\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned his head forward as if he\u2019d heard wrong.</p><p>\u201cAn invitation?\u201d Zane repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re offering us a job?\u201d Ty asked, incredulous.</p><p>Agent X nodded. \u201cWe here at the Agency believe that if you can\u2019t kill it, you hire it.\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh. Zane just shook his head and turned away, trailing after Burns.</p><p>Ty wagged a finger at Agent X, who was smiling ever so faintly. He took his things from the man. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of all right, man,\u201d Ty told him, still laughing. \u201cLater, gator.\u201d</p><p>He turned to amble off after the other two, content that the ordeal was over and he could finally go home. With Zane.</p><p>ZANE was already wrapped around Ty, kissing him senseless as he pressed him against the front door of his row house. Ty fumbled behind him for the doorknob, turning the lock and causing the door to open, tumbling both of them into the house.</p><p>Zane kicked the door closed and grabbed at Ty again, but Ty pushed at his hands and tensed, looking around the living room of his home.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d he whispered urgently, eyes scanning the darkness behind Zane. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked as he turned and reached for his gun. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Ty drew his weapon and edged into the narrow room. \u201cCouple years ago a suspect broke in during a case. I set up backup systems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d Ty hissed, waving at Zane to be quiet as he edged further into the room, heading for the kitchen. Zane followed, backing him up as he felt the tension of the last few weeks begin to invest itself in his shoulders once more. What else could they possibly run into before this month was over? Was it possible that he had set Ty's alarms off when he\u2019d come here at night? He prayed for a simple answer.</p><p>Ty moved past the bar, turning and pointing his weapon at the kitchen. He stopped short and straightened, lowering his gun as he stared at the kitchen floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked, breathless.</p><p>Ty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... alive,\u201d Ty mumbled as he stuck his gun in its holster. \u201cIt\u2019s Smith and Wesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross\u2019 cats?\u201d Zane moved into the kitchen and flipped the overhead light on.</p><p>The two large long-haired orange cats sat in the middle of the kitchen, eating cat food out of a bowl. They glanced over at Ty and Zane. One of them growled deep in its chest and then went back to eating. As it ate, it continued growling.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty was reading a note left on the counter, paying the two monsters no mind. \u201cHe says he\u2019ll retrieve them after he and Cam have settled somewhere. \u2018Don\u2019t get too attached,\u2019 he says.\u201d</p><p>Ty put the note down and looked at the two cats. One of them was still growling as it ate, making obscene smacking and hissing sounds.</p><p>\u201cI knew that bastard hated me,\u201d Ty grumbled as he turned to head up the steps.</p><p>\u201cBut... Ty,\u201d Zane said as he looked at the cats. They had left the food bowl behind and were stalking toward him, looking at him with luminous green eyes. \u201cUh.\u201d</p><p>One of the massive orange cats hissed at him. Zane stepped back, out of their way, as they sauntered past him toward the stairs, their tails swishing like the two evil Siamese cats in that Disney movie. Zane gaped at them as they trailed after Ty up the stairs.</p><p>THE day after returning to Baltimore, Ty and Zane finally found themselves back at their desks and back to work, with absolutely no downtime as a reward for what they\u2019d been through. The rest of the work group greeted them enthusiastically, Scott Alston even giving Ty a hug in greeting before he handed him a stack of paperwork.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Michelle Clancy said as she came up and put her arm around Ty\u2019s waist as he sat on the edge of Zane\u2019s desk.</p><p>He laid his arm over her shoulders, then glanced over her and frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Red? You look like someone kicked your puppy.\u201d</p><p>Clancy shrugged and gave him a weak smile. \u201cThey transferred Tim yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and glanced at Zane. \u201cWho\u2019s Tim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancial Crimes guy,\u201d Zane murmured from his seat. He looked at Clancy. \u201cWhy\u2019d he transfer?\u201d</p><p>Clancy shrugged one shoulder and laid her head against Ty. She looked like she was holding back tears. \u201cI think they found out we were dating. Sent him to North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty stared at the top of her head, feeling as if his heart had dropped into his stomach. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just reassign him?\u201d he asked, surprised when he found his voice hoarse.</p><p>Clancy shrugged. \u201cThey wanted to make an example of it, I guess.\u201d A tear slid down her cheek, and Ty pushed away from the desk to offer her a hug. She accepted it gratefully, something the hard-as-nails little redhead rarely did. He looked over her head to meet Zane\u2019s eyes, seeing the same fear in them as he was suddenly feeling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had planned to be open and out when they got home, planned to move in together and stop feeling like they needed to hide.</p><p>Now, though....</p><p>\u201cGrady, Garrett!\u201d Dan McCoy called from his office.</p> <p>Clancy thanked Ty as she wiped her eyes and hurried away, leaving Ty and Zane staring at each other. Ty could feel the fear growing in both of them.</p><p>\u201cHey, fruitcakes! Now!\u201d</p><p>Zane stood, and Ty followed him to McCoy\u2019s office, feeling like he was moving through water. Of all the things that had happened in the last month, he thought maybe Michelle Clancy\u2019s news was the hardest for him to take.</p><p>TY AND Zane filed into McCoy\u2019s office to find Richard Burns sitting there waiting for them. McCoy closed the door for them, and Ty thumped down into one of the chairs. Zane followed a little more gracefully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve still got all kinds of paperwork pending, but now that the CIA is deigning to tell us what the hell was going on over there, I expect this all to clear out pretty quickly,\u201d Burns said from his seat behind Dan McCoy\u2019s desk as he shuffled papers. He\u2019d come all the way from DC to speak to them, rather than make them drive any more than they had to at that point.</p> <p>Zane nodded absently, listening with half an ear, tapping his pen idly on the pad of paper in front of him. Another crisis past, another case closed, but so much had changed in the handful of weeks they\u2019d been away. He felt off-balance being back at home in Baltimore. He felt like the world had changed, with all the revelations between him and Ty. Zane felt like he\u2019d changed. The nervous swirling inside him was gone, replaced by an almost eerie calm. The uncertainty he always fought was taking a backseat to confidence he\u2019d forgotten he possessed. And the most glaring change of all, he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the love he was feeling for Ty was the real thing and that Ty reciprocated that conviction.</p><p>As Burns kept talking, moving on to a pr\u00e9cis of what they\u2019d missed, Zane glanced to his side. Ty was slouched, palm pressed to his cheek as he leaned his head on his hand. One foot rested on a knee, bouncing to a rhythm only he could hear. He was watching Burns attentively, but whether he was listening attentively was anyone\u2019s guess. Zane gave him a fond smile and tuned back into what Burns was saying.</p><p>\u201c... if anyone from over there contacts you directly again, you tell them to talk to me, got it?\u201d Burns asked, thumping his fist on the desk.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty murmured. He shifted in his seat, putting his foot on the floor and leaning forward expectantly. \u201cIf contact is made in person, are we allowed to hit or throw anything at them?\u201d he asked, deadpan.</p><p>Zane chuckled and leaned back as he watched Burns roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAs entertaining as it might be to watch, I doubt that will happen,\u201d Burns said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we also sort of doubted that agents of another federal organization would try to hunt us down and kill us,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Ty glanced at him dubiously as if he disagreed, but he was smirking as he looked back at Burns.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Ty asked almost cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Burns waved a hand at them. \u201cGo home. Relax. Come back to work Monday.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked. \u201cBut it\u2019s Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Garrett,\u201d Ty muttered as he stood and patted Zane on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go before he changes his mind.\u201d</p><p>Zane immediately got to his feet. \u201cThank you, Director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d Burns said with a melancholy smile.</p> <p>Ty hesitated as he looked down at Burns. \u201cDick. I... I\u2019m sorry about Jonas. I know how close you were.\u201d</p><p>Burns nodded, pursing his lips. \u201cHe was a spook. And no matter how good your intentions, spooks always end up transparent in the end.\u201d Zane glanced at Ty, uneasy. \u201cWhen you get home, dump your second phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Ty said, obviously too surprised to voice anything else.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of it, Ty. I won\u2019t be calling it again.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, still looking shocked and just a little hurt by the words. Zane almost reached out to put a hand on his shoulder but stopped himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given enough. There\u2019s nothing more precious than trust, boys,\u201d Burns said, voice somber. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it. Don\u2019t do something stupid and lose it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d they both murmured before heading for the door.</p><p>They were almost to the elevator before Ty turned to look at Zane appraisingly. \u201cTrust.\u201d</p><p>Zane cut his eyes to look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed, a sound similar to the one he made in bed. Zane\u2019s body noticed. \u201cLong weekend,\u201d he said instead of commenting on trust again. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerously close to the \u2018vacation\u2019 word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you still said it.\u201d Zane slid his hands into his pockets as they walked.</p><p>\u201cI like to live on the edge.\u201d Ty reached out and punched the button, then turned to lean his shoulder against the wall next to the elevator doors. He watched Zane.</p><p>Zane stifled the urge to shuffle his feet and simply returned Ty\u2019s look with a raised eyebrow. Ty didn\u2019t speak as he met Zane\u2019s eyes. The elevator doors opened up, and he nodded for Zane to step in. Zane let out a slow breath as he did, turning to lean back against the side wall as Ty joined him.</p><p>As the elevator doors slid shut, Ty leaned against the mirrored back wall and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve interrogated people who looked more relaxed than you.\u201d</p><p>Zane offered Ty a wry smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to hide. But... I don\u2019t want to be sent to North Carolina either.\u201d He felt a little more comfortable when he could look at Ty openly rather than constantly reminding himself not to watch his lover\u2019s every move. That was tiring. Zane didn\u2019t remember doing that to himself before.</p><p>Ty nodded, swallowing hard. \u201cWe can still be together.\u201d His manner was calm and soothing, but beneath the surface Zane could hear a hint of nervousness, so rare in his partner that he wasn\u2019t sure he hadn\u2019t imagined it.</p><p>Now that Zane had the opportunity to say something, everything in his head sounded so... silly. He gave in to the nerves and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cYou still want me to move in?\u201d he asked, chancing a look at Ty.</p><p>Ty pressed his lips together and nodded, glancing down at his feet. \u201cWe could have all your things moved by the weekend. We can pull it off. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked as he looked back at Zane. \u201cSay you\u2019re renting a room from me or something.\u201d</p><p>Zane tilted his head to one side as their eyes met again. \u201cI think I could pull anything off if it meant waking up with you every morning,\u201d he said, his voice barely audible.</p><p>Ty nodded, not looking away from Zane. \u201cWell,\u201d he started, a smile forming as his hazel eyes warmed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start with tonight, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>The relief made Zane laugh, and he nodded. How the hell did Ty make everything seem so simple? \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled, the sound low and warm and familiar. \u201cLife is hard and confusing, Zane. Love doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised both brows in mild surprise as the elevator dinged and the doors slid open. His instinctive response would have to wait until they were out of the building. He walked alongside Ty down the hall as they headed into the parking deck. \u201cNo more fortune cookies for you,\u201d he said as he caught Ty\u2019s eye. \u201cYou\u2019re way too Zen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll quit my fortune cookie moments of Zen when you stop making awful puns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m such a punny guy,\u201d Zane mock complained, one hand over his heart.</p><p>\u201cQuit it, Cheeseball.\u201d Ty swatted at Zane\u2019s head for emphasis.</p><p>Zane grinned and ducked, turning to walk backward in front of Ty. Ty looked him up and down with a rakish smile. It warmed Zane almost to the point of distraction. \u201cSo Chinese is out for dinner. Anything else sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t want to be left alone in the house with those cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so bad. Once you get used to their heads spinning. But seriously, let\u2019s go sit down somewhere where you get real silverware and I can grope you under a classy tablecloth.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. He didn\u2019t care where they went, as long as they were together. \u201cIt\u2019s a little early yet, just now four.\u201d</p><p>Ty sneered and looked across the parking deck in the direction of his rental. \u201cLet\u2019s go drive that thing into the harbor and see how long it takes the insurance adjustor to get there,\u201d he said, his eyes shining just enough to make Zane fear he might actually do it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not and just fantasize about it at an early dinner.\u201d Zane would rather Ty not go postal over another vehicle just yet. He reached out and snagged Ty\u2019s arm as he turned to walk beside him. \u201cHow about a trip to the batting cages, then we can clean up and get a decent dinner?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked sideways at him, grinning widely. He nudged him with his shoulder as they walked, the smile turning warmer and somehow more intimate without really changing. \u201cAre you asking me out on a date?\u201d</p><p>Zane smirked. \u201cI guess I am. If by \u2018date\u2019 you mean we end up naked and sweating.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed. \u201cYou do know how to charm me,\u201d he said, looking away and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cHey, I can be charming,\u201d Zane said, bumping Ty\u2019s shoulder as they came to a stop at Ty\u2019s rental.</p><p>Ty turned to him, leaning against the sedan and crossing his arms loosely against his chest. He was still smiling. Not his usual smirk or crooked grin that always warned Zane when he was up to something, but an honest, serene smile. \u201cYes, you can be,\u201d he said after a few moments of comfortable silence.</p><p>The concession made Zane\u2019s pulse speed, and he knew he was smiling like a fool. He inhaled deeply and willed away an impulse that could only bring trouble. They had to be more careful than they had been. They could do it.</p><p>\u201cPick you up in an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d Ty promised in a low voice that was smooth as honey. Somehow he seemed to know the effect his words had on Zane, and he was antagonizing him with the gentle flirtation.</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes and glared at Ty for a moment before turning toward his own truck, trying to ignore how flushed he was. He\u2019d get back at Ty tonight, in the privacy of their home. The home they would be sharing from now on.</p><p>Ty would be there; that was all that mattered. </p> </body></html>"]
