I tuck the upper part of my body behind the windshield where there is less wind resistance and yell out, \u201cWahooo!\u201d when the feeling of flying hits my stomach. This is what I love. Freedom.</p><p>I sit up when I see a few bikes in the distance. I don\u2019t recognize their patches, but that doesn\u2019t surprise me. Tennessee has a huge MC community, and there are always new clubs popping up all over the state. I slow down as I close the distance between us.</p><p>The closer I get, the more details I can make out. The group of about five bikes in front of me are all Harleys, all ranging in colors from almost purple to black. None of the men are wearing helmets, which is the complete opposite of me, who is covered from head to toe in black leather. Even my helmet is all black, with leather piping.</p> <p>I take the men in, noticing they are all well-built, their leather cuts displaying a large eagle, with its wings spread wide like it\u2019s midflight. The talons of the bird are carrying a long stem rose, with petals falling off it onto their club name, The Broken Eagles. I begin to speed up and pass them one by one, thankful for the security of my helmet, the black visor making it impossible to see me.</p><p>I keep my head straight until the last guy, the one who is at the front of the group, catches my attention. From the back, his hair is the first thing I notice. It\u2019s slightly long on top and buzzed on the sides. My eyes move to the expanse of his back, the wide set of his shoulders, and the tan skin covering his lean muscles. His bike is low to the ground, and the bars are in front of him in a way that he has to stretch his arms straight out, causing every muscle to flex and move, making it look like the tattoos are alive and dancing.</p><p>My eyes skim farther down over his chest, which is covered in a white tank top tucked into a pair of light jeans, and around his waist is a black belt with a large silver buckle. I continue to pass him, my eyes shifting from the road to him and back again. This time when I look over, his head is turned towards me, and if I didn\u2019t know any better, I would have swear he is looking directly into my soul.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whisper, taking in his hair, the set of his jaw that is covered in days of stubble, and a pair of light eyes I can\u2019t quite make out through the tint of my helmet. He is seriously hot, but equally scary-looking. I look from him back to the road. It must not have been even a second, but when my eyes go to the asphalt in front of me, I see a bird that is trying to make its way across the road, its wing hanging in an awkward position. I swerve to the right just in time to miss the poor animal.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I hear roared, and I look over my shoulder at the man who is now coming up quick on my right side. I yell an apology over the sound of my engine and his pipes. Do a quick wave and take off, lowering my body and pulling back the throttle, wanting to get away from them. Dude looks seriously pissed off, and even though I hate leaving the bird behind without helping it, I would like to live to see my next birthday.</p> <p>I think I\u2019m in the clear, but then the sound of pipes fills my ears, and I don\u2019t even know how it happens, but they all catch up with me, surrounding my bike. I can\u2019t make out what they\u2019re saying, but my stomach starts to roll at the sound of their voices. I feel my side to make sure I have the Taser my dad insisted I carry.</p><p>I see a clearing and pull my bike off to the side of the road. I know this is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever done, but if they keep chasing me like they have been, we could all end up seriously hurt. I pull over and don\u2019t even shut down my bike. I just lower my kickstand as my heart, which was already beating hard, begins to bang violently against my ribcage as they surround me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d the guy who was at the head of the group asks, stepping in front of my bike.</p><p>I shake my head as my words get lodged in my throat.</p><p>He pulls me off my bike, and the men who are with him begin yelling obscenities as well.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I croak out, and I don\u2019t even know if he hears me as his hand goes to the collar of my leather jacket, where he shakes me hard. My hand accidently presses down on the button that ignites the Taser. The loud crack fills the air, and his eyes go wide then he falls to the ground, and I fall on my ass and crabwalk backwards. I look up when I hit something, only to meet the eyes of another man, who looks pissed.</p> <p>\u201cGet up,\u201d he growls, picking me up. My feet flail under me as I\u2019m lifted off the ground with my hands restrained behind my back.</p><p>\u201cHold him still,\u201d the guy who I had tasered growls in front of me as I try to get away from the anger I feel coming off him. His hands go to my head and he rips my helmet off, causing my hair to float down around me.</p><p>Complete silence descends. I swear no one even takes a breath.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I bite my lip and the guy in front of me blinks a couple of times before his hands at my shoulders release then tighten.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d he barks, dipping his face closer to mine, and the scent of him fills my lungs. He smells like leather, musk, and man.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I start to explain to him what happened, when he cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cFucking bitches always trying to be fucking hard.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no, he did not just call me a bitch. \u201cYou did not just call me a bitch,\u201d I lean forward and hiss in his face.</p> <p>\u201cYes, bitch, I asked you what the fuck you were thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be serious right now!\u201d I scream. Have I mentioned that I may have a little bit of a temper? I come by it honestly.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna explain yourself?\u201d He crosses his arms over his muscular chest and then lifts his chin to the guy behind me, who immediately lets me go, causing my feet to hit the ground hard without warning, making me stumble.</p><p>Once I right myself, I turn around quickly to face the guy that just dropped me and get up on my tiptoes, even though that is not even close to reaching his face, and growl, \u201cThat was rude.\u201d</p><p>Then I swing my body to face the scary, hot biker dude. \u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t want to kill a poor, innocent bird, so I swerved to miss it. I apologized for almost hitting you, but then you proceeded to chase me down like this is an episode of Sons of Anarchy, which it is not, I might add,\u201d I yell, flinging my arms around. I hear someone chuckle, but I\u2019m too caught up in my own tirade to pay any attention to how crazy I might appear.</p><p>\u201cYou flipped me off,\u201d he says.</p><p>I look at him and my eyebrows pull together as I reply, \u201cI totally did not flip you off.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure that I didn\u2019t flip him off. Did I flip him off? I ask myself then shake my head. \u201cI did not flip you off,\u201d I confirm out loud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis bitch is crazy.\u201d I turn my head and come face-to-face with a guy who is at least a foot and a half taller than me. He\u2019s slim, and kind of cute in that \u2018I just got out of prison. Wanna take a walk on the wild side?\u2019 kind of way.</p><p>I swing around in a circle, stating, \u201cThe next one of you assholes who calls me a bitch is going to get tasered.\u201d I stop on skinny cute guy and hold the Taser out in his direction, causing him to suck in his already thin stomach.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d he complains, but I swear I see his lip twitch.</p><p>\u201cStop fucking around,\u201d Hot Biker Dude says, grabbing the Taser from my hand.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I protest, and turn to face him, holding out my hand while putting my other hand on my hip. \u201cGive it back.\u201d I wiggle my fingers and he looks me over, making every inch of me tingle. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding; give it back. It was a gift from my dad.\u201d</p><p>He looks me over again then looks over my head, and says, \u201cLets roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look at him then all the guys walking away and getting on their bikes. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m not happier about them leaving, but I swear I want to run up to that guy, jump on his back, and wrap myself around him. I shake my head at my stupidity and yell, \u201cGood riddance!\u201d</p><p>That comment must have come too soon, \u2019cause Hot Biker Dude slips off his bike and comes back to me. I think he\u2019s going to be a jerk, but instead, he hands me my Taser and mutters, \u201cBe safe, babe.\u201d</p><p>I watch him walk away; his ass in jeans is like nothing I have seen before. He lifts his leg and straddles his bike, and I stay in place, watching his arm muscles flex from behind. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d I whisper as they all pull off. I get on my bike quickly and head back towards the area I saw the bird. I finally find the poor guy off the side of the road near the edge of a field. Once I have him in my hand, I get back on my bike, and that\u2019s when I hear the sound of pipes once again. A shiver slides down my spine, but I ignore it and focus on what I need to do.</p> <p>I unzip my leather jacket and unfold the bird\u2019s wing so that I can tuck it closer to his body. Once I have his wing adjusted, I place him near my belly with one hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d a dark, rich voice asks, and I startle almost dropping the poor bird, so I lift my head and glare.</p><p>\u201cHe broke his wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bird,\u201d Hot Biker Dude says, looking at the tiny animal in my hand.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I roll my eyes and zip up the lower part of my jacket so the little bird is secure against me, with his miniature head sticking out the top of the zipper.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTaking him to my office, where I can hopefully get him fixed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a doctor?\u201d</p><p>I lift my head and our gazes connect. This time, without the visor, I can see his eyes are green, a green so light that they remind me of mint chocolate chip ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna answer, or just stare at me?\u201d</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me? \u201cI\u2019m a vet.\u201d I feel my face pinking from being called out. \u201cSorry about earlier,\u201d I murmur, picking up my helmet from behind me and slipping it on, feeling instant relief when he\u2019s blocked out. I lean forward and start up my bike, being careful of the bird that is now sitting close to me. I look at Hot Biker Dude one more time and lift my chin. He smiles, crosses his arms over his chest, and leans back in his seat. I know right then that if I ever see him again, I\u2019m screwed.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I smile, walking into my parents\u2019 house. My dad lifts his head from the papers in front of him on the island and smiles as I slide onto the seat next to him, leaning my head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, tenderly pressing a kiss to the top of my head then wrapping his large arm around my shoulders. I set my bag down on the counter and lean forward, picking up the coffee cup in front of him and taking a sip. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>I let out a shaky breath, set the cup down, and lean back so I can look at him.</p><p>\u201cThere was another dog left on the hospital\u2019s doorstep this morning,\u201d I tell him, and anger instantly fills his features. \u201cI hate it, Dad,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI hate knowing someone is fighting dogs and getting away with it. I hate that when they get to me, they are so badly broken I don\u2019t have any choice but to help them pass peacefully.\u201d I feel tears sting my nose, but I fight them back. You can\u2019t cry in front of my dad. He doesn\u2019t deal well when his girls cry.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Uncle Nico say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s putting up cameras out front to see if he can catch anyone, but there isn\u2019t much he can do right now,\u201d I mutter, picking his cup of coffee back up and taking another sip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call your cousins and see if they can have some of their boys do a round in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, seriously, they\u2019re busy.\u201d I shake my head. I know my cousins would do rounds if I asked them to, but I hate the idea of them worrying about me. They may be my younger cousins, but you would never know it by how they treat any of us girls. They make my uncles and dad look tame.</p><p>\u201cIf things don\u2019t pan out with the cameras, I\u2019m asking them.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, knowing there is no point in arguing. There are times you may as well be talking to a brick wall when speaking to my father.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d My mom smiles, walking into the kitchen, wearing a robe that isn\u2019t exactly appropriate, but still looks good on her. My mom is beautiful, and judging by the look on my dad\u2019s face, he seems to think so too. Which is my cue to leave.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom,\u201d I mumble as her arms wrap around me and she kisses my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming by.\u201d She looks at my dad over my head, but I still catch the look she gives him. Gross.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to come steal some food before I went home,\u201d I tell her, and then want to take it back, \u2019cause I need to get out of here.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to make you something?\u201d she offers, going to the fridge.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll stop at the store,\u201d I assure her.</p><p>I swear my parents are complete freaks, and I do not want to witness anything that will have me bleaching out my eyeballs later. Been there, done that, never going back.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She frowns, looking me over.</p><p>\u201cBabe, she\u2019s leaving,\u201d my dad growls at her, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cAsher Mayson.\u201d She puts her hands on her hips and I almost laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Mom.\u201d I pick up my bag and kiss my dad on the cheek before giving my mom another hug. I yell, \u201cLove you, guys,\u201d over my shoulder as I rush out of their house.</p><p>I drive twenty minutes to my house across town. I live in a yellow, three-bedroom, ranch-style home with a huge front porch that sits two rocking chairs. Even though my house is in town, the houses in my neighborhood are all spread out, each of us on my block having around one-acre lots.</p><p>I shut down my car in my driveway, not bothering to park in the garage since I would have to crawl out my trunk, and grab my bag before making my way up to my front porch. I grab my mail from the mailbox next to my door before making my way inside, quickly closing the door behind me so that Juice doesn\u2019t have a chance to escape.</p><p>\u201cHey, big guy.\u201d I drop my mail and bag on the entryway table and pick up Juice when he jumps up, making the contents of the table rattle. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d I rub my face into the soft fur of his neck and smile when he begins to purr. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an early night,\u201d I tell him as I walk back to my bedroom and toe off my shoes in my closet before dumping Juice onto the bed.</p> <p>He walks around in circles for a moment before curling himself up into a ball and closing his eyes. I shake my head, wishing I could fall asleep as easily as he does. I always find it hard to sleep after work. My body is normally exhausted, but my mind is in a constant state of worry. I\u2019m always wondering if I missed something, or if I should have done something differently with one of the animals in my care. I slip off my clothes, pull on a pair of cut-off sweats that are now shorts, find a tank top, and put that on before making my way into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, Taser,\u201d I say as I go to the cage that is now on a stand near the double doors that lead to my back deck. His little bird head turns towards me, and I check to make sure he has enough water and food before placing a sheet over the top of his cage. Since the day I brought him home, Taser has been improving, but judging by the way his small wing still hangs awkwardly, I don\u2019t think he will ever be free again.</p><p>I fix myself a peanut butter and banana sandwich and a glass of milk then carry both back to my bedroom, turn on the TV, and get into bed. I make myself comfortable while flipping through channels until I find one of my favorite shows, Ancient Aliens. I lean back and pick up my sandwich, taking a large bite before moaning at its perfection, and then wash it down with a gulp of milk. After I\u2019m done eating, I take my dishes back to the kitchen then go handle my nightly routine before getting back into bed. I make sure I hold back the covers for Juice, who, like always, curves himself against my stomach as I watch the supposable hidden secrets of an ancient alien race until I fall asleep.</p><p>I look at my receptionist, Kayan, and feel my eyebrows pull together when she taps franticly on the glass and waves her hand at me. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell my patient\u2019s family, and follow Kayan out of the exam room and down the hall towards the waiting area. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask her, and she pauses just around the corner and points. I look around to where she\u2019s pointing, instantly regretting it when I see the profile of the man I wished I would never see again standing near the reception desk. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d I whisper, taking Hot Biker Dude in, in all his jeans-and-leather glory.</p><p>\u201cHe said he wants to adopt a dog. I sat there staring at him for five minutes, not able to even speak, and I could tell he was becoming pissed off, so I figured you could help him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember when I told you about the bikers who chased me down a couple weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she mutters dreamily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one I tasered,\u201d I tell her, watching as her eyes get big and her mouth form an O.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispers, looking around the corner at him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod then pat her shoulder. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...please.\u201d She shakes her head franticly, grabbing onto my hand.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that scary.\u201d I frown.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s scary hot.\u201d She shakes her head again. \u201cI could deal with him if he was just hot, but no, he\u2019s scary and hot. That is a no-go for me. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I stand at my full height, which is only five-four, and adjust my shirt, pressing my boobs up a little higher, which makes no sense, because I\u2019m wearing scrubs. \u201cCan you go make sure the Thompsons have the supplies they need for Tutu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She breathes a sigh of relief, and I inhale a huge breath before stepping around the corner.</p><p>\u201cHi, Kayan told me you were interested in adopting?\u201d I say, pretending like I have no idea who he is. His head turns toward me, his gaze locking with mine, and my heart stutters in my chest. Everything I remembered about him was wrong. He is way hotter than I recalled, the scruff darker, his lips fuller, and his eyes greener.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he mutters as his eyes travel over the length of my hair, the tops of my breasts, down to my waist, and then slowly slide back up, making every inch of me feel exposed. \u201cJuly,\u201d he says when his eyes meet mine again.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d I ask, feeling completely baffled.</p><p>His head dips towards my chest and I look down, seeing my nametag attached to my top. \u201cOh,\u201d I say, feeling like an idiot, my hand going to my chest to cover the piece of plastic.</p> <p>\u201cWes.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I blink, wishing I had forced Kayan to do her damn job.</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Wes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool name,\u201d I mutter, and then wish I had grown up with a filter that worked properly when I see his smirk turn into a smile. \u201cSo you want to adopt?\u201d I ask him, knowing that if he says yes, his hotness points are going to increase tenfold.</p><p>\u201cThinking about it.\u201d He shrugs, shoving his hands into the front pockets of his jeans, forcing the well-worn black shirt he has on to stretch across his chest and abs. I swallow and mentally kick my ass around in my head until I pull myself together enough to speak again.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I clear my throat, and then narrow my eyes when I see he\u2019s smiling at how uncomfortable I am. \u201cFollow me,\u201d I snap, and stomp down the hall in front of him then push through the double doors at the end of the hall that leads to the kennels out back. I hear him chuckle, but I ignore him. \u201cThose are dogs. Those are cats.\u201d I wave my hand back and forth. \u201cCome back up front when you\u2019re done.\u201d I start to storm past him, but his hand shoots out, wrapping around my bicep stopping me in my tracks and sending a zip of electricity up my arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSlow down, babe,\u201d he says, and my heart stops, and a shiver slides down my spine from the tone of his voice.</p><p>I shake off his hand and turn to face him, trying to be casual, even though my heart is beating so hard I swear it\u2019s going to pound right out of my chest. \u201cDid you need something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me a little about some of the dogs you have here?\u201d</p><p>No! I mentally scream, but my stupid head nods up and down. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d I ask, and am proud my voice sounds normal and not breathy like I expected it to.</p> <p>\u201cAre any of these guys here known to be good guard dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Capone,\u201d I tell him, walking toward the kennel at the end of the hall. Capone needs a home. He\u2019s been with us for over six months, but no one wants the poor guy. He\u2019s ugly, but very sweet. If my heart weren\u2019t still broken from losing Beast years ago, I would have adopted Capone myself.</p><p>\u201cThis guy here is really vicious; he would kill someone if they looked at him the wrong way.\u201d He looks at me doubtfully. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled. He would rip your face off if he was given the chance,\u201d I tell Wes, crossing my arms over my chest while stopping in front of Capone\u2019s kennel. Capone sits up, his large bulgy dog eyes looking between Wes and me, the hair on top of his head sticking up in every direction and his long tongue hanging out the side of his mouth where a few teeth are missing.</p><p>I look from Capone to Wes and see his eyes are on me, and there is something in his eyes that causes my lungs to freeze.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d he says in a tone that is so deep that the space between my legs tingles and the breath I was holding whooshes out.</p> <p>\u201cThree what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree times you\u2019ve fucked with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapone is a badass,\u201d I insist, and his hand runs over his mouth and his eyes travel leisurely over me from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cThree times you\u2019ve made me want to fuck you or fill that smart mouth of yours.\u201d He steps towards me, his body pressing me into the wall behind me, and his large hand takes hold of my waist. I get lost in his eyes and words for a moment, but then I remember where we are and who he is. His head dips towards mine, and I do the only thing I can think of\u2014I cover my mouth with my hand.</p><p>His head pulls back and his eyes search my face as his brows pull together. \u201cThat\u2019s a first,\u201d he mumbles, but doesn\u2019t exactly sound disappointed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to kiss me?\u201d he questions, running his nose over the back of my hand that\u2019s still protecting my mouth. My mind screams, \u201cYes!\u201d but my head shakes no.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet.\u201d He skims his nose along my hand until he brushes my ear. \u201cBet once I\u2019m in there, I won\u2019t want to leave,\u201d he murmurs, and I swallow hard, fighting the instinct to remove my hand, turn my head, and kiss him like my body is begging me to. \u201cBet you\u2019d go wild for me the minute my hands were on you.\u201d The fingers of his hand at my side press in. \u201cBet you want it as badly as I do.\u201d</p> <p>He inhales at my neck and his tongue touches the skin behind my ear, making my knees actually shake. I have been in love; I\u2019ve been in lust too, but this is something new, something that makes me feel like every cell in my body is fighting to pull me closer to him, and that scares the shit out of me. I duck down and slide under his arm then walk backwards until there\u2019s at least twelve feet between us. Only then do I remove my hand from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you say? Do you want to adopt Capone?\u201d I ask, ignoring whatever the hell it was that just happened.</p><p>His brow that was furrowed after I stepped out of his embrace smooths out and he smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll take him,\u201d he says, looking at Capone then me.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I whisper as my heart flutters in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI still need a guard dog, but I\u2019ll take him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need a guard dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a shop, and around back, there\u2019s a lot with cars. The last couple weeks, someone\u2019s jumped the fence and broken into cars, stealing stereos or other parts out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave a dog outside.\u201d I frown at him.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say I was going to. You can even come check it out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d I mutter as he smirks.</p><p>\u201cSo do you have another dog? One that is actually dangerous?\u201d he asks, and I frown.</p><p>\u201cDogs are not dangerous. Stupid dog owners are dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...do you have a dog that\u2019s protective?\u201d He shakes his head, and I let out a breath then lead him to the back of the shelter, where Max is kept. Max was the only dog from the fighting ring that I was able to save. He is blind out of one eye and mean, but I love him and just couldn\u2019t bring myself to put him to sleep.</p><p>\u201cThis is Max.\u201d I crouch down in front of Max\u2019s cage and press my hand through the bars, rubbing his dark head.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Wes asks, crouching down next to me. I expect Max to growl, but he just looks at Wes then me. Wes slowly presses a finger through the cage, and Max starts licking him, making my heart feel lighter. I hate that Max is here and stuck in a kennel all the time.</p><p>\u201cHe was here one morning when I got into work. He was almost dead, his eye was missing, and he couldn\u2019t walk. I realized then that he had been fought and obviously lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally when dogs are fought, they kill them for losing,\u201d he tells me, something that causes tears to pool in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper, petting Max\u2019s head. \u201cHe was the first to be brought to me, but every few days, I get to work and there\u2019s another. Max is the only one I have been able to save.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I stand up, walk over to one of the visiting rooms, and open the door. \u201cWait in here. I\u2019ll bring Max in so we can make sure you guys get along,\u201d I tell him. I wait until he\u2019s in the room then shut the door and get Max, taking him into the room with me.</p><p>\u201cHey, bud,\u201d Wes mutters, petting Max\u2019s head when he comes to sit in front of him.</p><p>I watch them for a few minutes, and then ask, \u201cDo you want to see how he and Capone get along, or were you just saying you wanted them both in order to earn brownie points?\u201d</p><p>His head tilts back to look at me. \u201cGo get Capone, babe. I need to make sure my boys are cool,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d I mumble and head out of the room.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In front of Capone\u2019s kennel, I jump up and down, shaking out my hands. He watches silently, while the rest of the dogs go crazy. I make sure Capone is on his leash as I lead him into the room, where he meets Wes and Max. Max sits nicely, while Capone sniffs around before jumping up to sit on Wes\u2019 lap.</p><p>\u201cYou guys look good together.\u201d I smile at the image, reach into my back pocket, and grab my phone. I slide up the camera, taking a picture before I can think better of it. My head bends and I look at the photo, not quiet sure what the feeling in my stomach means.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>My head flies up and my gaze collides with his. I have read a lot, and I do mean a lot of biker books, and not once has a biker taken a girl out to dinner. \u201cUm...\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI know a great Mexican spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMexican?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cOr if you want something else...\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI like Mexican.\u201d I clear my throat and look at Max and Capone.</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p> <p>I look at him again, and he has one hand on Capone and the other on Max, two guys I believed would be forced to live out the rest of their lives in cages. He\u2019s saving them, so that tells me a lot more than knowing him for weeks could.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree, then move away from the bench when he stands. \u201cLet\u2019s get you guys out of here.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long to fill out the necessary paperwork, and when it\u2019s done, I help him get both boys into his Escalade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight,\u201d I confirm, watching him.</p><p>He swings up into his truck and shuts the door, pulling on a pair of sunglasses. His head dips towards me and I wave. The truck fits him as much as his bike does. He looked hot getting behind the wheel.</p> <p>I feel for my phone in my pocket, making sure it\u2019s still where he put it after he programed his number into it. I go inside and come to a complete stop when Kayan looks at me and smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, and she presses her lips together\u2014to keep from laughing, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I say, walking back into my office and shutting the door.</p><p>I have a date. I have a date with a hot biker who just adopted two dogs. Yeah, I was right in my last assessment of him. I\u2019m screwed.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>I look at myself in the mirror and turn from side to side, checking myself out. I have on a kimono jacket, and I\u2019ve paired it with a red tank and dark denim capris. I walk to my closet and pull out my beige wedges that wrap around my ankle and have a peep toe. I slip them on, tie them up and around my ankle, and then walk back to the bathroom. I apply some bronzer, a little blush, and a whole lot of mascara. I tease the top of my head and bend over, using some spray before flipping my head back over, pulling the bottom pieces down over the tops of my breasts.</p><p>I do not look like a biker\u2019s girl, but I do look cute.</p><p>I head out to my Jeep and toss my bag across the seat. It takes ten minutes to get to the restaurant that Wes asked me to meet him at, and when I arrive, the parking lot is packed with cars and tons of bikes. It\u2019s late spring, so the evenings are warm, and the whole outdoor patio is packed with diners wanting to eat outside under the stars. My phone starts to ring, and I answer it without checking who it is.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, the lot\u2019s full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know; there\u2019s no parking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you home and you can ride back with me,\u201d he says, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s smart. I\u2019m not sure I will be able to be pressed close to him with my thighs around his, my hands on his body.</p><p>\u201cBabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you.\u201d I turn around and see him straddling his bike with his cut over a plaid shirt in blues and blacks with the sleeves rolled up, the top buttons open enough to see the tank he has on under it, and a pair of jeans with his black boots.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper, and pull around the parking lot then onto the main road. He follows me the few minutes to my house, and I park in my driveway, getting out quickly and meeting him at the back of my car.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna get your helmet?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I look at my bag in my hand and realize that if I\u2019m riding with him, I need to lighten my load. \u201cBe right back,\u201d I mutter, opening the door to my car and bending across the seat to press the button for the garage.</p><p>\u201cBabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I turn to look over my shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, baby.\u201d</p><p>My stomach starts to turn, not with unease, but with excitement.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile with a shake of my head and go into my garage, pulling the stuff I need out of my purse and shoving it into my bra and pockets before carrying my helmet back out to where he\u2019s waiting.</p><p>\u201cYour car good?\u201d he asks, lifting his leg over the seat of his bike and taking my helmet from me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper as his smell surrounds me. His fingers tuck my hair behind my ears, and then he places the helmet over my head and hooks the button under my chin.</p><p>\u201cThat okay?\u201d he asks, and I nod as he tosses his leg over the seat once more. I\u2019ve ridden bikes since I was fifteen and begged my mom to teach me to ride. She and I both like riding sports bikes, but my uncles and cousins who ride like Harleys, so I know what I\u2019m doing. But I have never been on the back of a bike with a man I\u2019m attracted too. I slide on, and the moment my ass touches the seat, his hands go to the back of my calves, where he pulls me tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cHold me tight,\u201d he instructs, looking at me over his shoulder. I place my hands on his waist and squeeze him a little tighter as the bike takes off, which is a huge mistake, because I feel hardness like I\u2019ve never felt before right under my palms. I didn\u2019t even know abs were something that actually exist in real life. I try to keep still, even though my hands itch to press into him to see if what I think I\u2019m feeling is really real.</p><p>When we pull into the parking lot, I remove my hands quickly and get off the bike. I pull off my helmet and bend over, fluffing my hair before swinging my head back upright.</p><p>\u201cYou need to watch who\u2019s around when you do shit like that,\u201d Wes says taking ahold of my hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bending over, hair-flip shit you just did.\u201d I look at him and see that his eyes are pointing toward the outdoor eating area, where there is a group of guys all watching us. I ignore his comment and start walking into the restaurant, or try to, but his finger hooks into the back of my jeans and he pulls me into step with him. Then he wraps his hand around my waist, his fingers curling into my side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow many?\u201d a cute Spanish girl asks as soon as we enter the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Wes tells her, and she leads us to a booth near the bar and gives us our menus, telling us our waiter will be right with us.</p><p>My gaze connects with his, and I bite my lip and lift my menu up. The intimacy of being in the booth with him is causing me to suddenly feel nervous.</p><p>\u201cWes.\u201d</p> <p>I turn and look up at a guy who is wearing something similar to Wes, only he has on a red and blue plaid shirt, with his cut over it.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you?\u201d Wes shakes his hand and they begin to talk about something to do with bikes, or some crap I don\u2019t understand. I look at Wes, and I doubt he even remembers I\u2019m here at this point. I test my theory by saying, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d to the guy, and telling Wes I\u2019m going to use the restroom. His eyes don\u2019t even come to me when I speak. I slip out of the booth and go to the restroom then back to the table. The guy is still there and has now taken my seat, and they each have a beer in front of them. I stand there waiting for a few minutes, wanting to see if Wes realizes I\u2019m not there, but his eyes don\u2019t search the room for me.</p><p>\u201cScrew this,\u201d I whisper, suddenly feeling sorry for myself. I pull out my phone, call a cab, walk out to Wes\u2019 bike, and grab my helmet off the seat. It takes three minutes for the cab to show up, and the moment I slip into the back seat, my phone starts to ring. I click the end button, and do it again when it rings two more times. When we reach my house, I give the cabdriver a ten and tell him to keep the change.</p><p>I head up my walkway and into my house, when the roar of a motorcycle fills my ears. I go inside, close the door, take the stuff out of my pockets and bra, and set all of it on my entryway table. \u201cOpen the door, July. I know you\u2019re in there.\u201d Wes yells from outside but I ignore him and walk back to my bedroom, take off the kimono jacket and my heels, and walk back out to the living room, opening the door when he begins to pound so hard the pictures on my walls shake.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I raise a brow and his eyes narrow.</p> <p>\u201cYou wanna be a smartass after walking out on dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you\u2019re confused.\u201d I put on my biggest smile, open my screen door, and step out onto my front porch, shutting the door behind me. \u201cYou say I walked out on you, right?\u201d I ask, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he growls.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d I mutter, leaning back on the heels of my feet, looking him over. \u201cI sat across from you for fifteen minutes, got up from a table I was sitting at with you, and you didn\u2019t notice. I stood across the room from you for five minutes before I said \u2018Screw it\u2019, and left. I don\u2019t know what type of women you\u2019re used to, but I\u2019m not one of them. Good luck in life, Wes,\u201d I tell him, opening my door, stepping inside, and then closing and locking the door behind me.</p><p>I plop down on my couch for a minute and put my face in my hands. This was not how I expected my evening to turn out. After a few minutes, I stand and head for the kitchen, scooping up Juice on the way, letting his soft purrs sooth my wounded ego. Then I go to Taser and check on him before placing Juice on the counter, and pull down one of my large mixing bowls from one cupboard and a box of Fruity Pebbles out of another. I fill the bowl half-full and go to the fridge to get milk, and pour some on top of the cereal. I grab a spoon from my cute holder on my counter and take the bowl with me, heading towards my bedroom, when there is another knock on my door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, wrapping my arm around the bowl of cereal as I open the door.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating that. I ordered pizza,\u201d Wes says as soon as he spots my Fruity Pebbles.</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d I ask him as he pushes past me into my house, taking the bowl out of my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, and don\u2019t do that shit again, unless you want a red ass,\u201d he says, and I ignore his comment and follow behind him. \u201cSean had some information I needed, so I didn\u2019t even think; I just went into work mode.\u201d He walks into my kitchen, sets my bowl of cereal in the sink, and turns the water on.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just do that,\u201d I hiss, watching my favorite food in the whole world literally go down the drain.</p><p>\u201cI ordered us pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear the part where I said \u2018have a nice life\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignoring that, \u2019cause I know you\u2019re pissed, but I also know you\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it?\u201d I breathe out, watching as he takes off his cut and places it over the back of one of my kitchen chairs.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re not like any woman I\u2019ve been with before.\u201d He runs a hand over his jaw, and I notice he didn\u2019t say \u2018dated\u2019.</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d I shake my head, crossing my arms over my chest, and his lips twitch.</p><p>\u201cI also know that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m pursuing you. I can get pussy anytime I want. But a woman I see myself having a future with,\u201d he shakes his head, \u201cnever had that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...I just met you, and I hate to be the one to bust your little bubble, but you\u2019re not someone I see myself having a future with. I can\u2019t even see us having a second date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he mutters, walking over to Taser\u2019s cage.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t see. You need to leave.\u201d I pick up his cut and head towards the door, hoping he\u2019ll follow but when I open the door, the pizza delivery guy is standing there with his hand in air, ready to knock. Crap. I step back as Wes comes to stand in front of me, talking to the delivery guy.</p><p>\u201cBabe, take this into the kitchen while I pay for it,\u201d he tells me, handing me the pizza box and pulling his wallet out of his back pocket.</p><p>I stand there for a moment, looking at him like he\u2019s insane, but then stupidly walk the pizza back to my kitchen, setting it down on my counter. Then I put his cut on the back of my chair again and stand there in the kitchen with my arms crossed over my chest as I wait for him.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna get plates?\u201d he asks, walking around the corner.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to remind you that I went out to dinner with you, but you ignored me,\u201d I say haughtily.</p><p>\u201cTold you it was business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you believe in second chances. Most people, especially a vet, would take one look at Capone and Max and put them to sleep, but you didn\u2019t do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was a low blow. I look at him, and my gut is telling me to do it, to give him a second chance, but my brain is screaming at me, telling me that if I do it, then it will be the end of life as I know it.</p><p>\u201cWe can be friends,\u201d I compromise, and he grins.</p><p>\u201cSure, baby. Friends,\u201d he mutters then steps closer to me, and I cover my mouth again when I see his eyes drop to my lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t kiss you until you\u2019re begging me to,\u201d he says, and I scoff, take a step back, reach up with my free hand, and open the cupboard that holds my plates. I pull two down and shove them at him, and then remove my hand from my mouth when I open the fridge to grab two beers.</p><p>He opens the box of pizza, and the smell filters to my nose, causing my stomach to growl. \u201cEwww, you got Hawaiian and supreme.\u201d I scrunch up my nose. His eyes come to me and he blinks as I press my lips together to keep from smiling.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass,\u201d he mutters, shaking his head and smiling as he slides a slice of each on a plate and hands it to me, then does the same for himself. I walk back to the living room, and he comes with me, setting his plate and beer on the coffee table and looking around. \u201cWhere\u2019s your TV?\u201d he asks, confused.</p><p>\u201cIn my bedroom,\u201d I tell him, taking a bite of pizza.</p><p>\u201cYou only have one TV?\u201d He frowns, and I frown back.</p><p>\u201cYes, why? How many TVs do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple.\u201d He shrugs.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m home, I usually hang out in my room,\u201d I tell him, watching as he takes a bite of pizza. How can eating be sexy? I think, and then realize I forgot napkins, and I will definitely need them. I set down my plate, get up, and go to the kitchen, grabbing some paper towels off the roll before coming back and handing one to him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he mumbles, taking a drink of beer.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d I ask, sitting back on the couch and pulling my feet up under me.</p><p>\u201cMe and a few of my brothers have a parts store and bike shop.\u201d He says then wipes his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBrothers, like brothers, or brothers, like \u2018This is my brother\u2019?\u201d I ask, doing a fist bump in the air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the same.\u201d He smiles. \u201cWe were all in the military together, and when we got out a couple years ago, we decided to settle down and start a business together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d I murmur, taking a drink of my beer then pulling the crust off my pizza before finishing it off.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? How long have you been a vet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he questions, and I feel my skin heat as his eyes roam over me.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six.\u201d I shrug then continue when he looks at me doubtfully. \u201cI graduated high school at seventeen then started college right away. I knew I wanted to be a veterinarian since I was a little girl, so I worked extra hard until I got my wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, and my heart squeezes painfully in my chest.</p><p>\u201cWe had a dog growing up, and his name was Beast. He was a black and white Great Dane, but to me, he was my best friend. When he got older and became sick, I knew one day I wanted to be able to help other people who loved their animals as much as I loved Beast,\u201d I whisper, taking another sip of beer, hoping it will help wash away the pain of talking about my best friend.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you don\u2019t have a dog now?\u201d he asks, reading me, and I nod.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to replace him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d he says gently, setting his empty plate and beer on the table.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I ask, setting my own plate down but keeping my beer in hand.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-nine. So how long have you been riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was fifteen. My mom is actually the one who taught me to ride. My dad hates it, but knows he can\u2019t stop me. It was one of my mom\u2019s hobbies, and something that only she and I share, so it makes it that much more special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have brothers and sisters?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI have four sisters, all younger, all in college.\u201d I smile. \u201cWhat about you? Any siblings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m an only child, raised by a single mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up in Tennessee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom lives in Nashville, and when I came out to visit her, I drove through this town and liked the feel of it, so I talked to my boys and we packed up, got on our bikes, and drove out here from California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been scary, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us had anything to lose,\u201d he says, and I try to think of something else to say then look around my living room, wondering why the hell I didn\u2019t just buy another TV.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go to bed with me?\u201d I ask then cover my mouth and feel my eyes grow large.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He smiles, and I cover my face.</p><p>\u201cI mean do you want to watch TV with me?\u201d I say peeking out from behind my hands.</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d He chuckles, and I feel his hand on my knee. I remove my hands from my face and look at him, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cLet me just clean this stuff up,\u201d I mutter, standing and grabbing my plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he says, picking up his plate and taking mine from me, so I pick up his beer bottle and follow him into the kitchen, watching the way his ass moves as he walks. \u201cAre you checking out my ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I smile, walking past him to the garbage can.</p><p>\u201cPain in the ass,\u201d he mutters, but I hear the smile in his voice. \u201cYou kept the bird,\u201d he says, standing in front of Taser\u2019s cage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he probably won\u2019t be able to fly again. His wing didn\u2019t heal like it was supposed to.\u201d I smile when Taser tweets at Wes as he sticks his finger into the cage. \u201cDo you want another beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He nods, and I open one for him and another for myself then lead him back into my bedroom. I set my beer on my nightstand before climbing up on my bed. I watch as he walks around to the other side, his presence making my room feel small. My insides start to twist thinking about how my ex-boyfriend was allergic to cats, so we always spent time at his house, and the only guys who have been in my room since I moved here are my cousins.</p><p>I try to see what he sees as he takes in my room. I painted the walls a light blue that matches an antique chair I set in the corner of the room. My dressers and night stands are all antiques, as well as being all different in design, the old cream paint chipping and peeling, giving them character. My bedding is ruffled white duvet that covers the large down comforter I have inside it. You can tell it\u2019s a girl\u2019s room, but it isn\u2019t covered in pink flowers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch as he slips off his boots then slides onto the bed, sitting back against the headboard and crossing his ankles. I let out a breath and flipped on the TV, and Juice decides to come out of hiding, jumping up on the bed and climbing into my lap.</p><p>\u201cDo you like cats?\u201d I ask Wes while running my fingers through Juice\u2019s soft fur.</p><p>His eyes come to me, and I see something flash within their green depths before he replies, \u201cI love pussy.\u201d</p><p>I start to giggle and bury my face in Juice\u2019s fur. I hear Wes chuckle, and I shake my head and hand him the remote, not knowing what he likes to watch. \u201cYou can pick whatever,\u201d I tell him, curling up on my side with Juice curled into my belly.</p> <p>He flips through the channels for a few minutes then stops on the movie Back to the Future. He leans back farther, putting his hand behind his head and resting the one holding the remote on his abs. The urge to scoot closer to him is almost painful, but I keep myself still, making sure to keep my breathing normal.</p><p>\u201cSo...can we at least cuddle?\u201d he asks, and I tilt my head back to look at him then without thinking I move Juice and scoot over to him, and his eyes get wide. He shakes his head and holds his arm up, and I lay my head on his chest. Both my hands pillow under my cheek while I pull my knees up, tucking them against his side.</p><p>\u201cThat was easy,\u201d he mumbles, wrapping his arm around me.</p><p>What can I say? I\u2019m a girl; I like to cuddle. And no one in their right mind would turn him down if he asked them.</p><p>\u201cBabe.\u201d I hear Wes say but I\u2019m so comfy that I don\u2019t want to open my eyes or move.</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cI gotta head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cBabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whine, and he starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta come lock up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need to lock up,\u201d I grumble.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I open one eye and look at him. \u201cCome on.\u201d He pulls me out of bed and sets me on my feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up.\u201d I yawn, stumbling out of the room and to the front door. I open it for him while he goes to the kitchen, gets his cut, and slips it on over his shirt then comes toward me and I cover my mouth, making him smile.</p><p>\u201cI stole a kiss while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d I say as he stops in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI told you I won\u2019t kiss you until you beg me to.\u201d I pull my hand away from my mouth, and bite my lip when my eyes drop to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the pizza, Wes,\u201d I tell him as my gaze travels back up to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I nod, and he leans in and presses a kiss to my forehead that catches me off-guard.</p><p>\u201cLock the door,\u201d he says over his shoulder, and I roll my eyes then open them wide when something I hadn\u2019t even thought about clicks into place.</p><p>I have grown up around crazy-ass alpha men my whole life, men like my dad and uncles, and as I watch Wes walk to his bike, I know the kind of man he is.</p><p>\u201cBabe, lock up,\u201d he shouts, swinging onto his bike. I slam the door shut, lock both locks, go to the blinds, and peek out as he pulls away.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d I whisper as he drives out of sight.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d I ask Jax as I open the front door.</p><p>\u201cI need to use your shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask, seeing that he\u2019s carrying a large bag in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWater heater went out and I don\u2019t have time to wait for the repair guy to come look at it before I have to be somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well you know where it is.\u201d I swing my arm out for him to enter, and then I go to my kitchen and start a pot of coffee, set out food for Juice, and clean Taser\u2019s cage. Once my coffee is done, I take my cup out to my back deck along with my Kindle and start to read.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d I hear roared through the glass of my sliding door, and I get up, quickly setting my stuff on the table, slide the door open then make my way to my living room, where Wes is standing in the doorway with Jax, standing in front of him, wearing nothing but a towel around his waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Jax asks Wes instead of answering, and I step into the mix, push my cousin back, and stand in front of Wes.</p><p>\u201cYou go finish showering,\u201d I tell Jax, shoving him away.</p><p>\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d Wes snarls, and I wait glaring at Jax until I see him go back into the bathroom before I face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask then look down and see that he\u2019s juggling two cups of coffee and a bag, and my heart melts, because he brought me breakfast.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here? Are you fucking kidding me?\u201d My head flies up and my eyes meet his. \u201cI left you last night, and you already have Jax Mayson in your house, showering? Now you\u2019re asking what I\u2019m doing here?\u201d</p><p>His words punch me in the gut as his eyes roam over me in my long shirt that hides the boxers I have on. He shakes his head and mutters, \u201cBitches,\u201d as he walks off.</p><p>I stand there for a second as my stomach crawls up my throat, and watch as he opens the door to his truck. My mind is reeling from what he just said.</p><p>\u201cYou said his name\u2019s Jax Mayson, right?\u201d I shout, and he looks at me then shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, you fucking asshole, my name is July Mayson. He\u2019s my cousin, and you\u2019re a fucking scumbag,\u201d I yell then slam the door shut and stomp down the hall to my bedroom, getting my scrubs on quickly, and then my shoes. I don\u2019t even bother with makeup. I just tie my hair back into a ponytail, walk to the guest bath, and knock on the door, calling to Jax that I\u2019m leaving and to lock up.</p><p>I grab my bag, stomp out to my garage, pull on my helmet, and shove my purse under the seat. I put on my helmet and press the remote for the garage. I get on my bike start it up then pull out of the garage, noticing that Wes is still sitting in my driveway. I close my garage, shove the remote in my pocket then flip him off while simultaneously trying to kill him with the lasers I can feel coming out of my eyes.</p><p>When I get to work, I look at my phone and see that Wes has called every few minutes since I left my house. I turn off the stupid thing and head to the building. The moment I get to the front door, I see a large black mass in front of the double doors and my heart instantly sinks, because I know exactly what it is. I have already had such a horrible day; this just makes it worse.</p><p>\u201cHey, guy,\u201d I whisper, crouching down in front of the dog that is bleeding from his mouth and ears. His head barely lifts then drops to the ground again and his eyes close. I scoot closer and can see that his breaths are few and far between, and the blood coming from his nose tells me he\u2019s not going to make it. I head around the back of the building, go through the back door, drop off my bag, and get a small stretcher. Carrying it out front, I carefully get him on it before taking him inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d Kayan asks as I check him over, seeing if there is anything I can do to save him before I unwillingly put him to sleep.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whisper as I force myself to accept there is nothing I can do. Tears begin to fill my eyes, but I fight them back and do my job, making sure he\u2019s comfortable before I give him the injection that will help him go to sleep and never wake up again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call your uncle and have him come out?\u201d Kayan asks as we walk toward reception.</p><p>\u201cNo, I called. He\u2019s checking the cameras he set up. He said he\u2019ll stop by at some point today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks, looking me over.</p><p>I let out a long breath then tell her what happened with Wes last night and this morning. The more I talk, the bigger her mouth opens, and by the time I\u2019m done, her jaw is almost hitting the floor.</p><p>\u201cSo, no, I\u2019m not really okay,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI bet not,\u201d she mumbles then sits back in her seat. \u201cSo you really didn\u2019t kiss him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head and laugh when she whispers, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a jerk, and I\u2019m glad I found out now, rather than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nods then her eyes get glossy. \u201cSo what does Jax look like wearing nothing but a towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know he\u2019s my cousin, right?\u201d I frown at her.</p><p>\u201cYour cousin is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d I roll my eyes then walk down the hall, yelling that I\u2019ll be in the back.</p> <p>\u201cSo did you see anything on the video?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, kiddo,\u201d my uncle Nico says on a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I should do,\u201d I mumble. Watching the video that he had pulled up, the only thing you see is taillights then the image of someone wearing jeans and a black hoodie carrying the dog and setting him down in front of the double doors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, but a plan starts forming in my head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it worked out, kiddo.\u201d He gives me a hug and I hug him back then walk him out front and watch him pull away in his truck. Then I go over to where Kayan is still looking out the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really hot for an old dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stop lusting over my family members?\u201d I laugh.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She smiles then her face goes serious. \u201cSo did he tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada, but I have an idea. How do you feel about having a stakeout with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stakeout?\u201d Her eyes flash and a smile spreads across her face, making her already beautiful features striking. \u201cHell yes, I\u2019m down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll start tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Tonight, we can go shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping for what?\u201d I ask, and she looks at me like I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cWe need gear. We need black clothes and a camera, maybe some kind of device that lets us know when someone is coming. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019m thinking the police supply store will have some stuff we can use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted us to sit in my jeep and wait until someone came.\u201d I frown, and she lets out a huff of air.</p><p>\u201cYou have so much to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where did you get your stakeout knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTV.\u201d She shrugs then looks to the left when the bell over the door goes off. \u201cUh oh,\u201d she whispers as Wes walks in.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d he asks as his eyes come to me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, do you have an appointment?\u201d I ask, tilting my head to the side, studying him.</p><p>His eyes go to Kayan and he bends slightly over the desk. He takes the calendar that\u2019s in front of her and looks at it then pulls a pen from the jar that sits on the upper ledge and writes his name in one of the boxes.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I have an appointment.\u201d He sets the calendar down.</p><p>\u201cGreat, follow me,\u201d I mumble, leading him back toward one of the exam rooms. Once we\u2019re inside, I go to the opposite side of the counter from him. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Silver?\u201d I raise an eyebrow, using his last name I learned yesterday when we filled out paperwork.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He runs a hand over his head then down his jaw, which is covered in stubble that makes me want to rub up against him.</p><p>No, you don\u2019t want to rub against him, I remind myself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have all day,\u201d I say, making a point to look at the clock.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have jumped to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came over wanting to see you, and Jax answered the door in a fucking towel, then you in only a shirt. I saw red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had shorts on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had shorts on under my shirt,\u201d I tell him then wonder why, because it seriously does not matter at all.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d he asks, and I see he\u2019s sincere. I\u2019m sure it looked that way to him, and I\u2019m still pissed, but at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, apology accepted.\u201d I stick out my hand and he looks down at it, his frown lines growing deeper.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he whispers, and his gaze comes up to lock on mine again.</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s all, I really need to get to work.\u201d I walk to the door and open it up. \u201cSee you around, Wes.\u201d I walk out then head to one of the other exam rooms. I hear Kayan talking as I wait behind the closed door until I hear the front door alarm go off, letting me know he\u2019s gone. Only then do I head back out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSo, your biker dude just ruined my whole calendar,\u201d Kayan grumbles, and I peek over the counter to see what she\u2019s talking about, and everyday at noon, it says \u2018Lunch with Wes\u2019.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d I tell her, and she looks at me doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispers, looking down at the paper, but I can still see the smirk on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a tall drink of hot biker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I mumble as disappointment floats through my system. Wes was hot and edgy, and obviously a man with issues, so sadly, we were never going to explore things, but that didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t wish things had turned out differently.</p><p>\u201cYour two o\u2019clock is here.\u201d Kayan says and I come out of my daze mutter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Then smile at my patient\u2019s family before kneeling down to greet Cloyed a very hyper Yorkie who makes me wish that men were as easy to understand as dogs.</p><p>The rest of the day passes quickly between patients and back work that I have to catch up on. I don\u2019t leave the building until it\u2019s dark outside, leaving Kayan to go shopping alone, which I regret the next evening when she shows me what she picked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing that.\u201d I look at the black full bodysuit that Kayan just pulled out of the bag she set on my bed.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d She smiles then walks to the bathroom and comes back a few minutes later wearing a matching black bodysuit that is unzipped, showing cleavage, and a pair of black boots that go to her knee, with three-inch heels. Her black hair is up in a high ponytail, and she has put black smudges under her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, go get dressed.\u201d She pushes me toward the bathroom, and I go unwillingly then frown when I put on the outfit. I have no idea how I let her talk me into this. I leave my hair down. The bodysuit shows off every single curve and dimple of cellulite that I have. I don\u2019t have a choice but to leave the top unzipped, because my breasts are so large the zipper is likely to bust. When I come out, she\u2019s in my closet and she comes out with a pair of boots I wore once for Halloween. They are basically stripper boots that are shiny and have five-inch heels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this.\u201d I frown.</p><p>\u201cWe need to blend in,\u201d she tells me, and my frown grows deeper.</p><p>\u201cBlend in where? At the strip club?\u201d I ask, and she laughs, handing me the boots that I reluctantly put on.</p><p>We get in my Jeep and go over to the office, and we park off in the distance where it\u2019s completely dark. It\u2019s after ten at night, and from the video footage timestamp, I know whoever dropped the last dog off had done it after midnight.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask as Kayan pulls a bag from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cSupplies,\u201d she mumbles distractedly and begins pulling items out. The first is a camera that she sets on the dash. Next is a pair of walkie-talkies that she sets next to the camera, and then a thermos and a box of powdered doughnuts that she holds in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re taking this too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy at the cop store didn\u2019t even let me get everything I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get one of those things you roll out to blow out tires, but he told me I needed to be a cop in order to buy them, along with smoke bombs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I look at her and she smiles.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be so much fun,\u201d she whispers, and I shake my head and look out the front window. At one o\u2019clock I\u2019m just about ready to give up and go home, when lights flash and a car pulls into the parking lot. I tap Kayan, who had fallen asleep after eating the whole box of doughnuts while drinking the thermos of hot cocoa.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she mumbles, and I elbow her again.</p><p>Her head comes up as I hiss, \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d she whispers, pulling the camera off the dash.</p><p>I pull out my phone and call one of the vets, Mark, who has been working with me over the last few months. I tell him he needs to get to my office and take care of the dog that was just dropped off, and to call the vet tech on call. He agrees, and I watch as the person drops the dog at the door then gets back in the truck.</p><p>Everything in me wants to go to the poor dog, but I know there will be someone coming to help him soon so that I can follow the truck. I need to see if I can find out any more information. When the person gets back in the truck and pulls off, I make sure my headlights are off before I start up the Jeep and follow him out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI wonder where he\u2019s going,\u201d I say as we head out of town on one of the back roads.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d she mumbles, watching the truck in the distance, which pulls into a large parking lot that is packed with cars. That\u2019s when I remember it\u2019s a Friday night. I pull in and park a few spaces behind him then wait until the driver gets out before I open the door to my Jeep. I watch him, taking in what he\u2019s wearing so that I know what to look for if we lose sight of him inside.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m firing you on Monday,\u201d I tell Kayan as I realize the outfit I have on.</p><p>\u201cYou look smoking hot,\u201d she whispers, but I can tell she\u2019s nervous as well.</p><p>I shake my head, slam the door, and head into the building. The moment we walk though the door, the loud country music hits my ears. I follow the guy toward the bar, feeling every single person in the bar looking at Kayan and me. Hell, if I were them, I would be looking too. It\u2019s not everyday you see two chicks dressed like cat-women walk into a country western bar.</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s in back, bud,\u201d the bartender tells the guy we followed here. He looks probably twenty-five. He takes his hat off and runs his hand over his hair then gets up and starts walking toward the back of the bar. I start to follow him, when an arm bands around my waist and breath whispers against my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going, pretty girl?\u201d</p><p>I elbow the guy holding me then back up, grabbing Kayan\u2019s hand and pulling her with me toward the restrooms saying. \u201cYou\u2019re really getting fired.\u201d As my gaze connects with Wes\u2019, who is standing near a pool table talking to some guy, his eyes sweep over me, and even from across the room, I can see anger enter his handsome features.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Kayan whispers, and I remind myself to start looking for a new receptionist and best friend on Monday after I have a full-face transplant.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said run!\u201d I cry, and we both turn and start toward the front of the bar. We get down the hall, almost to freedom when I\u2019m suddenly pulled back into a hard body.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing?\u201d is growled near my ear, making my whole body shiver.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask, trying to get away.</p><p>\u201cZ, watch her,\u201d Wes tells a tall guy with a bald head and tattoos that run from his neck and down his arms, which you can see from the white tank and leather vest he has on. His arm muscles look even more intimidating as he stands, crossing his arms over his chest while looking down at my very petite best friend.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary; we were just leaving,\u201d I say as I\u2019m walked backwards into the men\u2019s restroom through a swinging door.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Wes growls to some guys who are standing near the urinals. They all look between Wes and me, zip up their pants quickly, and then rush out of the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was rude,\u201d I mutter, then my breath comes out in a whoosh as my body is pressed into the wall behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, July?\u201d he rumbles.</p><p>I feel the vibration of his words against my chest as he speaks, and I ignore the butterflies that have erupted in my stomach since seeing him. \u201cI wanted to learn how to line dance?\u201d My answer sounds more like a question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d He presses deeper into me, and I can feel every hard inch of him through the thin material of the bodysuit I have on. I hold my breath and squeeze my eyes closed, trying to get my body back under control. \u201cThere are some fucked up guys here right now, babe, and you can\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and search his face. \u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d I ask, and his eyes sweep over me as he mutters, \u201cYes,\u201d making my insides turn liquid.</p><p>\u201cWes, you\u2019re too close,\u201d I whimper, feeling like his presence is suffocating me.</p><p>\u201cNot close enough, baby,\u201d he whispers back as his hands framing my waist press in deeper and his erection presses into my belly.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I moan as his face lowers and his mouth hovers over mine, his breath brushes across my lips, making me crave him in a way I never, ever thought possible.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I tell him, closing my eyes, and after a long moment, I open them back up and meet his eyes when I realize that he didn\u2019t kiss me like I expected him to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna walk you out to your car. I want you to go right home, and don\u2019t ever come back here again,\u201d he tells me, placing his forehead to mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, babe, you need to swear to me that you will never come back here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He pulls me with him and leads me back out of the bathroom. Kayan is leaning against the wall, looking at the floor, while biker guy \u2018Z\u2019 stands blocking her from everyone\u2019s sight.</p><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d I tell Z when I realize he\u2019s the guy who picked me up like I was as light as a feather the day I tasered Wes. He grins then looks at Wes and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the girls out of here, and then we\u2019ll come back and finish up,\u201d Wes states.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Z mutters, wrapping a hand around a struggling Kayan\u2019s waist and walking in front of us out of the bar. I try prying Wes\u2019 fingers off my waist as we walk, but he only holds me tighter. My legs work double-time in the boots I have on to keep up with him, and I let out a relieved sigh once we reach my Jeep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as shy as a kitten. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had shy in my bed,\u201d I hear Z say as we get into the Jeep. I look over at Kayan, who has her eyes pointed at her lap, but I can see there is dark blush covering her cheeks. \u201cBe good, Kitten,\u201d Z rumbles, shutting her door. I start to shut my own door, when a body cages me into my seat.</p><p>\u201cStraight home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight home,\u201d I repeat then lick my lips when I realize how close his mouth is.</p><p>\u201cWe have some shit to work out, but I\u2019ll get in there,\u201d he tells me. My eyes flutter up to meet his, and my heart starts to pound when I see the promise in his eyes. His head dips to the side and his lips brush my ear, making my core convulse. \u201cBe good.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head as my voice box closes up. He backs up and slams my door. I start up my Jeep and pull out of the lot then look over at Kayan when I\u2019m at the stop sign. When her eyes meet mine, a smile alights her face.</p><p>\u201cThat was scary, but oh, my God,\u201d she breathes out, making me giggle.</p> <p>\u201cNo more stakeouts,\u201d I tell her, and she smiles and whispers, \u201cNo more stakeouts.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>I call Mark on the way back to town, and he tells me he wasn\u2019t able to save the dog that was dropped off. My heart breaks yet again for another dog. I vow then that I will get to the bottom of what\u2019s happening, if it\u2019s the last thing I do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Monday,\u201d Kayan mumbles solemnly when we pull up in front of my house since I got off the phone with Mark, the energy in the car has changed.</p><p>\u201cSee you Monday,\u201d I tell her, shutting down my car and heading toward the house. I watch her pull away before heading inside and closing the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Juice.\u201d I pick him up off the small table and press my face into his fur while I walk into the back bedroom. I dump him onto my bed then pull off the heels and bodysuit before finding an old t-shirt and getting into bed.</p><p>I lay there for a long time looking at the ceiling and just as I\u2019m about to fall asleep, there is a pounding on my front door, and I hear Wes yell, \u201cOpen up!\u201d I stumble out of my room and go to the front door to see that he\u2019s standing there with Z, who has his arm around Wes\u2019 shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask sleepily.</p><p>\u201cHe got shot.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go to Z then get big when I see he\u2019s holding a towel to his shoulder and there is blood soaking through. \u201cYou need to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes, I\u2019m a vet, not a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Z grumbles, and Wes gently presses a hand into my belly and pushes me out of the way as he walks into the house and helps him get seated in one of my white kitchen chairs that creaks like it\u2019s going to give out under his weight.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Wes comes and stands in front of me, and his palms hold my face gently as he nudges my cheek so that my eyes focus on his and not Z. \u201cI need you to help him. The wound is clean through, so all you need to do is sew it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d I whisper, looking away from him to Z.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d I do, and his face lowers toward mine. \u201cI need your help, baby.\u201d</p><p>I search his face and whisper, \u201cOkay,\u201d then clear my throat. \u201cI need to go to the clinic and get supplies. I don\u2019t have anything here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you stay with him. I\u2019ll go and be back quickly.\u201d I go to my room and get on a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, and a pair of sneakers. I walk past the guys, head out of my garage, and open the door, and that\u2019s when I see that I\u2019m blocked in by Wes\u2019 SUV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving you,\u201d Wes says, stepping out into the garage. He takes my hand, leads me to the passenger side of his truck, and helps me inside before jogging around to his side. It takes less then five minutes to get to the clinic, and by the time we arrive, my body is shaking with nervous energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve never done any kind of stitching on a human patient before, or been around anyone who had ever gotten shot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Wes tells me, placing a hand on my lower back as I open the back door. I go right to the supply room and gather the necessary provisions into a shopping bag before locking the building back up and heading to my house. When we arrive, Z is sitting at the table still, but he now has the bottle of Jack my sister June and I bought when she was home visiting from college.</p><p>\u201cYou better not neuter me, girl.\u201d Z smiles, and his words make some of the anxiety that I was feeling leave and a laugh to bubble out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou probably need to be neutered,\u201d I tell him, and he grins then eyes the stuff I begin to set out on the table.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask how this happened?\u201d I question softly, pulling the towel away from his shoulder and looking at the wound.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wes says, pulling out a chair and taking a seat.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I have the right to know, when you show up at my house in the early hours of the morning, asking me to stitch up a guy with a gunshot wound, while refusing to take him to the hospital?\u201d I narrow my eyes on him, and he doesn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>\u201cNothing you need to worry about.\u201d He looks at Z, and I see some kind of silent conversation happening between the two of them, which pisses me off.</p><p>I dump some alcohol onto a piece of gauze and begin wiping down the wound as I look at Wes. \u201cThis is the last time I see you,\u201d I tell him, even though the words leave a nasty taste in my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cYou already know that\u2019s not happening, July,\u201d he says as his jaw clenches tight.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, getting a new piece of gauze so I can clean the backside of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know twice you\u2019ve called me a bitch without cause.\u201d I shake my head then turn it so my gaze connects with his. \u201cI know you made me feel like crap when you found my cousin in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I cut him off before he can say anything. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask; you just jumped to conclusions.\u201d I finish cleaning Z\u2019s wound then look at Wes again. \u201cThen you show up at my house and ask me to do you a favor, refusing to tell me anything. So, yes, this is the last time we see each other. I think it\u2019s obvious we have no reason to stay in contact,\u201d I mutter the last part then frown when I see Z is smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucked, brother,\u201d he mumbles, looking at Wes. I ignore them both and start to thread up the needle. It doesn\u2019t take long to get the wound closed up, and I\u2019m surprised that Z doesn\u2019t even flinch as I work on him. By the time I\u2019m done putting a bandage over the wound, the sun is beginning to rise, casting an orange glow throughout the room, and my eyes are so heavy I can barely keep them open.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, girly,\u201d Z rumbles, standing up.</p><p>I sway on my feet in front of him, and a hand slides around my waist and Wes leads me back toward my bedroom. \u201cGo wash up and go to bed, babe. I\u2019ll clean the mess up.\u201d I nod, not even caring. At this point, my body is completely exhausted. I\u2019m running on empty, and not even coffee could help me now.</p><p>I go into my bathroom and take a quick shower then put on my robe from the back of my bathroom door, not even bothering with clothes, and climb into bed, where I immediately fall asleep.</p><p>I wake up to the smell of bacon, and roll to my side, coming face-to-face with Capone, who is looking at me with his tongue hanging out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I sit up and look at the clock, seeing it\u2019s after three in the afternoon, and then look around the room, making sure I didn\u2019t just dream that I came home last night.</p><p>Capone climbs into my lap and licks my cheek then jumps off the bed and leaves out of the small gap in the door.</p><p>I stand up, tie my robe tighter around me, open my bedroom door, and head through my living room. Coming around the corner into my kitchen, I stop dead when I see a shirtless Wes standing in front of the stove, wearing only a pair of jeans and necklaces that hangs between his pecs, with a cross and dog tag on it. I blink, trying to clear my head as my body reacts to the way he looks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p> <p>I lift my eyes and take in the extra scruff and the way his eyes are soft, like he just woke up as well. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the brothers came and picked up Z last night, and I stayed so that we would have a chance to talk when you got up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s Capone here?\u201d I ask as the dog sits down at Wes\u2019 feet, looking between the two of us.</p><p>\u201cI had him dropped off. I didn\u2019t like the idea of him being at my place alone for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I mutter, wrapping my arms around myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good at this kind of thing,\u201d he says, and I feel my nose scrunch up. \u201cAs you may have noticed, I can be harsh and jump to conclusions. But I can admit when I\u2019m wrong and when I\u2019ve fucked up. I\u2019ve done both with you more times than I want to count. I won\u2019t apologize for being me, but I will apologize for being an asshole. You didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Okay, I didn\u2019t know how to recover from that. I never expected him to apologize and to admit that he was an asshole.</p><p>\u201cAs for last night, not happening. I appreciate you helping Z, but this is not a situation that I would ever let you be involved in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for apologizing.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek, not knowing what I should say or do, and my stomach takes that moment to remind me I haven\u2019t eaten in over twenty-four hours, breaking into the moment with a loud growl.</p><p>\u201cSit, I made you breakfast.\u201d He points towards my kitchen table and I take a seat, and the second my ass hits the chair, I immediately realize I have no panties on and my robe is not exactly long. He brings the plate over and sets it in front of me before I have a chance to get up and go to my room. Then he comes back a second later, setting down a cup of coffee. He gets a plate for himself and a cup of coffee, sets it on the table next to mine, and then sits next to me, his jean clad leg rubbing against my bare thigh. I squeeze my legs together as tightly as I can and pick up the coffee in front of me, taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I mumble then look down at my plate. \u201cYou made this?\u201d I look up at him then back down at the perfect omelet that is sitting on my plate next to two pieces of flawlessly cooked bacon.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He smiles, taking a bite of his, and I follow suit and moan as the taste hits my tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoly crap, you can cook,\u201d I mumble, taking another bite, then I swing one leg up to cross over the other without thinking.

I go to my dresser and grab a bra and panties, slipping them both on quickly. Then I dig through my closet until I find a pair of sweats, and pull them on with a t-shirt before slowly making my way out of the room and back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs this better?\u201d I ask, not even sitting down until I know I\u2019m safe.</p><p>His eyes sweep over me and he nods, so I sit back down, pick my coffee back up, and shakily take a sip.</p> <p>\u201cUntil I get in there, and I mean really get in there, you need to wear clothes when I\u2019m around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my house,\u201d I mutter, ignoring the part about him getting into me, because that image caused my whole body to heat up, and I could feel myself turning red from the thought alone.</p><p>\u201cNever said it wasn\u2019t, baby,\u201d he murmurs, taking a seat next to me.</p><p>I try to think of something to say, but my mind is so focused on just trying to breath that nothing comes to mind.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me why you were dressed like Catwoman last night at Mamma\u2019s Country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I reply immediately definitely not wanting to fill the silence with that conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWhy were you there, July?\u201d he questions more firmly.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have to tell me why you showed up at my house last night, but you expect me to tell you what happened?\u201d I lower my eyes to my plate, saying, \u201cNot likely,\u201d under my breath.</p><p>\u201cIs it about the dogs?\u201d he asks gently as his fingers pull up on the underside of my jaw, causing my gaze to meet his. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d The gentleness of his voice and softness in his eyes causes the words to come tumbling out.</p><p>\u201cThe morning Jax was here, there was another dog left outside the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d he says as his fingers come up to run down the side of my face and I try to ignore the way his touch feels.</p><p>\u201cI want to find out who\u2019s doing this.\u201d I lower my gaze when I feel tears sting my nose from thinking about the helpless animals that have lost their lives just so some asshole could have a few minutes of entertainment. \u201cI will find out who\u2019s doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe the person who\u2019s connected to the dogs was at the bar last night?\u201d he asks gently.</p><p>I nod, still looking down at my plate. \u201cKayan and I followed the guy after he dropped off another dog.\u201d</p> <p>He lets out a loud puff of air and I can feel the energy change. \u201cDon\u2019t go there again.\u201d My head comes up and our eyes connect. \u201cI know you have no reason to trust me yet.\u201d His eyes drop to my mouth and his thumb touches the edge of my bottom lip before they meet mine again. \u201cBut I need you to promise me you won\u2019t go back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cBabe.\u201d He shakes his head then frowns when pounding starts on my front door. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I get up and head toward the door when Wes pulls me behind him and opens it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to live, Silver?\u201d Jax asks, shoving his way into my house.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Mayson,\u201d Wes replies, and Jax looks me over then shakes his head, looking at Wes again.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were serious about my cousin, and then you let her walk right into the fucking snake pit where someone could see her?\u201d Jax asks, and my eyes go between him and Wes and I feel my brows pull together.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d Wes growls.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Jax turns on me and shakes his head, \u201cwhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you at Mamma\u2019s Country last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to babysit you,\u201d Jax growls.</p><p>\u201cHold on one damn minute.\u201d I put my hands on my hips and get in his face. \u201cI have never, ever asked you to babysit me, so you need to get off that high horse you rode in here on and back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I ask, making my eyes big.</p><p>\u201cDoes Uncle Asher know you\u2019re seeing Silver?\u201d he asks, and my body freezes and my heart speeds up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing him.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek.

I peek over at Wes, who\u2019s frowning, then swing my head to look at Jax.</p><p>He growls, \u201cTwo days he\u2019s been here in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I haven\u2019t told my dad or anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone about all the women you have in and out of your house,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a dude. No one would care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom would.\u201d I smirk. Aunt Lilly would kick his ass if she knew the way he went through women.</p><p>\u201cDo you think my mom\u2019s dumb?\u201d</p><p>Okay, he\u2019s right. Aunt Lilly knew he had never been in a committed relationship, but she still didn\u2019t like it. \u201cWhatever. We\u2019re getting away from the point,\u201d I say, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the point being that he,\u201d he points at Wes, \u201cshould have made sure your ass was nowhere near Momma\u2019s Country last night, or any night for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to remind you that I\u2019m a grown woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also a woman who has no idea the kind of fucked up people there are in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d I ask, narrowing my eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he confirms, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cEvery week, I have animals that have been abused or left for dead come into the hospital. Helpless animals that cannot defend themselves. So, yes, I do know the kind of horrible people who live in this world. I do not have rose-colored glasses on, Jax.\u201d I choke on the last words as tears fill my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wes steps toward me and pulls me into him, tucking my head under his chin.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to her about going there when you showed up.

You have no idea the kind of men my dad and uncles are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve dated before.\u201d I frown, stepping away from Wes while defending myself. Not that it matters, I reminded myself. I\u2019m not dating Wes, but still. Yes, my dad is overprotective, but he accepts I\u2019m not a little girl\u2014or I should say my mom talks him down every time he forgets I\u2019m not a child anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d he agrees then looked at Wes, \u201cjust not a guy like him.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he had a point, but I was done. \u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but before I can go do my job, I needed to come over here and rein you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you can leave,\u201d I tell him, opening the door and sweeping my hand for him to walk out.</p><p>\u201cIf she gets into any trouble, I\u2019m holding you accountable,\u201d Jax tells Wes as he walks through the door.</p> <p>\u201cBye.\u201d I roll my eyes and shut the door, coming face-to-face with Wes, who is smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou want to finish breakfast and go for a ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ride?\u201d I ask suspiciously, and his lips tilt up farther.</p><p>\u201cJust a ride.\u201d</p><p>I study him for a moment, and just like every time he\u2019s near, my gut is pulling me toward him, telling me that if I miss out on the promise of him, I will regret it. \u201cSure,\u201d I agree, ignoring my brain, which is roaring at me that I have just changed the course of life as I know it.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I hold onto Wes\u2019 waist and memories from today wash over me. After we finished breakfast, I went and got dressed in a pair of jeans, my high-top Chucks, and a black tank top. When I walked into the living room, Wes was sitting on my couch with Juice and Capone, who had somehow became best friends. Seeing them all sitting there together made everything stop.</p><p>As a little girl, I told myself that my Prince Charming would love to ride motorcycles, have a soft spot for animals, and be strong like my father. When I got older, I realized I would have a better chance of finding the Holy Grail than the man I envisioned spending the rest of my life with.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know much about Wes yet, but I did know he was gorgeous, when his arms wrapped around me when I was crying, I felt sheltered, he loved riding, and he had a soft spot for animals. So far, he had more going for him than men I thought would be my perfect match.</p><p>Wes\u2019 hand coming to rest on top of mine lying against his stomach brings me out of my thoughts, and I feel that strange feeling in my chest again, the one that somehow makes me feel like I\u2019m connected to him in a way that goes beyond this lifetime. When the bike starts to slow, I pull my face away from his back and look around, realizing we arrived at his clubhouse.</p><p>Earlier today, we dropped off Capone and his truck at his place, which was about ten minutes from my house. He lived in one of the newer apartment buildings in town. My friend Ken lives in the same building, so I know the kitchens are open, with granite and stainless steel, and the rooms are all large enough that you don\u2019t feel like you are in an apartment. When we arrived at his place, I declined going inside and waited near his bike. He took Capone inside and came back out a few minutes later with his helmet.</p><p>He told me he didn\u2019t have anything in mind for the day, just that he wanted to ride, and I was completely okay with that. The sun was out, and there was a nice breeze in the air. Plus, I liked the idea of being wrapped around him.</p><p>After an hour of riding around on the back country roads, he pulled over to a small white shack that was set up along the highway, the sign out front offering homemade frozen custard. We got off the bike, and he didn\u2019t get anything for himself, but ordered me a cone and stole occasional bites as we sat under an umbrella, eating and laughing. I had the best time with him; more fun than I\u2019ve ever had with a guy I was interested in.</p><p>I\u2019ve had three boyfriends. One was my high school boyfriend, the guy I gave my virginity to. He was sweet, but when I went to college, we lost contact. He still lives in town, but we don\u2019t speak. My second boyfriend was in college. He was a pre-med student who I realized was more interested in the image of having a girlfriend than actually having a girlfriend. We never even kissed, and truthfully, I think he may have been hiding his sexuality from his parents. Then there was my last boyfriend, Harvey. He was nice enough, but he was also boring...so boring that I could actually tell you what he would say before he\u2019d say anything, and I never even bothered asking him what he wanted to do, because it was always the same.</p><p>Wes...he\u2019s nothing like the men I\u2019ve dated. None of them would ride a motorcycle, get a tattoo, or live a life where they picked up and move to another state because they liked the feel of a town they drove through. None of my exes made me feel as comfortable as Wes did. None of them made me feel the way Wes made me feel. Just one look from him had my skin feeling too hot and my belly dipping.</p><p>After we ate custard, he asked me if I wanted to go to a club party with him. I have been to parties, sure, but partying with bikers was not something I had ever done. But I hated the idea of missing out on time with him, so I agreed, and he dropped me off at home so I could get dressed. He came back an hour later to pick me up.</p><p>When I opened the door to my house, I found him on the other side wearing his normal black boots, a pair of jeans that look like they were washed one too many times, the cuffs and pockets fraying, and a black shirt that fits him like a second skin, with his cut over it. His hair looked like it always does, messy, and his green eyes grew darker as they made their way back up my body.</p><p>That one look shot a thrill through me. I did my hair big, like I did on our first date, but this time, instead of simple makeup, I went with smoky eyes and a light lip that made me feel like a vixen. I chose my blue jeans that were so dark they almost looked black. I cuffed the bottom and paired them with peep-toed booties and a simple tank and one of my big chunky necklaces that made the outfit look dressier than it actually was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, pulling me out of my thoughts as his hand runs over the top of my fingers, which are still wrapped around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d I remove myself from him and get off the bike, looking around. I haven\u2019t been to this part of town in years, and I\u2019m not really surprised that this is where they would have their biker headquarters. When I was in high school, this whole area was an industrial park. But over the years, the factories have shut down one-by-one, and the empty buildings have been put up for sale.</p><p>The outside of the building looks normal, with a large sign that offers \u2018Car, Motorcycle Repair and Parts\u2019. Next to that is a short alley and another building. Without even looking, I know where we are going. There\u2019s a metal gate that has to be at least fifteen feet tall. It looks like something you would find on the set of Jurassic Park.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says taking my hand and leading me toward the large double gate. On the other side, I can hear loud music and people yelling and laughing. I start to feel anxious the closer we get to joining them.</p><p>After our first date and what happened when we were at dinner, the way he completely forgot I was around when his friend showed up, I know if he did that to me tonight it would be the end. There would be no coming back from that. And the idea of that happening after the amazing day we had causes my feet to freeze in place.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, and I turn to face him, the light from the street lamp bouncing off his handsome features.</p><p>My eyes drop to his mouth then meet his gaze again when he growls my name.</p><p>I have never asked to be kissed, and I\u2019m not sure I can do it now, but I don\u2019t want to miss out on the opportunity to kiss him at least once. He takes a step toward me and his arm wraps around my waist, tugging me until my body is flush with his.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, July?\u201d he asks as his lips hover over mine. My eyes slide closed and I swallow, not sure how to say the words. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he demands, shaking me slightly.</p><p>My eyes flutter open and I whisper, \u201cPlease kiss me.\u201d</p><p>I feel his breath against my mouth as one of his hands moves up my back and his fingers fist into my hair, causing a whimper to climb up my throat.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he breaths against my lips, making me gasp, giving him the perfect opportunity to lick into my mouth. The first swipe of his tongue against mine causes my belly to dip and my hands to fist into his shirt, anchoring me to him.</p><p>His taste courses through my system as his hand in my hair pulls, causing me to tilt my head, opening me up to him while his other hand moves down, grabbing onto my ass between my cheeks. He pulls me tighter against him, allowing me to feel his erection against my belly and his fingers so close to my pussy.</p><p>His tongue swirls against mine, making me whimper and squeeze my thighs together, trapping his hand as I feel another rush of wetness spread between my legs. I follow his tongue moving mine in sync with his then slowly pull away, giving one last nibble to his bottom lip as he sets his forehead to rest against mine.</p><p>It\u2019s not my first kiss, but it\u2019s the kiss\u2014the one that makes my soul light up, the kiss you wait your whole life for, the kiss that changes everything you thought you knew. I place my fingers to my lips, trying to memorize the feeling, knowing I will never have that again with another person.</p><p>\u201cRuined,\u201d he rumbles, and my eyes open slowly and I blink, trying to clear my head. \u201cI don\u2019t even really know you, and you\u2019ve ruined me.\u201d He shakes his head and walks me backward until my back hits the concrete wall and his mouth crashes back down on mine again, this time stilling my breath as his body surrounds me. His hands go to my ass, making me moan.</p><p>\u201cWes.\u201d I dig my fingers into his shoulders and lift up on my tiptoes, wanting to get closer to him as his mouth travels down my neck. The moment his name leaves my mouth, his lips come back to mine, and my fingers slide up the back of his neck and into his hair. I could easily become addicted to his kiss and taste.</p><p>\u201cYep, fucking ruined,\u201d he mumbles, pulling his mouth from mine and looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cLet me have some when you\u2019re done,\u201d I hear a deep voice say, and I rest my forehead against Wes\u2019 chest, inhaling a deep lungful of air while trying to clear my head.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Neo,\u201d Wes growls, wrapping his arms around my back and holding me closer against his body.</p><p>\u201cYou always share, man,\u201d the guy named Neo states, and I feel my body freeze and my insides twist with jealousy.</p><p>\u201cNot her,\u201d Wes says, and the guy mumbles something else before I hear him stumbling away, but my mind is still stuck on the fact that Wes shared women with other guys.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go in?\u201d he asks, and I pull my forehead away from his chest as my hands slide down his shoulders and come to rest against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou share women with your friends?\u201d I ask him, the words causing that feeling of jealousy to increase and wrap around my stomach, making it hard to breath.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he says, and his thumbs slide into my jeans at my hips. \u201cWon\u2019t be anymore.\u201d</p><p>I take a breath then nod and bite my lip before digging my fingers into his chest. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a relationship, then there is no one else,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He pulls me closer to him using his thumbs in my jeans to drag my body flush against his. \u201cAre you asking me to be your man?\u201d He smirks, and my hands in his shirt fist tighter then release and drop to my sides.</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d I tell him, and his arms tighten around me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking you home,\u201d he growls looking angry. Good, I\u2019m angry too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play games, so if you can\u2019t give me what I want then I\u2019ll find someone else who will,\u201d I tell him, sounding stronger than I feel, but I know I need to do this. He has me and doesn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>\u201cDo not ever fucking threaten me,\u201d he rumbles as his hand wraps around my lower jaw and his face dips closer to mine. \u201cAnd unless you want to be responsible for someone\u2019s death, do not ever try to use another man to get back at me.\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to apologize as his eyes search my face. His face dips and his lips whisper over mine, \u201cI\u2019m willing to explore this thing between us, and willing to give you me while doing that, but I expect the same from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share.\u201d I pause then lift my hands to fist into his shirt again, and lift my face closer to his. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he says, and I raise an eyebrow. \u201cNot you, not ever.\u201d He shakes his head and kisses me once. \u201cNow, are you ready to meet my boys?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want to say no, but instead I tell him yes and walk with him towards a door that is next to the gate. As soon as we pass through it, I scan the wide-open space. Two sides are blocked in by tall concrete buildings that look like apartments from the outside, with stairwells and walkways that lead from one door to another. Along the back is a tall chain-link fence with razor wire along the top, and a million cars piled one on top of the other. The area seems almost like a fortress, with large barrels with fires going in them all over.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d I hear a woman moan, and my eyes go to a couch that looks like it had been picked up from the dump. The material is torn and shredded, and the foam from the cushions is coming out, but the fact the couch looks like a reason for a tetanus shot doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping the couple on top of it, who are going at it. The woman moaning is straddling a man, her jean skirt pulled up around her waist. I couldn\u2019t be sure, but if I had to guess, the guy\u2019s pants are down enough for his dick to be free. My stomach rolls and I immediately feel out of place.</p><p>I pull my eyes from the couple and look around. There is a large bar that has a few stools in front of it. Next to it are three tables with men playing cards or talking. Some of the men at the tables have women sitting on their laps. I look around, noticing there are men wearing vests then others who are dressed in regular clothes. I can tell without asking who are members and who are recruits. Thank God for reading and Sons of Anarchy.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a beer?\u201d Wes asks, pulling me from my perusal.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I mutter, hoping if I get a good buzz going it will help take the edge off. He takes my hand in his and leads me to the bar, where a guy in a plain white tee is passing out drinks.</p><p>\u201cBoss,\u201d he greets Wes as soon as we\u2019re near.</p><p>\u201cBlaze.\u201d Wes dips his chin then pulls me closer by dropping my hand and wrapping his arm around my waist. \u201cA beer and a shot of Jack.\u201d</p><p>Blaze nods and sets a beer in front of me and a glass in front of Wes, and then pours him a shot. I pick up my beer and down half of it without pulling the bottle from my lips. I have never been a big beer drinker, but I have a feeling I\u2019m going to need it.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d I hear a woman call, and my beer drops to the top of the bar and I look around Wes. A pretty woman with long auburn hair, wearing close to nothing, comes to stand on the other side of Wes. Her shorts are so short they may as well be underwear, and the plaid shirt she has on is tied up under her boobs, the buttons not even buttoned, leaving her lace bra and cleavage showing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call me,\u201d she tells him, and that anger and jealousy from earlier comes back full-force, making it almost hard to see.</p> <p>She presses her body against the side of his and smashes her breasts into his arm, wrapping her arms around his neck. I feel my fingers press into the bottle in my hand so hard that I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t break.</p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d Wes growls.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks confused, then her eyes move to me and she frowns. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t mind sharing,\u201d she whispers, kissing his neck while looking at me. My stomach rolls and that red haze grows darker.</p><p>\u201cLacy,\u201d he warns, stepping away, but her hands seem to hold him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you get your hands off of him before I rip them off,\u201d I tell her, and her hands drop and she takes a step back, looking between the two of us.</p><p>\u201cLacy, come here,\u201d one of the guys at the table calls, and he pats his lap. Lacy looks from me to him then shakes her head and goes to sit on his lap.</p> <p>I down the rest of my beer as Wes turns his head to look at me, and I notice he has lip-gloss smeared on his neck when his face comes toward mine, and I turn my head.</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d he growls, and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou have her mark on you,\u201d I tell him then look at Blaze, who\u2019s looking between the two of us. \u201cCan I get another?\u201d I ask, holding up my beer. He looks at Wes and I roll my eyes, but I take the beer he sets on the bar top then pat Wes\u2019 chest. \u201cWhen you get that cleaned up, come find me,\u201d I mutter then walk off toward one of the barrels.</p><p>I have never been jealous in my life, but the idea of Wes even touching someone else makes me feel like I could actually kill.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Wes says, not giving me a choice. He takes the bottle out of my hand and tosses it into the barrel. His hand wraps around my elbow and he pulls me along with him past the bar and through an orange metal door.</p><p>He leads me down a long hallway and stops outside a door then reaches in his pocket and pulls out a set of keys. He unlocks the door and holds it open for me to go inside before him. Once I clear the doorway, the light flips on and I look around the room.</p><p>There\u2019s a queen-sized bed with a blanket bunched up on one side of it, along with two pillows. Clothes and things are scattered around the room and tossed on the floor. I watch Wes as he walks past me into a small bathroom that connects to the room. His hand goes to his neck and he uses a paper towel to wipe Lacy\u2019s lip-gloss off his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou should have a seat,\u201d he tells me sounding angry.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sitting on a bed that you have probably had sex with other women in,\u201d I huff, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>His green eyes narrow and heat, turning a shade darker with anger and lust. He tosses the paper towel in the trash and stalks toward me, not stopping until I can feel the heat coming off his body.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, baby. I\u2019ll let you get away with a lot of shit, but do not disrespect me in front of my men.\u201d His hand goes to my hip then slides back to rest on my ass. \u201cThat happens, and this ass,\u201d he squeezes my ass cheek, \u201cwill be red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I growl, not sure if I\u2019m pissed off or turned on.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking foreplay, baby. We\u2019re talking you won\u2019t even be able to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d I ask him, feeling my pulse speed up.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head as his free hand tangles in my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re hot when you\u2019re jealous, and it\u2019s cool if you want to claim me, but you get a smart mouth like you did earlier, we\u2019re gonna have words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let another woman touch you or put her mouth on you, and we\u2019re going to have problems that no words will be able to solve. In fact, no words will be needed ever again. You get me, baby?\u201d I ask, studying him, and his hand in my hair tightens and he forces my head to the side. He covers my mouth with his, biting my bottom lip hard enough to sting, my mouth to open and his tongue to sweep in tangling with mine. This time, when he\u2019s pulling away, I\u2019m panting for breath and clutching onto him so I don\u2019t fall on my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t test me, July. I will win,\u201d he says, standing me up then tugging my hand leading me back outside.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>I feel warmth and open one eye, then the other. They lock on dark stubble and a pair of lips I learned last night are perfect for kissing.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d his deep voice rumbles as his hand on my ass and his arm wrapped around my shoulders pull me tighter against his warm body.</p><p>I feel the hair on his chest scrape against my nipples and my eyebrows pull together. \u201cWhere\u2019s my shirt?\u201d I question, then sigh in relief when I realize I still have my panties on.</p><p>\u201cYou insisted we sleep chest-to-chest, something about feeling connected to me,\u201d he mumbles sleepily.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I whisper, feeling like an idiot. Who says crap like that?</p><p>\u201cYou kept saying our souls are connected,\u201d he says, and I hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I hiss, tilting my head back to look at him.</p><p>His head inclines and a smile forms on his lips. \u201cTrue story, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never drinking with you again.\u201d I shake my head then regret it when it starts to throb. I drank too much last night, but when we went back out to the party, more women had shown up, and I knew the only way I was going to make it through the night was by getting a good buzz going.</p><p>\u201cYou should be saying you\u2019ll never try to outdrink Harlen again,\u201d he corrects, and flashes of me and a guy who was giant taking shots filter through my head.</p><p>\u201cThat happened?\u201d I question, biting my lip.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the dance-off?\u201d I whisper, hoping I had just made that memory up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I mumble, feeling my face heat in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, baby,\u201d he says softly, tucking the top of my head under his chin.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t...you know, right?\u201d I ask in a hushed tone.</p><p>His face moves until his lips are brushing my ear. \u201cThe first time I have you, the first time my mouth and cock get a taste of your pussy, you\u2019re not going to be drunk, and you\u2019re sure as fuck going to remember it and feel it the next day.\u201d</p><p>My breath pauses, my nipples pucker in anticipation, and the walls of my vagina contract.</p><p>\u201cNow try to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agreed, even though I know I\u2019m not going to be able to sleep, not now, not with the heat of his skin absorbing into me, his smell making it hard to think, and feeling his cock against my belly through his boxers. \u201cHave you washed these sheets since the last time you had someone else in your bed?\u201d I ask him as my mind registers that not only am I practically naked, but I\u2019m practically naked with him in his room at the clubhouse.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in my ass, beautiful,\u201d he grumbles.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want cooties.\u201d I smile, and his hand on my ass taps twice before grabbing a handful making my belly clench.</p><p>\u201cRemember how I said that until I was in there, you needed to wear clothes?\u201d he questions, his voice sounding deeper than before.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I\u2019m in there, baby, you\u2019re gonna need to settle when I ask you, \u2019cause right now, I can\u2019t give you what you need to help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>I start to pant, and my nipples scrape against his chest with each inhale. I\u2019m not sure I would be able to handle him; his intensity and rawness are something new to me. The feeling he causes within me from a few words is intimidating.</p><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d He gives me another squeeze.</p><p>\u201cSo annoying,\u201d I mumble, and I try to fight it, but my eyes slowly slide closed and I relax into his embrace until I fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Wes says, pulling me down into his lap at my kitchen table and kissing me.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to get Capone?\u201d I breathe when his mouth leaves mine. This morning when he woke me up at the clubhouse, he asked me to spend the day with him before we even got out of bed. I knew I needed to step back, but I just can\u2019t. He\u2019s like a drug I can\u2019t get enough of. So while he went to the bathroom, I found his shirt and slipped it on, along with my jeans and sneakers, and planned what I would make for dinner since it was already after three in the afternoon.</p><p>His hand on my thigh traveling up my side brings me back to the moment, and the breath I was about to release gets trapped in my lungs as his fingers come to rest under my breast. My eyes move from his hand to his eyes that are heated, the mint green looking wild and untamed.</p><p>\u201cYou...in my shirt...no bra...your dark nipples visible...\u201d His eyes lift to meet mine and his hands move to my hips, where he lifts me swiftly to the table in front of him. His face ducks and he pulls one of my nipples into his mouth through the material of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I cry as the roughness of the shirt scrapes against my nipple as he tugs. \u201cWes.\u201d I grab onto his hair as my head drops back, and his mouth moves to my other breast, where he delivers the same treatment.</p><p>When his mouth leaves my breast, my eyes flutter open to look at him. His hand wraps around the back of my neck and he pulls my mouth down to his. I tilt my head and my lips part as his tongue slides across my bottom lip. My fingers thread through his hair as I slide off the table and onto his lap, my legs hanging over each side of the chair, my core connecting with the large bulge in his pants.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters as I rock against him. His head tilts further taking over the kiss before ripping his mouth from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask in a daze.</p><p>His head is back, his eyes are closed, and his jaw is tight. \u201cOff,\u201d he commands, and I frown out of confusion. \u201cOff, babe,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I scurry off of his lap and go to stand near my fridge with my arms crossed over my chest. The wetness from his mouth on the shirt makes it hard to focus as it rubs across my nipples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he mutters and leaves without even looking at me. I stand there confused for a few moments, not understanding what the hell just happened then look down when Juice rubs against my legs and meows like he\u2019s confused as well.</p><p>I pick him up and carry him back to my room, dumping him on the bed before heading to the shower replaying everything that just happened while trying to figure out what I missed. Once I\u2019m dressed, I head for the door when the bell rings. I expect it to be Wes, and my pulse speeds up when I see my mom standing on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper swinging the door open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Nothing, I just got out of the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never been a good liar, honey.\u201d She shakes her head and drops her purse onto the couch. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d She crosses her arms over her chest and taps her foot.</p> <p>I\u2019m just about to cave into her Jedi mind tricks and spill about Wes, when the door opens. I watch in slow motion as Capone barks and runs past me. Lifting my head my gaze collides with Wes\u2019. His eyes drop to my mouth and his hand wraps around my waist as he dips me backward, kissing me hard and stealing my breath. \u201cHi,\u201d He says against my lips before standing me upright.</p><p>\u201cThat explains a lot,\u201d I hear my mom say, and I pull my stare from Wes and look at her.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I look from my mom to Wes.</p><p>\u201cWes Silver.\u201d He sticks out his hand that isn\u2019t wrapped around my waist and shakes my mom\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNovember Mayson, July\u2019s mother.\u201d She smiles, and Wes\u2019 head dips so he can look at me.</p> <p>\u201cI also have four sisters. June, May, December and April.\u201d I tell him, then press my lips together when I see him smile.</p><p>He shakes his head then looks at my mom again. \u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, huh?\u201d Mom looks at me and raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWes is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer man,\u201d he cuts me off, stepping fully into the house and shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cHer man,\u201d my mom whispers, looking between the two of us.</p> <p>Her mouth opens, but I cut in before she can say anything else. \u201cDid you need anything else, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She blinks like she\u2019s coming out of a daze then looks at me and smiles. \u201cI was planning on having your dad\u2019s birthday get-together this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap! My dad. I love my dad. My dad loves me. But I know my dad, and there is no way he will approve of Wes. No way.</p><p>\u201cYou should bring your man.\u201d My mom smiles looking between the two of us.</p><p>\u201cWes will be busy,\u201d I explain then narrow my eyes when hers light up, I can tell she\u2019s loving this.</p><p>\u201cWill I?\u201d Wes asks, and I turn to look at him. He raises an eyebrow as he searches my face.</p><p>I take a breath and look at my mom. \u201cCan I call you later?\u201d I ask pleading with my eyes and her face softens as she cups my cheek.</p><p>\u201cSure, honey.\u201d</p> <p>I really do have the best parents. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Wes Silver, it was nice meeting you,\u201d my mom says, picking up her bag.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mrs. Mayson,\u201d Wes replies.</p><p>My mom glances at me, and I see a look pass through her eyes that I don\u2019t quite understand, but then she turns to look at Wes and smiles again. \u201cCall me November,\u201d she tells him, and when he nods, her eyes come to me and they go soft. \u201cCall me, honey,\u201d she says softly, and I feel my throat contract with emotion and I close the distance between us as I give her a hug. \u201cI\u2019m always here,\u201d she whispers into my ear, and those words offer me a comfort I didn\u2019t even know I needed.</p><p>I nod and step away then follow behind her as she leaves, waving at her as she pulls out of the driveway. As soon as she\u2019s out of sight, I head inside, go to the kitchen, grab an onion out of the fridge, a knife and the cutting board, and begin chopping it up.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk about what\u2019s going on up here?\u201d Wes asks, running a hand over my head while pressing into my back, wrapping his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I reply, taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly. I don\u2019t know why this is causing me so much stress. I have never hid a relationship with anyone from my family or my father, and if I\u2019m honest with myself, the reason I\u2019m afraid of my father meeting Wes is I want my dad to approve of him. Well, maybe not approve. I don\u2019t know that my dad will ever approve of any man I decide to be with.</p><p>\u201cYour mom seems nice,\u201d he says, placing a kiss under my ear.</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you serious about the names?\u201d he asks, and I can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>I turn and look over my shoulder at him, my stomach fluttering when I realize just how close he is. \u201cMy mom\u2019s mom named her November because she didn\u2019t want to even bother to look for a name for my mom, and it was November when she was born. My dad loves my mom and wanted to turn the memory of her name into something good, so he named all of us girls after the month we were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad sounds like a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best,\u201d I agree then lower my eyes back to the cutting board.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I help with?\u201d</p><p>I look at him again, and Juice takes that moment to come wrap him self around my feet. \u201cCan you feed Juice for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, where\u2019s his food?\u201d</p><p>I point to the cabinet where I keep his cat food then turn again, only to have Wes\u2019 hand slide along the underside of my jaw. He pulls gently until my eyes go to him. His lips wisp over mine softly, then he drops his hand and goes about feeding Juice while leaving me completely exposed.</p><p>I have watched my father with my mom since I was a little girl, watched the way he spoke to her, watched the way he watched her, and watched the way he kissed her without reason, doing so just because he wanted too I\u2019ve never had that. I didn\u2019t even know I craved that for myself. Not until Wes.</p><p>\u201cBabe, the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I turn to look at him, his statement barely registering over the loudness of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s at the door. Want me to get it?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows pull together as I set down the knife. My mom wouldn\u2019t have told my dad about Wes. She would wait until I was ready, and no one had called to tell me they were coming over, so I\u2019m at a loss as to who would be here on a Sunday.</p><p>When I make it to the door, I look through the peephole then swing it open.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I say shakily, pulling Kayan into the house. Her eyes fill up with tears and I help her over to the couch, scarcely registering that Wes is talking on the phone behind me. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d I prompt and she lowers her head.</p><p>\u201cWait \u2019til Z and a couple of the guys get here,\u201d Wes says, getting down on his haunches next to me, handing Kayan some tissue.</p><p>\u201cWhy do we need to wait for them?\u201d I ask, looking at my friend, who now has a black smudge under her eye and a cut on her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI only want her to tell us once, and then you\u2019re going to go clean her up,\u201d he says, rubbing my lower back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod then move and sit down next to her so I can wrap my arm around her shoulders. It takes less than five minutes for the loud sound of pipes to vibrate my house. I don\u2019t know how many guys are coming, but judging from the sound, it\u2019s way more than a couple.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d Wes mutters, heading out the door only to come back a few minutes later with Z.</p><p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d Z growls as soon as he sees Kayan. His jaw starts ticking and his hands at his sides lift to cross over his chest like he\u2019s trying to control himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay talking in front of them?\u201d I ask her, and she nods, taking my hand in hers.</p> <p>\u201cI went out with Eric to get some food,\u201d she says, and a growl fills the room and my head flies up to look at Z with a glare.</p><p>\u201cCan you control yourself?\u201d I snap, and he lifts his chin, making me roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo you went out with Eric, and then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d She shakes her head and pulls her eyes from Z to look at me. \u201cHe dropped me home and when I got inside my apartment, I was shoved into the door and someone grabbed me around the throat. They told me I needed to give you a warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper, squeezing her hand tighter as fear creeps down my spine.</p> <p>\u201cThey said if we don\u2019t stop sticking our noses where they don\u2019t belong, we will find out what happens to nosey little girls.\u201d</p><p>I look at Wes and his gaze travels from Z\u2019s to mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they look like?\u201d Z questions.</p><p>\u201cAll I saw was a tattoo of a spider on his forehead. Really, I was too scared to pay much attention,\u201d she says, and more tears fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I assure her and look towards the front door as Z leaves, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Wes calls, and my eyes go to him. \u201cGo get her cleaned up. I\u2019m heading out with the boys. Harlen and Everret will be outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree, and he bends double, wraps his hand around the back of my neck, and pulls me up, kissing me quickly, and then is gone before I realize it.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m guessing I don\u2019t need a new calendar?\u201d Kayan asks, and I look at her and can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cWhat a difference a few days makes.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get you cleaned up before Z comes back,\u201d I say, knowing that statement will have her mouth slamming shut.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t deal with scary hot,\u201d she whispers, but her eyes cloud over.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d I take her hand and lead her towards my room.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d I whisper, blinking up at Wes. His face goes soft as he gets down on his haunches beside the couch and runs his hand over my head. I look around, seeing his friends are gone, but Kayan is still asleep next to me on the couch.</p><p>\u201cYou got a TV,\u201d he remarks, and I smile then look around him at my new TV before meeting his eyes again.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing your friends said when they walked into my house was, \u2018Where\u2019s your TV?\u2019\u201d I say, making my voice deeper. \u201cSo I asked them to take me to Target to buy one, but they refused, saying something about women and shopping...blaw blaw blaw. So they took us to BestBuy.\u201d I smile and sit up. \u201cWhich is funny, \u2019cause we were at BestBuy for two hours looking at TVs. Did you know they have \u2018smart\u2019 TVs?\u201d I question, tilting my head to the side and studying him. When he shakes his head, I continue, \u201cThey do, but I refused to buy one when I already own a computer. Why would I need a TV that is a computer?\u201d I take a deep breath and he chuckles, running his fingers down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to find out anything?\u201d I ask after a moment, and he shakes his head again.</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek and look at my friend. I hate that I had gotten her hurt. \u201cWhat now?\u201d I ask as he sits on the couch next to me.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Jax. Between his boys and mine, we\u2019ll be able to figure this out.\u201d He pulls me closer to him with a hand behind my neck which I notice that he does a lot. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here with you and your friend until we can get some security in at her place and yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, what\u2014?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happening. Whoever did this isn\u2019t going to scare me out of my own home. I love you, but I\u2019m not staying here,\u201d Kayan says, cutting in and sitting up from where she had fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you to be there alone,\u201d I tell her gently, and she stands up, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cThey are not scaring me out of my house,\u201d she repeats.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying alone,\u201d Z growls, coming into the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my dad,\u201d she replies, and my mouth drops open in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not staying alone, Kitten,\u201d Z says, leaning forward and getting into her space.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll call Eric.\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cThink again,\u201d Z tells her, and I have no idea what\u2019s going on, but I would swear I\u2019m missing something.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d she shouts.</p><p>\u201cBet your sweet ass I can!\u201d he shouts back, causing Capone to start barking at them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d she cries, throwing her hands up in the air in frustration when he continues to glare at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019m staying with you,\u201d Z says, sweeping his hand toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stops, her body freezing, and I swear you could have heard a pin drop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with you,\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cUhh...\u201d She looks at me like she just realized what she was doing and I smile.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just stay here,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cNope, walk your sweet ass to your car. I\u2019ll follow you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She glances at me and I press my lips together to keep from laughing. I have never seen her act like she did moments ago. Never.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she glares at Z then looks at me, \u201cI\u2019m quitting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were already fired,\u201d I remind her. I\u2019m still upset about that damn cat suit.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She tells me as she stomps toward the door, past Z, who watches her ass as she leaves.</p><p>\u201cPlease be nice to her,\u201d I plea, and he gets this strange look on his face, lifts his chin, and then leaves, shutting the door behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was so weird,\u201d I say, looking from the door to Wes, who\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He runs his thumb over the skin under my eye. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I affirm through a yawn. It\u2019s been a very long weekend, and not a relaxing one. My life has never been this exciting.</p><p>\u201cGo on to bed and I\u2019ll make sure everything\u2019s locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he mutters, pulling me off the couch, kissing my forehead, and pushing me towards the hall. I stop in my guestroom and put an extra pillow and blanket out before heading to my room, stripping off my clothes, slipping on a tank top, and getting into bed I expect it to take awhile to find sleep but the moment my eyes close I\u2019m out.</p><p>\u201cI put an extra pillow and blanket on the guest bed for you,\u201d I mumble half asleep as Wes drags me across the bed and wraps his body around mine.</p><p>\u201cSaw that.\u201d He kisses the skin behind my ear, pulling me deeper into him with a hand on my stomach. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping under the same roof as you and not sleeping next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathe. My body begins to wake up as his hips press forward so that his cock rests right between the cheeks of my ass. He feels huge and thick, and just thinking about it causes a shiver to slide down my spine.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he hushes me when I whimper as he lifts my tank top and rests his hand against the skin of my stomach. Every nerve in my body is in tune with him, every one of them reaching out to him, waiting for his touch.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d I whisper into the dark as his fingers slide along the elastic of my panties, causing the muscles in my lower abdomen to contract.</p><p>His hips shift forward again, making my lungs freeze in anticipation and a rush of wetness to spread between my legs. Squeezing my eyes closed, I wait for his touch. His fingers move slowly down my pubic bone and over the bare lips of my pussy. I let out a harsh breath as the muscles of his body coil behind me and his fingers slip through my folds.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even touched you and you\u2019re fucking soaked,\u201d he breathes against my ear while sliding a finger inside me, only to move it out again. His hand on my hip forces me to my back and he looms over me, the light of the moon making it possible to see him. His head lowers and his breath whispers against my lips. \u201cOpen your legs, baby.\u201d</p><p>My knees had bent and my thighs had somehow locked together, his fingers again playing along the edge of my panties. I fight myself for only a brief moment before sliding my legs apart. His teeth bite into my bottom lip, making me gasp. His tongue slips into my mouth and two fingers glide between my folds, over my clit, and into me, making my back arch and a loud moan to leave my mouth into his.</p><p>My nails dig into his shoulders as he slowly works his fingers in and out of me, each thrust creating a slow burn. He moves again; this time, he slips between my spread legs pulls my tank top off over my head then lowers his body causing the cold metal of the necklace he wears to slide between my breasts.</p><p>Sliding one hand down his chest under the edge of his boxers, I wrap my hand around him. My pussy convulses when I feel how wide and long he is. I know the first time he enters me he\u2019ll steal my breath.</p><p>He pulls his mouth away and places his forehead to mine. \u201cI swear I know how you\u2019ll taste by the way you smell, like vanilla and citrus. Your pussy would be sweet and tangy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I whimper, lifting my hips and pressing into his hand while pumping him faster.</p><p>\u201cYour pussy is greedy for my fingers and soaking my hand. I want inside of you.\u201d He groans against my mouth as my hand squeezes and pumps.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hiss, and he closes his eyes like he\u2019s in pain then opens again, making my breath pause.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, but soon.\u201d His thumb circles my clit in sync with my hand that\u2019s wrapped around him. I pump faster and his fingers pull up against my g-spot, making my legs shake and causing the slow burn to spread like wildfire until I\u2019m screaming his name. His head drops to my shoulder and he groans my name against the skin of my neck as bright lights fill my vision, and my pussy sucks greedily at his fingers that are still deep inside of me as his hot cum shoots across my belly.</p><p>My eyes close and my body completely relaxes, his heavy weight cocooning me, making me feel complete.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ma get you cleaned up,\u201d he whispers. I nod, unable to speak, not even able to open my eyes, because my body is completely lax from my orgasm. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to let go of my dick.\u201d I hear the smile in his voice and my hand drops. I feel him leave the bed only to come back a few minutes later with a warm cloth that he uses to wipe gently between my legs and over my stomach. I hear a splat near my bathroom and smile as he lies back down with me, his body wrapping around mine.</p> <p>\u201cNight,\u201d I murmur, snuggling deeper into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cNight, baby.\u201d He kisses my head and I sigh before drifting off to Dreamland.</p><p>My eyes travel over Wes, taking in his dark hair, tattoo-covered chest, and the necklace that is hanging around his neck...the necklace I felt glide between my breasts last night as he brought me to orgasm.</p><p>He leans back against the counter behind him and lifts the cup of coffee to his mouth, taking a drink, watching me over the edge of the cup.</p><p>I pull one leg up on the counter, wrap my arm around my calf, and take a bite of my bagel, ducking my head and trying to hide my blush. When I woke up this morning with his arms wrapped around me, his breath brushing against the back of my neck, I smiled. I have always been happy\u2014my life is full; my family is amazing\u2014but waking up wrapped in his arms was a different kind of happiness. It was something that was only mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be by the hospital to pick you up for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I say when I\u2019m finally able to swallow the bite of bagel I had taken.</p><p>\u201cLunch, today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were serious about that?\u201d</p><p>He closes the space between us and his hand cups my knee while his other hand wraps around the side of my neck. His thumb grazes the underside of my jaw and he lowers his mouth over mine, kissing me until I stop breathing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very serious about this,\u201d he says when his mouth leaves mine and his thumb runs over my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to get away during the day,\u201d I explain breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring food. I\u2019m sure you can step away for thirty minutes to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiles then steps back, leaning against the counter and crossing one bare foot over the other.</p><p>\u201cSo, um...\u201d My lips press together when I realize I have nothing to say, he smiles bigger and runs a hand over his hair, causing his abs to flex, making me fight myself when all I want to do is launch myself off of the counter and tackle him to the tile floor of my kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBabe, stop looking at me like that.\u201d</p><p>I take a large bite of my bagel to prevent myself from saying, \u2018Or what?\u2019 in hopes he will return with, \u2018I will give you endless orgasms.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBe back,\u201d he mutters when his phone starts ringing from somewhere in the house.

He drops his boots to the floor and pulls his shirt on over his head then drops his ass onto my kitchen chair to put his boots on.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d He pulls me down to his lap and pushes the hair out of my face. \u201cThis is not on you, so get that out of your head and that look off your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it though?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he states firmly, squeezing my waist, and I go to stand up, knowing it\u2019s pointless to argue with him, only to be pulled back down into his lap. His hand slides up into the back of my hair kissing me before standing us both.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d I say watching him shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t need you to follow me!\u201d Kayan yells over her shoulder at Z, who is sitting on his bike with his arms crossed over his chest, watching her with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day, Kitten,\u201d Z tells her, and she shakes her head then storms over to me, stomping her feet across the gravel parking lot. When she reaches my side, she grabs my arm and starts to pull me with her towards the door of the building.</p><p>\u201cCan I close the door to my car and get my coffee?\u201d I ask her while trying to control my laughter.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d she pouts, reading my face. \u201cThis is all your fault. Thanks to you, I had to have that guy in my house last night and this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could think of much worse problems, honey,\u201d I tell her, slamming my door with my hip and grabbing my to-go coffee cup off the roof of my car.</p><p>\u201cYou would think so. He was shirtless in my house. Who gets undressed in front of people they don\u2019t know then struts around showing off their body?\u201d She blows a piece of hair out of her face, which has turned a nice shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cYou like him.\u201d I smile, laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cI do not like him.\u201d She frowns, watching as he pulls out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cSure, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she says, stomping past me as soon as I get the door open. \u201cAnd if he thinks he\u2019s staying at my house tonight, he has another thing coming!\u201d I hear her yell as I go to my office. I shake my head and put away all my stuff before heading out front to see who my first patient is.</p><p>As I walk around the corner, I stop dead. The guy we followed to the bar is standing in front of the reception desk with his hands on top of it and his body leaning over the counter.</p> <p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I ask then sweep my eyes over my friend to make sure she\u2019s okay.</p><p>\u201cLike I was just telling your friend, you guys need to mind your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to mind my business?\u201d I step toward him and poke my finger in his chest. \u201cYou made whatever it is you\u2019re doing my business when you started dropping dead dogs off at my hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to do the right thing, but I won\u2019t be able to save your stupid asses again. They will kill you,\u201d he says, and I take in his appearance. He looks younger than I first thought. He\u2019s maybe twenty-one. His hair is covered with a baseball cap that is sheading on the brim. His eyes are a crystal blue that is almost startling, and you can see stress and exhaustion in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI know people who can help you,\u201d I tell him gently, but his eyes change and he takes a step back. \u201cThey can help; I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust mind your fucking business,\u201d he shouts then turns around and pushes so hard against the door that the glass cracks as it hits the outside of the building.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what we\u2019re missing,\u201d I say aloud as I watch him pull out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he seems scared,\u201d Kayan says, and I see her eyes are still on the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call Wes or Z and tell them what just happened?\u201d she asks, and I look at her and shake my head. I know the first thing Wes would do is track down the kid, and I don\u2019t think that boy could handle anything else right now.</p><p>\u201cNo, if anything else happens, I\u2019ll tell him,\u201d I promise.</p><p>She eyes me doubtfully, but nods her head anyways. The rest of the day passes without much drama, and I\u2019m even able to stop and have a quick lunch with Wes in my office. I avoid telling him about the kid, and manage to find out from him that the window at his shop was broken with a brick. He believes whoever did it was probably young and dumb, so he didn\u2019t believe it had anything to do with me.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cWho stopped by this morning?\u201d Wes asks as he walks through the door to my house. I look at him then my front door and wonder how the hell he was able to get in. I\u2019m pretty sure I locked the door when I came home.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d I question, feeling my brows pull together.</p><p>\u201cI have a key. Now tell me who stopped by the hospital this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...pardon?\u201d I cross my arms over my chest, ignoring the fact that he somehow found out the dog guy stopped by to warn me off, while zeroing in on the fact he just said he has a key to my house.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me; don\u2019t play dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard you.\u201d I lean forward and point at my front door. \u201cYou have a key to my house that I never gave to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shit doesn\u2019t matter. Now, tell me what the fuck you were thinking keeping that from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you tell me how you think it\u2019s okay to take a key to my house that I never gave you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d He points a finger at me and a vein in his neck begins to pulse. \u201cAnswer my question before I take you into your room and spank your ass,\u201d he roars, and I take a step back.</p><p>\u201cDo not threaten me \u0327\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what can happen to you? Do you understand the guys this kid and his father are involved with drug women until they have no idea what their doing and put them on the street, only letting them quit when they are broken and can no longer make them money?

Do you think I want to come looking for you, only to find out you have been kidnapped and sold into prostitution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I whisper as tears fill my eyes and my bottom lip begins to tremble.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think your family will understand that it happened because you were so bullheaded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d I tell him, taking a seat on the couch. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, and he looked scared. I didn\u2019t want you to go after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is something you could\u2019ve said when you talked to me about it,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe looked scared,\u201d I repeat, lifting my eyes to meet his. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to him, but he looked terrified, and I could tell he didn\u2019t want us to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He nods and gets down in front of me, taking my hands in his. \u201cHis dad owns Mamma\u2019s Country. It was one of the first places me and my boys started going to when we moved to town. His dad is a good man, but over the last couple months, he\u2019s gotten mixed up with some bad dudes. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but my guess is he owes these guys money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you help them?\u201d</p><p>His eyes search my face then he mutters a quiet, \u201cFuck,\u201d as he pulls his hands from mine, stands, and runs his palms over his head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been bringing me dogs, even if they\u2019re on their last leg. I know the person running the fights isn\u2019t telling him to drop them to me, so that leads me to believe he\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><p>He gets back down in front of me and swipes away a tear I didn\u2019t know had begun to fall.</p><p>\u201cMe and Jax are looking into what\u2019s going on. If I can help him, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in my ass,\u201d he says, shaking his head, but the words are soft, and so is the look in his eyes. I take a much-needed breath and then remember we were fighting about the key before he somehow turned this around on me.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you get a key to my house?\u201d I ask, and he stands back up and crosses his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI took it off one of your key rings.\u201d He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s something I should maybe give to you willingly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it would take for you to give me a key?\u201d he asks, looking down on me, so I stand up, wanting to have every advantage I can get. Even if the advantage is just a couple feet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m arguing with him about this. It doesn\u2019t even matter he has a key. I would have given him one if he asked me to. Even if we have only been an us for a few days this seemed like something bigger then I could ever even understand.</p><p>He looks me over and his eyes drop to my mouth. I cover it with my hand and he smirks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back there, huh?\u201d he questions, taking a step towards me. I take a step back and my knees hit the couch, and I fall to my ass on the soft cushion. \u201cNow you\u2019re caught.\u201d He smiles, putting his fist into the couch on each side of me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d I question, and his eyes heat as they roam over me.</p><p>\u201cI can think of a few things, but you\u2019re gonna need to uncover that hot mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to eat,\u201d I tell him, uncovering my mouth and placing my hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cEating is definitely on my list of things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I whisper, and he lowers his mouth over mine.</p><p>\u201cJuly, open the door right now.\u201d Kayan yells from outside breaking into the moment.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d Wes growls, punching the cushion next to my hip and looking at the door.</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d is growled, and the pounding gets more frantic. I regretfully slip out from under Wes and go to the door, opening it up only to close it back again when I see that Z has Kayan in his arms, his hand tangled in her hair and his mouth on hers.</p><p>\u201cMy neighbors are going to sign a petition for me to leave the neighborhood,\u201d I tell Wes, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just kiss people,\u201d I hear my friend say breathlessly from the other side of the door, and I open it again and move out of the way as she comes tumbling into the house, Z catching her around the waist before her face hits the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask as he rights her and she swipes his hands away from her waist.</p><p>\u201cI came to make sure you were okay,\u201d she tells me, looking between Wes and me.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be okay?\u201d I frown.</p><p>\u201cI may have been frustrated about Z being at my house when I got home and told him about the guy coming to the hospital. I told him not to tell Wes, but no sooner did the words leave my mouth did this big lug call Wes.\u201d She points at Z, who is smiling at her. She glares at him in return, only to have his smile become wider. \u201cYou\u2019re annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that, Kitten,\u201d Z tells her.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t call?\u201d Wes asks, and I look at him and narrow my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d he states, making my core tighten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry too,\u201d Kayan says, and my eyes leave Wes when his head tilts back so that he can look at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI was going to make tacos.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough?\u201d Kayan asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wes says as I say, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have plenty.\u201d I narrow my eyes on Wes, daring him to say something else. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me make dinner, while Wes and Z do guy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy stuff.\u201d Wes shakes his head, looking at Z.</p><p>\u201cYeah, drink beer, scratch your balls...guy stuff.\u201d I throw my hands up in the air then roll my eyes when Z laughs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start cooking,\u201d my poor, distressed friend says, walking to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beating the shit out of you tomorrow,\u201d Wes says, looking at Z, whose eyes are focused where Kayan just disappeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrother.\u201d Z shakes his head then looks at me. \u201cYou got any beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d he says, walking off towards the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe with him, right?\u201d I ask Wes when Z is out of earshot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been friends with him since we joined the Navy at eighteen.

They\u2019re \u2018I don\u2019t want to wash a million dishes\u2019 tacos.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head then goes back to chopping.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for dinner to be done, and even less time for the guys to scarf down every last bite. By the time dinner\u2019s done and Z and Kayan leave for the night, I\u2019m asleep on my feet.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask sleepily, opening my eyes and coming face-to-face with Wes, who\u2019s staring down at me. Turning my head, I look at the clock, seeing I still have an hour before I have to get up and ready for work.</p><p>\u201cYou were whimpering in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhimpering?\u201d I ask, still half unconscious.</p><p>\u201cWhimpering,\u201d he confirms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d I say then notice his eyes have turned a darker shade of green, and my body begins to heat. I was so tired last night that the moment my head hit the pillow, I fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou made that same whimpering noise when my fingers were deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I breathe as his hand slides down my stomach and cups me over my panties.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ll never forget that noise.\u201d His fingers slide over the lips of my pussy through the material, making me whimper. \u201cThat\u2019s the noise I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathe as he slides between my legs. His hands slide up my sides and he slips my tank top off over my head, tossing the shirt behind him. Then he lifts one of my legs and places it on his shoulder, doing the same with the other.</p><p>My breath starts coming in rough pants as his hands slide over my breasts then down my sides.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re fucking perfection,\u201d he says roughly as his fingers slide around my waist and grip my panties. As he pulls them up, the material sliding over my ass and hips, he places both of my legs on one of his shoulders until the panties slide over my ankles and he drops them to the bed near my hip. Then he pulls my right leg back over to his other shoulder and looks down again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to make it through another day unless I know how you taste. Can I taste you, baby?\u201d he asks as his hands slide from my ankles that are near his ears, down the front of my legs, then farther down as his fingers wrap around my inner thighs. I swallow hard, trying to get my voice to work, but all I can manage is a jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he breathes, lowering my legs from his shoulders. He places my feet on the bed and leans over me, causing his necklace to hit me between my breasts as his mouth opens over mine.</p><p>Sliding his tongue into my mouth, rocking his hips against me, I lift my legs, wanting to wrap them around him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulls my legs from around him with his hands wrapped around my ankles, then spreads them, holding my feet to the mattress, his arm muscles flexing as he spreads me wider and lowers his face, placing a kiss on my lower belly, making the muscles flex.</p><p>His nose runs across my pubic bone as he inhales a deep breath. My thighs start to shake as his hands slide from my ankles, up over my kneecaps, and down my inner thighs.</p><p>My breathing starts to feel rushed as I try to anticipate when his mouth will touch me. My fingers tangle in the sheets near my hips as his eyes meet mine. Even though I had been anticipating the touch of his tongue, my back arches, my head digs into the pillow, and my eyes close in bliss as his warm tongue runs over my clit then back down.</p><p>\u201cGive me your eyes,\u201d he growls. My head tips down and my eyes meet his as his tongue spreads across my sex. This time he does this thing, flicking his tongue in quick bursts while his thumbs hold me open.</p><p>My hands grab onto his hair and my heels dig into the mattress near his shoulders as I lift myself closer to his mouth, and his thumb slides inside me. He hums against my clit before pulling it into his mouth. My hips buck in response and my hands in his hair tug hard as he sucks mercilessly, pulling an orgasm from me that I didn\u2019t even feel building.</p><p>His name leaves my mouth on a loud moan. My nails scrape through his hair as I hold him to me, feeling the orgasm wash throughout my body.</p><p>I relax into the bed and drop my hands to my sides as he crawls up between my legs. His tongue sweeps across mine, leaving my taste and his behind. I wrap my legs around him as he leans back, and run my fingers down his scruffy jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou are seriously hot,\u201d I blurt then close my eyes, feeling like a dork. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckles and kisses under my jaw then runs a hand over my head before rolling off me to his back and pulling me over to his chest. I press my legs together as I feel how hard he is against my arm, which is resting across his abs.</p><p>I inhale a deep breath, letting the oxygen give me the courage I need, then move before he can stop me. I pull down the band of his boxers and stop dead as all the oxygen leaves my body.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I whisper. I knew he felt big when I had him in my hand, but he is huge, long and thick, the veins pronounced, the head red and angry-looking. I swallow hard as my mouth fills with saliva. I look up and meet his eyes. His body is frozen in place. I pull my hair over one shoulder, wrap my hand around him, and pull up the heavy weight of him with my hand, causing me to have another surge of wetness. I lower my head and lick over the tip, moaning as his taste explodes on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he growls as his hand fists into my hair at the side of my head. I lower my mouth completely over him, going down until he hits the back of my throat, making me gag. I lift up then down, keeping my cheeks hollow as I suck. When I reach the tip again, I release him from my mouth with a pop then use my hand, pulling up then down as I swirl my tongue around the tip.</p><p>His hand leaves my hair and lifts above his head so he can grab onto the headboard. The visual of him, his muscles taught as I bring him closer to release, makes me moan loud and slide down, causing him to once again hit the back of my throat. I move faster, working my hand along with my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d he groans, placing a hand on the side of my hair. My eyes meet his. I know he\u2019s giving me a chance to release him, but I just move faster, with my eyes locked on his as he comes hard. I swallow him down then swirl my tongue around the tip again before releasing him from my mouth. \u201cI almost lifted you up and impaled you on my cock, baby,\u201d he says, pulling me up his body with his hands under my arms. Once my mouth is near his, he places his hand on the back of my head and pulls my lips down to his, kissing me until my nails are digging into his chest.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize breathlessly, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize; that was hot. I just had to check myself,\u201d he says, tucking some hair behind my ear then searching my face. \u201cA friend of mine from the Navy is coming into town from California on Saturday and we\u2019re having a party for him. I want you there with me,\u201d he states, dragging his fingers through my hair, removing the knots he caused.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to my dad\u2019s birthday party Saturday, so I won\u2019t be able to,\u201d I say, tracing the tattoos that start at his shoulder and travel down to his wrist.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We can go after his party,\u201d he says, wrapping his hand around my neck to pull my face towards him.</p><p>I pull back and search his face then remind him, \u201cMy dad\u2019s going to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his birthday, so I would expect him to be there.\u201d He smiles, running a finger of his free hand down the center of my face.</p><p>\u201cYou want to meet my dad?\u201d I whisper in shock. Everyone is afraid of my dad, and I have never had any guy, even just friends, willing to meet him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. I can\u2019t tell the future, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change, so I would like to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad is very protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any man with all girls not to be,\u201d he says softly, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cWill you let me talk to him about us first?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready for the only man I have ever loved to meet the man I\u2019m falling in love with. This thing between Wes and me is still so new, and I don\u2019t want anything to ruin it.</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d he says gently.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smile, kissing him once more before my alarm goes off and we\u2019re forced to get up.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday, Dad,\u201d I say, walking up to where my dad is manning the barbeque.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He smiles, wrapping an arm around my shoulders and kissing the side of my head. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, working.\u201d I shrug then cringe, willing myself to tell him about Wes.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to take a break every once in awhile and come visit your old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him, and he kisses my head again.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d My mom smiles then looks around, and I jerk my head side-to-side before she asks exactly what I know she\u2019s going to.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring a date?\u201d she asks, and I take a breath and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dating, are you?\u201d my dad asks.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any help inside, Mom?\u201d I ask ignoring my dad\u2019s question. Not giving her a chance to answer, I take her elbow and lead her past the pool and into the house.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d she laughs, looking at my dad, who is still in front of the grill, but his body is turned toward the house, \u201care you still seeing that nice guy Wes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, really?\u201d I ask, going into the kitchen and pulling out platters from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I thought you would bring him, or that he would insist on coming today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to, but I asked him to let me tell Dad about him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell your father about him, and right now, when you had the perfect opportunity to tell him, you pulled me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I cover my face in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks, and I feel her hand on my back and uncover my face to look at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried Dad won\u2019t like him,\u201d I whisper, and her face goes soft.</p><p>\u201cHoney, what happens if he doesn\u2019t like him?\u201d she asks, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, feeling my chest constrict.</p><p>\u201cWhen I started dating your father, Grandpa was not exactly happy about it, but I knew your dad made me feel things I didn\u2019t even think were possible, and I also knew my dad loved me enough to know I knew what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Dad to like him,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cThen you need to give him a chance to get to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready, if our relationship is ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy beautiful girl is falling in love,\u201d she whispers, and I close my eyes, not wanting her to see how true that statement is. I\u2019m falling in love with a guy I barely know.</p><p>\u201cI think I just need a little more time,\u201d I tell her, finally opening my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust don\u2019t wait too long, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise I won\u2019t,\u201d I say as my insides twist.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hot.\u201d She smiles after a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I shriek, looking at her.</p> <p>\u201cHe is, and that kiss he gave you when he walked into you house. \u201cVery nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?

Bye, Dad!\u201d I yell out my car window to my parents, who are standing on the front porch with their arms wrapped around each other.</p><p>\u201cBye, honey,\u201d my mom calls back as my dad lifts his chin as I back out.</p><p>After dinner, we FaceTimed my sisters while we sang him happy birthday before cutting his cake. I missed my sisters, but with all of them going to college out of state, it was hard for all of us to get together like we used to when we were all home. The good thing is over the next few years, all of my sisters will be moving back to town one-by-one as they finish college. I pull out onto the main road and press send on Wes\u2019 number when it pulls up on my call log.</p> <p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d he answers, and I hear music in the background then moving.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say when his side goes quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou on your way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cGood, I miss you,\u201d he says, lowering his tone\u2014not like he\u2019s trying to hide what he\u2019s saying, but like he is really happy I will be there soon.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I smile again, turning onto another road.</p><p>\u201cHow did things go with your dad?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I don\u2019t want to lie, but I don\u2019t want to tell him I never even mentioned him to my dad, and that I actually tackled Jax to the ground when he was going to say something about Wes to his dad.</p> <p>\u201cHe had a great birthday,\u201d I say, playing dumb while hoping he doesn\u2019t ask anything else\u2014at least, not yet, not until I\u2019ve spoken to my dad, which I will do soon. Okay, maybe not soon, but sooner, rather than later. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop by my house and change really quick, and then I will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I wore a dress to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome straight here,\u201d he growls, and the space between my legs tingles.</p><p>\u201cWes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome straight here, July,\u201d he demands, causing the tingle to become a shiver of excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d I say, and the phone goes dead. I drop it into my lap and attempt to focus on driving, not on the ache that the tone of his voice caused.</p><p>When I pull up outside of the compound, Wes is waiting out front. My mouth waters as I take him in. Wearing a white tank that shows off his tattoos, his cut over it, a pair of jeans, and his black boots, leaning against the building with a beer in his hand at his hip.</p><p>I shut off my car and check my face in the mirror, noticing that my eyes are bright with excitement and happiness. They travel from my reflection to Wes, and his eyes hold me in a trance as I unlock my seatbelt and fumble until I get my door open.</p><p>The moment my sandal-covered foot touches the ground, Wes steps away from the building. I clear the door and slam it behind me, and his eyes run over me from head to toe. I left my hair down after I got out of the shower this afternoon, so it dried with messy waves. The dress is the color of buttercups. It has wide straps, and the top of the dress is snug, with buttons down the front, the bottom flaring out at the hips, making it look like I have the perfect hourglass figure.</p><p>I let out a long breath and wipe my hands down the front, trying to settle my nerves.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be cool with my boys seeing you like this,\u201d he places a hand on my waist and dragging my body close to his until we\u2019re hip-to-hip. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he says as his eyes take me in.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smile, placing my hand on the leather of his cut, sliding up to wrap around the back of his neck so I can pull him down to kiss me.</p><p>\u201cI should just take you back to your house,\u201d he whispers as his mouth hovers just out of reach of mine.</p><p>\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t get to meet your friend,\u201d I tell him, pressing up on my toes, trying to reach his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>I smile when I finally get the kiss I had been waiting for, and somehow end up with my legs wrapped around his hips and my arms wrapped around his neck, my back pressing into the door of my car. When we finally end our make-out session, he leads me inside and straight to the bar towards a group of guys who are talking.</p><p>The moment we\u2019re close, the conversation stops and one of the guys turns to look at us. His hair is low to his scalp, his face ruggedly handsome, almost so much so that it\u2019s intimidating. His eyes sweep over me and heat slightly then drop to the hand Wes has wrapped around my hip. Then they travel up to meet mine again, and this time, the heat is gone and understanding is in its place.</p><p>\u201cSo this is her, huh?\u201d he asks, looking over my shoulder at Wes.</p><p>\u201cBaby, this is Tuck. Tuck, this is July,\u201d Wes introduces us.</p><p>\u201cTuck?\u201d I ask, and Wes chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know how I got that nickname.\u201d He shakes his head and sticks out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. Seems you have my boy strung out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I tell him as I shake his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He looks over my shoulder and smiles as he drops my hand. \u201cSo what\u2019s your poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to drink tonight,\u201d I say, shaking my head as memories of the last time I was here come to mind.</p><p>\u201cOne shot?\u201d he questions, and Wes squeezes my side then whispers in my ear, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t challenge anyone to a dance-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d I huff, looking over my shoulder at him and smiling.</p><p>\u201cShot, shot, shot,\u201d is cheered, and I shoot back a shot of tequila and slam the glass down on the table then cover my mouth with my hand, wincing as the taste floods my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGahhh, I hate tequila.\u201d I laugh then pick up another shot.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Wes laughs, taking the shot from my hand, lifting it to his mouth and shooting it back then wrapping a hand around the back of my neck and pulling my mouth to his. He presses his tongue into my mouth until I moaned down his throat.</p><p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d Tuck says, pouring another shot.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d Wes smiles, kissing me again, this time below my ear.</p><p>\u201cSo have you taken July to meet Mama Judy?\u201d Tuck asks, sitting back in his chair and taking a pull from his beer.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, I was thinking this weekend,\u201d Wes says, rubbing my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cUh...what?\u201d I wheeze out.</p><p>\u201cShe has next weekend off, so I figured we could take a ride up to Nashville.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Z?\u201d I ask, changing the subject before the conversation can turn to family and parents.</p><p>\u201cHe and your girl were supposed to be on their way when you called.\u201d</p><p>I frown then pull out my phone and check the time. \u201cI got here over an hour ago,\u201d I say, and my frown grows deeper as I dial her number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Kayan answers breathlessly then moans and I feel my face heat up.</p><p>\u201cI...uh...later.\u201d I hang up and set the phone on the table, whispering, \u201cI think they were having sex.\u201d</p><p>Wes and Tuck both start laughing and the music gets turned up, so I look around, noticing more people have shown up, and by more people, I mean more women, all of them wearing close to nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Wes asks, and I nod and look at the bottle of tequila when loud explosions fill my ears. Wes and Tuck both shove me under the table. My knees and hands hit the concrete hard, causing me to yell out in pain. Then the table is flipped to its side, blocking my view as women begin to scream, and the guys in the open court start yelling out at each other.</p><p>I tuck myself into a ball and cover my head with my hands when I realize they were gunshots. I don\u2019t know how long it lasts, but before I even think it\u2019s safe, Wes is picking me up off the ground and running, with me tucked in front of his body. My eyes are squeezed shut and my pulse is going haywire as I\u2019m set down on a soft mattress.</p><p>\u201cBaby, open your eyes.\u201d I shake my head, trying to clear the loud ringing in my ears. \u201cBaby.\u201d I feel his hands hold my face and my eyes open, blinking a few times. \u201cThere you are,\u201d he says, pulling me forward and placing a gentle kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou good, man?\u201d Wes pulls his mouth from mine and we both turn our heads toward the open doorway, where Tuck is standing, holding a gun.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His eyes leave his friends and come back to me and then flash, and he begins touching everywhere on my body until he gets to my knees, where they are scraped and bloody from hitting the concrete so hard. \u201cShit. Get me the first aid kit from the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll just wash it with some water,\u201d I assure him then look towards the door, but Tuck is already out of sight.</p><p>\u201cWho did that?\u201d I ask, and his jaw clenches.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he grits out. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you cleaned up then head out with the boys. Tuck will stay here and watch over you until I get back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d I whisper desperately. No way do I want him out where he can get shot at.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d Tuck says, coming back into the room and setting down what looks like a tackle box on the bed next to me, and Wes opens it up and starts to pull out supplies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here with July,\u201d Wes tells Tuck, wiping off my bloody knee.</p><p>\u201cFuck no, I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t get in trouble when you\u2019re on leave, brother,\u201d Wes tells him, and I look at Tuck and see that his jaw is hard and his fists are balled at his sides.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me,\u201d I plead, looking back at Wes, who gently cleans my wounds then covers them with some kind of ointment. If it weren\u2019t for the hardness of his jaw, I would guess he hadn\u2019t heard me. He closes up the box then pulls out a gun from under his mattress, drops his fist into the bed near my hip, and kisses me before standing up to his full height again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I ask, but he ignores me then looks at Tuck.</p><p>\u201cWatch her,\u201d he tells him.</p><p>\u201cWes!\u201d I cry, getting up from the bed and going after him, only to be grabbed with an arm around my waist that prevents me from following behind him. I kick out with everything I have, but my strength is no match for Tuck, who only holds me tighter against him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get himself hurt,\u201d I say, attempting to breathe.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Tuck argues, and my body slumps against him when I realize he\u2019s not going to help me. He walks backward two steps and sets me on the bed.</p><p>I look towards the exit and hear Tuck mutter, \u201cFuck,\u201d under his breath as he moves to the door and closes it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going after him. He would kill me if something happened to you while I was on watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot expect me to just sit here and do nothing while he\u2019s doing God knows what!\u201d I yell, standing up and looking around the room for something to throw at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I expect you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. I need to go out there. What if someone needs my help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one was hurt, and even if they were, you\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my phone,\u201d I try again, hoping he will let me go look for it.</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d He shakes his head then mutters, \u201cI see what he meant,\u201d while running a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I need it. Can you call Z to ask if he and Kayan are okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he growls, pulling out his phone from his back pocket, pressing a couple buttons and putting his phone to his ear, then mutters a few things while watching me before putting his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYour friend is fine. She\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I call her?\u201d I ask, and he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d I murmur, flopping down on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you have a gun or I would totally Kung Fu your ass and leave whether you liked it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He shakes his head. I scoot back in the bed then lean back against the wall, crossing my arms over my chest and glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cHow is it I have been with my friend in some of the worst environments known to man, but after meeting you, I\u2019m more concerned for his wellbeing than I ever was?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d I frown.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the truth. I have never seen him mixed up over a woman. Even his ex-wife didn\u2019t affect him like you do,\u201d he says, and the breath I was going to take pauses in my lungs. I had no idea Wes was ever married. He never told me.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Tuck says, sitting on the bed at my side. \u201cSorry, I thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to look at him and swallow around the lump that has painfully formed in my throat before speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s fine; we haven\u2019t known each other long,\u201d I admit with what I hope looks like a smile.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t even mention it,\u201d I assure him, leaning my head back against the wall and closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I hear and open my eyes then frown in confusion as I look at Wes, but I feel warmth under my cheek and the steady rise and fall of the chest I\u2019m lying on with my arms wrapped over a hard stomach. I look from a pissed off Wes to Tuck, whose eyes are open, looking down at me.</p><p>I scoot back quickly and look at Wes again while trying to get my bearings straight. \u201cI fell asleep,\u201d I say to him and myself.</p><p>\u201cI see that, babe,\u201d he growls then looks at Tuck. \u201cI need to talk with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrother, do not even fucking go there,\u201d Tuck says, and Wes\u2019 jaw grinds.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Wes clips, not taking his eyes off his friend.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know, or you\u2019re not going to tell me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern you,\u201d he says, causing my temper to flare.</p><p>\u201cIf it concerns you, it concerns me,\u201d I retort, crossing my arms over my chest when his eyes come to mine.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start your shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d I ask, getting off the bed.</p><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t start your shit, not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d I hiss then look at Tuck. \u201cI told you to let me leave, but no, you just had to listen to this jerk.\u201d I see the corners of his lips twitch, but I ignore it and walk past Wes towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder to sweep my eyes over him then mutter, \u201cHome, to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving without me.\u201d</p><p>I snort in disbelief and head out the door, only to be pulled back. \u201cLet me go,\u201d I hiss.</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d he replies close to my ear then growls, \u201cIf I ever see you touching another man, even unconsciously, I will kill him, friend or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asleep,\u201d I whisper in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself!\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou have turned me into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for you\u2019re insanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to attest that my friend was never like this before you,\u201d Tuck says, and I look at him and glare. \u201cJust saying.\u201d He holds up his hands in front of him.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re going to tell me what happened while you were gone, let me go,\u201d I growl, and his arms tighten around me.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I would let my woman get involved in what went down tonight?\u201d he asks, making it sound like I\u2019m the crazy one.</p><p>\u201cDid I ask you to take me along on a drive-by? No. I asked what happened, if you found anything out, if you know who shot up the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014you\u2019re not getting involved.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just about ready to flip out, when I\u2019m cut off.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. You\u2019re not getting involved. There is no reason for you to know what happened tonight,\u201d Jax says, standing in the open doorway of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are so ridiculous.\u201d I shift out of Wes\u2019 hold and turn on him. \u201cI was here when this place was shot up. I\u2019m not asking you to go into detail about what went down; I just want to know I can go to bed tonight without worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d Wes tells me, and his voice gentles as his hand comes up so his fingers can run across my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being shot at, and I hate that this is happening because of me,\u201d I say, pressing my cheek into his hand.</p><p>His jaw goes hard and his eyes leave me to look at the door. \u201cThis has nothing to do with what\u2019s been happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d I ask, searching his face, then look at Jax when I notice Wes is still regarding him like he wants to kill him.</p><p>\u201cI asked Wes to help me out with something,\u201d Jax cuts in. \u201cThe people his boys were watching must have caught wind of the situation and made it clear they knew we were watching them.\u201d</p><p>I look from Jax to Wes then back again. I want to strangle my cousin for getting Wes involved in whatever it is he\u2019s doing, but I know Wes well enough to understand the only way he would ever be involved in anything is if it was something he believed in. So what can I really say about that?</p><p>\u201cIs it safe for me to go home?\u201d I ask, as his jaw goes hard again and he glances at Tuck and then me.</p><p>\u201cCan I trust you to take her home and wait for me to get there?\u201d Wes asks Tuck.</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t even have to ask that shit,\u201d Tuck returns.</p><p>\u201cApparently, I do,\u201d Wes replies, and I throw my arms up.</p><p>\u201cI was asleep!\u201d I repeat again, which only makes his jaw tic harder.</p><p>\u201cI found this outside,\u201d Jax says, breaking the moment by handing me my phone, which shows I have a few missed calls from Kayan.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter then look at Wes. \u201cPlease, be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be good,\u201d he says, and his lips touch mine briefly before his hand goes to the middle of my back. Once we\u2019re outside, I look around and notice there are a few bullet holes in the building and one in my trunk, which I\u2019ll have to find a sticker or something to cover it with before someone in my family sees it and wonders why the hell there\u2019s a bullet hole in my car.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get it fixed,\u201d Wes says when he notices I have stopped to look at the hole.</p><p>I exhale a harsh breath then listen as he gives Tuck directions to my house before buckling me into the passenger seat with a kiss to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cSee why I\u2019m worried about him?\u201d Tuck says as we pull away from the building with Wes looking at us like he is going to run after us. I ignore his statement and put my phone to my ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, my God! I have been trying to get in touch with you. Are you okay?\u201d Kayan says as soon as she answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine; I just got my phone back. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m at Z\u2019s house. We were on our way there when someone called to tell him what happened, and he turned his car around, brought me here, and dropped me off before leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you anything?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, just that he would be back. Where are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way home. Wes said he would be at my house in a couple of hours, so my guess is Z will be about that long as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe let you go home alone?\u201d she asks in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tuck is my babysitter.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Tuck?\u201d she asks, and I look out the window.</p><p>\u201cHe is one of Wes\u2019 friends from the military,\u201d I explain then yawn as the day catches up with me.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep and call me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, girl. All this drama is almost more than I can take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like you were taking it just fine when I called you earlier,\u201d I whisper and hear her giggle.</p><p>\u201cShut up. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d I say, hitting the end button on my phone just as we pull up to my house.</p><p>I get out of the car and head up to the front door with Tuck following close behind me. As soon as we get inside, I pick up Capone and scratch him behind his ears then let him go to the floor, where he runs circles around Tuck. Then I pick up Juice and give him some love before setting him back on the table and going to the couch, taking a seat so I can unbuckle my sandals and slip them off.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a beer or something?\u201d I ask Tuck, who has taken a seat on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You go on to bed,\u201d he says, picking up the remote and pressing the TV on.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I mutter, watching absently as the channels flip from one thing to another.</p><p>His finger comes off the remote, his head turns toward me, and his face goes soft. \u201cBabe, go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I mumble, standing back up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He nods then turns back to the TV and begins flipping through the channels again. I head to my room and shut the door behind me then go to the shower, turning it on hot before stripping off my clothes and stepping in.</p><p>The moment the hot water rushes over me, I sigh in relief. I don\u2019t take long getting washed up before drying off and going to my room. Normally, I would just get into bed without putting anything on, but knowing Tuck is here has me pulling out a set of pajamas and slipping them on before crawling into bed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d I sigh as Wes slides in behind me and his smell engulfs my senses.</p><p>\u201cI like that you call this my home,\u201d he whispers, placing a kiss on the back of my neck. I try to reply, but sleep takes me away before I can get anything out.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>I look out the front window of Wes\u2019 truck, watching as the rain beats mercilessly against the windshield, and my leg bounces in sync with the wipers.</p><p>\u201cBabe, relax,\u201d Wes says as he takes my hand, placing it on his thigh. I look over at him and try to release, through a breath the stress that has been swarming in my stomach since he picked me up a half-hour ago.</p><p>We\u2019re going to meet his mom. I\u2019m nervous...so nervous that I want to jump out of his truck and try my luck with hitting the road at seventy miles an hour.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to love you,\u201d he tells me, and I look out the window, wondering if he said that before to his ex-wife the first time she met his mom.</p><p>\u201cDid she like your ex-wife?\u201d I ask then kick my ass around in my head when I feel the muscles of his thigh contract. \u201cSorry, Tuck told me. He didn\u2019t mean to, and I promised I wouldn\u2019t say anything, but it just slipped out,\u201d I ramble, pulling my hand from his leg.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding it,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know. I told him we haven\u2019t known each other long. I totally get it,\u201d I reply just as quietly.</p><p>\u201cMy mom did like her,\u201d he answers, making me regret asking when that all too familiar feeling of jealousy begins to ignite in my stomach. \u201cWe met right after Hell Week. I was still on a high from making it through SEAL training.\u201d He pauses and pulls my hand back to his thigh and places his hand over it. \u201cShe had the whole girl-next-door thing going for her. I thought she was a sweet, beautiful woman, and I was gone so much that it took me far too long to realize she wasn\u2019t at all who I thought she was. She married me so she could say her man was in the military. The moment I started talking about getting out, things went to shit. She was more concerned about what her friends would say than how I was feeling going into work everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, squeezing his thigh.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago, right after I got out of the military, we got divorced. I know it may sound fucked up, but I don\u2019t even think about her,\u201d he confesses, and I have no idea what to say about that. I can\u2019t imagine being married and having the person I promised to spend my life with become nothing, not even a thought in my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d He clasps my hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get out of the military?\u201d I ask after a moment, trying to fill the uncomfortable silence.</p><p>\u201cMe and my boys had been on a rescue mission. One of our own had been kidnapped, and they were being held by insurgents who wanted us to give them back one of their men. The US doesn\u2019t negotiate with terrorist, but they will attempt to rescue their people if they think they can. We were sent in and found out too late that it was a setup. I lost three of my brothers when everything went to shit, and the rest of us barely made it out alive,\u201d he confides then runs his hand over mine, and I notice my fingers have dug into his denim-covered thigh. \u201cComing home from that solidified what I needed to do, and I knew it was time for me to leave the military and do something else with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost your friends,\u201d I say, feeling tears sting my nose.</p><p>\u201cMe too, baby.\u201d He gives my hand a squeeze.</p><p>I look over at his profile and can tell he\u2019s not with me but back there, so I attempt to lighten the mood by asking, \u201cSo you decided to become a biker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass,\u201d he mutters, smiling at the windshield before bringing his eyes to me for a brief moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah, me and my boys had always ridden on weekends when we were home, and we all did our own repairs and custom work on our bikes, so it seemed like fate was leading us down this path long before we moved to Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it lead you here,\u201d I say softly, giving his thigh a pat.</p><p>\u201cMe and you both, babe,\u201d he murmurs then takes his hand off mine to turn onto another road then another until we pull up outside a small light blue house with white shutters and a small porch that is covered with flowers.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head as a woman with long white hair wearing a pair of jeans, cowboy boots, and a t-shirt steps out onto the front porch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you face down a gang of angry bikers. This will be a walk in the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d I mumble, and he kisses my nose and I watch as he gets out of the truck. I unhook my belt then find the handle at the same time he opens the door for me.</p><p>His hands go to my waist and he lifts me out of the cab, holding onto me until my ballet flat-covered feet hit the ground. Then he moves me out of the way, slams the door, puts his arm around my waist, and leads me up to the house.</p><p>The moment we hit the top landing of the porch, his mom wraps her arms around him, whispering something in his ear before releasing him, turning to look at me.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I want you to meet July. July, this is my mom, Judy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you.\u201d I stick out my hand and she surprises me by pulling me into an embrace that fills me with warmth.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She smiles then laughs, patting my cheek. \u201cI feel like I know you already. Every time I talk to my son, he tells me about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, feeling my cheeks heat in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. You have definitely woven a web around my son.\u201d</p><p>I look from her to Wes, unsure of what to say about that, but then don\u2019t say anything, because she is taking my hand and leading me into the house, leaving Wes on the front porch, shaking his head.</p> <p>Once we get inside, the smell of cinnamon and apples touches my nose, reminding me of home. I follow Judy without choice through the living room and into the kitchen, where she leads me to the small island.</p><p>\u201cSit here,\u201d she says, dropping my hand. I hold back the laugh I feel and take a seat on one of her barstools to watch as she pulls a beautiful pie out of the oven and sets it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cPulling out the big guns, Mom?\u201d Wes asks, kissing the side of my head before taking a seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love to bake,\u201d she states, smiling and spinning the pie around slightly. I wish I had half the baking skills she does; the whole pie looks like it could be in a magazine.</p><p>\u201cThat would be true if you didn\u2019t leave the evidence of your baking skills in your garbage,\u201d Wes says, and I follow his eyes to the trashcan, where there is a box that once contained the apple pie sitting on top of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a know-it-all.\u201d His mom laughs, hitting him with the hot oven mitt in her hand, making me laugh. \u201cJust so you know, honey, this is his favorite pie. They have it at every store and all you have to do is put it in the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I suck at baking,\u201d I tell her, and her face goes soft.</p><p>\u201cMe too, but my boy didn\u2019t know I couldn\u2019t until he turned sixteen and found the first box from a frozen apple pie I had made him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew when I was ten,\u201d Wes confesses, and her eyes go to him.</p><p>\u201cYou did not!\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cI did; I had a sleepover at a friend\u2019s and his mom had bought one, and it looked and tasted just like yours. I just didn\u2019t confront you about it until I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, but her gaze on him is soft and so full of love that I feel it all the way down to my toes.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you two meet?\u201d she asks, going to a cupboard and pulling out three plates, setting them in front of us.</p><p>\u201cMe and the boys were out riding when this biker swerved and tried to run me off the road,\u201d Wes says, and his mom\u2019s face pales.</p><p>\u201cI swerved to miss a bird that was in the road,\u201d I defend, pulling Judy\u2019s eyes to me. \u201cIts wing was broken, and I didn\u2019t want to kill it. After I swerved, your son and his friends chased me down on their bikes,\u201d I tattle, and she inhales a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell her how you stun-gunned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my...\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and glare at him, then hiss, \u201cYou scared me and it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh lord,\u201d Judy whispers, and I turn to look at her. Her eyes go from him to me, and the same look I saw on my mom\u2019s face when she met Wes appears on hers. \u201cThat will be a good story for your kids one day,\u201d she cheers blissfully then turns around, leaving me sitting there like a fish out of water, with my mouth gaping while she goes over to a drawer, opening it up and pulling out forks.</p><p>\u201cClose your mouth, babe,\u201d Wes chortles, pushing up on my chin. I turn to look at him, noticing he doesn\u2019t even look slightly taken aback by his mom\u2019s comment. I double-blink then snap my mouth closed.</p><p>\u201cSo, you ride a bike also?\u201d Judy asks while cutting a piece of pie and placing it on the plate in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI do...well, not a Harley, but a sport bike,\u201d I tell her, smiling.</p><p>\u201cMy ex used to ride, and I hate that my son rides. I worry about him everyday, but I know it\u2019s something that makes him happy. I\u2019m glad you guys have that in common,\u201d she says, and Wes\u2019 hand wraps around the back of my neck and he pulls me closer to him so he can place a kiss above my ear.</p><p>\u201cMy mom rides, and it was always something we did together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does your dad feel about it?\u201d Judy asks.</p><p>\u201cThe first bike I ever had, I was constantly having to refill the tires with air, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why. And I wouldn\u2019t ride it, because it was too risky. Then one day, I went to the garage and found my dad taking the cap off the nozzle on the tires. He hated that I was riding, so he was sabotaging my bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, I don\u2019t feel so bad.\u201d His mom smiles and I smile back, taking a bite of the pie, and I have to agree; even if it was frozen, it is seriously delicious.</p><p>By the time we leave, I have completely fallen in love with Wes\u2019 mom, and I know that if the time ever comes for our parents to meet, my mom and dad will both love her too.</p><p>\u201cI love your mom,\u201d I tell Wes as we head back to my house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTold you.\u201d He smiles, squeezing my thigh.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stay at my house tonight?\u201d I ask, not knowing why I even bother asking, \u2019cause he has stayed with me every night since the first time he crawled into my bed.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he starts, and I can tell he\u2019s trying not to laugh, \u201cI haven\u2019t even been to my place in three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird how this thing has been happening between us,\u201d I say quietly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has been at warp speed since our first date, or what would have been our first date, if you hadn\u2019t ruined it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you forgot about that,\u201d he mumbles, but I can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNope, I still remember, and will probably use it as leverage for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou plan on knowing me that long?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I reply, wondering why the hell I just said that.</p><p>\u201cGlad to know even in warp speed we\u2019re on the same page,\u201d he says, and I pull my eyes away from him and look out the window.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to fall in love in such a short time, but if it is, I\u2019m in love with Wes Silver.

I lift my chin and step away from the bike I\u2019m working on while wiping my hands on a greasy rag. \u201cI have some news about Snake,\u201d he says, and my jaw grinds at the mention of his name. As much as I don\u2019t want to be involved with this shit, I know I have to be. It\u2019s not in me to sit by while good, innocent people are hurt. \u201cHe was seen leaving a meeting in downtown Nashville this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the meeting was with Franco Demitrez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to mean something to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe controls one of the largest sex trafficking and prostitution rings this side of the Mississippi,\u201d he says, and my gut twists. I had known for a while that what was happening with Snake and his boys was bad, but this takes this shit to a whole different level.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate asking you for any favors,\u201d he starts, and my eyes narrow. Since the first moment we met he has been asking my crew to help him with shit. \u201cI need you and your boys to help me secure some girls their moving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what? Do you even know the level of fucked-up you\u2019re dealing with right now? You can\u2019t just sweep in and you sure as fuck need to have a plan in place for when it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that, I also understand that Landon came to talk to me.\u201d He says pulling his hat off and running a hand over his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d I ask, Landon\u2019s dad owns Mamma\u2019s Country; he\u2019s the kid that was dropping off dogs to July, the same kid July asked me to help.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Landon has a sister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ronnie never mentioned having another kid, not to me and I never saw a girl around.</p><p>\u201cHe does but Snakes boys took her and that\u2019s the leverage they have been holding over Ronnie that\u2019s why things went to shit at Mamma\u2019s Country.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon heard one of Snake\u2019s boys talking about some girls that they were holding and Landon thinks his sister will be with them.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I grunt, disgusted. \u201cLet me talk to the guys.

Harlen, you find out everything you can about this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Mic says, walking away, followed by Everret and Harlen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need someone to watch the girls when we can\u2019t,\u201d Z states, and I run a hand over my head then look at him.</p><p>\u201cJax and the boys will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they kill to protect them? Die to protect them?\u201d he asks, and I think about Jax, Talon and Sage and I know they would. \u201cThey would do whatever is necessary,\u201d I assure him.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone, not yet, \u2019cause it\u2019s so early, but Kayan\u2019s pregnant,\u201d he confides, and all I can do is stare at him. \u201cWe weren\u2019t planning on this happening. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even planning on her.\u201d He scrubs his hand down his face, and when his eyes meet mine, I notice for the first time in years that he looks happy.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you move fast,\u201d I mutter, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhen she told me she was pregnant, I thought I was going to fucking pass out. I have never been so scared in my life.\u201d He shakes his head and looks out the bay door then back at me. \u201cI never put much thought into the future until her,\u201d he says, and I get that. Even when I was married, I didn\u2019t think about the future or having children. I didn\u2019t think about anything but my next mission. Seeing July changed all of that. I want tomorrow and seventy years from now with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, brother.\u201d I pull him in for a one-arm hug then lean back just enough to see his face and wrap my hand around the side of his neck, smiling. \u201cYou ever think two years ago this would have happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d He shakes his head and I let him go.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d I didn\u2019t expect to find a woman who fits me perfectly, a woman who makes me want to slide a ring on her finger just so I can show everyone she\u2019s mine, a woman who brings out every possessive and protective instinct I didn\u2019t even know I had. But that\u2019s what I found the day I met July Mayson. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask Z, who suddenly looks worried.</p><p>\u201cNever been in love. You know my family\u2019s fucked up,\u201d he says, and I nod. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what love feels like.\u201d</p><p>Fuck... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI worry I won\u2019t do her justice,\u201d he admits, rubbing his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s love, brother.

He doesn\u2019t say anything, just walks me backward until the backs of my knees hit the bed and I\u2019m falling, landing with him on top of me.</p><p>\u201cYou smell good.\u201d His tongue licks up the column of my throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I question, wrapping my arms around his neck and my leg around his hip.</p><p>His mouth lands on mine, and his tongue slides across my bottom lip as I open up for him, tilting my head to the side. The moment his taste floods my mouth, I moan and let my hands travel down his back then up his shirt, feeling his hot skin under my palms. I pull his shirt up until he\u2019s forced to release my mouth, and he sits back, pulling his shirt off over his head then comes back to me. His hand slips behind my back, and the bra I had just put on is quickly unhooked. He slips it off first one arm then the other before pulling it away from my chest \u0327 returning his mouth to mine as his hand runs up my side, stopping at the underside of my breast.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d I mewl, and his thumb sweeps over my nipple. That one swipe has my core tightening and wetness flooding between my legs. There is nothing I want more than him inside me, but every time we get close to going there, he pulls away, and that thought has my nails scratching down his back and my head digging into the pillow as his mouth travels down my jaw and neck.</p><p>I tilt my head down to look at him as he shifts, palming my breast in one large hand then licking over my nipple before kissing down between my breasts, down my stomach, teasing around my belly button.</p><p>\u201cLift your ass, babe,\u201d he commands as he unsnaps my jeans. I lift my hips off the bed as he pulls them over my ass and down my legs. My hands go to the bed near my hips as I begin to pant. The thought of his mouth on me has my body lighting up in anticipation. \u201cYou\u2019re swollen and wet, baby,\u201d he breathes over my core, using his thumbs to spread me open.</p><p>I tilt my head down, and the moment our eyes meet, he licks up my center. My head falls back onto the bed, my eyes squeeze closed, and I lift myself higher then run a hand over his head. \u201cI want to touch you,\u201d I hiss as his tongue licks back and forth over my clit, causing an ache to fill my lower belly.</p><p>He grunts and my hips stir as his fingers play just outside my entrance, torturing me.</p><p>\u201cWes, please stop,\u201d I cry, needing more than he\u2019s giving me, but instead of filling me with his fingers like I want, his hands go to my thighs and he holds me open, pulling my clit into his mouth. My head presses harder into the bed and my legs lift me higher to his mouth then slam closed around his ears as that ache in my lower stomach explodes.</p><p>\u201cWes!\u201d I scream as my head thrashes against the pillow.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he growls, climbing up between my legs, taking my mouth in a deep kiss that makes that unfulfilled throbbing below burn. His fingers run between my legs again, but I can\u2019t take anymore. I roll him to his back, sit up with my hands on his chest, and look down at him before lowering my head and kissing him, pressing my tongue into his mouth then moaning as his hands wrap around my breasts, his fingers pulling on my nipples.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaking my stomach, baby,\u201d he says, and I lean back then scoot down his body enough to pull him free of his boots, jeans, and boxers. The moment my hand wraps around his width, my core tightens and his hips buck up. Blinded by want, I adjust, straddle him, and impale myself.</p><p>My breath hisses out, my head flies back, and my hands scratch down his chest and abs as he fills and stretches me.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I hear him grunt, and my head lowers, our eyes connect, and my body stills. I watch him swallow, the look in his eyes unlike anything I have ever seen. One of his hands goes to my ass, the other splaying over my lower stomach, his thumb pressing down on my clit as he starts rocking me back and forth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to get anything done. All I\u2019m going to think about is this pussy, how hot it is.\u201d He circles my clit. \u201cHow wet it is.\u201d His hand on my ass comes down hard, the pain and heat making me whimper. \u201cHow tight it is.\u201d He rocks me harder while lifting his hips up. I feel every single inch of him, all of them hitting the places deep inside me that make it hard to even think.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d I moan, lifting my hands to my breasts and pulling my nipples. My head falls back as I drop myself down, meeting each of his upward thrusts, that unfulfilled ache full and overflowing, expanding through my body.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby, you\u2019re squeezing me so fucking hard,\u201d he growls, thrusting faster, each upward assault causing my breath to pause. Then, it happens. I scream out, stars light behind my eyes, and my body implodes.</p><p>He flips me to my back, lowers his mouth over mine, and kisses me as his hips pound into me. My legs wrap around his hips and my hands hold onto his shoulders as his mouth leaves mine. He nips and kisses down my neck until he reaches my breast, where he pulls my nipple into his mouth and bites down, causing another orgasm to light through my body.</p><p>\u201cI want one more,\u201d he says, and my head rocks back and forth against the pillow. \u201cYes,\u201d he growls as his hand slides between us and his mouth latches onto my other nipple, pulling it into his mouth. He bites down hard as he thrusts twice more then stills, pressing deep inside me as I feel him become even larger. My arms and legs wrap tighter around him as his forehead drops to my shoulder. Our heartbeats beat rapidly against each other as we both fight for breath.</p><p>\u201cI knew the moment I got into you I was screwed. Fuck, I was right,\u201d he breathes against my sweat-soaked skin. My body stills, and he lifts his head and looks down at me. \u201cNever had anything sweeter than your pussy, baby.\u201d I smile and feel him jump deep inside me. \u201cYou have my dick thinking it\u2019s sixteen again.\u201d He kisses me before pulling out. \u201cI know you\u2019re on birth control, and I know I\u2019m clean. You good with us not using something every time I slide inside you?\u201d</p><p>I can only nod. He felt so amazing I can\u2019t imagine having something separating us. \u201cI want to take you again, but we\u2019re going to need a shower and food.\u201d I lick my lips as my eyes travel from his to his cock that is at half-mast, then my eyes fly up to meet his when he starts to laugh, making me frown. \u201cCat got your tongue, babe?\u201d he asks, and I sit up, ducking my head and blushing. My body is still on sensory overload right now. I can barely keep my thoughts straight, let alone talk right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to keep you quiet,\u201d he mutters, and I take a pillow and throw it at him.

Our plans of meeting up with his friends forgotten.</p><p>\u201cBabe, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d Wes asks, looking at me under the table.</p><p>\u201cI dropped something,\u201d I lie, feeling around on the floor like I really did drop something, but then regret it instantly when my hand runs over a piece of chewed-up gum. Eeewww! I wipe my hand on my jeans, cringing at the thought of what I just touched.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass up here,\u201d he growls, and my heart, which was already beating hard, begins to beat erratically at the idea of my Uncle Nico who had walked into the clubhouse moments before seeing me once I get out from under the table that I hid under.</p><p>Wes\u2019 eyes narrow and I reluctantly get out from my hiding space, and he wraps his arm around my shoulders and places a kiss on my hairline that has me closing my eyes, only to open them and come face-to-face with my uncle.</p><p>\u201cJuly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smile and give him a little wave while pleading with my eyes for him to not say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d he asks, looking between Wes and me.</p><p>So much for wishful thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou may want to watch how you\u2019re talking to my woman,\u201d Wes growls, making me cringe once again.</p><p>\u201cYour woman?\u201d Uncle Nico says, and I see something flash through his eyes, but I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up.</p><p>\u201cMy woman,\u201d Wes replies, and my body freezes and my lungs compress as I wait to see what\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>\u201cDoes my brother know his daughter is your woman?\u201d Uncle Nico asks, crossing his arms over his chest, looking between the two of us, and all I want to do is dive back under the table and hide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he does,\u201d Wes says, and I press my lips tighter together, because no way does my dad know about Wes.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d he asks, and Wes looks from him to me, where he searches my face. I know the moment he sees what I\u2019m trying to hide, because disappointment fills his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I start to explain, when he pulls his eyes from me, looks at Uncle Nico, and pulls his hand from behind my chair, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re here?\u201d Wes questions through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI told my nephew he needed to back off, but he and my sons are hard of hearing. Like I told them, I\u2019m telling you. Stay out of it and let the authorities handle what\u2019s going on,\u201d my uncle says, setting his fists on his hips. His words barely penetrate over the fact that even though Wes is right next to me, it feels like he\u2019s miles away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have no problems from me or my boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate that,\u201d Uncle Nico mumbles, and I\u2019m sure his eyes are on me, but mine are locked on Wes. I set my hand on Wes\u2019 thigh, and his muscles flex under my palm and his jaw goes hard at my touch.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper, wishing he could understand.</p><p>His eyes come to me and I see pain flash in their green depths before he stands. \u201cI\u2019m heading out. Did you need anything else?\u201d he asks my uncle, and my chest compresses under the pressure as a completely consuming pain slices through my body.</p><p>\u201cNah, we\u2019re good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMic,\u201d Wes calls, and Mic, who has been watching everything play out, looks from me to Wes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure July gets home okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Mic says, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I wheeze out, still stuck in place. This cannot be happening. I look at my uncle, who is watching me, looking concerned, and then his eyes go to Wes and so do mine, but all I\u2019m able to catch is his back as he walks out the door.</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d Uncle Nico calls, but I shake my head and place my hand to my throat as I attempt to fight for a breath. \u201cI\u2019ll take my niece home,\u201d he says gently, but before he can reach me, I stand and run towards the door Wes just left out. I slam through, causing the large metal door to bang loudly against the brick exterior. The moment the cool outside air hits my face, I see Wes straddle his bike. He stops, looks over his shoulder, and then turns back around, and the loud roar of his bike fills the air.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me, but I\u2019m sorry. I just couldn\u2019t tell him. No matter how many times I tried, I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>I see him shake his head and his boots leave the gravel as he takes off. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I whimper as pain explodes through my chest and I fall to my knees on the gravel.</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d Uncle Nico says, picking me up like he used to when I was a little girl. I hold onto him as tears stream down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI was so stupid,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cLove makes us stupid,\u201d he says gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you he doesn\u2019t.\u201d He sets me in his truck.</p><p>I inhale a few deep breaths then shake out my hands, trying to get myself under control enough that I can figure out what my next move needs to be. \u201cI\u2019ll drive myself home,\u201d I tell Uncle Nico while hopping down from his truck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good Idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying right now, and my house is five minutes away. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes search my face for a moment and he shakes his head. I know he doesn\u2019t want to let me go, but he knows he doesn\u2019t have a choice. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agree, pulling my keys from my pocket and getting into my Jeep. I turn down the music so I can focus on driving. It takes only a few minutes to get home, and I wave Uncle Nico off then look at my house. The windows are dark, and I know when I get inside I will be greeted by emptiness, and that thought brings a fresh wave of tears to my eyes.</p><p>I let out a ragged breath, pick up my cell phone out of my cup holder, and dial.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I sob like an idiot when he answers the phone.</p><p>\u201cJuly?\u201d he asks, and I rest my forehead on the steering wheel of my car and will myself to calm down enough to talk.</p><p>\u201cDad, I need to tell you something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you tell me you\u2019re pregnant, I\u2019m killing someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love,\u201d I cry then sniffle, covering my face. \u201cDad?\u201d I pull the phone from my ear and look at the screen when the phone stays silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he says softly, and I hear shuffling. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Dad.

I love him, Dad...like really, really love him.\u201d I cry harder, my breath hiccupping with each gulp of air.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018compound\u2019?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBike compound,\u201d I explain then shake my head. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter, Dad. Are you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBike compound?\u201d he asks, and I can hear the frown in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cA place bikers hang out, Dad. Focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you mean bicyclist, and not an MC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I yell, becoming more and more frustrated.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he clips, then I hear more shuffling. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I freeze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at your house in twenty minutes max.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d he says and hangs up.</p><p>I pull the phone from my ear and look at it for a long moment while wondering just how stupid I am. \u201cOh, shit!\u201d I scream, getting out of the car and coming face-to-face with Mic, who\u2019s standing with his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWas gonna knock on your window, but you were on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to my dad,\u201d I tell him, drying my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d He puts his arm around my shoulders and leads me up to my house.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Wes?\u201d I ask him, and he shakes his head, making a fresh wave of tears fill my eyes. I shake my head and open my front door, crying harder when Capone begins to jump around at my feet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back; just give him a chance to cool down,\u201d Mic says, and I nod. I know he\u2019s right, but I hate the idea of him somewhere pissed off at me. Not that he doesn\u2019t have a right to be pissed. I have continuously changed the subject or made excuses for why he and my dad haven\u2019t met, and because of that, I hurt him. I just hope that when Wes does come home, he will be willing to let me plead my case.</p> <p>\u201cYou can go back to the compound. My dad will be here in just a few minutes,\u201d I tell Mic while going to my kitchen and grabbing the roll of paper towels off the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just wait until he gets here, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d he asks as I take a seat on the couch, wiping my face. Then I start to think about the last week and the fact I haven\u2019t been alone at all. I pull the paper towel away from my face and look at Mic.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust doing a favor for my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shake my head, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a moment\u2019s break over the last week. If Wes isn\u2019t with me, one of you guys is. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust being cautious. You know Wes is protective of you,\u201d he states. I know he\u2019s lying, but he pulls his eyes from me, looking at the front door when a car door slams outside, so I know that\u2019s the end of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dad,\u201d I say when a knock sounds on the door that causes Capone to start barking. Mic nods and goes to the entrance with me. I glare and he just shrugs.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I open the door and tears pool in my eyes as he pulls me in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cThis him?\u201d he asks, lifting his chin at Mic.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is Mic. Mic, this is my dad, Asher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, sir,\u201d Mic says before his eyes come to me and go soft. \u201cI\u2019m gonna step outside.\u201d He chucks me under my chin before he walks out the door.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s not him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s Wes\u2019 friend.\u201d I sigh, going to the couch and sitting down.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he here?\u201d he asks, and I hate that I have to lie to him, but there is no way I can tell him what is going on, even if I don\u2019t know all the details.</p><p>\u201cWes is protective,\u201d I say, hoping he will accept that explanation.</p><p>\u201cHuh...\u201d my dad grunts, taking a seat. The moment his body folds into my couch, he takes my hand in his, and then his eyes go soft as he searches my face for a long time before he speaks. \u201cSo, you\u2019re really in love?\u201d he questions quietly in the same tone he used to talk to me in when I was little, when he would find me crying or upset.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nod and swallow through the lump that has formed in my throat then wipe my eyes with the paper towel I still have in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he asks, squeezing my hand.</p><p>Sheesh! Why didn\u2019t I tell him about Wes? There are so many reasons, but now I feel like none of them make sense. None of them were good enough reasons for hurting Wes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I cover my face with my hands. \u201cWes is like no one I have been with before; even Jax said that.\u201d I close my eyes, trying to get my thoughts in order before speaking again. \u201cI want you to like him,\u201d I say when I open my eyes. \u201cI love you, and I want you to like him, because I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my baby girl.\u201d He smiles and his hand comes up to hold my cheek. \u201cFrom the moment your mom told me she was pregnant with you, my world changed, and you became one of the most important things in my life. When you took your first breath, I knew I would do everything within my power to make sure that each breath you took was easy. You will always be my baby girl, and I can\u2019t promise you I will like any man you\u2019re with.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me forward and kisses my forehead. \u201cYour grandfather gave me a chance with your mom, and I swore that when my girls told me they were in love I would find a way to make peace with that, so they would never have to choose between me and the man they wanted to share their lives with,\u201d he confesses, and I cry harder, sobbing into his chest as he wraps his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dad,\u201d I hiccup.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, more than anything in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do about Wes?\u201d I ask, pulling away and wiping my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust talk to him.

I follow him up and walk him to the door. He gives me a hug, and a kiss on the forehead, before stepping out onto the front porch. \u201cCall me tomorrow,\u201d he orders, walking to his Jeep, passing Mic on the way and shaking his hand. I give him a small wave as he backs out of my driveway then look at Mic, who is standing near his bike, talking on his phone.</p><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d I ask hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cNo, babe, go back inside,\u201d he tells me, and I frown but step back into my house and shut the door.</p><p>The moment the door closes, I realize how quiet it is. Since the moment I met Wes, there has been a loudness in my life that wasn\u2019t there before. Not the kind of noise that is annoying or that you want to get away from, but the kind of noise that lets you know you\u2019re alive and that the life you\u2019re living is full. I didn\u2019t know my life was missing anything until Wes...until now. Closing my eyes, I take a few deep breaths then pick up the remote and turn on the TV, hoping the sound will help chase away the feeling that has settled in my gut since I watched Wes ride away.</p><p>\u201cYou did this to yourself,\u201d I whisper, going to the kitchen and getting a bottle of water before walking to my room and changing into a pair of sweats and a t-shirt. Afterwards, I head out to the living room to watch some TV.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d I murmur as I\u2019m lifted off the couch and tucked close to Wes\u2019 front as he carries me to my room.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he mutters, laying me down then pulling the covers over me. I chew on my bottom lip, watching him, trying to gauge where his head\u2019s at.</p> <p>His back is to me, and he lifts his shirt off over his head and drops it to the floor, and then the sound of his belt coming off fills the silence, making that coiled ball of energy in my stomach unravel slightly with the knowledge that he\u2019s not leaving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I reach out to him and run my fingers down his back as he takes a seat on the side of the bed. The moment I touch him, his muscles contract and he looks over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told my dad. He was here earlier.\u201d I close my eyes, hating the distance I feel between us. \u201cI know you will probably think it\u2019s idiotic, but the idea of you and my dad not getting along is one of the worst things I can imagine.\u201d I open my eyes back up, seeing he\u2019s still watching me. \u201cI love my dad; he\u2019s my best friend, but since the moment I met you, that has changed. You have become important in a way that I know if I had to choose between the two of you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to without it ripping me apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I would make you choose between us?\u201d he growls, and his brows shoot together.</p><p>Okay, said out loud like that makes it sound stupid.</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think you would,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would either, but how could I choose between two men I love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t choose between the two men you love.\u201d He crawls over me, pressing me into the bed with his weight, his face inches from mine. \u201cYou love me?\u201d he asks softly, and I shake my head and close my eyes. \u201cJuly, open your eyes and look at me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head again and his hands go to each side of my face. \u201cBaby, open your eyes and look at me.\u201d The tone of his voice has my eyes opening to look at him. \u201cI love you too,\u201d he says, and my eyes slide closed and I let his words wash over me before opening them again. \u201cLoving you means I want what\u2019s best for you and that I want you to be happy. You think I don\u2019t know what your family means to you?\u201d He pushes my hair away from my face. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I see the way your face lights up when you talk about your dad, or the love you have for him?\u201d He kisses my lips then my chin. \u201cI see it baby, and regardless if we get along, I would never make you choose between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you got from that speech?\u201d he asks, smiling.</p><p>\u201cUh basically...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m going to do with your crazy ass,\u201d he mutters, looking over my head.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I smack his side, \u201cyou telling me you love me is kinda a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more keeping shit from me,\u201d he demands as his face goes serious.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cNext time, I\u2019m spanking your ass.\u201d</p><p>My body freezes under him, and the space between my legs tingles from the thought of him spanking me.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d He smiles, and I pull my bottom lip into my mouth before I blurt out something completely inappropriate.</p><p>\u201cRuined,\u201d he says, biting my chin, making me gasp as he pulls one of my legs around his hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I moan as he runs his hand down my stomach into my sweats.</p><p>\u201cMake-up sex, baby,\u201d he whispers against my mouth as he slides two fingers inside me.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. I\u2019m coming!\u201d I yell, rolling over to get out of bed when the doorbell rings for the tenth time in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it, baby,\u201d Wes says, tugging me back down into bed and kissing the side of my head before getting up. I turn my head and watch as he pulls on his jeans, leaving the room without a shirt. Wondering who it is, I get up and follow him out of the room then stop in the hall, looking at his back as he opens the door. His body freezes, all of the muscles in his back going taught as he says something to whoever is at the door.</p><p>I pad to where he is then duck under his arm, coming face to face with my parents. Oh, crap!</p><p>\u201cMorning, honey.\u201d My mom smiles.</p><p>I blink, looking at my mom then at my dad. \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured if he was here, that would mean he\u2019s who I thought he was. If he didn\u2019t come back here last night, I knew you would need some of your mom\u2019s famous French toast to get you over him,\u201d my dad says as Wes wraps his arm around my waist, pulling me out of the way.</p><p>\u201cUhh...\u201d I mumble as my dad tugs my mom into the house, shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna put a shirt on?\u201d my dad queries, looking at Wes. Then his eyes drop to my legs and he frowns. \u201cAnd you some pants?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsher Mayson!\u201d my mom snaps, hitting my dad\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, frowning down at her.</p><p>\u201cThis is your daughter\u2019s house, not yours.

And I wonder how he\u2019s so cool about this.</p><p>\u201cGet some pants on.\u201d His eyes meet mine in the mirror and he cups his hand under the flowing water to rinse his mouth. I look around the bathroom. The shower curtain is open, and Wes\u2019 body wash and shampoo are next to mine on the shelf. My eyes go back to him when he puts his toothbrush next to mine in the holder once again. My eyes drop to his clippers, deodorant, and man products that have taken up half the counter, and I shake my head and remind myself to get dressed.</p><p>I leave the bathroom and go to the closet. When I open it up, I notice Wes\u2019 clothes have filled up a whole side of my closet, and then my eyes drop to the ground and I see that his boots and sneakers are mixed in with mine on the floor. I grab a pair of sweats then go back to the bathroom, suddenly feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>I swallow hard, watching as he pulls his shirt on. \u201cI...uhh...when did we move in together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, get dressed,\u201d he says, ignoring me, and I wonder if I\u2019m thinking too much into it. I pull off my shirt, put on a bra and a tank top, and then slip on my sweats before brushing my teeth. When I come out of the bathroom, Wes is completely dressed and sitting on the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, going to stand in front of him. He tugs me forward until my hips are settled between his then slides his hands up my tank, running along the skin of my sides.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever happens out there doesn\u2019t effect what we have. When your parents go home, we will still be us, and nothing will change that.\u201d</p><p>I lean in, and press a kiss to his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d I lick my lips and nod, he takes my hand, leading me out of the room towards the kitchen, where I hear my parents talking.</p><p>When we walk around the corner, I see my mom at the stove and my dad standing at her back with his arms around her. I clear my throat then tug Wes\u2019 hand when their eyes come to us.</p><p>\u201cDad, I would like you to meet Wes Silver. Wes, this is my dad, Asher Mayson,\u201d I introduce them.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, sir,\u201d Wes says, and my dad\u2019s eyes narrow and I hold my breath, almost afraid to watch.</p><p>\u201cYou military?\u201d my dad asks, and Wes nods.</p><p>\u201cEight years in the Navy SEALs.\u201d</p> <p>My dad grunts then shakes his head. \u201cMarines,\u201d he says pointing to himself, then takes Wes\u2019 hand and gives it a firm shake. I let out a breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding and go to my mom\u2019s side to kiss her head then wrap my arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cTold you everything would be okay, honey,\u201d my mom whispers softly, giving me a squeeze. I smile and walk to my dad\u2019s side and slip under his arm as he talks with Wes. He kisses my hairline and I hug his waist then slide from his grasp and go to Wes, wrapping my arms around him and resting my cheek on his chest. I stand there until my mom finishes making her famous breakfast of French toast, and we all move to sit around the table. \u201cYou guys should come over for dinner this weekend,\u201d my dad suggests as we walk my parents to the front door.</p><p>\u201cGot some stuff going on this weekend,\u201d Wes says, and I look at him and frown; he hasn\u2019t said anything to me. \u201cShould be able to work something out for next week though.\u201d</p><p>My dad nods and pats his shoulder then looks at me. \u201cI know you guys are together, but I don\u2019t want to be a grandfather yet, so make sure you\u2019re being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shakes his head then points at Wes, \u201cIf my girl tells me she\u2019s pregnant before she has a ring on her finger, we\u2019re gonna have issues. Hell, you shouldn\u2019t even be having sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, stop. I lost my virginity on prom night.\u201d I shake my head and his swings my way. His eyes narrow and I can see the wheels in his head turning.</p><p>When the hell will I learn to shut my big, fat mouth?</p><p>\u201cYou went to prom with Bobbie Evans. He still works at the car dealership in town,\u201d my dad growls and his jaw starts to tic.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I look at my mom for help, but I can see that she\u2019s upset as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d Dad seethes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Wes says. I look at him and narrow my eyes, and he shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him in years,\u201d I say, tossing my arms in the air then crossing them over my chest, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cKeep it that way,\u201d Wes commands.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep your caveman in your pants?\u201d My eyes go from Wes to my dad, who is looking between Wes and me with a strange look on his face.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I say, and it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s frozen in place.</p><p>\u201cLove you, honey,\u201d my mom says, cutting in and giving me a hug.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher.\u201d My mom grabs his hand and his eyes go to her, and he shakes his head then looks at me.</p><p>\u201cBe good,\u201d he mutters, giving me a hug and kissing my forehead. Then he looks at Wes and lifts his chin before heading towards his Jeep with his arm around my mom\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad,\u201d I tell Wes. His arm wraps around my waist and I feel his lips on my hair as we watch my parents drive away.</p><p>\u201cI like your parents,\u201d he says, leading me back into the house.</p><p>\u201cThey like you too.\u201d I smile then walk towards the bedroom once we\u2019re inside, but don\u2019t make it far, because the back of my shirt is grabbed and I\u2019m tugged backward into his hard body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d He wraps his arms around my waist and kisses down my neck.</p><p>\u201cI was going to shower.\u201d I moan, tilting my head to the side.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d He bites my neck, lifting me and walking towards the bedroom, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhere in that did you hear me invite you?\u201d I ask as he reaches around me, turning on the shower.</p><p>\u201cThe part where you were going to be naked.\u201d He pulls my shirt off over my head and unhooks my bra, letting it drop to the floor before palming my breasts, pulling on both nipples, which makes my core tighten with want. His hands travel down my stomach and he slides my sweats down my legs, commanding, \u201cStep out,\u201d against my neck before biting into my skin.</p><p>When his hands leave me again, I turn to look at him over my shoulder and watch as his hands go behind his back as he pulls his shirt off over his head, dropping it to the floor with mine. When his arms wrap around me again, I moan, feeling the denim of his jeans scrape against the skin on the back of my thighs as one of his hands slides down my stomach, the other wrapping across my breast. His foot spreads my legs farther apart and his fingers slide through my folds, making my hips buck forward. Turning my head, I pant into his neck as two fingers slide on either side of my swollen clit.</p><p>\u201cMy mouth is watering.\u201d He lets me go, making my eyes that had slid closed fly open. I turn and watch as he pulls a towel off of the shelf and sets it on the vanity. Then he pulls me by my hips and lifts me, placing me on it. \u201cShow me your pussy, baby,\u201d he says, unbuckling his jeans. My eyes are glued to the outline of the budge the V of his hips is pointing to.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs, July.\u201d My eyes glide up to meet his and I swallow, slowly spreading my legs open. \u201cTouch yourself how you want me to touch you.\u201d He pulls down his jeans and his cock bobs against his stomach, the veins pronounced, the head so red it looks painful. I bring two fingers down my stomach and pause just over my pubic bone, feeling unsure.</p><p>\u201cTouch it, baby. Show me how you like it,\u201d he encourages while wrapping his hand around his length and pumping. I lower my fingers between my folds and rub circles around my clit then slip one finger inside of myself, taking the wetness of my arousal and sliding it up and around my clit.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he clips, and my eyes that had slid closed open and meet his. I swallow, keeping a slow pace, the ache in my core telling me that when I do come it\u2019s going to be huge. Like he can\u2019t stop himself, he steps towards me, circling my entrance with one finger then pulling his finger, covered in my arousal, out and swiping it across my bottom lip.</p><p>He crashes his mouth down on mine, pulling my bottom lip into his mouth and sucking hard, causing me to cry out and my fingers to move faster, circling my clit. Then he pulls his mouth from mine and drops his face between my legs, burying his tongue in my pussy taking long strokes as his fingers enter me, making me scream his name. My orgasm crashes over me suddenly; the walls of my vagina contract, pulling at his fingers as I float away, my body breaking out with cold bumps as he wipes his chin on the inside of my thigh. He stands, grabs my ankles, holding them out to the sides as he slams into me hard. My hands go behind my back to keep myself up.</p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he growls, pulling out and slamming back in. \u201cI love the way I look disappearing into you.\u201d His words make me hotter and I lower my eyes, watching him enter me in long, measured strokes. Each of his thrust hits something deep inside me that causes a sharp pain that simmers out into pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I whimper, and his mouth crashes down onto mine, causing the sound of my orgasm to slide down his throat. He pulls and wraps my legs around his hips, puts his hands under my ass, and then lifts me up, taking me into the shower, where he presses my back into the tiled wall. I use my legs wrapped around him as leverage to bring myself to orgasm again. \u201cFuck, baby, squeeze me,\u201d he groans, planting himself deep and dropping his forehead to my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI want to follow Z tonight,\u201d Kayan says as I lock up the doors to the clinic.</p><p>\u201cFollow him where?\u201d I ask, watching as she pulls out her keys from her bag.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she mutters then lifts her eyes to look at me. \u201cI feel like maybe he\u2019s cheating. He\u2019s been hiding something,\u201d she whispers, and I feel my eyebrows pull together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Z is cheating on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll find out for sure,\u201d she says, and I know there is no convincing her. When we were in college, she dated a guy that was cheating on her. The whole time, everyone knew except for her and me, or we didn\u2019t know until we went to a frat party and walked in on him while he was having sex with our other roommate Lynn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d I tell her seeing the look on her face.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always have your back, even if I think you\u2019re crazy,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to find some way to ditch our tail.\u201d She nods her head towards Harlen, who is sitting on his bike across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cFifty Shades of Grey is coming out tonight. We will just say we\u2019re going to watch it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cCall me and we\u2019ll make plans for the movies,\u201d I shout loud enough for Harlen to hear.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Fifty\u2019s ass!\u201d she shouts back, and I can\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you guys doing tonight?\u201d I ask Wes as I pull on my jeans.</p><p>His eyes lift from his cell phone and he looks at me. \u201cWe\u2019re helping Jax with something then going to ride up to Nashville and check out a club Harlen found. The boys are thinking about buying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of club?\u201d I ask, pulling my hoodie out from the closet.</p><p>He pauses like he\u2019s not going to say, and I raise a brow with my hoodie paused over my head. \u201cStrip club.\u201d</p><p>I nod once then pull the sweatshirt on. \u201cYou should talk to my uncle and mom. They\u2019ve been running Teasers, now that my grandpa retired.\u201d</p><p>His head goes back like I hit him and his brows pull together. \u201cYour uncle and mom run Teasers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>I smile and pull my black Converse out of the closet. \u201cBabe, your mouth.\u201d I laugh, tapping his chin as I sit down next to him on the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow did I not know that?\u201d He kisses my neck.</p><p>\u201cI guess it never came up, but I\u2019m sure my mom and uncle would be happy to talk to you and the guys.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.

I have the best tits I\u2019ve seen in my life at my disposal twenty-four hours a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww, you say the sweetest things.\u201d I laugh, tying my shoes.</p> <p>He pulls me up off the bed, slapping my ass once before pushing me towards the door, muttering, \u201cSmartass,\u201d as the bell goes off.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d he greets Sage when he opens the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good?\u201d my cousin replies, stepping into the house, doing that guy handshake thing with Wes before pulling me into a hug and lifting me up off my feet.</p><p>My cousin Sage is mixed. His dad is black and his mom is white. Uncle Nico and Aunt Sophie adopted him and his twin sister when they were three. He\u2019s handsome in a way that my aunt asked Uncle Nico to buy her a gun to keep the girls away when he turned sixteen. He\u2019s really tall at almost six, six, and his skin is a few shades darker than mine is in the summer. His hair is curly and low to his head, and his eyes are a light hazel that stands out against his complexion.</p><p>Even though he\u2019s not my aunt and uncle\u2019s biological kid, you can see them in him. He\u2019s sweet and soft-spoken like Aunt Sophie, yet a badass to the core like Uncle Nico, which is why he works with Jax.</p><p>As soon as my feet touch the ground, Wes pulls me to him. \u201cBe good,\u201d he says against my mouth. I don\u2019t say anything; after all, it\u2019s only a lie if you acknowledge it, and if Wes never finds out what I\u2019m doing, he will have no reason to be mad.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go,\u201d Sage says, holding the door open. I grab my bag from the table and wave goodbye to Wes as he pulls away from the house on his bike.</p><p>\u201cKayan is meeting us at the theater. Z said he would follow her there and wait for us,\u201d I tell Sage as we get into his truck.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he mutters, getting behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI wish Nalia was here,\u201d I say, and Sage\u2019s eyes come to me for a moment before going back to the road.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d he says, but I can also hear the doubt in his words. When Sage and Nalia turned eighteen, they were able to talk to their biological parents. Sage wanted nothing to do with them, but Nalia got close with their mom and moved to Colorado to be nearer to her. I understand her reasoning, but I know it\u2019s hard on my aunt and uncle and her brother. I just pray she finds whatever it is she\u2019s looking for.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy she\u2019ll be home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I just hope she\u2019ll decide to stay home after that,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I shrug. I know Aunt Sophie has been torn up about her being gone. She feels like she did something wrong, but I also know that sometimes you have to do stuff for yourself, even if it\u2019s hard on the people you love.</p> <p>When we pull into the parking lot of the movie theater, I see Z and Kayan standing near his bike. I look around for her car and sigh in relief when I see it parked over on the side of the building.</p><p>\u201cHey, Z, are you sure you don\u2019t want to watch the movie with us?\u201d I ask, hopping out of Sage\u2019s truck and walking toward Z\u2019s bike.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no, thanks.\u201d He smiles then turns and kisses Kayan, then whispers something to her before letting her go mussing my hair and getting on his bike starting it up and pulling out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Kayan asks, wrapping my arm around hers and heading into the theater, with Sage following close behind us.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d I mummer wondering if there is a way that I can talk her out of this then I look over my shoulder at my cousin and ask \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll wait here,\u201d he says, and we pay for our tickets and stop to get popcorn and candy, giving Sage a wave before heading into the movie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Kayan asks as we head into the theater.</p><p>\u201cThis is your idea.\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cYeah but you\u2019re the planner.\u201d She smiles and I roll my eyes and lead her towards the front of the theater, where I push through the door marked Exit. The moment we clear the door, I head towards the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She shrieks as I start to toss the food we got into the garbage that is on the corner of the building. \u201cYou cannot throw that out,\u201d she pulls the popcorn from my hand, causing half of it to land on the ground, \u201cor this.\u201d She hands me the keys to her car and takes the soda from me.</p><p>\u201cAre you good now?\u201d I ask. She shrugs shoving a hand full of popcorn into her mouth after making it to her car. I make sure Sage isn\u2019t anywhere around, start up the car and head out of the parking lot towards the compound.</p><p>\u201cSo much for this plan,\u201d Kayan says through a mouthful of popcorn as we pull up in front of the compound fifteen minutes later.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree then shove her head down and duck as well when I see a bike pull up. The moment the roar of pipes dies, I lift my head and watch as Harlen swings off his bike and heads inside, coming back a few minutes later carrying an envelope.</p><p>\u201cWe need to follow him. He\u2019ll be with Z.\u201d She says from her still bent position then takes a drink of her soda.</p><p>I look at her for a long moment then shake my head and take off after him following him for about ten minutes down some back roads. When he pulls into a parking lot, I park a block away and watch as he rides right to where the rest of the guys are waiting including my cousin Jax. When Harlen gets off his bike, he says something to Wes then hands him the envelope. Even from this distance, I see Wes\u2019 jaw go tight and I wonder why he\u2019s pissed. Then he puts his phone to his ear, and I watch his mouth work and wonder what he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, watching Wes go to Z and say something. When Z\u2019s body goes tight, a ball of anxiety forms in my chest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re busted,\u201d Kayan whispers. I look at her, put the car in drive, and take off. The moment I hit the road, the sound of pipes fills the air. My hands start to sweat and my heart starts to pound. \u201cOh, my God. Z is going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can get back to the theater,\u201d I say, not believing it for a second.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d she agrees, and I push down on the gas and take every back road I can until I reach the parking lot of the theater. The moment I turn off the car, we get out and rush toward the door of the theater we left out of, then stop dead when we come face-to-face with a very pissed-off Sage.</p> <p>\u201cHey, what are you doing out here?\u201d I ask, and his eyes turn even angrier.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I came out to smoke. You know...the scenes were so hot I needed a cigarette,\u201d I say and hear someone chuckle. I turn to look over my shoulder as Mic, Wes, Z, and Jax walk up to where we\u2019re standing.</p><p>\u201cThis shit\u2019s not funny,\u201d Wes growls, looking at Mic, who holds up a hand in front of him.</p><p>When Wes\u2019 eyes come back to me, they do one sweep then he looks at Sage.</p> <p>\u201cYou mind taking the girls home? We\u2019ll be there in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, man,\u201d Sage says, and Wes lifts his chin then his eyes drop to me.</p><p>\u201cDo not fucking leave the house.\u201d He points at me, and my heart skids in my chest from the amount of anger I see on his face.</p><p>\u201cGive me your keys,\u201d Z tells Kayan. She grabs my hand and I turn to look at her, seeing tears in her eyes. I hand over the keys and watch as Z storms off towards the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not fucking talk,\u201d Wes says, and my mouth slams shut. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with your ass when I get home.\u201d Okay, I knew he was mad and had a reason to be, but this was a little too much. My hand not holding my friend\u2019s balls into a fist at my side. It takes everything in me not to flip out.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Sage tugs my elbow and leads us away from the guys and towards his truck.</p><p>\u201cSorry about leaving,\u201d I mumble, looking out the window, trying to catch a glimpse of the Wes.</p><p>\u201cYou know we wouldn\u2019t be watching you guys if there wasn\u2019t some fucked-up shit going on,\u201d Sage says, and I can hear the anger and concern in his voice. The moment we arrive at my house, Sage shuts down the truck and follows us inside. \u201cBoth of you, sit here,\u201d he growls, pointing at the couch when I start to lead a still crying Kayan back to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we\u2019re not going to leave again, and second, I\u2019m older than you and this is my house. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to take my friend back to the bathroom so she can splash some cold water on her face!\u201d I reply and tug Kayan with me to the hall bathroom.</p><p>\u201cSit here,\u201d I tell her, closing the lid on the toilet so she can take a seat, and then I gab a washcloth and run it under cold water before handing it to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmurs, pressing it to her face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not cheating,\u201d I remind her, and she nods but doesn\u2019t say anything, making me feel worse than I already do. When we go back out to the living room, Sage is watching television. His eyes come to us and go soft.</p><p>\u201cThe guys are on their way back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mumble as the ball of stress in my stomach expands. When the sound of pipes rumbles the house, I close my eyes, trying to get myself under control. Having both Wes and me mad isn\u2019t going to fix anything.</p><p>The front door flies open, making me jump. I turn my head, expecting it to be Wes storming into the house, so I\u2019m surprised when it\u2019s Z. \u201cHow the fuck do you think it\u2019s okay to take a pregnant woman on one of your crazy-ass adventures?\u201d he roars at me, and I sit back on the couch, surprised by his words. I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. I look at my friend, the girl I have been best friends with since our first day of kindergarten, and my mouth drops open when I see the truth in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d I whisper in shock. \u201cHow did that happen? I mean...when, shit...I mean, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I shake my head, completely flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry; you know I love you,\u201d she says then looks up at Z. \u201cAnd you had no right to tell her, you big, fat jerk. I\u2019m pregnant, not incapable of making my own fucking decisions.\u201d She stands up and pushes past Z, whose glare has softened. \u201cFuck!\u201d she screams when she gets to the front door, and I stand when I see her chest heaving up and down. \u201cYou have my keys. Either give them to me, or take me the fuck home.\u201d</p><p>I look from her to Z and blink, because I have never seen my friend like this, and Z doesn\u2019t even look a little bit fazed by her outburst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna head out,\u201d Sage says, and I nod absently, my eyes still on my best friend.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming, or am I walking?\u201d She raises a brow, and I look at Z and hear him mumble something about his kitten having claws before he moves to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u201d she says, looking at me before disappearing through the door.</p><p>I flop down on the couch and close my eyes, wondering what the hell just happened. Suddenly, the door slams so hard that the walls shake and I jump, my eyes flying open as I look towards the entryway and my eyes lock with Wes\u2019 angry ones.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what the fuck you were thinking tonight?\u201d Wes roars. My brain is screaming to say, \u2018Not really,\u2019 but judging by the look in his eyes, I don\u2019t think he would find me funny. \u201cJesus!\u201d His fist clenches then he picks up an empty glass from the side table and pulls his hand back, throwing it full force at the wall across the room, causing glass to explode everywhere. My pulse speeds up and I press back into the couch. \u201cThis is not some fucking game. People\u2019s lives are on the line,\u201d he thunders, coming to stand in front of me.</p><p>He pulls out his phone, and I wonder what he\u2019s doing until he shoves the phone into my face and an image of a woman not much older than me is on his screen. She\u2019s tied up. Her nose is bleeding, one eye is swollen shut and black and blue, and her hair looks like it hasn\u2019t been washed in a few days. Her clothes are dirty, and there are bruises on her arms in the shape of handprints.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mellissa Hornel. She\u2019s twenty-five and a college graduate. She went missing three weeks ago. She had a date with a guy she met online. She never made it home.\u201d He flips to another picture, this girl younger than the pervious one. Her blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail, her lip is swollen, and you can tell they tried to use makeup to cover the bruise under her eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Stacy, Landon\u2019s sister the kid that dropped the dogs to you. Tonight, I was going to go help him by getting her away from the slimeballs that have been keeping her and Mellissa\u201d he says, and my eyes fly up to meet his and my chest starts to heave with anxiety. \u201cBaby, I love you. I love that you\u2019re crazy, I love that you\u2019re fucking wild and untamable, but if I say or do something, it\u2019s for a reason. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go get her,\u201d I say, cutting him off as tears cloud my vision. \u201cWe need to go help them.\u201d I stand up, but he pushes me back down onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle was able to get all the girls out before they moved them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I sob, covering my face in relief.</p><p>\u201cNo more bullshit, baby. No more crazy antics. No more doing shit, just \u2019cause you feel like causing me headaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d I agree, leaving out the part that this was all my crazy best friend\u2019s fault. The idea of those women being stuck in that situation will haunt me for a long time. I knew there were evil people in the world, but what was happening to them is sickening.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m going to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, either,\u201d I breathe, crawling into his lap where he holds me until I stop crying.</p><p>\u201cGo on to bed. I need to make a few calls,\u201d he orders on a squeeze.</p><p>I place a kiss on the underside of his jaw then head to the room, where I strip down quickly before getting into bed. I lay there for a long time thinking about what Wes said. The kid that was bringing me the dogs name is Landon and he had a sister, obviously the people that had her were using her as leverage over him and probably his dad. I couldn\u2019t imagine what they have been going through, what she was going through. Then I thought about the fact that Wes was helping rescue them and that brought more questions then I couldn\u2019t think any more because I fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cWes?\u201d I question as I\u2019m flipped to my stomach and long fingers run over my clit.</p><p>\u201cUp on your knees, baby.\u201d The sound of his voice causes a shiver to run down my spine as he wraps his arm around my stomach and lifts me up on my hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg, grabbing onto the sheets in front of me while pressing back into his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get what I give you. Get your shirt off.\u201d</p><p>I whimper in distress and feel myself soaking his hand as his fingers bring me closer to the edge while I struggle with my sleep shirt until I\u2019m able to slide it off over my head.</p><p>\u201cThe idea of someone taking this from me makes me fucking furious,\u201d he growls, removing his fingers, lining up his cock, and then slamming deep while simultaneously smacking one cheek of my ass hard. My head lowers to the bed and I whimper, feeling myself tightening around him.</p><p>\u201cI would kill for you, fucking die for you,\u201d he snarls, smacking the other cheek even harder than the first one, and a ball starts to coil in my lower stomach. \u201cYou belong to me. You are not allowed to risk what is mine.\u201d He pulls me up with an arm under my breasts. \u201cWhose pussy is this?\u201d he asks while holding his hips still, impaling me on his cock.</p><p>My breath hitches as my body tries to adjust to his length and girth.</p><p>\u201cWho does this body...\u201d His hands slide up my sides, over my stomach, then up, cupping my breasts where he tugs hard on my nipples, making my back arch and causing him to slide impossibly deeper, \u201c...belong to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you what you want, but tell me who you belong to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, this body and this pussy are mine, and if you jeopardize my goods, you will be punished.\u201d He pushes me back down in front of him and smacks my ass hard, over and over, in rapid succession, each smack bringing me closer to orgasm. Then he pulls me back up and I turn my head just in time for his tongue to slide into my mouth as his hand slides down my stomach and over my clit, where he circles.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I say on a hitched breath.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, baby.\u201d He kisses down my neck, working slowly in and out of me as his hands slide over my body, like he\u2019s memorizing each exposed inch of flesh.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I love you,\u201d he says like he\u2019s talking to himself. \u201cCome for me,\u201d he demands, rotating his hips on each upward thrust. His hands wrap around my hips and I slide my fingers between my legs, first feeling our connection then rolling one over my clit in fast circles.</p><p>My orgasm hits quickly; the top half of my body drops to the bed, Wes being the only thing keeping me up as he takes three more strokes before planting himself deep. My breath pauses and the walls of my core tighten around him. He stays rooted like that for long moments until he rolls us to the side, him still deep inside me.</p><p>Moving the hair off my neck, he kisses the skin behind my ear and wraps his arms tighter around me. There is no place I would rather be than with him just like this, sweaty and breathing hard from amazing sex while being safe in his arms.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby.\u201d He slides out of me rolls me to my back, kisses down my stomach, and then climbs out of bed. I listen absently as the water comes on in the bathroom. Seconds later, he comes back, sliding a warm cloth between my legs, then dries me off before coming to lay half-on me again. His thigh lays over both of mine, his arm is under my breasts, and his lips rest close to my ear, where I listen to his breath even out, and I let my body do the same, so I can follow him off to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>I pull off my shirt and put my phone back to my ear. Then I reach behind my back with one hand and unhook my bra.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Wes answers on the second ring, and a smile forms on my lips.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I mutter, letting the sound of his voice wash over me.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, my sisters and cousins want to go out tonight,\u201d I tell him, holding the phone to my ear as I start up the shower.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably get dinner then go have a drink at Daniel\u2019s bar,\u201d I tell him, slipping off my panties.</p><p>Yesterday was Thanksgiving, and Wes and I celebrated with his mom in the afternoon and my family that evening. I was so happy to see my family all welcome Wes with open arms. My mom and aunts adored him, or they just liked looking at him\u2014I couldn\u2019t quite figure out that one yet\u2014and my uncles all seemed to respect him, especially after the way Uncle Nico spoke about him in regards to what Wes and the guys did to help him get those girls out of the situation they were in. I never expected them to all get along, but I was very happy they did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCall me when you need to be picked up,\u201d he says, bringing me back into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to pick me up. I don\u2019t plan on drinking that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love when you drink, baby,\u201d he says. I can hear the smile in his voice and I roll my eyes. \u201cCall when you need to be picked up,\u201d he repeats more firmly than the previous time.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I sigh, knowing there\u2019s no point in arguing with him. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove you too, baby,\u201d he says, and I click the phone off, set it on the counter, and get into the shower. It\u2019s been a month since the night Kayan and I went to spy on Z, things have cooled down. The guys who had taken Landon\u2019s sister were arrested by Uncle Nico and are awaiting trial. I was definitely looking forward to them getting what they deserved, and hopefully that came in the form of becoming the bitch of some scary inmate in the state pen. I found out through Wes that Snake had taken Landon\u2019s sister and was using her as leverage over Ronnie the owner of Mamma\u2019s Country Landon also confided in Wes with the information about the dogfights that were being held. He said that when the guy Snake and his boys had taken over a few times a week they would hold fights but he didn\u2019t know where the dogs came from. He said that when he was forced to remove the loosing dog he would take them to me in hopes that I could save them. I hated that there were probably still dogs suffering somewhere but I was thankful that Snake no longer had a hold over Landon or his father.</p><p>Kayan also opened up about being pregnant. She was afraid I would have the same reaction her parents had. They were disappointed in her for having a baby with someone they didn\u2019t approve of, but her parents had always been part crazy, so I was glad she was finding a way to get over what they thought. She also admitted to me that she and Z had been seeing each other since their first encounter, but she wasn\u2019t sure then where their relationship was going until the night they came over for tacos. He made it clear then that he wanted to be with her and that he wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer.</p><p>She also said that half the things she said I needed to ignore, because the hormones were making her partly crazy. That, I had to agree with her on. If it weren\u2019t against the law, I would have fired her already. The other day, someone called about having their dog fixed, and she freaked out on them, questioned them on how they would feel if their balls were chopped off.</p><p>After that outburst, it took me a good hour to get the person calm enough to continue using me as their Vet, and the whole time I was talking to them, she was crying, apologizing about how she acted. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to deal with her for the next few months. I feel bad for Z, but I swear every time I\u2019m around them and she freaks out about something or another, he gets a weird smile on his face, like he thinks it\u2019s the most adorable thing he has ever seen in his life. They are both insane, and I guess a perfect match.</p><p>I finish getting washed up, get out, and wrap a towel around my head. I go out to the kitchen, grab a bottle of water before feeding both Juice and Capone, and then go back into the bathroom to blow out my hair, using a large round brush so the volume is at full capacity. Once I have my hair dry, I put large rollers into my hair with clips.</p> <p>Going out with my sisters and cousins is different than going out with my normal girlfriends. Even in high school, we would all compete with each other for the most over the top look, even if we were just going to a bonfire. I think part of the reason we did it was no one else could ever really understand our fathers, and the extreme competitiveness in which they raised us.</p><p>We are all daddies\u2019 girls, and we all fought tooth and nail to get our way, some more than others. My cousin Ashlyn has had it the hardest of any of us. Uncle Cash is overly protective of her, so when we were younger and she would go out with us, it was the one time he didn\u2019t fight her on her outfit or makeup, because he, my dad, and my other uncles would get together, drink beer, and complain about us, while our moms rolled their eyes and insisted we have our time. I don\u2019t regret the way I grew up. Having the father I have has shown me how a man is supposed to treat not only his wife, but also his children.</p><p>I start my makeup with a smoky eye that causes my eye color to pop, and then add bronzer and blush that define my cheekbones. I use a lip liner to make my lips look even plumper than normal then find the perfect shade of light pink lipstick that gives me a nice, pouty mouth. Wes has never seen me this dolled up, so I have no idea what his reaction is going to be tonight when he comes to pick me up.</p><p>After my hair and makeup are done, I go to my closet, pull out the dress I bought a few weeks ago, and set it on the bed. Going to the dresser to pull out a black strapless bra and a seamless black thong, I put both on and look at myself in the mirror. The bra gives me the perfect amount of cleavage, and the thong sits just above my pubic bone, the fabric black but sheer, letting you see everything.</p><p>I step into the dress, the strapless ensemble ending just above my knees. The fabric covering my breasts is tight, and then the waist poofs out where there are pockets. The bottom is tight again, showing off my hips and ass. After struggling with the zipper for a few minutes, I slip on a pair of five-inch heels that wrap around my ankles and have a slim strap across my toes. Once I\u2019m completely dressed, I step in front of the mirror, unroll my hair, toss the rollers onto the bed, and then fluff my hair. I look hot and am glad Wes isn\u2019t home, \u2019cause I have a feeling that he if he was here to see me, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave the house.</p><p>I touch up my lipstick then head to the front room and grab my coat from the closet before going to the garage, which Wes cleaned out for me so I could actually fit my jeep inside without having to climb out the trunk.</p> <p>Once I pull out onto the highway, I call December to let her know I\u2019m on my way to my parents\u2019 house. My sisters normally stay with me when they are in town, but since Wes is basically living with me, they decided to give us our space and have been staying at my mom and dad\u2019s.</p><p>After I park and get out, not even knocking before going inside, the moment I cross the threshold, I see my sisters all standing in the kitchen, each of them defending themselves against my dad. My sister June has on a navy blue dress that is the same length as mine, but the outer shell is a lace material. Her long brown hair is tied back in a straight ponytail.</p><p>December is wearing a dress similar to mine, only hers has one long sleeve, and her long dirty-blonde hair is down each side of her breasts. May has a dress with cap-sleeves. The top is tight then it flows out at the waist, making her waist look perfectly curvy and her long white-blonde hair is pulled over one shoulder, showing off the curve of her neck. April has on a dark purple dress that swoops down, showing off her cleavage and tattoos. Her bright red hair that she colored weeks ago is hanging in waves down her back. I have seen my sister with every color hair you can think of, but she always looks beautiful. June smiles looking at me instead of wearing a dress she has on a black strapless romper with a chunky gold necklace that somehow accentuates her cleavage the bottom of the romper flares out at the ankle showing off a pair of gold heels that I may have to steel from her. Her hair is short but the cut stylish, which fits her almond, shaped face perfectly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, great, you too?\u201d my dad mutters as I join them. \u201cWhere is that man of yours?

She wraps her arm around December\u2019s waist, who is a few inches taller than her with the help of her heels. \u201cMy girls are so gorgeous.\u201d My mom smiles then looks at my dad, and her face goes soft the same way it has my whole life, and I swear I know exactly what she\u2019s thinking. My dad gave my mom everything she didn\u2019t even know she needed or wanted.</p><p>\u201cThey take after their mama.\u201d My dad smiles, and June mutters, \u201cGross,\u201d making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you girls doing tonight?\u201d my mom asks as Dad wraps his arms around her waist and sets his chin on her head a pose I have seen them in more times than I could count.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting the girls for dinner then drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need you to drive us, Dad,\u201d May says, and he just glares at her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking,\u201d he says, kissing the side of my mom\u2019s head before moving her aside and grabbing his keys. \u201cLet\u2019s go; just let me know when you want to be picked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes is picking me up,\u201d I say, and May comes over and wraps her arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cDoes your hot biker man know any hot biker friends?\u201d she asks, and my dad swings his head to look at us. I shake my head no while saying, \u201cYes,\u201d without moving my lips.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to move home,\u201d she says.</p><p>I look at her and smile, whispering, \u201cWait \u2019til you see Harlen and Everret,\u201d while getting into my mom\u2019s SUV.</p> <p>When we pull up in front of the restaurant, we each kiss Dad\u2019s cheek before heading inside. The moment I walk through the doors, squeals ensue as we all greet each other. My cousin Ashlyn is Uncle Cash and Aunt Lilly\u2019s daughter. Hanna is Uncle Trevor and Aunt Liz\u2019s daughter. And Willow, Harmony, and Nalia are Uncle Nico and Aunt Sophie\u2019s daughters.</p><p>\u201cHow hard was it getting out of the house in that dress?\u201d I ask Ashlyn, and she rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBetween my dad and Jax, I might as well go live in a nunnery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax isn\u2019t even my brother and I want to kill him,\u201d I tell her, and understanding flashes in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the hot boyfriend?\u201d Hanna asks.</p><p>Okay, maybe my cousins were all watching my man, and not just my mom and aunts. \u201cWorking, he will be here later to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he bringing any friends?\u201d Nalia asks, and I laugh. I\u2019m so glad she came home for the holidays.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, please tell me he has friends,\u201d my twin cousins Harmony and Willow say as we make our way to the table.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you guys all move home, I\u2019ll set up a meet and greet, or maybe I can host speed dating.\u201d I laugh again, taking a seat at the table and they all giggle too.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait until you guys are all home. I miss these dinners,\u201d I say, taking a sip of wine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be moving home,\u201d Nalia confesses, and all eyes go to her. \u201cI like being with my mom and brothers in Colorado. I miss you guys, but I\u2019m happy there.\u201d She lowers her face.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do what makes you happy,\u201d April says, and all of us nod in agreement, even if we want her here with us.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I wasn\u2019t hurting Mom and Dad,\u201d she replies, looking at Harmony and Willow.</p><p>\u201cMom gets it. She\u2019s sad, but she understands,\u201d Willow says softly.</p><p>\u201cWe all love you,\u201d Harmony adds, \u201cand it\u2019s not like you\u2019re never going to come home. We will always be sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will all always be family,\u201d December chips in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d I smile. The rest of dinner is quiet, with all of us sharing stories of the last few months after we finish eating. We pay the bill and then walk a few blocks down to the bar we have been going to since we were old enough to drink.</p><p>\u201cFind a table and I\u2019ll get us some drinks,\u201d I say, and Nalia wraps her hand around my elbow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d She smiles and I giggle, \u2019cause we\u2019re both already tipsy. I\u2019m not sure if it will hurt or help having her with me. We make our way to the bar and get there in one piece without knocking anything or anyone over.</p><p>\u201cTwo pitchers of beer!\u201d I yell at the bartender while holding onto Naila.</p><p>His eyes come to me briefly and he yells back, \u201cGot it,\u201d then goes to pour the pitchers. The other bartender says something to him, and his eyes come to me and sweep me from hair to chest. I try to place him, but the alcohol in my system is making it hard to figure out where I know him from.</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d Nalia asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I shout over the music.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d she says, and I look at him. No, he is not cute; he is hot. His arms are covered in tattoos, he has small gages in his ears, his skin is the color of chocolate, and his torso is covered in muscles that are shown off by his tight t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that guy say to you?\u201d she asks him when he places the beer in front of us.</p><p>\u201cPardon, bebe?\u201d he asks, leaning closer to Nalia over the bar. His voice is rough, and he has an accent I have never heard in person before, but it sounds Jamaican, and the look on his face as he looks at my cousin is one of awe. I don\u2019t blame him; my cousin is model material.</p><p>\u201cUhh...\u201d Nalia sputters then looks at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that guy say to you?\u201d I ask him, taking pity on my cousin.</p><p>\u201cNot fee. No charge you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I frown, and he shrugs then looks at Naila again and smiles.</p><p>\u201cSeeya \u2019round, bebe,\u201d he says, running a finger over her cheek, then turns and walks to another customer. We each grab a pitcher of beer off the bar along with cups and take it to the table the girls are sitting at. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was that hottie saying?\u201d Willow asks, looking towards the bar.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Naila mutters, frowning, and I smile at my cousin. Maybe there\u2019s hope of Naila moving home after all.</p><p>\u201cThe other one is hot too,\u201d December says, and I follow her gaze towards the bar and see the guy who said something to the bartender, then it clicks into place who he is. I met him at the first club party I had gone to. He was working behind the bar with the other guy. That\u2019s when I know Wes probably told them we were going to be at the bar and they should look out for us.</p><p>\u201cEnough about guys.\u201d June rolls her eyes, grabbing a pitcher of beer and a glass.</p> <p>\u201cJust \u2019cause you\u2019re off the market doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is,\u201d April says, and I look at June and frown. I didn\u2019t know she was dating anyone.</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I haven\u2019t dated in a year,\u201d June retorts.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harmony asks, and June takes her glass of beer and chugs it then pours another glass and drinks that one as well.</p><p>\u201cThis must be bad,\u201d Nalia says and gets up. She goes to the bar, coming back a few minutes later with a bottle of tequila and a nice pink hue to her cheeks. She pours us each a shot and tilts the bottle back against her lips and takes a chug. \u201cSpill it, bitch,\u201d she mutters, wiping her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was married,\u201d June blurts, causing the table to go silent and us all to look at her.</p> <p>\u201cI swear you just said you were married,\u201d December says, taking another shot and giggling.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d June starts to cry. Hanna, who is sitting next to her, wraps her arms around her, and I sit back in my chair, completely stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask when I\u2019m finally able to speak.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Evan. We got married in the spring before he went away to boot camp.\u201d She shakes her head and I watch tears fall onto her lap, so I go to the bar and get a stack of napkins and hand them to her when I return.</p><p>\u201cHe came home two weeks ago after going to Afghanistan, and served me with divorce papers.\u201d She laughs and it sound hollow, and then she lifts her glass to her mouth and takes a large drink.</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t actually serve me with them. I haven\u2019t even seen him since he\u2019s been home. He had his mom bring them to me. Can you believe that crap?\u201d Actually, no, I couldn\u2019t. That was horrible.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even married for a year. I had sex one time the night we were married, the night before he went away to boot camp.\u201d She cries harder.</p><p>\u201cOh, my god,\u201d I whisper, feeling tears fill my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d December asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think deep down I knew he was done with me. I was humiliated.\u201d She shrugs, and I stand and walk around the table to wrap my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he first went away, he would call every night, but then things changed, and the phone calls became less and less frequent. I knew he would have a hard time keeping in contact, but I felt like he just never tried to call me. Eventually, he stopped calling at all. His mom would call me once a week to ask how I was. I started dreading those calls, and resenting him. Then his mom stopped calling, and two weeks ago, a friend of ours said he was home. He had gotten out early, and he was going to be moving to Tennessee. The next day, I got the divorce papers.\u201d She sobs, and I look around the table, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be embarrassed about. He is obviously an asshole,\u201d Harmony says, and I nod, agreeing with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is his last name?\u201d Ashlyn asks, looking white as a ghost.</p> <p>\u201cBaristea,\u201d June mutters, and Ashlyn looks at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hanna asks, sitting forward like this is a soap opera.</p><p>\u201cJax just hired a guy named Evan. He was in the Marines and his convoy was blown up. All of his friends were killed; he was the only survivor. He is supposed to start in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d June whimpers. \u201cSo he\u2019s moving here.\u201d I cannot even believe this is happening.</p><p>\u201cYeah, since Jax\u2019s case load has been building up, he wanted to hire some new guys, and this guy, Evan, was recommended...by one of Wes\u2019 friends actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Jax he can\u2019t hire him,\u201d Harmony says.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d June whispers. \u201cIf it\u2019s true he lost all of his friends and all that happened to him, then he needs this. Don\u2019t take that from him,\u201d she breathes, and more tears fill my eyes. That is love\u2014caring about what the other person is facing, even if they don\u2019t care about you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving home next year,\u201d December reminds her softly.</p><p>\u201cThen I have a year to get over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will help you, whatever you need,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI need to get drunk,\u201d June states.</p><p>\u201cThat, we can do,\u201d Willow says, handing her the bottle of tequila.</p><p>\u201cI need to call Wes,\u201d I slur when the girls start saying they are going to head home.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ride with us?\u201d my sisters ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, Wes wants to pick me up.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cWes is so hot and nice,\u201d December mumbles, leaning on my arm.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I agree, pulling out my phone to call him.</p><p>\u201cCan he bring his friends?\u201d Willow asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d I shrug and put my phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Wes answers.</p><p>\u201cI love that,\u201d I tell him while looking at my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you call me babe,\u201d I clarify, and December mutters, \u201cI love it too,\u201d making me giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little,\u201d I mutter, holding my fingers in front of my face an inch apart.</p><p>\u201cJust a little, huh?\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>\u201cCan you bring your friends with you to come get me?\u201d I ask, twirling my hair around my finger.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u2019cause they\u2019re hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d he growls making me giggle.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spank me for that?\u201d I giggle louder.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he mutters that one word, making me squirm on my seat. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay.\u201d I smile, hanging up.</p><p>\u201cWes is on his way,\u201d I tell the table.</p><p>\u201cIs he bringing his friends?\u201d Willow asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer,\u201d December mutters.</p><p>\u201cOne more shot,\u201d June murmurs.</p><p>\u201cDad, Uncle Trevor, and Jax are outside,\u201d April tells everyone, taking the shot glass December hands her.</p><p>\u201cTo a sisterhood that is more than just blood,\u201d Willow says, holding up her shot glass, and we all clink our drinks together then shoot the shots back.

That was hot.\u201d She shrugs, and Wes wraps his arm around my waist and leads me to his SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your bike?\u201d I ask again.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re not riding on the back of my bike sloshed,\u201d he says as I stumble, and he pulls me back into his body just before I hit the pavement.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I murmur while admitting to myself that it\u2019s probably best he didn\u2019t ride his bike.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019m taking you guys home,\u201d Jax says gathering Willow, Harmony, Nalia, and Ashlyn.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d Hanna says, stumbling over to Uncle Trevor, who is frowning at her. \u201cOh, turn that frown upside down. At least there are no boys here,\u201d she tells him, and he just shakes his head and looks at my dad, who shuts the door, cutting off the sound of my giggling sisters.</p><p>\u201cWas one boy too much to ask for?\u201d my dad asks.</p><p>\u201cAww, Dad, I\u2019ll give you a grandson,\u201d I say then cover my mouth and look at Wes, who has a funny look on his face, and then to my dad, who just shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d Dad says, coming over and giving me a hug.</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d I hug him back then let Wes lift me up into his SUV.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be around tomorrow?\u201d Wes asks my dad, and even in my drunken state, I can see something flash in my dad\u2019s eyes as he nods. Wes slams my door and says something else before walking around and getting behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I ask Wes, watching Dad get into his car and take off.</p> <p>\u201cNothing, baby,\u201d Wes says, pulling my seatbelt across my lap before putting his on and pulling out after Jax. \u201cWhat do you got on under that dress baby?\u201d he asks, and my breath hitches as his fingers skim up my thigh.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I breathe, and his finger pauses.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d he asks, but there is a hint of anger in his tone. \u201cLet me see how you left the house with my goods.\u201d I start panting and slowly shimmy the tight bottom of the dress up and over my hips. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky, baby.\u201d His finger slides up my core, over the sheer material of my panties, making me gasp. \u201cPull that skirt back down,\u201d he says, and I hold my breath a moment then pull it back down over my hips as his hand slides back and forth over my thigh in soft, smooth strokes, not giving me anything, while at the same time, letting me know he\u2019s with me.</p><p>When we pull up to the house, he clicks the button for the garage and I\u2019m reminded my Jeep is at my parents. He pulls in and parks then shuts the door to the garage, leaving only a small bit of light available to see with. My pulse spikes higher as he gets out without saying anything and comes around, opening my door and unhooking my belt, turning me with my feet out the door.</p><p>Without warning, his hand fists in the top of my dress, tugging it down, causing my breasts to spring free. His head lowers and he pulls one nipple into his mouth, while pulling, pinching, and tugging on the other one with two fingers. My head falls back and my legs try to wrap around his hips, while my hands grab onto his shoulders as he moves to cup the other breast, licking around the nipple before biting down on it.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d I moan, and his hands move to the back of my knees as he pulls me roughly towards him, shoving my dress up over my hips.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby, your smell makes my mouth water, knowing when I bite into you, you\u2019re gonna gush into my mouth,\u201d he says, taking my mouth in an aggressive kiss.</p><p>Then his fingers slide up my center again, making my hips jerk forward. \u201cHmmm,\u201d leaves his mouth as his mouth leaves mine. He pushes me back gently with a hand on my chest then lifts my foot, placing it on the open door while placing a hand on the inner thigh of my other leg, spreading me out for him. He pulls up on the top of my panties causing the material to slide between the lips of my pussy and a moan to leave my mouth. My nails dig into his scalp as his mouth lowers and he pulls my clit into his mouth, sliding my panties to the side, and slips first one finger, then two inside me, lifting up, causing a deep burn to build inside me then ignite as he lifts my leg to his shoulder and sucks my clit, flicking it with his tongue.</p><p>His name leaves my mouth on a loud cry and my body lights up, every cell of my body buzzing. As I come back to myself, I feel Wes enter me. My arms go around his shoulders and my legs around his hips as he pulls me from his car with his hands on my ass then presses me into the cold metal of his truck.</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of you having my son,\u201d he tells me, causing the walls of my vagina to contract around him. \u201cSeems you like it too, baby.\u201d He smiles, lifting me higher with his hands around my thighs. My heels dig into his ass and my nails grasp into his tee-covered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I moan then clamp down on his shoulder with my teeth, coming hard.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he roars, pulling me down hard on him, making the orgasm already flowing through me reignite as I feel him get bigger as warmth floods my insides. His hips still and my mouth releases his skin as he gathers me close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d I mumble, wrapping myself tighter around him, and he gathers me impossibly closer, carrying me through the house and setting me on the bed. He pulls my dress off, along with my bra and panties, and then goes to the bathroom, coming back a few minutes later with a makeup wipe. He gently takes of my makeup then lays me down, unstrapping my shoes.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna shirt, or you wanna sleep like that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChest-to-chest,\u201d I mumble then watch as he slips off his clothes and turns out the light. When his body compresses the bed, I snuggle into his side, and he pulls me up and over until I\u2019m lying on top of him with my legs between his.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby.\u201d His hand runs down my back, but I\u2019m too out of it to reply, so I just kiss his chest and give him a pat. His body shakes and I know he\u2019s laughing, but I ignore it and fall asleep.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>I wake up and look at the clock then down at the warm, sweet woman that\u2019s asleep on top of me, closing my eyes. I couldn\u2019t imagine not waking up to her everyday for the rest of my life.</p> <p>I kiss her hair and roll to the side, fighting myself from sliding back inside her as I adjust her on the bed. These moments are the hardest. If I could spend my days with my mouth on her or my cock inside her, I would, but I need to get up and feed the boys then go over and meet her dad.</p><p>I never thought I would be asking a father for permission to marry his daughter, but with July, I know her dad\u2019s approval is important, and if I\u2019m honest with myself, it\u2019s important to me as well. It would mean he thinks I\u2019m good enough for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d she mumbles in her sleep, burying her face in my chest and making me smile.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get up, baby,\u201d I tell her, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get up.\u201d She pouts, making me chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get up; you can sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good,\u201d she sighs, then tugs my pillow down, hugging it to her chest. I run a hand down my face and pick up my sweats off the chair, pulling them on, and then head to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I pause to give Capone a scratch then go to the kitchen and set up the coffee pot before getting the boys their food and feeding Taser, who just tweets when he sees me. I still laugh when I think of his name and the fact if it weren\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have met July. Once I finish a cup of coffee, I grab a bottle of water, the bottle of aspirin from the cabinet, along with a glass of orange juice, and take them with me, setting them on the side table, so when July wakes up, she will see them.</p><p>I pull out a pair of jeans and a thermal shirt, taking them with me to the guest bath so I don\u2019t wake her up.</p><p>Once I\u2019m done showering, I dress quickly, put on my boots, grab my wallet and cell, and then head to my truck. When I open the door for the garage, the light comes on and I smile then laugh, going back into the house to grab a rag so I can wipe down the side of my truck, where July\u2019s ass-print is. I don\u2019t think her dad would be cool with me showing up with proof on the side of my truck that I\u2019m trying to get his daughter pregnant, I think, then pause and lower my head, trying to breathe as I realize what I just thought. I know deep down it\u2019s the truth; I would be happy if she had my kid. Fuck, I would be over the moon about it, and my mom...hell, my mom would be fucking thrilled to be a grandmother.</p><p>\u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d I tell myself as I finish wiping down the truck.</p> <p>By the time I pull out onto the highway, I feel like I\u2019m preparing to go to war. I know that no matter what her dad says, I will still have July as my wife, but I want his approval, not for myself, but for her. I bought her ring two weeks ago, and I can\u2019t wait to put it on her finger.</p><p>When I pull up to her parents\u2019 house, I get out and November opens the front door, meeting me on the porch. \u201cHey, Wes. Where\u2019s my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill in bed. She had a little too much fun last night with her sisters,\u201d I tell her on a chuckle.</p><p>She starts laughing and gives me a hug once I reach the front door. \u201cThe girls are still in bed, and when I offered them breakfast, they started throwing stuff at me. So would you like some breakfast? I have plenty.\u201d She smiles, and I can plainly see where July got hers from.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d I agree, following her into the house and to the kitchen, where she has a whole buffet of food prepared.</p><p>\u201cI got a little carried away, but I like having the girls home, and I know one way to keep them coming back is by keeping them full while they\u2019re here,\u201d she says on a grin.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt they would continue to come back, even without your food,\u201d I assure her, seeing a lot of my mother in her.</p><p>\u201cYou hitting on my wife?\u201d Asher asks, coming into the kitchen, and I hide my smile. These two have most likely been together for a good twenty years, and you can tell he is still possessive and protective of his wife.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if that would bode well with you agreeing to let me marry your daughter,\u201d I tell him, and his eyes flash with respect, the same look he has given me since the first time we met, and some of the anxiety about this moment leaves me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose it would,\u201d he concurs, patting my shoulder then kissing his wife, whispering something to her that makes her snap out of her daze.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he asks me, holding up the pot.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I nod, and he fills a cup for himself and one for me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you deserve my girl?\u201d he asks, and I\u2019m actually impressed that\u2019s his first question. I take a drink of coffee and look at July\u2019s mom, who is watching me closely, more closely than she has any other time I\u2019ve been around her before.</p><p>I swallow and set my cup on the counter. \u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThere\u2019s probably someone out there who can give her more than I can, but I would kill that guy before I gave him the chance to prove me right.\u201d I look at her mom then her dad. \u201cI love her with everything in me. Since almost the moment I met her, I\u2019ve felt a pull to her unlike anything I have felt before. I don\u2019t deserve her, but no one will ever love her like I do or will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d one voice says from behind me, but I don\u2019t take my eyes off Asher.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re voting, my vote is yes,\u201d another voice says.</p><p>\u201cHe has my vote too,\u201d comes a third.</p><p>\u201cI love my sister, but if she says no, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApril!\u201d November snaps, making me chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAll right, son, you have my blessing. Now you just have to ask my girl,\u201d he says, and the word son fills me with a sense of pride.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me; turn around and look at the girls behind you,\u201d he tells me, and I do as he says, taking in July\u2019s four sisters. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any boys. I had five girls...five beautiful girls I swear to Christ were put on this earth to torture me.\u201d There is a lot of yelling, \u201cHey!\u201d from the girls, all of them glaring at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the first man, which means some of this weight has been lifted off me, and you now have the responsibility of helping me look out for my girls. Welcome to the family,\u201d he says, lifting his cup to me then to his mouth and taking a drink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s eat,\u201d November says, and I look at her then the girls, wondering what the hell I just got myself into. July is a handful on her own, and with all her sisters coming home over the next couple of years, I have a feeling I\u2019m going to need some back-up. I shake off the feeling, knowing I have a few years until I need to think about it, and go and eat breakfast.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d I answer the phone as the girls pass around the ring I got for July. I step out of the room and stand in the hallway. All along the wall are pictures of the Mayson family, and my eyes land on a picture of July when she was a little girl. Her long blonde hair looked wild, like she had been rolling in grass, her dress wrinkled, and her tiny arms were wrapped around a giant dog\u2019s neck, her head pressing into his black and white fur. He sat looking regal, the look on his face one that said he would eat anyone who got too close to her. I knew instantly that was Beast; I also knew from the picture the bond they shared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not home,\u201d she complains, her voice still scratchy from sleep. I look from the picture to the ground and smile. Since the moment I first stayed at her place, she has been calling her house our home. I love that.</p><p>\u201cI came to your parents\u2019 to get your Jeep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask after a long moment of silence, wondering if she has fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cDid my mom make breakfast?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I laugh and mutter, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you bring me some when you come home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure thing, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmurs, still sounding tired.</p><p>\u201cSleep \u2019til I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agrees, saying, \u201cI love you,\u201d before hanging up.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind making July a plate, and then following me back with the Jeep, so she doesn\u2019t catch onto why I was here?\u201d I ask, walking back into the living room.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Asher says, and November gets up, gathering some food together for July.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how you\u2019re going to ask her?\u201d December asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t thought much about it. Figured it would come to me,\u201d I confess, taking the ring back, putting it in the box then in my pocket again.</p><p>\u201cI think however you do it, it will be perfect. She loves you,\u201d November says, coming back and setting down a plate covered in plastic wrap. \u201cJust follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smile, and she pats my cheek.</p><p>\u201cThank you too, for loving my baby the way she deserves to be loved,\u201d she tells me, and those words echo in my ears as I make my way out to my car, and I watch Asher get in July\u2019s Jeep as November gets into her own SUV so they can follow me to the house. The first time I got married, I did it because I thought I loved her. Now, I know different. Now, I know what love feels like, and the way it doesn\u2019t change you, but makes you want to change yourself...to be worthy of the person you are with. I also know that no matter what I want to do in life, I will have a woman at my side to support me, and that says it all.</p><p>July</p><p>I roll over and look at the clock when I hear the garage door open, seeing it\u2019s a little after ten.</p><p>I get out of bed and find one of his shirts, slipping it on, and then find a pair of panties and pull them on before heading out into the living room, where I\u2019m greeted by Juice and Capone.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you would still be sleeping,\u201d Wes says, wrapping his arms around my waist from behind as I stop to pick up each of the boys for a cuddle.</p><p>\u201cI heard you come in,\u201d I tell him, and then my stomach growls. \u201cAnd I was hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just put your plate in the microwave.\u201d He kisses the side of my neck and I follow him into the kitchen, hopping up on the counter across from him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for getting my Jeep,\u201d I say, watching as he pulls the plate out of the microwave.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He takes in my position on the counter and smiles, handing me the plate then opening the drawer to get me a fork. \u201cCoffee or juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuice,\u201d I reply through a mouthful of fluffy pancake, and he pulls out the jug of orange juice from the fridge, giving me a glass and kissing my forehead before leaning on the counter behind him, crossing his arms over his chest. The top collar of his grey thermal is unbuttoned, showing off the defined muscles of his chest and arms. Last night flashes through my mind. I love the way he is able to make me feel so small and feminine, the way it feels as he\u2019s standing, holding me up with his strength while fucking me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about right now?\u201d</p><p>My eyes focus on him and I feel my cheeks heat, so I shove a forkful of food in my mouth again and mumble, \u201cNothing,\u201d causing him to smirk and my eyes to narrow, which only causes his smirk to turn into a grin. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for today?\u201d I ask, swallowing another bite of pancake.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go on a ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I agree immediately; there is nothing better than being on the back of his bike.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to dress warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a ride,\u201d he says, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree slowly, wondering what he\u2019s up to.</p><p>\u201cAlso, we need to stop pretending I\u2019m not living here, and stop wasting money on my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...you were the one pretending like you hadn\u2019t moved in,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I asked you, \u2018When did we move in together?\u2019 and you acted like we hadn\u2019t,\u201d I tell him, hopping off the counter and rinsing off my plate before setting it in the drying rack.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just didn\u2019t want to have that conversation, with your mom and dad in the next room. Plus, you looked freaked when you asked that shit.\u201d Okay, so he may be slightly right. I was a little freaked about it, just because I had no idea when it happened. It was like one minute we were dating, and the next, he moved in. \u201cJudging by the silence, I think you get my point,\u201d he says, and I roll my eyes. \u201cSo are you good with me closing my lease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agree, wrapping my arms around his waist and looking up into his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the mortgage on your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou rent this place?\u201d he asks as his eyebrows pull together.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit down,\u201d I suggest, walking him backwards until we reach the living room, where I push him onto the couch and straddle his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like this idea.\u201d He smiles, palming my ass and lifting up, causing my core to rub across the denim of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d I place my hands on his chest and lift my hips. \u201cLet me tell you about this, and then we can get back to this,\u201d I say, dropping my ass onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cGet to it, baby,\u201d he commands as his eyes drop to my mouth, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cMy mom was left an inheritance. My dad wouldn\u2019t let her use it, so she put it into an account and it grew, and when each of us girls turned twenty-one, we were given an even share of it. I paid for my clinic and my house, and the rest is in an account that just collects interest.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re loaded,\u201d he says, but I can\u2019t read his face. I don\u2019t know how to answer that question; I\u2019m not loaded, but I\u2019m comfortable, and will be until the day I die as long as I continue to work.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with you having money, baby. All that means to me is if something happens and I leave this earth before you, you\u2019re good. That shit will help me rest easy,\u201d he tells me, and with that, he pulls my mouth down to his and kisses me until I\u2019m riding him hard and fast on the couch, only stopping when I scream my orgasm into his mouth while he groans his into mine.</p><p>I watch the open road and smile while wrapping my arms tighter around Wes\u2019 stomach, feeling his muscles flex under my fingers I slid under his leather jacket and t-shirt.</p><p>This morning, after our couch session, I got up and took a shower, and then got dressed while Wes did whatever guys do while they are waiting for women to get ready. I chose a pair of dark jeans that I tucked into my brown boots, a tank top with a sweater and my brown leather jacket, and a scarf that has the story of The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett printed on it.</p> <p>I tied my hair into a long braid that I laid over one shoulder and did light makeup of bronzer, a little blush, and mascara. I know nothing about our destination today, and that is okay by me. I just like being with Wes, and if I happen to be on the back of his bike, that is even better.</p><p>We turn down one road and then another until we\u2019re riding on the road I first came across Wes and his boys. I can\u2019t believe that was only a few months ago; it feels like I have known Wes much longer. I honestly don\u2019t know what things would be like anymore without him in my life.</p><p>I would probably still be eating cereal alone in bed every night while watching TV, and only going out when my sisters were home. Thinking about it now, I realize how boring my life was. I was actually a perfect match for my ex; I was absolutely as boring as him, but just wasn\u2019t seeing it, and on that thought, I wrap my arms tighter around Wes.</p><p>We drive for about twenty more minutes then pull over to the side of the road, where I instantly recognize as the place I tasered him. It\u2019s actually a beautiful spot. The road curves around a large bend, there\u2019s a forest along the side of the road, and on the other side, there is a drop-off that looks out at the lake.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d I laugh, sliding off the bike behind him.</p><p>He does the same then stands in front of me, not speaking as he unhooks my helmet along with his, setting both on the seat.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of freaking me out,\u201d I tell him, not able to read his face.</p><p>\u201cThis is the place you knocked me on my ass,\u201d he says, and I smile. \u201cThe place I realized why I moved to Tennessee, and the place I found my future.\u201d I stop breathing as he puts his hand in his pocket, coming out with a diamond ring. \u201cI want to share everyday with you, to grow old with you. Will you be my wife?\u201d he asks, and I look down at the ring. The center stone is imbedded into the design of filigree work that runs around and down each side of the ring. My eyes go from the ring in his hand to his eyes, and my mouth opens and closes. I can\u2019t believe this moment is really happening.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d I ask after a long moment.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I wouldn\u2019t be asking you if I didn\u2019t know I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is forever, as in for-ev-er,\u201d I sound out.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re a pain in the ass,\u201d he says, grabbing my hand and sliding the ring onto my finger. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d he states, and a bubble of laughter climbs up my throat, which he silences with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I mumble against his lips when his mouth leaves mine.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d I whisper, and his face goes soft and he kisses me again, murmuring, \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow! I\u2019m getting married!\u201d I scream and start jumping around while holding my hand up in the air, looking at the way the light bounces off the stones.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell everyone,\u201d I say, breathing heavily and pausing to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d I run at him and he catches me in his arms as I wrap my legs around his waist. He hoists me up with his hands under my ass. \u201cI\u2019m so, so happy.\u201d I rest my forehead against his.</p><p>\u201cJuly Abigail Silver.\u201d He smiles, and my heart does a little flutter in my chest at the sound of his name with mine.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d I close my eyes and tighten my arms and legs around him.</p><p>\u201cMe too, babe,\u201d he replies, kissing me again. This time, his mouth stays against mine for an extra long moment.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d I repeat, opening my eyes and looking at the ring on my hand that is resting against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cSo I take it you say yes?\u201d he asks, and I look into his eyes and nod then press my mouth to his again.</p><p>\u201cYes, a million times,\u201d I say and he smiles. \u201cCan we go tell my mom and dad?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he mutters, \u201cThought I\u2019d at least get lucky before then, but yeah, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re gonna get lucky...very lucky, but the things I plan to do to you are going to take all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, and he slides me down his body, letting me feel his arousal, which causes me to whimper. \u201cMaybe we can tell my parents tomorrow,\u201d I suggest, and he throws his head back laughing, which causes me to giggle.</p><p>\u201cYour sisters will be excited. I wasn\u2019t sure when I was going to ask, and I know they are leaving tomorrow, so we can go visit with them then have the night to ourselves,\u201d he says then picks up the helmet off the seat, placing it gently over my head and buckling me in. My heart, which is already full of love for him, gets that much bigger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wait until he has his helmet on and lifts his leg over the bike before I do the same. Once I have my legs tight to his thighs and my hands on his abs, he starts up the bike, squeezes my knee, and then pulls off onto the road, going back the way we just came, and even though I just saw the same scenery moments before, everything looks more vibrant. The colors of the trees in yellows, golds and oranges that let you know fall is in full swing, and the air feels cleaner and I just feel happier.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long to reach my parents\u2019 house, and when we do, my dad is the first to step outside. His eyes go to Wes, and even though I was afraid of his reaction to Wes to begin with, I can\u2019t wait to tell him I\u2019m getting married, that I found someone who loves me the way he does, completely without question, and honestly, I should have known better. That was all my dad ever wanted for any of his girls.</p><p>As soon as Wes shuts off the bike, I lift my hand in the air, and yell, \u201cI\u2019m getting married!\u201d at the top of my lungs, which causes my dad to smile and Wes, who I was still pressed up against to laugh.</p><p>\u201cBabe, hop off,\u201d Wes orders, squeezing my knee, and I get off the bike and start fiddling with the straps of my helmet, trying to get it off while my hands shake with excitement. Lucky for me, Wes pushes my fingers away and quickly removes the helmet from my head. As soon as I\u2019m free, I take off at a run towards my dad, who is still smiling, only bigger now. I pause halfway, run back to Wes, kiss the underside of his jaw, and then take off back towards my dad, who is now laughing at me, but I don\u2019t care. I make it up the stairs to him and wrap my arms around his waist, feeling his go tight around me before I tip my head back and breathe, \u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d again, this time with tears in my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI know, my beautiful girl,\u201d he says gently, bringing one hand up to cup my cheek, and I can see a deep happiness in his eyes. That one look tells me he\u2019s happy I found what he and my mom have...what my grandparents have.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s mom?\u201d I ask, swiping my eyes free of the tears that had filled them.</p><p>\u201cShe and your sisters were out back near the fire pit,\u201d he tells me. I give him one more squeeze then take off into the house, running through, and then out the back door, yelling once again, \u201cWes asked me to marry him!\u201d only this time, my news is met with squeals of happiness from my sisters, who all come and hug me, each saying how happy they are. Then I look at my mom, who has her hand covering her mouth and tears in her eyes. I go to her, wrapping my arms around her waist then resting my head on her chest, like I did when I was young.</p><p>\u201cI love you, honey,\u201d she whispers, running a hand down my hair and back, \u201cmore than you could ever know.\u201d But she\u2019s wrong. I do know how much she loves me. I know, because since the first moment I can remember, she has reinforced that love, always showing just how much each of us means to her. I\u2019m lucky to have that, blessed beyond reason to know what it feels like to have that kind of love from my family. \u201cWes is a good man. Me and your father are both so happy for you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom,\u201d I tell her as a lump forms in my throat and a sob escapes.</p> <p>\u201cNo crying.\u201d Mom hushes me, and then I\u2019m transferred to another set of arms, and this time, the smell of Wes sweeps through my system as I take in a shaky breath, muttering against his shirt, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t riding that damn bike with my baby girl on the back, I\u2019d offer you a beer,\u201d my dad says, making me laugh and look up at Wes.</p><p>I turn my head to smile at my dad. \u201cI love that damn bike,\u201d I tell him, something he already knows, and he just shakes his head, putting his beer to his lips and taking a pull before muttering, \u201cOne down, four to go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>I look down at my phone and bite my lip when I see Wes is calling.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to answer that?\u201d Kayan asks, and I want to say no, but I know deep down that I can\u2019t avoid Wes forever. Especially since we live together. It\u2019s been a week since he asked me to marry him, a week of us living happily, and a week of getting all of his crap out of his old apartment and moving it to my house.</p> <p>I\u2019m happy, and I know he is too, but I have a feeling I may have stepped over my bounds as new fianc\u00e9 today, when I walked the three blocks down from my clinic and went to the furniture store in town. We didn\u2019t need anything new; we\u2019re keeping my bed, but we changed out my couch for his, since his is newer, the leather soft and the cushions comfortable. Plus, it has the cool cup holders built into the armrests, and the seats lean back, so you can lay and watch a movies without taking up the whole couch. I love his couch, and my old couch is going into storage, along with anything else in good enough condition that one of my sisters or cousins could use it when they come home to live.</p><p>But that isn\u2019t why Wes is calling, and I know this, because when we discussed getting a new bed or keeping mine, it reminded me of his bed at the compound. I know he hasn\u2019t slept with anyone in it since meeting me, but I\u2019m also not na\u00efve enough to believe the mattress hadn\u2019t seen a lot of action prior to us. That thought made me sick. It also made me pissed, so I stomped three blocks over to Jem\u2019s Furniture Warehouse and ordered a new bed for Wes, which would be being delivered right now.</p><p>The phone went silent, and then started ringing again, and Kayan, who was looking at me, dropped her eyes to the phone and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I tell her then bite the inside of my cheek, debating what I should do, but then my cell phone stops and the office phone starts up.</p><p>\u201cBeast\u2019s Veterinarian Clinic, how can I help you?\u201d Kayan asks, answering the phone before I can tell her not to or slide across the counter and pull the phone from her ear.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Wes, but she\u2019s with someone right now. Do you want me to have her call you back?\u201d she asks as I jump around with my hands in the air, pointing at myself and shaking my head franticly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can tell my best friend that,\u201d Kayan says, looking at me with her eyes getting big then hangs up the phone then raises a brow at me.</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I guess your lunch break consisted of a shopping trip?\u201d she prompts.</p><p>I press my lips together then ask, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask him yourself. He\u2019s on his way down here.\u201d She smiles, and my heart starts to pound in my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d I hiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause what he told me to tell you didn\u2019t exactly sound like punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. Z has caused you to become delusional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a head-start on getting away, I suggest you go now.\u201d She returns to looking at her computer, and I glare at her then jump when I hear the sound of a door slamming in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I tell her, watching Wes walk up to the front of the clinic.</p><p>\u201cRun.\u201d She laughs, and I do just that. I take off towards my office, where I know I have a lock on the door, enter, and shut it behind me, pressing the button.</p><p>\u201cBabe, open the door.\u201d Wes pounds, and I\u2019m sure my ex-best friend told him where I am, because she would find it funny. \u201cIf you don\u2019t open it, I\u2019m taking it off the hinges,\u201d he shouts, and I have no doubt he will do just that, so I take the two steps to the door, twist the knob, releasing the lock, and then jump back behind my desk, putting it between us.</p><p>I expect the door to crash open, but instead, it opens slowly and Wes fills the space, his hands resting on his hips. I didn\u2019t see him before he left this morning, because like most days, he went to work a couple hours before me. My eyes take him in, not for the first time thinking how lucky I am. He is hot, today and like always, and in anger, his features stand out and he looks even more handsome. His top-half is covered in a burgundy thermal, and a black jacket with a straight collar that looks good against his neck and jaw. Today\u2019s jeans are darker, and of course his black boots. My eyes travel from his boot-covered feet to his face.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I smile, and his eyes narrow before he steps inside the office and shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cLose the clothes.\u201d</p><p>At his words, my body jumps and I whisper, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes, \u2019cause if I do it, I can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll have anything to wear home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t I made sure.\u201d</p><p>My hands go to my jacket and I slip it off my shoulders then pull my shirt off over my head. As I remove my clothes with shaky fingers, he moves the stuff on my desk, setting it aside before taking off his jacket and tossing it onto my chair. Knowing what is going to happen\u2014or thinking I know what\u2019s going to happen\u2014is causing wetness to form between my legs and my breathing to pick up.</p><p>I stand there naked, and Wes\u2019 eyes move hungrily over me before he growls,</p><p>\u201cCome here. I want your tits to the desk and your hands above your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes\u2014\u201d I try again.</p><p>\u201cNo more talking; just do it.\u201d</p><p>I chew on the inside of my cheek for just a moment before stepping around to the side of my desk, bending over the side, and inhaling a sharp breath as my nipples touch the cool wood.</p><p>\u201cHands all the way up,\u201d he orders. I slide my hands out above me until I\u2019m almost on my tiptoes. \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m pissed?\u201d he asks, stepping up behind me, the feel of the denim of his jeans rubbing against my bare skin.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and his hand slides over my ass, his boot-covered foot spreading mine farther apart.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think you deserve to be punished for going behind my back, ordering a bed, having it delivered, and telling them they had to take away the old one or you wouldn\u2019t pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I tell him honestly.</p><p>\u201cFigured you\u2019d feel that way.\u201d He bent over me, nipping my ear. \u201cYou gonna apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him, squeezing my eyes closed as his hand slides over my clit, then cry out as that same hand comes down hard on my ass.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t sound sincere, baby,\u201d he admonishes, placing that hand back between my legs. Each pass over my clit causes my back to arch and my ass to press into his groin. \u201cNow, tell me you\u2019re sorry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the bed,\u201d I say, and his fingers slide inside me, out and around my clit, and then back in deep. His other hand slides under me, cups my breast, and pulls at my nipple.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaked, baby. You like pissing me off. Does it make you hot?\u201d he asks against my ear, making me whimper. Then his hand moves from between my legs again, spanking me harder than the last time.</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d I stutter out, needing just a little more. My body is on fire, every inch of me just waiting to see what he\u2019ll do next.</p><p>\u201cYour pussy\u2019s so hungry you\u2019d think I wasn\u2019t feeding it everyday,\u201d he tells me as my core tightens around his fingers entering me. He then steps back and orders, \u201cUp.\u201d Confused, I look over my shoulder at him and swallow when I see the look in his eyes. \u201cUp on your knees, baby.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>My.</p><p>God.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this in my office, even if my office is down at the end of the hall, too far away for anyone to hear anything.</p><p>\u201cUp, baby,\u201d he says a little softer, and I lift one knee then the other onto the desktop, and then look over my shoulder at him.</p><p>His eyes travel from my gaze, over the curve of my back and ass, and then lock between my legs. \u201cI wish you could see what I see right now. Wish you could see how fucking hot you look, how wet and swollen your pussy is for me...for my touch.\u201d He shakes his head, puts his hands behind his neck, and pulls off his shirt.</p><p>I lick my lip as his abs flex, and the outline of his cock in his jeans is so large that I know when he unhooks the buttons, the head will be red and angry, the veins down the length so pronounced when he slides inside me I swear I can feel each of them.</p><p>He steps back behind me and I lower my head, waiting to see what he will do. His hands go to my ass and lifts, and then I feel the wet warmth of his tongue sliding over me.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d I whimper as I feel my arms shake while attempting to hold myself up.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d He licks again then swirls his tongue around. I feel his thumbs holding me open to him, bringing me closer and closer, and then my arms give out and my head lowers when my orgasm crashes over me. It takes a moment to come back to myself, but when I do, he\u2019s entering me swiftly in a hard, fast thrust.</p><p>I push back on him each time then lift up on my hands as my knees start to slide farther apart. My legs start to shake as his hand comes down hard on my ass, and then whimper as he flips me to my back and reenters me, one hand going to my thigh, the other going down my stomach, his thumb pressing against my clit.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I cry, my head tilting back, my hands going to my breasts, pulling my nipples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me your eyes.\u201d My head tilts down again and our gaze connects. Then his eyes travel down my body from my hands on my breasts to our connection, and his thumb swirls faster as he bends forward, puts his hand behind my head, lifts me up to him, and takes my mouth in a deep kiss, his taste and mine flooding my mouth. My hands move to his shoulders, clutching at him as my legs wrap tighter around his hips.</p><p>\u201cSqueeze me, baby.\u201d</p><p>I do without needing to be told as my core convulses around him with my orgasm, pulling him even deeper. His hips jerk and he plants himself deep, groaning his orgasm into the skin of my throat as my limbs lock tight around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy you a bed everyday,\u201d I say with a smile, and I feel his body shake against mine, letting me know he\u2019s laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, baby.\u201d He pulls his face away from my neck and moves some hair out of my face. \u201cDon\u2019t do that shit again.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together to avoid telling him I won\u2019t, because it\u2019s already done; there is no need to buy another bed for his room at the compound. We don\u2019t stay there often, but when we do, I don\u2019t want to think about who was there before me. I can\u2019t handle that.</p><p>\u201cI love you...only you,\u201d he says, reading my face. \u201cMy future will be with you. Nothing before you matters.\u201d Tears fill my eyes and I turn my head to the side to avoid his gaze while crying. But Wes, being Wes, places his hand on my cheek, pulling my attention back to him. \u201cNo crying.\u201d He wipes my tears and I nod, but still, the tears fall.</p><p>He slides out, fixes his jeans, and then gathers me into his arms and turns to sit on my desk, with his arms tight around me. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m crying...probably the stress and excitement of everything that has happened. \u201cI hate when you cry, baby,\u201d he says softly, and my face presses into his neck for a moment, taking in a deep lungful of his scent before tilting my head back to look at him. His fingers run under my eyes and he searches my face. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a lot has happened and I think I just needed to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou happy?\u201d he questions, and that has me searching his face, seeing worry in his eyes. I never want him to worry about my feelings for him.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little, I told myself the guy I would marry would love to ride motorcycles, have a soft spot for animals, and be strong like my dad.\u201d I place my hand on his stubble-covered jaw and run my thumb over his bottom lip. \u201cWhen I got older, I never believed I would find a guy like that. Then you chased me down on your motorcycle and gave me everything I could ever want. So, no, I\u2019m not happy; I surpassed that the first time you looked at me like I was something you wanted to devour and protect, all at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispers, looking into my eyes before pulling me closer and tucking my face into his neck. \u201cNever wanted much, babe, but knew the moment I looked into your eyes that I wanted you. Just didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have a shot. I promise I\u2019ll find a way to make myself worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my everything,\u201d I tell him, then look at the clock and slide out of his arms to stand in front of him. \u201cSorry about the bed, but I\u2019m not taking it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know what it cost and I\u2019ll give you the money for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I frown, going to my chair and pulling on my panties then putting on my bra.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me the cost,\u201d he says a little more firmly. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk about it now, but I also need to know the house cost, so I can give you that. Then we\u2019ll figure out the bills and shit, so we can get that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I own my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, baby, but I\u2019m not going to be living there free and clear, knowing you paid for it and I didn\u2019t do my part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he says immediately.</p><p>\u201cThen what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters, because you\u2019re not my mother; you\u2019re my woman, and it\u2019s my job to take care of you,\u201d he says, but I\u2019m still completely lost. I mean, I know whenever we go out he doesn\u2019t let me pay, not even for groceries, and I\u2019m fine with that\u2014not that I have a choice\u2014but this is a house I paid for already, so getting money back on it, when that money would just go into an account, doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \u201cI\u2019m not loaded, baby, but I have money saved from the service, and work at the shop is good. I need to know that I do my part.\u201d</p><p>I can tell by his tone that he is serious and this means something to him, so I just nod while putting on my shirt. Once I have it on, I go to him and place my hands on his thighs. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it worked out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAppreciate that, baby. You got anymore patients today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta head back to the shop, but call when you\u2019re on your way home and we\u2019ll figure out dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I smile, leaning in and pressing my mouth to his.</p><p>\u201cHow much shit is your girl going to talk when I leave?\u201d</p><p>That comment gets him a full smile as I mumble, \u201cTons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured.\u201d He smiles back and waits until I have on my pants and shoes before opening the door. I walk him out hand-in-hand, past a smiling Kayan, who laughs her, \u201cLater, Wes.\u201d He doesn\u2019t reply, just gives her a chin lift and me a touch from his mouth before leaving through the glass doors.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should buy Z a bed,\u201d Kayan says as soon as the door closes behind Wes. I look at her and roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not the only one with a scary-hot guy,\u201d she mutters.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with you and Z?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat between us. My parents are still being dumb, and I think my dad may end up murdered if he tells one more guy to ask me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing that while you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Z is about to have a coronary because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he is.\u201d Knowing Z and how protective he is over Kayan, I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019s even a little okay with what her dad is doing. Hell, if my dad was doing that to Wes and me, I\u2019m pretty sure Wes would kill him.</p><p>\u201cLast week, he asked Mark to call me and ask me to dinner. Z was there when I got the call, and spoke to Mark. He explained that even though my dad didn\u2019t want to believe I\u2019m in a relationship, I\u2019m very much taken and pregnant, and surprisingly, Z was very nice to him and asked if he could spread the word to anyone else he knows who might hear the same thing from my father. Mark agreed that he would and told us congrats on the baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour dad is an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I see tears fill her eyes, so I walk around the counter and hug her. \u201cZ is perfect, amazing actually, and I worry this is going to push him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, honey, and I have a feeling there is nothing that would ever keep Z away.\u201d And that was the truth. Even Kayan\u2019s overbearing parents were no match for Z, who had found a woman to spend his life with. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to cry.

When the baby gets here, I bet they change their tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t stop what they\u2019re doing, I won\u2019t let them see the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask surprised, not that Kayan has ever been really afraid of her parents, but they have been known to push her into things she really didn\u2019t want to do.</p> <p>\u201cReally. Z\u2019s the man I\u2019m going to marry one day, and he will be the father of our children. He deserves respect, much more than they have given him, and if that doesn\u2019t change, I won\u2019t be allowing them to see our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think if you tell them that, they might come around a little quicker than you think,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone not want to be a part of your baby\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m the smart friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever, that just means I\u2019m the hot one.\u201d She shrugs, making me laugh before I head back to my office.</p><p>I look at the clock, see it\u2019s midnight, roll over, grab Wes\u2019 gift from under my side of the bed, and sit up. I turn on my bedside light then look at Wes, who is sleeping with his hand, which was wrapped around my waist, now over my thighs.</p><p>I run my hand over his hair, and his eyes open slowly and he looks up at me, looking sleepy and confused.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d I smile and he double blinks.</p><p>His eyebrows come together and he looks over me, glancing at the clock, then smiles as he lifts up and kisses me, saying, \u201cMerry Christmas, baby,\u201d against my lips.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d I hand him the box I have been holding onto for weeks, but then I want to take it back and rip the paper off for him when he just looks at it. \u201cI know technically we open gifts tomorrow, but I just can wait any longer,\u201d I tell him excitedly. He sits up completely, the sheet landing at his waist, so the expanse of his chest is visible. I turn towards him, sitting on my calves with my knees tucked against his thigh. \u201cPlease, open it.\u201d I bounce a little, which makes his eyes drop to my breasts, which are not covered, since after he made love to me, I didn\u2019t take the time to put anything on.</p><p>\u201cNot sure I can focus on this with your tits bouncing in my face,\u201d he says, and I roll my eyes, pulling the sheet up to cover my chest. \u201cShould have kept my mouth shut,\u201d he mutters, and I cry, \u201cOpen the box!\u201d which makes him laugh.</p> <p>He pulls my face to his with a hand wrapped around my nape, and then he lets me go and drops his eyes to the box, ripping the paper off slowly. Finally, he opens the top of the box, moving the tissue paper out of the way and pulling out the leather wallet I had designed for him. When asked what he wanted for Christmas, he would repeat over and over that he wanted me in a bow, naked in bed, waiting for him. Since he could have that any day of the year, I gave up on asking him, and actually gave up on finding him anything at all until I was talking to my Aunt Liz, and she told me about a shop in town where the guy custom made silver jewelry and leather goods. So I talked him about what I wanted, and a little about our story, and he created a piece of art that Wes could carry with him always and add things to it as time went on.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispers, and I bite my bottom lip, watching the way his fingers travel over the designs in the leather, which if you\u2019re not looking closely, you would miss. I chose things I felt repressed us: the Taser and bird from the first time we met, the motorcycle that is a huge part of our lives and who he is, and then on the back, his name, Silver, in the shape of a motorcycle, and on the end, where the medal hook is that holds his chain, is the date he asked me to marry him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to carry it\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cut off when his mouth crashes down on mine and he rips the sheet away, pulling me over to straddle his lap. The feel of his tongue and his taste work through my system as he adjusts me slightly, filling me with him. I rock against him slowly, wrapping my arms more tightly around him, our mouths never leaving the other as he brings me to a slow orgasm that doesn\u2019t explode, but burns, feeling like it never ends. Tears spring from my eyes and I taste salt in our kiss as his orgasm slides down my throat.</p><p>When he leans his head back, his hands hold my face gently and he whispers, \u201cI love you, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I reply, because I do know; I feel it all the time. Even when we\u2019re apart, I feel it.</p><p>\u201cGonna carry it always,\u201d he says while wiping away another stray tear, and I know he\u2019s talking about more than just the wallet. He\u2019s also talking about the love and connection we have. I cuddle closer to him as he leans over with us still connected and turns off the light, and then he adjusts us, with me still on top of him, him still deep inside of me as he pulls the covers over us. He rubs my back for a long time while I listen to the sound of his breath. When it evens out, I follow him off to sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re glowing,\u201d my mom says, walking up to me and wrapping her arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d I smile at her and wrap my arm around her. I lean my head on her shoulder and look at my family and Wes, who are all sitting in my parents\u2019 living room, talking and laughing. When we got up this morning, we fed Capone and Juice then sat around our Christmas tree and opened the gifts we had gotten one another. Wes got me a beautiful gold necklace that is an exact replica of his dog tag he wears, just smaller. The small metal plate has the same information his dog tag carries, but unless you flip it over, you would never know it is just for me. He will always be pressed to my skin, the same way he\u2019s wrapped around my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d my mom asks, and my gaze immediately goes to her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom.\u201d I smile, then add, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispers in shock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, Mom.

Honestly, I\u2019m shocked your dad is so cool about Wes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to love about Wes,\u201d I tell her, and she looks out at the living room at Wes and my dad, who seem to be in a deep conversation. Then my dad throws his head back, laughing and patting Wes on the shoulder as he chuckles. His eyes come to me and go soft, and then he turns his attention back to my man.</p><p>\u201cYou did good, honey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I reply, taking a sip of coffee then laying my head against hers, laughing when I see my sisters dancing around in the matching pajamas my mom got all of us for Christmas. This is more than I could have ever hoped for, everyone I love in the same place, all of us together.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we get the turkey in the oven and have a mimosa?\u201d Mom asks, and I nod, giving her waist a squeeze, and then we get the turkey in the oven and go out to sit with everyone else, me tucked close to Wes\u2019 side, my sisters all gathered together, and my dad with my mom on his lap. We all stay like that most of the day, only taking breaks to cook then to eat. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better Christmas.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cBabe, where the fuck are you?\u201d Wes growls as soon as I put my phone to my ear after digging through my bag to find it. It\u2019s a week since Christmas, and things have been good. I\u2019ve been busy trying to plan a wedding, and Wes has been busy keeping me cool about it.</p><p>\u201cI had to stop at the store to get chips and stuff for the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having a party,\u201d he says, and I know that if I were in front of him, he would be shaking his head with a smile on his face.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more than ten people coming over to watch football. I think that\u2019s called a party,\u201d I explain, rolling my eyes while tossing some avocados in my basket.</p><p>\u201cI got beer,\u201d he says like that\u2019s all anyone needs, and he may be right with his boys; as long as they have beer, they\u2019re cool. And that was fine before he had a woman, but not now. So I\u2019ll be making wings, seven layer dip, fresh salsa, and some puff pastries I\u2019m sure the guys will complain are too girly, but will scarf down. I\u2019m even getting two apple pies. No, I didn\u2019t make them from scratch, but they\u2019re Wes\u2019 favorite, so that\u2019s all that matters. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d he asks, bringing me back to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI know you got beer, honey,\u201d I tell him, walking up to check out, and I do know he got beer, because last night, when I got home from work, there were five cases of beer on the back porch where he had put them, because it was cold enough out that he didn\u2019t have to put them in the fridge in the house. \u201cI\u2019m still getting snacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like going all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain in the ass,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou love this ass.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah, I do,\u201d he growls, causing a shiver to slide down my spine as I put the groceries on the conveyer belt.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d I tell him softly while swiping my card through the credit card machine.</p><p>\u201cSee you then, baby,\u201d he says, and I smile at the cashier, pick up my bags, and head toward the doors.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d I say, hanging up and shoving my phone into my purse, then shuffle the shopping bag from one hand to the other so I can open the door to my car. Once the doors open, I lean over the driver\u2019s seat and set my purse and the bags down, then scream out when I\u2019m pulled backwards. A hand covers my mouth and I kick my legs hard as I\u2019m dragged into a van and the door slams shut. My knees hit the metal floor and I feel a sharp blade against my throat.</p><p>\u201cGot you, bitch,\u201d is breathed near my ear, and the stench of cigarettes and leather hits my nose. \u201cYou scream, and I\u2019m slicing your throat. Nod if you understand me.\u201d</p><p>I nod frantically, and my mouth is uncovered and I\u2019m pushed over until my cheek hits the floor. My hands are pulled together and my wrists are tied behind my back with what feel like plastic ties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you just like this, at my mercy, nowhere to go, no one to hear you cry,\u201d the guy behind me says, pressing his hard-on against my ass, making me gag. I feel tears roll over the bridge of my nose onto the floor before a sharp blow to the side of my head, then nothing but black.</p><p>I open my eyes then slam them shut, not wanting to believe what I\u2019m seeing is real. My heartbeat thumps rapidly, and my breathing begins to increase, so much so that I know if I don\u2019t calm down, I will pass out again. I take a moment, gathering courage, and when I open my eyes again, it takes a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. I look around, seeing I\u2019m in a small room. The walls are pitched, which makes me believe I\u2019m in an attic. The sound of dogs barking is so loud it\u2019s almost deafening.</p><p>My eyes land on a small figure that is huddled in the corner. Her long brown hair is down, and her face is smudged with dirt, along with her clothes. I scoot closer to her and she begins to cower away.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d I whisper, going to her side, but not too close. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl...Ellie. Wh-what\u2019s yours?\u201d she whispers in a hoarse tone after a long moment.</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d I whisper back. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d I ask while looking around the space, trying to see if there are any windows.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whimpers, and I can hear the fear in her voice from that one single word.</p><p>\u201cHow did they get you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Her eyes close and she lowers her head as her body begins to shake, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to answer, but then she says so low that I almost miss it, \u201cMy mom sold me to these guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I hiss, completely caught off-guard.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whimpers, dropping my hand and wrapping her arms around her legs, resting her forehead on her bent knees. \u201cShe has my daughter. I need to get my daughter,\u201d she cries, and her body begins to shake with silent tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wrap my arms around her and whisper, \u201cIt will be okay,\u201d even though I have no idea how I will make it okay. Not for her...not with this.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. There was another girl here before me. They took her out, and when they brought her back, she was strung out on some kind of drug. She didn\u2019t even remember her own name,\u201d she tells me, and memories of what Wes told me about these guys flash through my head, making me vow that I will get us out of here before they can hurt us.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything? See anything?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was unconscious when they brought me here. When I woke up, Claire was with me. She said she was kidnapped from outside her house. Not long after I woke up, they came and got her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did they look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know. They were big; one of them had a tattoo on his forehead of a spider,\u201d she says, and a chill slides over me, knowing that was the same person who threatened Kayan at her apartment.</p><p>\u201cWe need to look around and see if we can find anything to use as a weapon to protect ourselves when they come back. My fianc\u00e9 will be expecting me home soon, and when I don\u2019t show, he\u2019ll come looking for me,\u201d I tell her, trying to comfort her and myself.</p><p>I just have no idea how long I was out, or how long it took for them to bring me here. I hate this. I can\u2019t imagine what Wes is going to do when he realizes I\u2019m not on my way home.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I whisper, and we begin crawling around on the floor, trying to be careful, because there seem to be some parts that are weak in the floor, like the structure is old. The floor is covered in a thick layer of dust, and my hand runs over a puddle of thick liquid, and when I lift my hand close to my face, my stomach turns as I see it\u2019s actually blood. Someone was hurt here, hurt bad. It\u2019s not a little blood; it\u2019s a lot of it.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I whimper in fear as the weight of the situation crashes over me.</p><p>\u201cI found something,\u201d Ellie says from across the room, and I wipe my hand on my jeans and go towards her. When I make it to her side, I see she has a two-by-four with a thick rusty nail sticking out of one side.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d I say, giving her a hug. At least we won\u2019t be going down without a fight. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find anything else, and then we\u2019ll come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>Wes</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s July?\u201d Mic asks, and I look from the TV to my phone and feel myself frown. I spoke with her fifteen minutes ago; she should be home by now. I put the phone to my ear and her phone rings and goes to voicemail.</p><p>\u201cThis is July. Leave a message...or not. Who leaves messages nowadays anyways?\u201d She laughs, and a bad feeling settles in the bottom of my gut. I click off the phone then redial, and it rings then goes to voicemail again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Harlen asks as I step out onto the front porch, where he\u2019s having a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s off,\u201d I tell him, waiting to see if her car comes around the corner. The store that we always go to is about ten minutes from the house, if that, and she was checking out when I hung up. \u201cJuly\u2019s not picking up her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she can\u2019t reach it,\u201d he says, and I nod, but I know that\u2019s not the case. Something\u2019s definitely off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving her three more minutes, but then I\u2019m taking off to look for her,\u201d I tell him, putting my phone back to my ear and trying her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride with you,\u201d he agrees, going into the house, coming back moments later with his jacket and handing me mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Mic asks stepping out onto the front porch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna ride out with Wes to check on July. You stay here and have her call if she gets back,\u201d Harlen tells him, and I pull on my jacket then try her number one more time.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I clip and head towards my bike, swinging my leg over my seat, and Harlen does the same with his. The rumble of our pipes fills the air as we pull out of our driveway. I ride ahead of Harlen onto Main, heading right to the store, where I know July was last.</p> <p>The moment we get there, I see her car in the parking lot off to the side of the door, where no one would see it. My stomach drops and my adrenaline kicks in as I pull into the space next to it and look inside. Her purse and the groceries she had just bought are sitting inside on the passenger seat. I open the back door, knowing not to touch the front in case someone needs to dust for prints, and reach in to grab her bag, pulling out her cell to see if she had gotten a call from anyone else, and there are no messages or anything in her call log.</p><p>When I lift my head, I see Harlen is on the phone, so I head into the store to see if anyone had seen anything, which no one has, and they don\u2019t even have cameras, so that\u2019s out. When I get back outside, Jax, Talon, Sage, and July\u2019s uncle Nico are waiting near her car, with Harlen, Mic, Everett and two officers I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cZ\u2019s at the house with Kayan,\u201d Mic says when he notices me looking at him.</p><p>\u201cThey got any cameras?\u201d Nico asks, and I shake my head while walking closer to them, instead of going to the building and punching the shit out of it to relieve some of the rage I have pumping through me.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be able to keep your head?\u201d Nico questions, and I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cI find who took her, they\u2019re dead,\u201d I say, meaning that shit to my core. Not if, but when I find them, they will pay with their lives for taking her from me.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to take you in?\u201d Nico asks, and I fold my arms over my chest. Uncle or not, I will lay him out if he thinks he can take me anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna stand around all day asking dumb as fuck questions while my woman is out there somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ma let that slide, \u2019cause I know you\u2019re worried about my niece, but say some shit like that again and I will put you down,\u201d Nico threatens, and my body stills and expands, ready to tackle his ass to the ground.</p><p>\u201cBrother,\u201d Mic says, and I turn my attention to him, \u201ccool it.\u201d</p><p>I run my hands down my face, attempting to get myself under control. Lashing out at everyone isn\u2019t going to help anything right now. \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Nico puts his hands on his hips. \u201cShe had no enemies, and the man I would have thought had something to do with this is in prison awaiting trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I rumble, and then think about Landon. It\u2019s a long shot, but he may know something. \u201cI\u2019m going to ride to Mamma\u2019s Country.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think someone there is connected?\u201d Harlen asks, straddling his bike.</p><p>\u201cNot sure, but it\u2019s doing no good just standing around here,\u201d I mutter then look at Nico. \u201cYou call Asher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he and November are going to your house to wait and see if she showed up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. Call me if you find anything, and I\u2019ll do the same,\u201d I tell him, and he lifts his chin. I straddle my bike, start it up, lift my chin, and take off. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Mamma\u2019s Country, and the parking lot is empty except for a few cars I\u2019m sure are regulars at the bar during the week. I park close to the entrance, Mic on my left, Harlen on my right, and we get off our bikes and head inside. Tommy is behind the bar, and his eyes come to us.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ronnie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffice,\u201d he says, and I head back behind the bar and knock once, opening the door without waiting for an okay. As soon as the door opens, Ronnie is standing behind his desk with a nine-millimeter aimed at us.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ronnie says, putting away his gun. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about my woman being taken today?\u201d I ask him, and he sits back in his chair and his face goes pale. Knowing what happened to his daughter I\u2019m sure he gets how fucked up this situation is.</p><p>\u201cNo, son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boy?\u201d I ask, and he looks at the three of us. I\u2019m sure we look imposing as fuck standing in front of his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Landon says, coming into the office and walking around to stand next to his dad. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuly was taken from outside the grocery store on 5th. You know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, looking at each of us then his dad. \u201cSince Snake got locked up, things have been quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a guy with a tattoo of a spider on his skull?\u201d</p><p>He swallows and then looks at his dad again then back at me. \u201cSnake\u2019s brother, River, has a spider tattoo.\u201d</p> <p>How the fuck did I not know he had a brother? \u201cYou know where he hangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he used to work at the tattoo shop on Westend, but since that place got new management and they didn\u2019t much like the fact he had a history of being inappropriate to the women who came into have work done, they let him go. \u201cIf you go over there, they might be able to tell you some info,\u201d he suggests, and I know exactly who he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>Blaze and his boy Jinx just opened a tattoo shop in town and bought out the people who owned Daniel\u2019s Bar, where July, her sisters, and her cousins had gone to drink. Jinx was a recruit, and Blaze came to talk to us a week ago about wanting into our club. We were still talking about it. Our crew has always been small, but since moving to town, there has been an influx of new recruits, guys who have ridden solo, or who have crews that are into drugs or other shit we\u2019re not into, and they want to ride clean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Jinx and have him bring Blaze with him to the compound, and then we can go from there,\u201d Harlen says, walking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou want us to do anything?\u201d Landon asks, and I know July\u2019s right; he\u2019s a good kid. He was just in a situation that was out of his hands, and he was doing the right thing the only way he could, by bringing in those dogs.</p><p>\u201cCall around and see if anyone knows where he is, or if anyone knows who he\u2019s hanging out with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, man, and sorry about your woman. She seemed cool,\u201d he says, and I lift my chin and head out the bar, meeting Harlen, who\u2019s standing near his bike.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re meeting us at the compound.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s roll out,\u201d I mutter, getting back on my bike.</p><p>When we get to the compound, the street is littered with bikes and cars. I look at Harlen, and he shakes his head as we park our bikes and move towards the gate. The second we get inside, we see all the guys are there, not just the few we called to meet us.</p><p>\u201cWe know you guys don\u2019t know if you\u2019re recruiting anymore members, but we wanted to come and show our support and help anyway we can,\u201d Maxen says, patting my shoulder, and I look around the open area of the compound. There must be at least thirty guys standing around, some whom I know, and others I have never seen before.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Preciate that, brother,\u201d I tell him then move to where I see Z talking to Blaze and Jinx.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kayan?\u201d I ask Z as soon as I reach his side.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with July\u2019s mom and dad,\u201d he says, and I nod then put my attention on Blaze.</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about a guy named River? He has a snake tattoo on his skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he was at Zero\u2019s before we bought it. Management was afraid of him, so even though he had a history of stepping over the line with female clients, they never fired him. Unfortunately for him, me and Blaze didn\u2019t hold that same fear, so as soon as we closed on the shop, we gave him his walking papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he went?\u201d Mic asks, and Jinx shakes his head.</p><p>Blaze looks at me. \u201cOne of his clients came into the shop and said he moved to Chapel Hill. Said he bought an old church and was going to open a tattoo shop in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I tell him, walking towards my room with the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou got anything?\u201d Jax asks as soon as he answers, and I unlock the door, go in, lift my mattress, and grab my gun, putting it in the back of my jeans, pulling my shirt out and over it.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. Seems Snake has a brother, and I think he\u2019s the same guy who threatened the girls before. I\u2019m gonna take a few of the guys to Chapel Hill to see if I can find anything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet you at the gas station off the highway in ten and I\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d I hang up, lock up my room, head straight towards my bike, and swing my leg over.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want us to do here?\u201d Blaze and Jinx ask, and I hadn\u2019t even realized they were following me.</p><p>\u201cAsk around and see if anyone heard anything, if anyone knows anything. Right now, we\u2019re taking any lead we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.,\u201d Blaze says, stepping back from my bike.</p><p>\u201cJax is meeting us off the highway and will follow us down,\u201d I tell Harlen, Everett, Z, and Mic.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s roll,\u201d Mic says, and it takes just a few minutes to get to the gas station, and when we do, I don\u2019t even stop; I just circle the parking lot and let Jax follow me in his SUV. On the highway, I lead with my boys to my sides and July\u2019s cousins to my back. It takes less then twenty minutes to get to Chapel Hill, and when we pull into town, I stop at the first mom and pop shop I see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t really got time to stop and get cookies, Silver,\u201d Jax says, and I ignore him and head inside the small shop, and just what I thought, an older gentlemen is behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you know anything about a church in town being up for sale?\u201d I ask him, and he nods.</p><p>\u201cIf you take a right out of the parking lot and go about four miles then go over the train tracks, past Lord\u2019s Jewelry, you\u2019ll see it on the left.

They grew up in foster care together, and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t know about him. Seems like River is Snake\u2019s muscle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I say, and I hear Mic before I see him. He pulls up close on his bike and doesn\u2019t even shut it down before he starts to talk.</p><p>\u201cChurch parking lot is empty, and the doors have chains locking them closed. Across the street are some houses, and I saw a woman out front in her garden.

It\u2019s small, but I think that with how weak it is, we can chip away at it, hopefully making it large enough to fit through.</p><p>\u201cHold this,\u201d I tell Ellie, handing her the two-by-four. I go to where the hole is and peek through. The sun is setting, and I can see\u2014at least from where I\u2019m looking\u2014it appears we\u2019re in the forest. I press on the wood, and it bends slightly at my touch. I don\u2019t know who has us, or if they are around so I don\u2019t really want to make a lot of noise. I hold onto the beams in the ceiling where the wall pitches downward and put my foot to the wood, pressing hard, and my foot goes through the roof.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Ellie whispers, and I stop what I\u2019m doing to look at her, wondering if she heard someone coming.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t try that,\u201d she says, and I almost want to laugh at the look on her face, but I don\u2019t; I just turn around and press my foot a little higher. This time, more of the roof crumbles enough that I can stick my head out, which I do cautiously then look around. We\u2019re about two stories up, but until we get out, we won\u2019t know if there is a way down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be a way for us to get down, but I would rather be on the roof than in here waiting for them when they come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she agrees, holding the two-by-four a little tighter in her grasp.</p><p>I use my sweatshirt over my hands to pull more of the roof off. I know that if this spot is so weak that I can do this, then there must be others in the same shape, so once we\u2019re out, we\u2019re going to have to be very careful not to fall through. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out first, then you\u2019re going to follow me and only put your body where I put mine. The roof is weak, and there is a chance we could fall through if we\u2019re not super cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agrees, and I push out through the opening, using my arm strength to lift myself out. I look around to make sure no one\u2019s below then stick my head back in the hole.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I hold my hand out to Ellie, and she hands me the two-by-four. I set it aside then help lift her out onto the roof. Once she\u2019s out, we both lean back against the shingles. I grab her hand and give it a squeeze. \u201cIf anything happens and one of us is able to get away, we go for help, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you behind,\u201d she says, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about either of us leaving the other behind, but about getting help if we need to,\u201d I tell her, and she looks away then squeezes my hand back.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she says after a long moment. I nod, turn onto my belly, and start to slide across the roof. It\u2019s steep, and I know that one wrong move could have me tumbling to the ground. When we make it to the side of the house, I see there are wire cages set up. It takes a moment for me to realize what I\u2019m looking at. Hundreds of dogs are stacked one on top of the other in two rows for about twenty feet. My stomach begins to turn with rage. I know these dogs are probably either fighting dogs, or it\u2019s a puppy mill.</p><p>\u201cCan we use the cages to get down that way?\u201d Ellie asks in a hushed tone, and I look at her, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cThe dogs will all flip out if we try, and if someone\u2019s around, they will come to see what\u2019s causing the dogs to go nuts,\u201d I whisper, and she looks over me, down to the ground, then back towards the way we came.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there is something on the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree, and she leads us in the other direction. Halfway there, her foot goes through the roof, and she covers her mouth before a scream can leave it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay; just go slow,\u201d I assure her when her body freezes and begins to shake. She closes her eyes then opens them before moving again, this time more cautiously. I follow behind her as she slides over the hole, and I do the same. The roof pitches at a steeper angle, almost like we\u2019re completely vertical. I look down and cringe when I see how far we are from the ground.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down,\u201d Ellie hisses, grabbing my hand. I bite my lip then follow her to a ledge near where the roof changes angles. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here,\u201d Ellie says, peeking around a corner of the roof. \u201cIt\u2019s the guy who took me,\u201d she whimpers, with fear evident in her voice. I hold her hand and she scoots back toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d I ask, looking around and noticing we are surrounded by forest on all sides.</p><p>\u201cTaking dog food out of his truck,\u201d she says, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cDid you see a way down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t really look though, \u2019cause he\u2019s there and I didn\u2019t want him to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur only other option is to wait until it\u2019s dark, hope they don\u2019t come to check on us, make our way down the side the cages are on, and then make a run for it,\u201d I tell her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince I have been here, they have checked on me once in the morning, and once at night. They take me down to the bathroom and give me some water or bread then send me back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they will be coming back. Staying here isn\u2019t an option,\u201d I say then hear a vehicle start up, and Ellie stands, peeking over the pitch in the roof.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s leaving,\u201d she hisses, sitting back down next to me. \u201cWhat if we go down over the cages and open them as we leave?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I hate the idea they would hurt the dogs if we let them out, but I know we need to do something. If we stay put, we are sitting ducks, and that is not an option.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s head over to that side of the roof. We\u2019ll find a safe way to get down then make a run for it.\u201d</p><p>She agrees silently and we make our way across the roof again as the sun sets in the sky. Once we reach the side of the house with the cages, I know we can get down, but I also know the minute we make our presence known to the dogs below, they are going to start barking, drawing attention to us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be fast...really, really fast,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cIf we make it out of this, I\u2019m joining the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d I whisper back, making her smile, and even with the events of the day and how exhausted she looks, I realize how beautiful she is. Her smile is blinding, and I hope when we\u2019re out of here and she gets her daughter back that she smiles more.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here, and then go get your baby,\u201d I say, and a light fills her eyes right before she hugs me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she murmurs, releasing me from her grasp. I take a few deep inhales and then lower myself to the shortest part of the roof. A fresh wave of adrenalin starts coursing through me as I watch Ellie get down next to me. It\u2019s about six feet to the top of the cages, which have pieces of plywood set on top of them. I hop down, and the dogs immediately begin to bark louder and snarl in the cages.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d I tell Ellie, looking up at her. She hops down, and I hear someone off in the distance yell, \u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d and my body freezes. Then I slide over the back of the cage, hitting the ground hard, and Ellie comes down next to me, her feet hitting the ground then landing on her ass.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let them out. They\u2019ll attack us,\u201d I tell her as she looks at the dogs. \u201cLet\u2019s run back that way.\u201d I point towards the forest behind the house. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the road is, but maybe we will see another house.\u201d We slowly make our way back into the woods, and the deeper we go, the darker it gets.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I pause, asking Ellie as I hear what sounds like a four-wheeler.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She holds my hand a little tighter, and we begin to run as the sound gets closer.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide, you dumb bitches. This is five hundred acres of private property. No one is around for miles,\u201d I hear yelled from off in the distance.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Ellie whimpers, and I stop and grab her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cListen to me. We got this far; we are going to get out of here,\u201d I tell her. Even as scared as I am, there is no way I\u2019m giving up. Not now, not when we have come so far.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up, but I\u2019m scared,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMe too, but we need to keep moving. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to be able to make it out of this alive,\u201d I say then begin pulling her with me again. We run forever without coming across any sign of life, and my body is beginning to shut down from exhaustion. I know Ellie is in the same shape, because we both start to stumble more. Then I see lights shine through the trees, as the sound of the four-wheeler gets closer than it has been.</p><p>\u201cI have a plan,\u201d I whisper when I see the lights coming closer. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to have to be brave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stand out in the open for him to see me, and you\u2019re going to hide behind a tree. When he gets close, I want you to hit him in the head with the two-by-four,\u201d I say, looking down at that weapon both of us have taken turns carrying since finding it.</p> <p>\u201cI think you should hit him. I\u2019ve been here for four days. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough to hit him,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a better chance if you do it,\u201d she replies, and the lights get closer, so I know we don\u2019t have time to debate with each other who\u2019s doing what. I slip behind the tree, keeping my eyes locked on Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, and we\u2019re not going down without a fight,\u201d I tell her, looking into her scared eyes.</p><p>The lights land directly on her, and she yells, \u201cPlease, the other girl is hurt. She needs help!\u201d She starts to cry, and I see the four-wheeler move closer, driven by a guy I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he growls, reaching out to Ellie, so I take that moment to run out from behind the tree. His head turns my way and his eyes grow with shock as I hit him in the side of the head. His body slumps forward and I push him off the four-wheeler.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I tell Ellie, who seems to be frozen in place. Her body startles then she jumps on behind me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to drive one of these things?\u201d she asks as I pull off quickly. Uncontrollable laughter bubbles out at her question, and I don\u2019t answer, just drive faster. \u201cI hope so.\u201d She wraps her arms tight around me.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s stupid, but we need to go back to the house and follow the road. We stand a better chance of making it to safety if we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten us this far,\u201d Ellie says, and I just hope I can get us to safety.</p><p>We drive for a good hour, and I\u2019m actually really surprised how long it takes for us to get back to the house. When we get closer, I notice a figure standing outside. I zoom past him, fishtailing, then press the gas harder as we head down a long dirt road.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d Ellie screams right before the four-wheeler jolts forward. \u201cOh, God! He\u2019s got a gun!\u201d she cries, and I yell, \u201cDuck,\u201d getting down as low as I can while pulling back on the throttle. Then I see it, off it the distance\u2014headlights. My pulse kicks up, and I know if these are his friends we are as good as dead. Shots ring out from behind me as I drive faster, and then I pull off the road and into the forest when the headlights coming from the other direction get closer.</p><p>\u201cJuly!\u201d I hear roared, and I\u2019d know that voice anywhere. Wes. Then I hear gunshots, and my body begins to shake with worry. I turn, going back towards the road, and stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay here,\u201d I tell Ellie.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She grabs my hand, but I don\u2019t have time to fight with her. I need to make sure Wes is okay.</p><p>\u201cI need to get to my fianc\u00e9,\u201d I tell her in a panic, and then we hear two more shots. I sob, trying to get to the road.</p><p>\u201cJuly!\u201d Wes roars again, and I yell back, \u201cOver here!\u201d</p> <p>I step out of the clearing, my eyes landing on the truck that was chasing us. The door is open, and the guy is slumped onto the steering wheel. Mic, Harlen, and Z are standing next to him, and Jax, Talon Everett and Sage all look at us as tears form in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead baby,\u201d Wes says, pulling my attention to him. His eyes meet mine then do a sweep over the rest of me. I run to him, pulling Ellie with me, only letting go of her when I throw myself into Wes. His arms wrap around me, holding me so tight that I feel myself molding to him. \u201cJesus.\u201d He lets me go and begins to look me over, his hands moving over my body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I assure him, putting my hands on his cheeks. He drops to his knees and his face goes into my belly, and I wrap myself around him for a moment. Then he stands, kissing me once more before looking to my side. \u201cThis is Ellie. She was here when they brought me,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His face turns hard and he growls, \u201cThere was more than one guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was in the forest. We knocked him off the four-wheeler and took it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo a sweep of the forest. See if you can find the other guy. Your dad should be here soon,\u201d Jax tells my cousins as he walks towards us, carrying a flashlight. The light sweeps over me then Ellie, and his step falters for a brief moment, before he continues towards us.</p><p>\u201cLet me have that, baby,\u201d Jax says, his eyes locked on Ellie, and she holds the two-by-four a little tighter to her chest then shakes her head, backing up almost until she\u2019s behind me. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let anything hurt you, but I need you to give that to me, and then I want to look you over,\u201d he tells her gently. Her eyes leave him and come to me. I look at her hands and see they are red, and I know why Jax is worried about her.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ellie,\u201d I tell Jax then say, \u201cJax is my cousin. He looks scary, but he\u2019s a big softy.\u201d Her eyes go back to Jax, looking him over. He is imposing; at a little over six feet, his body is honed from workouts and training, and his dark hair is buzzed close to his skull. And next to Ellie, he looks like a giant.</p><p>\u201cSwear on my life I won\u2019t hurt you, or let anyone hurt you ever again,\u201d he tells her, and I watch his eyes go soft in a way I have never seen before, not from him. Ellie swallows then hands him the two-by-four. He drops it to the ground then takes her hands, making her cry out, causing anger to flood his features. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, but your hands are in bad shape,\u201d he explains then looks at me. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head and Wes\u2019s arms wrap tighter around me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put Ellie in my truck and look her over while I wait for Uncle Nico to get here,\u201d Jax says, and I watch, stunned as he swings Ellie up into his arms and carries her off to his truck.</p> <p>\u201cThat was so weird,\u201d I mutter, looking at where Jax is standing in front of the open door of his truck, with Ellie in front of him. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d I ask Wes, and his eyes sweep over me again before his mouth lands on mine, kissing me so deep that when he pulls his mouth from mine, I have unconsciously wrapped myself around him.</p><p>\u201cThe place these guys were turning into a tattoo shop is about an hour from here. When we got inside, we found they left a computer, and the computer was hooked up to that guy\u2019s cell phone. We did a backwards trace and it lead us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty smart,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all Harlen; he\u2019s good at that kind of shit.\u201d He says and I wiggle out of his arms when the guys walk over, I give them each a hug, telling them thank you before getting pulled back by the loop of my jeans into Wes\u2019 side, where I stay when Uncle Nico pulls up along with ten other cop cars. Ellie stays with me, and we both answer as many questions as we can, most of which we have no answers to.</p><p>After an hour of talking to the police, Wes gets fed up and tells them he\u2019s taking me home and they can talk to me the next day. Jax, who hadn\u2019t left Ellie\u2019s side, agreed, and Uncle Nico told me he would be around in the morning. I was okay with that, and hugged Ellie, who was going to the hospital before getting on the back of Wes\u2019 bike.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, honey.\u201d My mom kisses my head and tucks the blankets tighter around me.</p><p>\u201cYou worried the fuck out of us,\u201d my dad complains, running his hand over my hair then narrowing his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to do anything like that again,\u201d he says like I did it on purpose.</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d I place my hand on his cheek while fighting my smile, which makes his eyes narrow further. \u201cCan you find out how Ellie is doing?\u201d I ask after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s good. She\u2019s going home,\u201d my mom informs me, and my heart drops into my stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t go home.\u201d I sit up, looking towards the door. \u201cOh, God, she can\u2019t go home! Her mom is the one who sold her to that guy. She can\u2019t go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax is taking her to get her daughter,\u201d my dad says with a strange look on his face. \u201cThey were heading out as soon as the doctor said she could leave the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I breathe, plopping back down onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Wes snarls, walking into the room. I take a breath and let it out slowly. I know he\u2019s worried about me, so he\u2019s on edge, but he\u2019s been a snarling beast since he carried me into the room, stripped me out of my clothes put me in the shower, and then tucked me into bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to head out and let you guys get settled in, we\u2019ll be back in the morning,\u201d my mom says, kissing me then Wes\u2019 cheek. My dad does the same, but pats Wes\u2019 shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask Wes as he sits next to my hip.</p><p>\u201cFuck no, that guy is still out there somewhere. I don\u2019t know how the fuck I\u2019m going to be able to deal with knowing you\u2019re still in danger. Meanwhile, you\u2019re acting like this is fucking normal.\u201d</p><p>I sit up then climb into his lap, holding onto his cheek gently. \u201cI\u2019m alive. I rode home on your bike. I\u2019m lying in our bed. And tomorrow, I\u2019m going to talk to the ASPCA and ask them to help me with all the dogs, and hopefully we can save some of them. Then I\u2019m going with Kayan to pick out the kind of cake we will eat on our wedding day. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know what happened today; it\u2019s that I have this amazing life, and some asshole isn\u2019t going to take that from me,\u201d I say, wanting him to understand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m scared about the guy being free, but I have a feeling he isn\u2019t going to be for long, and if he does happen to come after me again, I know Wes will find a way to keep me safe.

I hated seeing her breakdown after each try, each negative test killing her slowly. It got to the point that when friends and family would share their happy news, she would have to battle her mind, knowing she was happy for them, but sad for herself. I hated what it was doing to her, so I talked to a buddy of mine and he got me hooked up with an adoption agency.</p><p>After our last fertility treatment was a fail, I came home and handed her the paperwork. She cried...she cried for a full day, and then my beautiful, strong woman pulled it together, and we sat down and filled out the paperwork. We had no idea of how long it would take to go through. That was seven months ago.</p> <p>The adoption process happened a lot faster for us than it did for other families. The family that had been planning on adopting James decided they weren\u2019t ready for a baby. I have to say the day we went to meet our son I wasn\u2019t sure we were either, but then I held my boy in my arms and knew right then that it didn\u2019t matter to me how James came to be with us; he is my son.</p><p>I look down at him, pull the bottle from his lips, and a small pout forms at the loss. I lift him to my shoulder with a smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you in here,\u201d July says, and my eyes go to her at the door of the nursery. She is even more beautiful than she was when we first started dating. She still makes me question my luck.</p><p>\u201cYou needed to sleep,\u201d I tell her gently. Since the moment James came home, she has been on edge, trying to make sure to do everything perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She smiles, walking into the room and bending over, kissing me then the top of James\u2019 fuzzy head. I take her hand and pull her down onto my lap, and she lays her head on my shoulder, tucking her forehead into my neck, placing one hand on James. Even after all these years, knowing this could have been taken from me causes a buzz of anger to sizzle through me.</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me sleep,\u201d she whispers, moving her hand from James to settle on my jaw.</p> <p>\u201cAnytime, baby.\u201d I turn my head, kissing her palm.</p><p>\u201cI love this chair,\u201d she says, making me chuckle. Two months before James came home, July had her dad go into the attic and bring over the rocker that had been in her family for generations. She and her sisters argued for days over who got what, and July finally pulled the \u2018I\u2019m the oldest\u2019 card and got the chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice chair,\u201d I agree, rocking the three of us until I feel her body relax and James\u2019 little body sink into mine.</p><p>July</p><p>I look at the pregnancy test in my hand and cannot believe what I\u2019m seeing. Since we brought James home, I have been feeling ill. I honestly didn\u2019t think much of it until this morning, when I walked into the kitchen, where Wes was standing shirtless, flipping bacon, the smell touched my nose and I got sick. That had never happened before, not ever. They say it\u2019s possible when you adopt that sometimes something clicks into place, and voila\u2014you end up pregnant.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d I breathe then look at myself in the mirror, bursting into tears. I never believed I would take a pregnancy test and have it come out positive. After so many attempts of IUI then IVF, I gave up. Now, I have James, and we\u2019re pregnant.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you good?\u201d Wes asks, knocking on the door, and I toss the test in a drawer quickly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry, I spaced out,\u201d I say. I mouth, I spaced out? in the mirror to myself, shaking my head, then splash some water on my face to conceal my tears and open the door.</p> <p>\u201cJames is sleeping. Why don\u2019t you lay down for a bit?\u201d he asks, and I nod absently as he kisses my hair then tilts my head back to get my eyes. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re good?\u201d he questions, making that panic from a few minutes ago disappear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I tell him, and he kisses me briefly then takes off down the hall. I head to the bedroom then pick up my phone and call my doctor, setting up an appointment for later in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to head out,\u201d I tell Wes, walking into the living room, where he and James are sitting and watching TV.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asks, looking concerned.</p><p>\u201cI need to meet Kayan,\u201d I say the first lie that comes to mind.</p><p>\u201cCome kiss me,\u201d he demands, and I go to him, kissing him then James, trying to avoid the look in his eyes as I make it out of the house.</p><p>When I get to my Jeep, I start it up and head into town. We sold our house in town a couple years ago, and Wes bought a piece of property from my dad and built a house on it. I love our house, but I loved it more, knowing Wes and my family had built it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Dr. Marks says, then I turn my head when there is a pounding on the door of the exam room.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t a fluke?\u201d I whisper in shock. Dr. Marks has been with us since the beginning. He knows how much we have struggled with getting pregnant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he says, and the pounding gets louder.</p><p>\u201cJuly,\u201d Wes says from the other side, and I feel my eyes grow wide in shock then look at Dr. Marks as he opens the door.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Wes,\u201d he says as Wes steps into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou lied,\u201d he says to me, then looks at Dr. Marks and growls, \u201cCongratulations on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a dad, and actually, we can do an ultrasound today if you like, since you\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wes says, looking at me then stumbling over to one of the chairs sitting down. \u201cPregnant?\u201d he asks then shakes his head. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, it just happens,\u201d Dr. Marks says, looking proud, like it was his doing. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you guys a few minutes and go get the ultrasound set up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s James?\u201d I ask, seeing our son isn\u2019t with him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with your mom. When did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning. I took a test, one of the leftovers that had been collecting dust. I didn\u2019t think it would be positive, and when it said I was pregnant, I wanted to know for sure before telling you,\u201d I say, hoping he understands. I hated seeing the disappointment in his eyes every time I took a test. I hated that no matter what I did we weren\u2019t getting pregnant, and no doctor could answer why. Why couldn\u2019t we have a baby?</p><p>\u201cYou know how I feel about that kind of shit,\u201d he says, and I do know how he feels about me keeping things from him, but if it\u2019s tell him and have him hurt, or save him that, I would do it all over again.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I get down from the table, curling myself around him on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d His hand lies gently over my stomach, and tears form in my eyes and a sob climbs up my throat. I have wanted this moment forever, and to finally have it makes it that much more memorable.</p><p>\u201cYou guys ready?\u201d Dr. Marks asks, coming back into the room.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I nod and do as he instructs, getting back up on the table. He squirts the liquid on my belly then moves it around with the wand in his hand. Before I even know it, the sound of a heartbeat fills the room, and my eyes fill with more tears.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Wes whispers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about nine weeks along,\u201d the doctor says, and I absently find Wes\u2019 hand with mine and hold on tight. James is going to be a big brother. I can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll print you guys some pictures to show off to everyone, and when you go out front, just tell them you need to make your next appointment. I\u2019ll leave a prescription up front for prenatal vitamins,\u201d he says, wiping off my belly before leaving the room. I sit up, stunned, and look at Wes, who\u2019s looking down at the pictures in his hand. When his eyes come to me, the love I see there tells me everything I need to know.</p><p>Wes</p><p>One year later</p><p>I walk into our bedroom and my eyes fall on July, who has both our boys tucked close to her waist. Her eyes open slowly, and the smile that lights her face makes me feel like I\u2019m the king of the world.</p><p>\u201cWe fell asleep.\u201d She smiles, and I smile back then kiss her neck before running my hand over James and Dean\u2019s heads.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and dad are coming to pick up the boys,\u201d I tell her, waiting for her reaction. I love my boys, but I miss being inside my wife without interruption, and I plan on fixing that tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they picking up the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of being cock-blocked by my kids,\u201d I tell her, and she giggles. Shit, just this morning I was going down on her, and she came hard and loud, but before I could lift up and enter her, the boys woke up, leaving me to take care of myself in the shower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been away from them for more than a few hours,\u201d she says, and my face goes soft then I remind myself of my mission, and my dick throbs, reminding me what it\u2019s missing, so I steel myself against saying, \u2018We can do it another time,\u2019 and tell her instead, \u201cI know, baby, me either, but we need this. My dick needs this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She searches my face then lifts up, giving me a shot of her cleavage, which causes my dick to press harder against my zipper. When her mouth touches mine, I pull her head to the side with my hand at her nape and take over until she whimpers when I pull away.</p><p>\u201cLet me get their bags ready,\u201d she breathes, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cAlready done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure of yourself, aren\u2019t you, Mr. Silver?\u201d She raises a brow, and I flick one of her nipples through the thin material of her summer dress.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa.\u201d I look down at James, and he rolls over then crawls to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, little man,\u201d I say, picking him up and kissing his head as he babbles on about something, then turn just in time for Dean to reach his little arms up at me. Unless you know us, you would think my boys are twins. They both have dark hair and blue eyes. James is just bigger.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are going to spend the night with Grandpa and Grandma. How does that sound?\u201d July coos, taking James from my grasp as he reaches out for her.</p><p>We walk out into the living room, and July smiles over her shoulder when she sees I wasn\u2019t lying. Both of the boys\u2019 bags are sitting by the front door, ready to go. \u201cThanks, mom,\u201d July tells November as she walks out of the house, carrying both diaper bags. Asher just exited moments before carrying both boys. James was more than excited to spend some time with their pop, while Dean grinned up at him toothlessly from his car seat.</p><p>\u201cThey will be fine, and we\u2019re just down the road,\u201d November says over her shoulder then mutters something under her breath. As soon as I see they have all gotten into their car, I shut the door after pulling July inside, pressing her back into the wood then lifting her up with my hands under her ass. As soon as her legs wrap around me, I groan, feeling the heat coming off her pussy.</p><p>\u201cUnhook my belt, baby,\u201d I growl, bunching up the material of her dress and ripping it off over her head. Then I do the same with my shirt, using the door and my hips as leverage to keep her up.</p><p>She bites her lip as I strip my shirt off, and then her nails scrape down my abs before working my belt. She groans and her head falls back with a thunk as I pull down the cups of her bra then lower my mouth, pulling her nipple in with a deep tug.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d she moans, and I get down my jeans, just releasing my cock, pull her panties to the side, and impale her. \u201cOh, God, you\u2019re so deep,\u201d she whimpers, and I fuck her hard, watching as I enter her, then my gaze travels up, watching the way her tits bounce with each thrust.</p><p>\u201cWhose pussy is this, baby?\u201d I ask, wrapping a hand in the back of her hair, twisting my fingers until her half-mast eyes meet mine. \u201cWhose is it?\u201d I growl on an outward slide.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she breathes, wrapping her legs tighter around me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby, and tonight, I\u2019m going to fucking imprint my dick in your pussy,\u201d I tell her, slamming back in, making the door bang loud throughout the quiet house.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she screams as her orgasm pulls at my cock, sucking it deeper until I come so hard I\u2019m not even able to hold us up. My legs start to give out, so I carry her to the couch, sitting down with her in my arms, my cock still deep inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cFuck, I missed this pussy,\u201d I confess, and she giggles, burrowing closer, then mewls as I stand, carrying her to the bedroom, never leaving the heat of her. I lay her on the bed and start to go again, and her eyes go wide then slide closed. We spend the rest of the night in bed...in the kitchen...in the shower...</p><p>\u201cI love you, Wes Silver. Until the day I die, I will love you,\u201d she tells me when we\u2019re lying in bed later that night.</p><p>I let her words sink into my soul and pull her closer, resting my lips against her temple before whispering there, \u201cLove you too, babe. You have given me everything.\u201d And she did. A man who didn\u2019t expect to have a woman or a family, a man who was okay with just living life day by day\u2014one little woman changed all of that and made him want more. It\u2019s on that thought I drift off to sleep, with everything I ever needed right in my arms.</p><p>The End</p>   </body></html>"]
