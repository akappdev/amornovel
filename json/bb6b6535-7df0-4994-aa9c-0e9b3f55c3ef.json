With her future on the line, there was absolutely no way she would be anything but perfectly pleasant during her conversation with Nicholas Giovanni. She would be confident, persuasive, even charming. She would not get crabby, beg, or think about sex. Especially not sex. No matter how good it had been.</p><p>But it had been great, she thought as she paced the length of the waiting area in the executive offices of Wild Sea Vineyards. Better than good. One time they\u2019d done it on the beach, and that night on the news there\u2019d been a report of an unexpectedly high tide. Brenna had always wondered if she and Nic were somehow to blame.</p> <p>\u201cHistory,\u201d she murmured as she clutched her portfolio more tightly to her chest. \u201cAncient history. This is a new decade\u2014a new century even. I am empowered. I am impervious. I am really annoyed that he\u2019s keeping me waiting.\u201d</p><p>She turned and glared at the closed door leading to Nic\u2019s private office. When his assistant had asked her to wait and promised the man in charge would be with her shortly, Brenna had believed her. Now, nearly ten minutes later, the assistant had disappeared and there was still no sign of Nic.</p><p>\u201cJust a power play,\u201d she told herself, then took a calming breath. \u201cI\u2019m not going to buy into it. He can keep me waiting as long as he wants.\u201d</p><p>Except her stomach was in knots, she had serious regrets about that fifth cup of coffee, and she had a bad feeling that if she stopped moving for too long, she would find that her knees were shaking. Not exactly the picture of professional confidence she wanted to portray. She really needed to\u2014</p><p>The office door opened and the devil himself walked into the room.</p> <p>Okay, maybe calling Nic the devil was a bit strong, but he was dark, dangerous, and at this point she would sell him her soul to get what she wanted. A rose by any other name and all that.</p><p>\u201cBrenna.\u201d Nic spoke her name with a smile. As if they met on a regular basis. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>If only, she thought. She hadn\u2019t set foot on Giovanni land in ten years. And with good reason.</p><p>\u201cHi, Nic.\u201d</p><p>He motioned toward his office and she stepped into the inner sanctum. The room hadn\u2019t changed a whole lot since she\u2019d last seen it. Still massive, still dominated by a desk built in the eighteenth century. The computer was new, as was the owner. Ten years ago Nic\u2019s grandfather had occupied the space. From here he\u2019d run all of Wild Sea Vineyards. Now the old man was gone and Nic was in charge.</p><p>In charge and going places, she thought as she crossed to the map on the wall opposite the opulent desk. She studied the shaded area that detailed the Giovanni holdings, noting how much expansion there\u2019d been in the past seven years. Nic had always wanted to be the biggest and best. He\u2019d achieved that in spades.</p> <p>Of course, focusing on the map allowed her not to think about that damn desk. Unfortunately, she was going to have to turn around and stare at it sometime. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if she and Nic hadn\u2019t, well, done it on that desk.</p><p>It had been about three A.M. on a Saturday morning. The night had been still, cool, and incredibly romantic. Of course, when she\u2019d been seventeen and in love, watching paint dry had been romantic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to sit down,\u201d he said, a trace of amusement in his voice.</p><p>Sure, she thought as she squared her shoulders and turned to face her past. Nic worked here every day. He\u2019d probably forgotten what had happened on that carved slab of wood. But not her.</p><p>She made her way to an oversize chair and sank onto the smooth leather surface. Nic walked around his desk and sat facing her.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised to hear you\u2019d made an appointment to see me,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI hope everything is all right with your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine. Great, really. Francesca\u2019s engaged.\u201d More than engaged, but that conversation was for another time.</p><p>\u201cThat must make your grandfather happy.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and found her gaze settling on his face. Strong features, she thought, remembering the boy as she stared at the man. He\u2019d always had strong features. Compelling eyes, a straight nose, a determined, maybe even stubborn chin, and a mouth that had once been able to kiss her into another time zone.</p><p>Despite the warm August temperatures, he wore a long-sleeved black shirt, dark slacks. Not exactly the jeans and T-shirts she was used to seeing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dressed for success,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn honor of our meeting.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a slow, sexy smile that made her remember other smiles. Like the one he\u2019d used to convince her it was really okay to make love late at night in the vineyard. It had been their first time and she\u2019d lost her virginity to the sound of crickets and\u2014</p><p>Let\u2019s stop this right now, she told herself. Trips down memory lane were only going to get her into trouble. She was here on a mission that had nothing to do with sexy smiles or the heat flaring to life low in her belly.</p><p>She forced herself to relax in the leather chair. She carefully crossed one leg over the other and tried for a faintly amused, possibly bored expression. Who knew if it really worked.</p><p>\u201cAll that trouble for me? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cAll right. I have a meeting with several foreign distributors later this afternoon. I figured jeans would put them off.\u201d</p><p>Not if they were women, Brenna thought before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re expanding again,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cAlways. Be the biggest and the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly going to win on volume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they say size matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly those who don\u2019t know how to use what they have.\u201d She remembered her vow not to argue with him about eighteen seconds too late.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cFor disagreeing with me? There\u2019s a first. Now I\u2019m even more intrigued.\u201d He grinned and leaned forward. \u201cAll right, Brenna. You\u2019re here, you\u2019re wearing a suit, and you\u2019re carrying what looks like a thick stack of papers. Why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>So they were going to get right to it. She cleared her throat and set her portfolio on his desk. At that moment her brain hiccupped and every single intelligent, logical, financially sound sentence she\u2019d practiced flew out of her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of the best in the business,\u201d she began, then hesitated, wondering if that sounded too arrogant.</p><p>At least he didn\u2019t break into hysterical laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I wouldn\u2019t want to go head to head with you in competition,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>The compliment boosted her confidence and made her want to wiggle in her seat. She satisfied herself with a slight smile. \u201cAs my grandfather says, aside from him, I\u2019m the only one in the family with a passion for wine. I\u2019ve lived it most of my life.\u201d</p><p>He started to say something, but she rushed on. There was no way she was going to let him remind her of the ten years she\u2019d spent away from Marcelli Wines. Ten years she\u2019d spent being an idiot.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather has put me in charge of the winery. I know what\u2019s needed to take our success to the next level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not here for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She flipped open the portfolio. \u201cI\u2019m here for a loan.\u201d</p><p>Nic straightened. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t have a cash-flow problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcelli Wines doesn\u2019t. Business has never been better. But I\u2019m not them. I work for my grandfather. The company still belongs to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll inherit.\u201d</p><p>If only. The truth shouldn\u2019t still hurt, but it did. It hurt a lot. \u201cMy sisters and I inheriting has become less of a sure thing.\u201d She paused, knowing that there was no point in holding back. He was going to hear about it eventually.</p><p>\u201cIt seems my parents had a child out of wedlock, as they say. A son. They were both still in high school. Due to family pressure, they gave up the baby for adoption.\u201d</p><p>Nic was cool as always. Instead of letting any emotion show on his face, he leaned back in his chair. \u201cThat would change things,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt our big Fourth of July party. It was our version of fireworks, to say the least. The point is, the long-lost baby is now a thirty-year-old man.\u201d</p><p>The Marcelli and Giovanni families might not have spoken in nearly three generations, but they had both grown up with the same traditional Italian values. Feminism had yet to arrive at the shores of their respective vineyards. Nic got it right away.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather is old-fashioned enough to be more comfortable leaving the family business to a male heir. I\u2019m guessing the long-lost brother is interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ton of money. Wouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d she asked with a lightness she didn\u2019t feel. \u201cAll of which leaves me on the short end of the inheritance stick.\u201d Now came the tough part. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that the wine business is in my blood. I don\u2019t want to do anything else with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re right and your brother inherits, why wouldn\u2019t he keep you on to run things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might, but I\u2019m not willing to wait around and see. Besides, I have my own ideas and plans. I want to start my own label.\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the portfolio in front of her. \u201cYour proposal?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve detailed everything. What grapes I want to buy, the price of the inventory, barrels, storage. There\u2019s also some land I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarting a label doesn\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze never left her face. \u201cWhere else did you go for financing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere short of a loan shark.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLet me guess. They want to know why you can\u2019t get the money from your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some of it. They were also concerned that I don\u2019t have any collateral. I\u2019ve explained that the wine is collateral, but that doesn\u2019t seem to impress them.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re a man who likes to take risks, but only when they pay off. I\u2019m the closest to a sure thing you\u2019re going to find.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Brenna could have cheerfully thrown herself in front of a moving delivery truck. She could feel the heat on her face, but with her olive coloring, the blush wouldn\u2019t show. It was a small consolation, but one she clung to like a life preserver.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can do this,\u201d she said, as if she hadn\u2019t caught the embarrassing wordplay.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why would I want to add to my competition?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since driving onto the property, Brenna relaxed. \u201cOh, please. If I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll be able to match ten percent of your production in five years. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to sweat me putting you out of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Why did you come to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know with extra cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents would have helped you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. But I didn\u2019t want to make them choose between me and my grandfather. You\u2019re a neutral party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Giovanni. Doesn\u2019t that make me second cousin to the devil?\u201d</p><p>Gee, just what she\u2019d been thinking earlier, only in her eyes, the relationship had been a little closer.</p><p>Coming to Nic was her last hope, but also a calculated risk. The Marcelli and Giovanni families had been feuding for years. Her grandfather might find out about the loan if she\u2019d secured it through traditional sources such as a bank, but he would never know if Nic funded her. Grandpa Lorenzo would cheerfully rip out his tongue rather than speak to a Giovanni. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brenna and her sisters had never been all that interested in the feud. Nic hadn\u2019t been, either, which he\u2019d proved the first time she\u2019d met him. But to her grandparents\u2014hostilities were alive and well.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain irony to this conversation,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI would think that appealed to you.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. Brenna would like to know what he saw, but on second thought\u2014maybe not. She was still recovering from a disastrous, impulsive haircut. Several months at the family hacienda eating her grandmothers\u2019 cooking had added seven pounds to her already plentiful curves. She thought the suit she\u2019d chosen looked pretty good on her, but was that enough? She\u2019d come a long way from the seventeen-year-old who had promised to love Nic with her whole heart; but the question was, would he consider the changes good or bad?</p> <p>\u201cRumor has it I\u2019m a ruthless bastard,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard. Should I be scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She could remember everything about being with Nic\u2014the way he touched her, the way he kissed, the scent of his skin. She knew the boy he had been, but not the man. What was the same and what had changed? Or did it matter?</p><p>Ruthless bastard or not, she wanted the money.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t scare easily these days.\u201d She pushed the proposal toward him. \u201cLook it over and tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>He rested his hand on the leather cover but didn\u2019t open it. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>The butterflies appeared in her stomach and began to fly in formation. She thought they might be practicing touch-and-go landings. Her mouth got dry, her palms got wet, and the room lurched once for good measure.</p><p>\u201cA million dollars.\u201d</p><p>Nic didn\u2019t react in any way\u2014at least not on the outside. He didn\u2019t blink, didn\u2019t shift in his seat; he didn\u2019t even smile. But on the inside, his mild amusement and intrigue turned to impressed amazement. Brenna had gone and got herself some balls.</p><p>He pulled his wallet from his back pocket and fingered the bills. \u201cYou want that in twenties?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to be picky. Twenties are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have that much with me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>She watched him, her big eyes betraying her nervousness. She was at the end of the line and they both knew it. If he turned her down, she wouldn\u2019t get her loan. Any dreams of starting her own label would be squashed. Oh, sure, she could buy a few tons of grapes on the open market, borrow equipment, and set up a few dozen cheap barrels in a garage somewhere. She might get a loyal following, a little notice, maybe a write-up in Wine Spectator. But without an infusion of cash, she would never have the chance to make it big.</p><p>Not that he gave a damn about that. What mattered to him were his goals. How did her request fit into the big picture?</p><p>He rose and circled the desk until he stood in front of her, then he leaned against the surface, his arms folded over his chest. It was a position designed to intimidate. To challenge.</p><p>Brenna reacted by uncrossing, then recrossing her legs. In the silence of the office the sound of her silk stockings brushing and shifting grated against his ears. He found himself watching the movement, staring at the hem of her skirt, picturing her thighs underneath. And above her thighs?</p><p>Paradise. At least that\u2019s what her body had been ten years ago. Dark, slick, secret\u2014the road to redemption. Instead she\u2019d steered him right to hell. Because of her, he\u2019d been sent away from his home. He\u2019d been exiled, abandoned, and written off for dead.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the reminder didn\u2019t do a damn thing for the unexpected tension crawling through him. He tore his gaze away before he distracted himself with the wrong kind of memories.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying no,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d</p><p>She sprang to her feet, which put her less than a foot in front of him. Close enough for him to see the various shades of gold and brown that made up her irises, and the tiny scar by the corner of her mouth. Close enough for her perfume to invade his personal space. The scent was different; his reaction to it was not. Long-forgotten heat awoke, stretched, and went searching for sustenance.</p><p>He ignored the temperature and the hunger. This was not the right time nor the place, and she was sure as hell not the right woman.</p><p>The thing was, he had a plan. Over the years he\u2019d learned that a well-thought-out plan ensured that he always won. When the goal was revenge, it paid to be patient.</p><p>His instincts told him that Brenna\u2019s loan request was as unexpected as a home run off the first pitch. All he had to do was toss down his bat and circle the bases. But he wanted to be sure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded as her mouth curved in a smile. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve detailed every penny. It\u2019s all going into the wine. I\u2019m not taking a salary. Oh, Nic, the land I want to buy is just perfect for Pinot Noir. There\u2019s a sweet valley at the base of a hill that gets just the right amount of midday sun. That, combined with the fog and the salt from the ocean, creates perfect grapes. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Her enthusiasm was as tangible as the hand she put on his arm. He acknowledged the contact\u2014and his reaction to it\u2014by sliding away and picking up her portfolio.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look this over in the next couple of days and get back to you.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cHow exactly do I do that?\u201d</p><p>Brenna chuckled. \u201cI suppose a phone call to the hacienda would cause problems for both of us. My cell number is on the proposal. If you don\u2019t get me, you can leave a message and I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>She clutched her hands together. \u201cNic, I know it\u2019s a lot of money and that this is a risk for you, but I can do this. If you take a chance, you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it if there\u2019s a chance I will be.\u201d</p><p>Her excitement didn\u2019t flicker. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be impressed. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He had a feeling she was right. Besides, one of his rules in life was to take advantage of every unexpected opportunity. If he agreed, he would insist on keeping close tabs on what she was doing, which was the same as keeping close tabs on Brenna herself. Being close to her had only ever led to one thing.</p><p>So money wasn\u2019t the only risk. Was that good or bad?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an answer, but he knew time spent with Brenna wouldn\u2019t be boring. Once again, they could be entering dangerous territory. The difference was this time he would be the one calling the shots.</p><p>Brenna drove back to the Marcelli winery, taking the long way around so she drove past the ocean. She rolled down the windows of her ancient Camry and let the warm salty air brush over her skin. Her suit jacket and high heels lay where she\u2019d tossed them on the passenger seat. She had the radio cranked up and sang along with an old Beach Boys tune, delighting in the fact that although they\u2019d been years and years before her time, she knew all the words.</p><p>At this moment she felt free and wild and happy and so excited, she probably could have taken flight, if not for the seat belt anchoring her. She leaned her head back and laughed out loud at the sheer pleasure pumping through her.</p><p>She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d done it!</p><p>Oh, sure, Nic hadn\u2019t said yes, not yet. But somehow down in her gut she just knew he was going to. He\u2019d been willing to listen, something no one else had done, and listening was all she needed. Her carefully thought-out proposal was going to blow his socks off. Maybe even his pants.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m around when that happens,\u201d she murmured, then grinned at the thought of a bottomless Nicholas Giovanni.</p><p>Until this past spring she hadn\u2019t seen him in nearly ten years. He could have gotten wrinkled and paunchy, but instead he still had the power to make her entire body go up in flames. And maybe, just maybe, she\u2019d seen a flicker of appreciation in his beautiful sex-god eyes.</p><p>After several years of a crappy marriage, abandonment by a creep of a husband, and nine months and seventeen days since her last sexual encounter, male admiration\u2014especially that coming from Nic\u2014was a balm to her battered and horny soul.</p><p>Not that anything would happen, she reminded herself. If Nic agreed, make that when Nic agreed, they were going to be business partners. There was no way she was going to be foolish enough to mix business and pleasure. Not with a million dollars and her future on the line. No one was that good in bed.</p><p>She turned into the entrance to the Marcelli Winery and sighed. Okay, from what she recalled, making love with Nic had been spectacular. Incredible. Life-altering. But not worth a million dollars.</p><p>She shifted uncomfortably. All this reminiscing about sex was getting to her. If she\u2019d been a cat, she would have been rubbing herself against the nearest door frame. Not only was she going to have to avoid any sexual contact with Nic, she was going to have to stop thinking about him as anything but her loan officer. Nothing personal. Not again.</p><p>Fortunately her resolution coincided with her arrival at the family hacienda. Judging from the number of cars crowding around the rear entrance, the entire family was home.</p><p>The three-story Spanish-style home had been built in the late 1920s. Her great-grandfather had found plans for a house designed in the late eighteen hundreds by a Spanish nobleman with ten children, which made for lots of bedrooms. Good thing, she thought as she came to a stop in the shade of an old oak tree and turned off the engine. Currently the permanent residents of the hacienda included her paternal grandparents, her maternal grandmother, her parents, and herself.</p><p>\u201cHumiliating but true,\u201d Brenna said as she slipped on her pumps and grabbed her suit jacket. \u201cTwenty-seven years old and living at home.\u201d</p><p>Actually she\u2019d moved back the previous spring when her jerk of a husband\u2014a newly licensed cardiologist without a speck of gratitude or decency\u2014had left her for a younger woman who happened to be a former cheerleader. He was poised to marry the bimbo the instant the computer print was dry on the divorce decree.</p><p>Brenna had no desire to have her soon-to-be ex back in her life, but she wouldn\u2019t mind a little justice. Her current favorite fantasy was some kind of genital infection that left him unable to enjoy the wedding night. Ever.</p><p>All revenge aside, one of these days she was going to take the time to find a place of her own. For now, it was nice to be where a houseful of people loved her.</p><p>She made her way up the rear steps and into the kitchen. As usual, the entire female contingent of the family collected there. Her two grandmothers held court over the food, with Grammy M stirring something on the stove and Grandma Tessa chopping vegetables. Her mother sat at the kitchen table, a box of wedding-invitation samples open in front of her. Katie, Brenna\u2019s older sister, and Francesca, Brenna\u2019s fraternal twin, stood in front of their mother.</p><p>Their defiant posture made them look like five-year-olds who had just been caught spray-painting the dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brenna asked as she draped her suit jacket over her arm. \u201cI was gone two hours. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 terrible,\u201d Grammy M\u2014aka Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea\u2014said from her place at the stove. \u201cFrancesca has the most wonderful news.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s mother didn\u2019t look all that excited. \u201cBut we\u2019d already picked a date and were about to order the invitations.\u201d</p><p>Wedding talk.</p><p>First baby sister Mia had come within weeks of marching down the aisle, only to call the whole thing off. Then Katie had gone and gotten herself engaged to Mia\u2019s exfianc\u00e9\u2019s father. Twisted, but so California. Francesca had fallen for the handsome CEO of a security company who found out within days of their meeting that he had a twelve-year-old daughter he\u2019d never known about. A few weeks after that, Francesca had turned up pregnant.</p><p>Only Brenna had managed to escape love\u2019s sticky snare and the ongoing soap opera that was the Marcelli family. Her current plan was to avoid romance and focus on work. She might be open to a little meaningless sex, but a relationship? She didn\u2019t have the time or the energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She crossed to the kitchen table, grabbing an iced cookie on her way. After six months of her grandmothers\u2019 cooking, she didn\u2019t want to think about what her cholesterol level must be.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything,\u201d she said, stopping next to Francesca and eyeing her very beautiful, very thin twin.</p><p>Nearly two months pregnant and was Francesca showing? Not even close. Brenna knew that if she was ever to play host to a marauding sperm, she would plump up overnight and look as if she were giving birth to a water-melon by week nine.</p> <p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cI know we all talked about waiting, what with the baby and all, but Sam and I have changed our minds. And Katie and I want to have a double wedding. It could be a triple one if you wanted to get married again.\u201d</p><p>Groans erupted from the grandmothers. Brenna\u2019s mother simply settled her elbows on the table and rested her head in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cA double wedding?\u201d Brenna considered the possibility, while ignoring the comment about her getting married again. That was never going to happen. \u201cIt will be a cost savings,\u201d she reminded her mother as she draped her suit jacket over a chair. \u201cYou\u2019ll only have to feed the guests once instead of twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the wedding gown?\u201d Grandma Tessa looked up from her chopping. \u201cWe barely have time to make a dress for Katie and now this? Are you sure you want to go down the aisle in your condition? Not that we\u2019re not happy for you, Francesca. A pretty girl like you needs a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ugly girls live to be single,\u201d Brenna whispered.</p> <p>Katie\u2019s full mouth twitched as she tried not to laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to put the wedding date back to give us all time to get everything done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have the weddings at Thanksgiving,\u201d Brenna said as she nibbled on her cookie. \u201cWe all know everyone in this family will be doing the happy dance to see two sisters married. For years everyone has despaired of ever getting us all hitched. Now we\u2019re halfway there. That gives us so much more to be thankful for.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa muttered something Brenna couldn\u2019t hear. She half expected to see the older woman whip out her rosary for a quick trip around the beads. Fortunately Grandma Tessa contented herself with a couple of dark looks.</p><p>\u201cTurkey-day weekend works for me,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWe could have the wedding that Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cSam doesn\u2019t care about the date. As for a dress, I\u2019ll pick something simple and flowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be nine months pregnant and still not showing.\u201d</p> <p>Their mother raised her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. As it is, we\u2019ll be sewing day and night.\u201d</p><p>Family tradition dictated that any Marcelli bride have a wedding gown handmade by the women in the family. A great idea in theory, but beading lace took forever. Brenna wasn\u2019t worried about the additional sewing duties. She had a winery to run and therefore was excused from most of the needlework.</p><p>Their mother pulled out a pad of paper. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a double wedding, we need to start making lists.\u201d</p><p>The three sisters looked at one another and shook their heads. When Mom started making lists, an entire afternoon could fly by. Better to escape now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the drinks,\u201d Brenna said, heading for a rack on the far wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get chocolate,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>Katie walked to the cupboard. \u201cCheese and crackers or cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCookies,\u201d Francesca and Brenna said together.</p> <p>Their mother shook her head. \u201cYou girls aren\u2019t going anywhere. We have two weddings to plan.\u201d</p><p>Katie snaked a plate of cookies from the counter, kissed both Grammy M and Grandma Tessa, and hurried out of the room.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Mom,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>Francesca quickly followed.</p><p>Brenna collected a bottle of wine, an opener, and two wineglasses, then opened the refrigerator. As expected, there was a bottle of chocolate milk sitting on the top shelf. It was the Grands\u2019 contribution to Francesca\u2019s need to increase her calcium.</p><p>\u201cYou guys think of everything,\u201d she said as she shut the door.</p><p>Her mother glared at her. \u201cWe need to plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it later,\u201d Brenna promised. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everything will get done in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you girls are having wine. It\u2019s the middle of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have things to celebrate,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cYou seem exceptionally happy today. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>Brenna wasn\u2019t about to spill the beans about her potential deal with Nic. Not to her parents. While she knew they would understand her need to stand on her own, the information would put them in an awkward position. Her paternal grandfather was still the head of the family and he wouldn\u2019t approve. Rather than make her parents take sides, she would keep her mouth shut.</p><p>She smiled and started backing out of the room. \u201cTwo of my sisters are marrying wonderful men. Isn\u2019t that enough to put a spring in my step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by a long shot. What are you up to, Brenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing. Cross my heart.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa looked up. \u201cYou go to hell for lying, same as stealing, young lady. The good Lord knows all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords to live by,\u201d Brenna said with a laugh as she turned and raced up the stairs.</p><p>2</p><p>Brenna followed Katie and Francesca into the bedroom she and her twin had shared while they\u2019d been growing up and where she\u2019d returned to when she\u2019d moved back into the hacienda. She set the wine and the glasses on the nightstand, then handed the chocolate milk to her sister. While Brenna went to work on the cork, Francesca flopped down on the bed opposite and Katie sat cross-legged on the foot of Brenna\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cYou know they\u2019re not going to leave us alone for very long,\u201d Katie said, accepting the glass of Cabernet Brenna handed her. \u201cMom\u2019s right. There\u2019s a lot to go into the wedding planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo speaks Ms. Organized,\u201d Brenna said. She poured a glass for herself and raised it. \u201cTo my sisters getting married.\u201d</p><p>But neither of them responded to her toast. Katie stared watchfully, while Francesca looked concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brenna asked, kicking off her shoes and sinking onto the mattress. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at me funny and that always makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. It\u2019s just...\u201d Francesca leaned toward her. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d She glanced at Katie. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m drinking wine in the middle of the day? I swear, it doesn\u2019t usually happen. Most of the time I\u2019m too busy to stop for lunch, which isn\u2019t anything I ever thought I would say. Unfortunately with the Grands\u2019 cooking being as fattening as it is, skipping a meal once in a while doesn\u2019t work as a weight-loss plan.\u201d She patted her stomach. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to seriously think about portion control.\u201d</p><p>Her two sisters exchanged a knowing glance. Brenna sighed in exasperation. \u201cI hate it when you talk about me behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t,\u201d Katie said defensively, but as she spoke she tugged on a strand of her reddish-brown hair and bit her lower lip\u2014sure signs that she was lying.</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re just a little concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>Brenna took a sip of the 1999 Cab; \u201998 had been a crappy year for California wines, but \u201999 had been better. She eyed the cookies and thought about grabbing one, but maybe she should wait until she got things settled with her sisters.</p><p>\u201cAmazingly enough, your pending nuptials don\u2019t exactly impact my day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be harvesting the Chardonnay grapes any day now, so I\u2019m going to be too busy for the sewing marathon everyone is about to embark upon. But I\u2019ll be there in spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the dress,\u201d Katie said, then glanced at Francesca. \u201cYou tell her.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sipped her wine, then sighed. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your feelings to be hurt.\u201d</p><p>While she appreciated that they worried about her, she still had no idea what they were talking about. \u201cAre you telling me you don\u2019t want me at your wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>\u201cThen how could you hurt my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t making any sense. Brenna gave up on self-control and grabbed a cookie. \u201cIf the concern is I\u2019ll be depressed because I\u2019m dateless, I swear I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Right now a man was the last thing on her mind. Well, unless he had a million dollars to loan her. Then she was intensely interested.</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cFrancesca, this isn\u2019t the time for delicate psycho-speak. Just blurt it out.\u201d But rather than wait for her sister, Katie continued. \u201cFrancesca and I are worried that you\u2019ll be upset because we\u2019ve finally found great guys and that bastard you were married to is getting married to someone else and you\u2019re all caught up in the winery and what if our long-lost brother really does claim it, and without the winery, you don\u2019t have a life and we\u2019re afraid our happiness is going to depress you.\u201d She paused to suck in a breath.</p><p>Brenna took a bite of her cookie and chewed. \u201cImpressive lung control,\u201d she mumbled over the crumbs, then swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Neither sister looked convinced. Brenna glanced between them. The Marcelli daughters were a perfect blend of their Italian-Irish heritage. Katie was mostly Irish with pale skin and reddish-brown hair. Francesca had the thick, dark hair from the Marcelli side of the family, but had also inherited hazel eyes and a tall, thin body from the O\u2019Sheas. Brenna was pure Italian\u2014dark hair, brown eyes, plenty of curves.</p><p>Which left Mia. Brenna smiled as she thought of her baby sister\u2019s bleached hair and high drama makeup. Mia had never met a tube of mascara she didn\u2019t like. But then, Mia had always been just herself.</p><p>Her sisters had been her best friends all their lives. No matter what else happened, she knew they would be there for her, as they always had been.</p><p>\u201cThis is your time,\u201d she told Katie and Francesca. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me. I swear, everything is great. More than great.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t look convinced. Well, poop. She hadn\u2019t planned on telling anyone about her plans until things were settled, but maybe they would sleep better at night if they knew she wasn\u2019t about to drown her sorrows in a case of Marcelli sparkling wine.</p><p>Francesca\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>Brenna set her wineglass on the nightstand and stood up. She walked to her closet and pulled out a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and began to change her clothes.</p><p>As she reached for the button on the waistband of her skirt, she said, \u201cI went to see Nic Giovanni about a loan. I think he\u2019s going to say yes.\u201d</p><p>After smoothing her shoulder-length hair, she turned back to find her two sisters staring at her. The combination of open mouths and wide eyes was pretty funny.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Francesca breathed. \u201cYou did not go to Nic for a loan, did you? You\u2019re really doing this? You\u2019re starting your own label?\u201d</p><p>Katie clutched her wine in both hands. \u201cHow much did you ask for? Not the amount you said before because that was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA million dollars,\u201d Brenna said cheerfully as she pulled on her jeans. \u201cOr seven figures, as they say on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Francesca sounded horrified. Katie mumbled something Brenna couldn\u2019t hear, which was probably for the best. Her business-minded sister would get caught up in payment schedules and the disaster of what would happen if Brenna failed. Something she wasn\u2019t going to let happen.</p><p>She hung up her suit, then plopped back on the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t decide to go to Nic on a whim. I\u2019ve run out of options. I can\u2019t get a bank loan. Not without Grandpa Lorenzo giving his support. Everyone I talked to assumed that if he wasn\u2019t behind me, it must be because I\u2019m a bad risk. Even as a good risk, I\u2019d have a tough time. There isn\u2019t any collateral. I mean, I\u2019m going to buy those four acres I want, so that would help, but I don\u2019t have a penny of my own to put down. It\u2019s not as if Jeff and I had any assets to split during the divorce.\u201d</p><p>Her sisters looked stunned and slightly panicked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the settlement money?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>\u201cNot even close to enough.\u201d</p><p>Brenna thought about the monthly payments her soon-to-be-ex husband would be sending. While the income would be nice, being reimbursed for putting his ungrateful ass through medical school didn\u2019t come close to the cost of starting a new label. If Nic came through\u2014she crossed index and middle fingers on her left hand\u2014Jeff\u2019s payments would barely cover the interest on her million-dollar loan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to work out great,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cNic Giovanni,\u201d Katie breathed. \u201cYou just went to him and asked for the loan? But you don\u2019t even know him. What makes you think he\u2019ll say yes?\u201d</p> <p>Brenna picked up her wine and cleared her throat. \u201cHe likes to take risks. He gave some other winery start-up money a few years ago. I read about it and remembered.\u201d</p><p>As for not knowing Nic...well, that wasn\u2019t exactly true. Ten years ago she\u2019d known everything about Nic. Not that she\u2019d ever told her sisters. Loving him had been her only secret. One she\u2019d held close to her heart.</p><p>At first she hadn\u2019t told anyone because she\u2019d assumed he wouldn\u2019t stay interested in her for very long. Then she hadn\u2019t told because keeping their relationship a secret had made it seem more special. And when it had ended, she\u2019d been too ashamed by what she\u2019d done to say anything.</p><p>\u201cStart-up money is a world of difference from a million dollars,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work? What if something bad happens?\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cThen I fall on my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwing a million dollars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I have to try. You\u2019re right\u2014I may fail, but I think it\u2019s unlikely. But if it does, I\u2019ll be okay. Even if Grandpa Lorenzo sells the winery, or leaves it to our long-lost brother, he\u2019ll still settle cash on each of us. It probably won\u2019t be a million dollars, but it will go a long way toward paying off my debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo wait,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWait and use that money when you get it.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cThis is the right time. I can feel it. Besides, there are four acres I want to buy, and they won\u2019t stay on the market forever. There\u2019s a crop of Pinot Noir grapes with my name on them, some Chardonnay grapes. I have an idea for a fabulous cuv\u00e9e. My life has been on hold for the past ten years. I\u2019m not willing to wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Nic won\u2019t loan you the money?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t want to think about that, but she had to admit the possibility. \u201cThen I don\u2019t have a choice except to wait. Look, I know I can do this. I have a well-thought-out plan, I know the industry, and I\u2019m not afraid to bust my butt working twenty-four-seven. You both have to take a deep breath and trust me.\u201d</p><p>Francesca and Katie glanced at each other, then at her.</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl,\u201d Francesca said and raised her bottle of chocolate milk. \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>Katie reached for a piece of chocolate. \u201cSo how did our neighborhood bad boy look? I haven\u2019t seen him in years, but the last time I did, I\u2019ll admit my heart did a little back flip.\u201d</p><p>Francesca chuckled. \u201cI know what you mean. I saw him, oh, maybe a year and a half ago. He was coming out of the gourmet store in town. It was one of those perfect spring days. Cool, but sunny. He had on a black leather jacket and sunglasses. He smiled at me as he held open the door. I stood there and watched him ride off on his motorcycle. It was really good for me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna rolled her eyes. \u201cYou two are pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome off it,\u201d Katie scolded. \u201cLike you\u2019ve never had a fantasy about Nic Giovanni. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s physically possible to be within a hundred feet of him and not think about sex. I refuse to believe you\u2019re immune.\u201d</p><p>Brenna was far from that. \u201cHe\u2019s good-looking,\u201d she admitted grudgingly.</p><p>Francesca hooted. \u201cYeah, right. There\u2019s an understatement. He\u2019s dark, dangerous, and moves like a man who knows what he\u2019s doing in bed. Does it get any better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were wildly in love with Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Francesca didn\u2019t look the least bit embarrassed. \u201cBut along with every other female either twenty years older or younger than Nic, I\u2019ve had a crush on him forever. So has Katie and Mia, and I\u2019m guessing you, even though you haven\u2019t admitted it. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>A crush? Did that describe it?</p><p>Katie rolled onto her stomach. \u201cWhat gives, Brenna? Don\u2019t you have a Nic fantasy you want to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That he loans me the money I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want something juicier than that.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sipped her wine. Juicy? That she could provide.</p><p>\u201cNic is the first guy I ever slept with.\u201d</p><p>The room went utterly and completely still. Francesca froze, her drink halfway to her mouth. Katie paused in the act of reaching for another piece of chocolate. Brenna felt as if she\u2019d found the freeze-frame button on a DVD.</p><p>Francesca recovered first. \u201cNic? Nic our neighbor? Nic Giovanni\u2014the great-grandson of the hated Salvatore? The Romeo to our collective Juliet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlept?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cAs in sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never said anything?\u201d Katie sounded outraged. \u201cI\u2019m your sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m her twin and she didn\u2019t say squat to me!\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned back against her headboard. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much to tell.\u201d</p><p>She ducked as Francesca threw a pillow at her.</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d her twin demanded. \u201cStart at the beginning and don\u2019t leave out any of the good parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not the sex,\u201d Katie added. \u201cYou slept with him? I can\u2019t believe it. We voted him the guy the three of us would most like to have had sex with back in high school. And you did it. And didn\u2019t tell us. How is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It just happened.\u201d</p><p>Brenna set her glass on the nightstand and pulled her legs up to her chest, then wrapped her arms around her knees. After all this time she wasn\u2019t sure she could tell the story. Not because she\u2019d forgotten or because it was a big deal, but because she\u2019d gotten so used to keeping it all to herself.</p><p>Ten years after the fact, did it matter if the women she loved most in the world knew?</p><p>\u201cIt started when I was seventeen and Nic was twenty. I knew who he was and all, but we\u2019d never had a real conversation. He caught me sneaking around the barrels over at Wild Sea. I knew they were tasting the wines before bottling. I\u2019d heard so much about the hated Giovanni vineyards, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked stunned. \u201cYou went over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just snuck in the back. It was easy. I was tasting one of their Reserve Cabernets when Nic caught me.\u201d</p><p>That had happened ten years ago, and she could still recall the moment in detail. The sharpness of the wine on her tongue, the heat of the summer afternoon, the terror when someone grabbed her arm. She\u2019d turned to see Nic. In that second before she tried to bluff her way out of the situation, she\u2019d found herself drowning in his dark brown eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d noticed everything about him. His height. The way he brushed his hair back and the single lock that flopped forward. The stubble on his jaw, the dust motes dancing in sunlight. Even the sound of birds outside and the distant rumble of voices.</p><p>\u201cDid he get mad?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>\u201cI think he was more curious. I told him why I was there and that I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201d She smiled as she remembered his failed attempts not to laugh at her audacity. \u201cI\u2019d just won two gold medals for wines I\u2019d blended and I was pretty cocky. I told him they\u2019d made a mistake in using new American oak barrels because it was putting too much vanilla into the wine. I mean that\u2019s great in a Chardonnay, but this was a Reserve Cab. You want berry and chocolate flavors. Some plum and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off and glanced at her sisters. Katie had her head in her hands and Francesca slumped onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Katie looked up. \u201cI know you\u2019ll find this hard to believe, but we don\u2019t care about the wine. Get back to meeting Nic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhilistines,\u201d Brenna muttered. To her, Nic and wine were two halves of the same equation. She couldn\u2019t have one without thinking of the other. But her sisters wouldn\u2019t understand that.</p><p>\u201cInstead of throwing me out, he ended up having me taste several of the wines there. I gave him my opinion. Sometimes we agreed, sometimes we argued. I was always right, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Francesca said with a laugh.</p><p>Brenna grinned. \u201cWe spent the rest of the afternoon together. I remember being surprised by how much there was to talk about. I mean, I knew he was really cute and everything, but back then the wine was more important than any guy. I guess it still is.\u201d</p><p>Katie picked up her glass. \u201cYou are so in need of some serious therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Francesca will give me a discount.\u201d</p><p>Her twin shook her head. \u201cNo treating family members. There are strict rules about that. So then what? You hung out, it was great, and?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a couple of days later I was out walking the vines and Nic found me. We talked for hours. I got sunburned, we were out for so long. This time we arranged to meet up again.\u201d</p><p>Brenna remembered how magical everything had become that summer. With Nic around, the sky was bluer, the ocean more salty. She\u2019d laughed longer, slept harder, breathed more deeply than ever before.</p><p>\u201cWe became friends,\u201d she said slowly, feeling herself getting lost in the past and knowing that was dangerous territory. \u201cWe rode his motorcycle down to the beach for picnics, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were on his motorcycle?\u201d Francesca sounded outraged. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I always wanted to go for a ride with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time I see him I\u2019ll ask if he wants to take you.\u201d</p><p>Francesca rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go now. That\u2019s a teenage girl fantasy. Plus he probably didn\u2019t even keep his bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not be the same one, but he still has a motorcycle,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him on it around here.\u201d She didn\u2019t say that watching him drive by made her blood race or her throat get dry. Nor would she admit that the sight of him in his black leather jacket had flooded her with memories. Having a crush on Nic at seventeen was acceptable. At twenty-seven it was just plain embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re hanging out together,\u201d Katie said. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen one day he kissed me. I was really surprised. I had a thing for him, but I figured he thought I was still a kid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d frequently talked about how much younger she was than him and just as often she\u2019d pointed out that while three years seemed like a big deal now, when they were older it wouldn\u2019t matter at all.</p><p>\u201cHe kisses great, huh?\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca looked at Katie. \u201cShe is so lying. You know it was better than not bad. If nothing else, Nic has had plenty of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling this story or am I?\u201d</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cKeep talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he kissed me and I was stunned and then he admitted that he liked me a lot and I admitted I felt the same about him. Things progressed as they do and one day we made love.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s humor fled. \u201cYou were only seventeen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I was scared, but Nic was great and within a few days the sex was terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told us. You kept this from me,\u201d Francesca said, sounding hurt. \u201cOf course it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>Brenna understood. She and Francesca were twins. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t want you two keeping my secrets and...\u201d She smiled. \u201cSomehow no one knowing made it even more special. I know that sounds silly and it probably was, but I liked having Nic all to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had Nic as your secret, would you have told us?\u201d Katie asked Francesca. \u201cKnowing how the three of us would talk about it, laugh about it, and study it from every angle?\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s twin grinned. \u201cHmm, tell you two all the details or keep Nic to myself. Not exactly a tough choice.\u201d She looked at Brenna. \u201cOkay. I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Now I can sleep tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Katie sat up and reached for the wine bottle. \u201cI understand the why of keeping it quiet. What impresses me is that you could. There wasn\u2019t even a hint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it would cause trouble. The families hadn\u2019t spoken in three generations. It\u2019s not as if Grandpa Lorenzo listened to me about anything anyway. Can you imagine the explosion if I told him I was in love with Nic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you in love?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did it end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic went back to school. He was going to UC Davis, I was here. We didn\u2019t see each other.\u201d</p><p>She took the bottle from Katie and topped up her own glass, then took a drink.</p><p>She and Nic hadn\u2019t seen each other. But what she didn\u2019t tell her sisters was that they\u2019d written. He\u2019d sent his letters to one of her friend\u2019s. They\u2019d agreed to see other people while he was gone. She still didn\u2019t know if Nic had gotten involved with another girl, but after falling in love with him, she\u2019d been unable to get excited about any of the boys at her high school. She also didn\u2019t mention that when Nic returned, they had picked up where they\u2019d left off. That this time when the relationship ended it wasn\u2019t over something as simple as Nic heading off to school. This time she\u2019d been responsible.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say when you went to him for the loan?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said he would think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a no. I should hear from him in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her head. \u201cAre you sure about this? You don\u2019t think it\u2019s the least bit dangerous borrowing money from the great-grandson of the family\u2019s sworn enemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo any of us take the feud seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Francesca picked up a cookie. \u201cI hope everything goes well. Maybe he\u2019ll loan you the money for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo teenage relationship is worth that much,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Brenna couldn\u2019t help agreeing. What they didn\u2019t know and what she wouldn\u2019t tell them was there had been a time when Nic had hated her as much as he had once loved her. Not that she could blame him. If their situations had been reversed, she would never have forgiven him.</p><p>For the first time since going to him that afternoon, she felt a shiver of apprehension. If he wanted revenge, she was handing him the means.</p><p>No, she told herself. That wasn\u2019t possible. Nic wanting revenge would mean that she still mattered. It had been nearly ten years since their relationship had ended, and in that time he\u2019d dated scads of beautiful women. She was just somebody he used to know and his interest in her project was about risk and opportunity, nothing more.</p><p>Francesca smiled. \u201cOkay, Brenna. If you\u2019re determined to do this, then I want to wish you the best.\u201d She raised her drink. \u201cTo your new winery.\u201d</p><p>Katie raised her glass as well. \u201cMay you only rate ninety and above in Wine Spectator.\u201d</p><p>Brenna picked up her glass. \u201cTo new beginnings. For all of us.\u201d</p><p>Nic called out greetings to the office staff as he walked to the executive offices of Wild Sea Vineyards. The door with the brass nameplate stating M. Moore, Chief Financial Officer, stood open. He knocked once and entered.</p><p>Maggie Moore, a tall, beautiful redhead with a brain like a computer, looked up and grinned. \u201cI can always tell when you\u2019re around by the increase in the pitch of conversation among the office staff. You\u2019re a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re all dancing around, trying to look at my butt.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI should never have told you they did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you strutted around here for weeks afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help it if they find me irresistible? Besides, I\u2019ve checked out my share of female body parts over the years. I consider it payback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you love. It\u2019s a curse, but you handle it with style and grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She laughed then and her green eyes crinkled at the corners.</p><p>Maggie had always enjoyed poking at his ego. For the past eight years she\u2019d kept him from taking himself too seriously. When they\u2019d transitioned from lovers to coworkers, that trait had kept things comfortable between them.</p><p>He nodded at the computer. \u201cAre we making millions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best to make that happen. When does harvest start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week for the Chardonnay grapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to be praying for rain or no rain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rain during harvest. While you\u2019re at it, mention that we\u2019d like warm temperatures for the Cabernet and Merlot grapes.\u201d He pulled out a chair in front of her desk and took a seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never remember all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not a wine drinker.\u201d</p><p>She touched her index finger to her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to tell. It\u2019s my big secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I figure one day I\u2019ll use it for blackmail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help it if I don\u2019t get the whole wine thing? Give me a milkshake kind of drink or something with an umbrella. I don\u2019t want to taste the alcohol if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cStrawberry daiquiris. Talk about a chick drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a chick, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did my best to educate your palate, but you\u2019re beyond redemption.\u201d</p><p>Maggie didn\u2019t look the least bit chagrined. \u201cI figure there are more people like me in the world than there are like you, so I don\u2019t care what you say.\u201d She glanced at her computer screen, hit the Save key, and logged out of the program.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said as she turned back to him. \u201cTell me everything. Are we going to be selling overseas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can honestly say we\u2019re going to have more orders than we can handle.\u201d</p><p>He brought her up to date on the meetings he\u2019d held the previous afternoon. They\u2019d gone late into the night, and by the time Nic had headed home, Wild Sea Vineyards had become the newest wine to be imported to the Far East.</p><p>\u201cDennis will be getting you specific numbers,\u201d Nic said, referring to their sales manager. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get up to speed on all the regulations and the hell of shipping the wine overseas. Once we get a start date, I\u2019ll want updated financials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Maggie made a few notes on a pad. \u201cDennis and I already have a meeting set up for later this morning. I\u2019ll add this to the agenda.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cSo why aren\u2019t you thrilled about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem excited. Isn\u2019t this a big deal? You\u2019ve been working toward it for nearly a year. Why don\u2019t you look like a happy camper?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI got what I wanted. Now it\u2019s time to move on to the next goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to stop and enjoy all that you\u2019ve already accomplished.\u201d She leaned forward and rested her elbows on her desk. \u201cNic, you\u2019re burying yourself in work. Have you ever thought about getting a life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted. \u201cYou have the winery, which occupies about ninety percent of your time. The rest of your free hours are spent riding that damn motorcycle along the coast road and dating women you have no intention of ever settling down with. Don\u2019t you want something more significant than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruined me for other women,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNot likely. You\u2019re the one who dumped me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m too smart to let someone like you get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Say that now that I\u2019m happily married with a toddler.\u201d Her humor faded. \u201cWhen we first met you had so many plans and dreams. I never noticed they were all about business. In the past seven years you\u2019ve made them all come true. Maybe it\u2019s time to focus on other areas of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for the lecture, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I appreciate the concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to listen to me.\u201d She sounded resigned.</p><p>\u201cNot for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get through to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a born rescuer and I don\u2019t need saving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need something.\u201d She tapped her pen on the desk. \u201cWhat about a dog?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Maggie always knew the right thing to say, even when he didn\u2019t want to hear it. She wanted him to be a well-rounded person. He wanted to win. As far as she was concerned, he\u2019d achieved every goal he\u2019d set for himself. Which he had. All but the one she didn\u2019t know about.</p><p>As for a woman in life, something permanent, it might be for other people, but not for him. He\u2019d long ago learned that loving someone meant opening himself to being left behind and betrayed. Why bother?</p><p>\u201cMaybe a dog,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get one of those sidecars for your motorcycle. Wouldn\u2019t that be great? You could buy doggie goggles and a little leather dog jacket.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cNot in this lifetime. I\u2019d be getting a dog, not a dress-up doll. Does Jason know you\u2019re this twisted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband adores me.\u201d</p><p>Nic was glad. When he\u2019d come home after his eighteen months of exile in France, Maggie had just been hired to get the winery\u2019s books in order. She\u2019d been five years older, new in town, and the softest touch around. The second she\u2019d found out about his broken heart, she\u2019d gone to work, healing him with everything from long conversations to nights of great sex.</p><p>Six months later he\u2019d been back on his feet, and she\u2019d been smart enough to end things before they got awkward. Over the years they\u2019d stayed friends. She\u2019d met Jason, had fallen in love, and gotten married. Nic had been happy for her. She\u2019d always been the home-and-hearth kind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s our cash flow?\u201d he asked, changing the subject to something less personal.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to buy? More land? Maybe a small island somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. Actually I was thinking of making a loan.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie frowned. \u201cTo whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone I know wants to start a winery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just love training the competition?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHow many new concerns make it?\u201d</p><p>Maggie blinked. \u201cYou want to loan money for a winery start-up you expect to fail?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect it to fail.\u201d Not exactly. But Brenna had been out of the business a long time. Ten years ago he would have bet on her in a heartbeat, but now? He wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cAre you making the loan yourself, or is this from the company?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends on terms. There are tax implications either way. How much money are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>Nic settled back to watch the show. \u201cA million dollars.\u201d</p><p>Maggie pushed to her feet and planted her hands on her hips. Her eyes widened and her cheeks turned as red as her hair. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this how you talk to your boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do when he\u2019s in serious need of therapy. You\u2019re considering loaning someone a million dollars and you think there\u2019s a chance they might fail?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt would be a good write-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be really dumb. I mean it, Nic. I know this is your company and you can tell me to pound sand if you want, but this is a really, really bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you to pound sand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words, but you frequently ignore my very sound financial advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis may have to be another one of those times.\u201d He rose and faced her. \u201cWork up a couple different ways to come up with the money. I don\u2019t know if I want to do it privately or through the company, so go at it from both angles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cBecause I can.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Sweat prickled Brenna\u2019s back as the hot California sun burned through her T-shirt. She wore a wide-brimmed hat to protect her face and should have used gloves, but she didn\u2019t have the dexterity to feel what she was doing with them on. As a result, her fingers were bruised, her nails broken, and she\u2019d been scratched from fingertips to wrist by dozens of grapevines.</p><p>As she crouched between the rows of lush plants, she inhaled the heady aroma of ripe Chardonnay grapes. She took the heavy bunches in her hand and carefully cut them free, imagining the pale green juice running free as the ripe, tender fruit was squeezed. Marcelli Wines Reserve Chardonnay was one of the best in the country, and this harvest was going to be one for the record books. As she worked, cutting grapes free and dropping them into the bin in front of her, she calculated tons per acre and bottles per ton.</p><p>When she\u2019d first seen the potential success of the harvest, she\u2019d wanted to hold some of the grapes back for blending. She had an idea for a cuv\u00e9e she\u2019d been wanting to try and this was the year. But her grandfather had refused to listen, instead telling her that they had always made Reserve Chardonnay from the best grapes, and he wasn\u2019t going to let any of them go to waste because she wanted to experiment.</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s a fool,\u201d she told herself as she shifted to the next plant and began cutting.</p><p>Around her the migrant workers who had shown up at the beginning of the week worked quickly, filling three bins of grapes for every one of hers. She didn\u2019t practice enough to be efficient and her heart wasn\u2019t in the task.</p><p>Yesterday they\u2019d brought in the first grapes. She\u2019d been there as they\u2019d been carefully loaded on the conveyor belt that would carry them into the giant vat for crushing. She\u2019d sorted and watched, then tasted the first juice of the harvest. One sip had told her it was going to be a good year.</p><p>The realization that it might be the last year for Marcelli Wines\u2014if her grandfather went ahead and sold, or left everything to her newly found brother\u2014had driven her from the winery and into the fields. She\u2019d stayed there all day yesterday and had remained there today. She felt restless and tense. It had been three days. Why hadn\u2019t Nic called?</p><p>She\u2019d been so sure he was going to loan her the money, but as time passed, she became less confident. Without him, there wasn\u2019t going to be a Four Sisters Winery. Without his money she was completely on her own. Her current checking-account balance hovered around twelve thousand dollars. Since she and Jeff had split, she\u2019d been able to save most of her paycheck. Unfortunately combining that with the money her ex would soon be sending her wasn\u2019t close to enough.</p><p>The long row of plants stretched out in front of her. Brenna continued to cut the clusters, ignoring those that weren\u2019t ripe enough, working methodically, wondering how much worse her shoulders were going to hurt by the end of the day when her cell phone rang.</p><p>Her youngest sister, Mia, was heading back from six weeks at a Japanese language school in Washington, D.C. Delayed at Dulles Airport by a canceled flight, Mia passed the morning by phoning her siblings and telling them about her adventures. She\u2019d already called Brenna twice in two hours. Each time Brenna had been so sure it was Nic, that she\u2019d barely been able to breathe. Now she knew better and didn\u2019t bother to glance at the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she said as she straightened slightly. \u201cSo stop calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>The low male voice sounded nothing like eighteen-year-old Mia. Instead it sounded intimate, familiar, and too sexy for comfort.</p><p>\u201cNic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call back.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around to make sure she wasn\u2019t likely to be overheard. The regular crew had long moved past her and was nearly halfway down the row. She shifted so she could plop down on her butt.</p><p>Her breathing hadn\u2019t stopped, but there was a tightness in her chest. Tension filled her. Was he going to tell her yes?</p><p>\u201cThis is fine. I\u2019m helping with harvest and I could use a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out in the fields?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019m hot and sweaty. I\u2019m a real fashion statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the winery? Shouldn\u2019t you be worrying about the fermenting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather and I had a disagreement, as usual. I\u2019m in a snit, so I thought I\u2019d come out here and sulk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my feeling.\u201d She wiped the sweat from her face. Her heart felt as if it were beating so hard it was going to jump into another dimension. \u201cSo, um, did you come to any decisions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m thinking about getting a dog.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced up at the bright sun. Had she been out for too long? Was her brain being poached?</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cDogs are nice. Did you have a particular breed in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA golden retriever. Not exactly an untraditional choice, but I want something big and friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey qualify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a breeder up in Ojai. I was thinking of heading out there this afternoon and taking a look. I already called and they have a litter of puppies that are just weaned. A couple are spoken for, but there are five or six available.\u201d</p><p>Okay\u2014one of them was crazy. Why did Nic think she cared about him getting a dog? Was he telling her about the puppy so that she would think he was a swell guy even though he was going to turn her down?</p><p>\u201cThat sounds just peachy. I hope you have fun.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d blinked several times before she realized her eyes were burning. There was no way she was going to cry over this, she told herself even as her throat got all tight. Dammit, she\u2019d been so sure he was going to say yes that she hadn\u2019t bothered with a fall-back plan...mostly because he was her fall-back plan.</p><p>The loss of her dream made her feel sick to her stomach. She wanted to curl up in a ball and die.</p><p>\u201cLook Nic, I really need to get back to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the market for a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would give us a chance to talk.\u201d</p><p>The sick feeling went away. Hope blossomed and grew until it pushed out every other emotion. \u201cDo we have something to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few questions. If I like the answers, then yes, I would say we do.\u201d</p><p>If Brenna hadn\u2019t been sitting she would have fallen down. \u201cAre you going to loan me the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I still need convincing, but I\u2019m about seventy percent there. It\u2019s nearly eleven. Why don\u2019t you get cleaned up and head over to my place? Be here by noon and we\u2019ll go to Ojai. On the way to the breeder, we can talk about your proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-that sounds great. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya.\u201d</p><p>She heard a click in her ear. She pushed the Off button on her cell phone, then flopped on her back on the dirt and burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d she yelled to the heavens. \u201cHe\u2019s going to say yes!\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later Brenna stood in front of her bathroom mirror and tried to manipulate the blow-dryer and a fat, round brush. Normally she simply let her hair air dry. Since the unfortunate incident of the haircut she\u2019d impulsively indulged in after Jeff had dumped her, she hadn\u2019t bothered much with style. As her entire world had been reduced to the hacienda and the winery, there wasn\u2019t anyone to impress, so she\u2019d let her morning routine slide to a quick shower followed by body lotion.</p><p>Right now she wanted to look dazzling. Not dressed up but attractive and confident. But what exactly did one wear when one wanted to be considered worthy of a million-dollar loan?</p><p>As she fumbled with the brush and tried to add a little volume and shine to her hair, she considered her options. Suit, dress, jeans, shorts. Nothing.</p><p>The latter made her both wince and smile. It had been ten years and fifteen pounds since Nic had seen her naked. She didn\u2019t think she should expose her more rounded self without some kind of warning. Besides, this wasn\u2019t about sex, it was about business. So a suit?</p><p>But it was August, damn hot, and they were going puppy shopping. Not exactly an itinerary for a skirt and pumps.</p><p>When her hair was somewhat styled and nearly dry, she tossed down the brush and blow-dryer, then lunged for her makeup case. At least she had decent skin with medium olive coloring that meant she didn\u2019t need much in the way of base or concealer. She smudged on a little eye shadow, applied mascara and lip gloss, then headed for her closet.</p><p>Three minutes later she\u2019d settled on what she hoped was suitable puppy-shopping attire: khaki shorts, a teal polo shirt, and sandals. She slipped on a watch, simple hoop earrings, and ran the brush through her hair one last time before grabbing her purse and car keys and ducking out the door.</p><p>It was 11:58 when she pulled up in front of the Wild Sea Vineyards winery. The building facades hadn\u2019t changed in a generation, but a half dozen new structures had been added in the past few years. She could see the tasting building about a half mile away and all the tourists\u2019 cars parked in front. To her left and right were acres of grapes; behind her was the house.</p><p>She stepped out into the warm afternoon and pulled off her sunglasses. In the past hour she\u2019d been too busy getting ready to think about being nervous, but suddenly the butterflies migrated to her stomach and began dive-bombing her pancreas. She felt hot, thirsty, tense, and apprehensive. If her emotions were a liquid, they would be thick, green, and bubbling.</p><p>The brew got worse when Nic stepped out of the winery. He wore jeans and a T-shirt. Dark sunglasses hid his eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d seen him dressed like this hundreds of times, maybe more. So he was tall, muscular, and good-looking. She was only interested in his money. Nothing about the man appealed to her. Really. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brenna shoved her car keys into her jeans pocket and sighed. She wasn\u2019t a very good liar, not even to herself. It might have been ten years and a lot of miles since she and Nic had been a whole lot more than friends, but some part of her remembered every detail of their time together. Especially the time they\u2019d spent in bed.</p><p>She remembered the warmth of his skin. They\u2019d mostly made love outdoors, so in her mind sun heat and Nic heat were almost the same. They\u2019d discovered the sensual pleasures of making love in the cool June rain, by the beach in July, and under thick canopies of grapes on a sultry August night.</p><p>Their favorite indoor location had been the fermentation room, empty until harvest but still dark and quiet, smelling of yeast and magic. Sometimes, when she walked by the fermentation rooms at Marcelli and caught a whiff of that distinctive perfume, she flashed back to Nic\u2019s body against her, his hands everywhere, their need spiraling out of control.</p> <p>Ten years, a lot of miles, and one failed marriage later, she still remembered...perhaps more than she should.</p><p>\u201cYou made it,\u201d he said, pulling off his sunglasses and offering a smile.</p><p>\u201cI was motivated,\u201d she admitted, determined to act completely cool. \u201cAnd curious. I never thought of you as the pet type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted a dog for a while. This seemed like a good time. You ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and followed him to the multicar garage. Her thighs did some kind of weird shimmy thing, which made it hard to walk. She hadn\u2019t thought about getting there\u2014to Ojai. This was Nic\u2014the guy who rode motorcycles.</p> <p>She had an instant vision of herself on the bike with him, riding behind, holding on, being really, really close. She would wrap her arms around him and feel each time he took a breath. Eventually their hearts would start to beat in unison, just as soon as hers stopped kicking into hyper-drive. It would be fun, intimate, exciting, and more than a little dangerous.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>He stepped into the garage and hit a button that activated an overhead door. Light spilled in from outside. As her eyes adjusted, she saw an expensive Jaguar convertible\u2014the really sleek kind, a Land Rover, and three motorcycles. Which was two more than he\u2019d had before.</p><p>As she glanced around for extra helmets, Nic walked to the Land Rover and held open the passenger door. \u201cIn case we come back with a puppy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want it chewing up my good car.\u201d</p><p>Sensual heat drained out of her like water draining out of a bathtub. Right. Nic was buying a dog. People didn\u2019t show up on a motorcycle if they were pet shopping. It wouldn\u2019t look responsible. It\u2019s not as if the puppy could wear a helmet and hang on from behind. What had she been thinking?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t, she realized as she slid into the passenger seat and waited while Nic closed the door. She\u2019d been caught up in the past and feeling. Which was really stupid. What about her dreams? What about her mission? The drive to Ojai was her opportunity to convince Nic to loan her the money. She had to focus.</p> <p>As Nic settled in next to her, she vowed to keep things strictly business. She was about to mention the loan when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cHave you started harvesting the Reserve Chardonnay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>He turned the key and started the engine, then glanced at her. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe grapes are pretty spectacular,\u201d she admitted. \u201cExactly ripe, with just enough sweetness. You wouldn\u2019t have to have any talent to make this harvest a success. What about you? The Chardonnay grapes ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn most of the fields. I have crews out.\u201d</p><p>They backed out of the garage. He hit a remote to close the door, then turned the vehicle and headed down the main drive to the highway.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she asked, grinning. \u201cAre you going to have a brilliant year?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looks that way.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019d been hearing that it was turning into a good harvest for everyone. Which was a whole lot better than the years when everyone was scrambling. She still shuddered when she thought back to 1998 when California Cabernet had suffered from low yields due to uncooperative weather. The Cab grapes hadn\u2019t ripened correctly. It had been one of the few times she hadn\u2019t minded not being involved with Marcelli Wines.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you and your grandfather argue about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to use some of the Reserve grapes for a cuv\u00e9e. He thinks they should all be bottled as Reserve Chardonnay. They\u2019re our best-producing vines and I see his point, but I\u2019ve had this idea for a great cuv\u00e9e. He\u2019s a purist and old-fashioned.\u201d</p><p>Nic glanced at her. \u201cChardonnay is one of the most popular wines around. Why would you want to try something new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think blends are becoming more popular. Both Kendall-Jackson and Columbia Crest up in Washington State have done really well with Cabernet-Merlot blends. Qupe Winery has a cuv\u00e9e that sells out about thirty seconds after it gets bottled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd because you like to experiment.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it. I want to create the perfect white wine. Light, slightly fruity. I want the finish to be crisp, with a hint of sweetness. Minimal oak. I want it to taste cold, even when it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be done. Assuming you cough up the money, I\u2019m going to buy the Schulers\u2019 Chardonnay grapes. I have some Voignier on reserve up in Napa. I figure with the right blend and barrel fermenting I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to barrel ferment?\u201d</p><p>She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. \u201cYou sound like my grandfather. Yes, I am. I know it\u2019s expensive and more time-consuming, but the blend will be smoother and the color lighter. Which is what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your Pinot Noir?\u201d</p><p>She watched as they merged onto 101 south heading for the off ramp that led to Ojai.</p><p>\u201cI went and saw the grapes last week. They need about another month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know good Pinot\u2019s a bitch to make.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cI am more than up to the challenge.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOkay, so Chardonnay, a cuv\u00e9e, and Pinot. Anything else on the Brenna Marcelli radar scope?\u201d</p><p>She did ten minutes on her plans for the perfect Cabernet. As she wasn\u2019t able to grow her own grapes, not yet anyway, she\u2019d lined up a list of potential purchases. Rather than buy in bulk from one seller, she would pick up small batches from several to get the exact blend she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going a hundred percent on this Cab,\u201d she concluded. \u201cNo Cab Franc or Merlot to smooth it out. I\u2019m not looking for a wine that will cellar for twenty years, either. At least not at first. I want it good in three years and great in four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d</p><p>She allowed herself a smile. \u201cThe difference is I know how to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say that? You do fine. Wild Sea is known all over the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolume not quality?\u201d</p><p>The argument was familiar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept track of Wild Sea wines,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know all this, Nic. You\u2019re too focused on getting the most number of cases per ton. You need to give up that last ten percent. It\u2019s not worth it. Oh, and there were a couple of poor barrel choices for the 2000 Reserve Merlot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how you convince me to loan you money? By insulting my wines?\u201d</p><p>She shifted in her seat, adjusting the seat belt so she could face him. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want my opinion, you wouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou phrased \u2018volume, not quality\u2019 in a tone of voice that implied a question. That\u2019s asking.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou\u2019re still stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also still right. You might outsell Marcelli Wines four to one, but we get nearly three times as many wins at competitions, and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to remind you about our ratings from the various magazines and critics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Want to compare gross profits?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cOnly if you want me to drool in your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s save that for the puppy.\u201d</p><p>They left the freeway and turned onto the road to Ojai. August in California meant sunny days and little rain. In summer much of the state turned brown.</p><p>Brenna studied Nic\u2019s strong profile and the competent way he drove.</p><p>This was the longest they\u2019d spent in each other\u2019s company in what felt like forever. She was nervous about a lot of things, but also oddly relaxed. Maybe because he\u2019d always been so easy to be around. Because of their differing opinions on everything from wine to politics, they fought all the time. Yet their arguing was never hostile\u2014instead it was more of a hobby they shared. They discussed with plenty of emotion, they called each other names, they even threatened bodily harm\u2014in the best way possible, all without either of them ever really getting mad. At least they used to. Currently, they were only arguing.</p><p>She found herself wondering what he\u2019d been doing for the past ten years. Oh, she knew the basics. He\u2019d spent eighteen months in France, exiled by his grandfather, Emilio. Best not to think about that, she told herself. After all, Nic being driven away had pretty much been her fault.</p><p>In the end Nic had been vindicated when his grandfather begged him to return to run the family vineyard. Nic had agreed, taking over the day-to-day operations. When Emilio died, Nic inherited everything.</p><p>In the past seven or eight years Wild Sea had grown, mostly through acquisition. If a winery went out of business, or someone got tired of the ups and downs of the industry, Nic was there with the best offer to be had. He\u2019d always said he wanted to be the biggest and best. By most standards, he already was.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to bother?\u201d he asked, breaking into her thoughts. \u201cYou could fall on your butt and end up owing me a million dollars plus interest.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d done her best to forget why she was here. Suddenly it was show time. She considered the question.</p><p>\u201cI was a fool to walk away from Marcelli Wines ten years ago. I didn\u2019t realize my heart and soul were buried in the land and that without them I was an empty shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were happily married.\u201d</p><p>She tried to figure out if there was heat or sarcasm in his words, but couldn\u2019t hear either. Maybe it was just a statement.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was, too. It was all an illusion. Now I\u2019m back and I can\u2019t believe the difference. I never want to lose the land or the vines again. My grandfather has options he considers a lot more interesting than leaving me in charge, so I\u2019m willing to take the chance. I don\u2019t consider failure possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people would say that\u2019s arrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what some people say. I know what I\u2019m doing. I have a plan. I\u2019m not afraid to work hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>She straightened in her seat and stared out the front window. \u201cInteresting question. I guess being stupid. Giving it all up for something that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words fell out of her mouth, she wanted to grab them and stuff them back. Of all the idiotic, insensitive, ill-timed things to say, that was it. If she wanted to make sure Nic didn\u2019t loan her the money, she\u2019d just come up with the perfect strategy.</p><p>\u201cSo we have that in common,\u201d he said, his voice even.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them. \u201cNic, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d he said, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cBut I really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I\u2019m not interested in the past. It\u2019s boring. I find the future far more intriguing. Assuming you make it through the first year, then what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t know what to say.

By year two I\u2019ll start selling. I know the distributors. I\u2019m not worried about getting into restaurants and stores.\u201d</p><p>He was going to say no. She\u2019d just blown the opportunity of a lifetime. Why couldn\u2019t she remember to think before she spoke? It wasn\u2019t hard. She had a functioning brain most of the time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d want a callable note,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA callable note. There would be a payment schedule and a reasonable rate of interest. I\u2019ll even hold off two years until you have to start paying me back. But in return the note is callable at any time. You start to stumble, I\u2019m not going to wait for the crash. I\u2019ll call in the note and take everything you have.\u201d</p><p>Her mind went blank. One second there were thoughts, the next, nothing. Her hands clenched tight, her legs felt icy cold, and her heart stood still. Then rational thought returned, as did her body temperature. She raised her arms and pressed her hands flat against the roof of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cDid you just say you were loaning me the money?\u201d she asked carefully.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and saw he was smiling. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean I shouldn\u2019t have the papers drawn up in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Please. Draw away.\u201d</p><p>Brenna started to laugh. She wanted to throw herself at Nic and kiss him. Good sense and a seat belt held her in check. Instead she rolled down the passenger\u2019s-side window and stuck her head out into the hot afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI just got a loan for a million dollars!\u201d she yelled to the trees. \u201cI\u2019m going to open a winery!\u201d</p> <p>Joy flooded her. She was going to get her chance. When she flopped back in her seat, she closed the window, then looked at Nic.</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already announced it to the world. How could I say no?\u201d</p><p>Happiness made her blood bubble like champagne. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. You actually have a million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a whole lot more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow-off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, how about a little gratitude? I\u2019m going out on a limb here.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI am grateful. You have no idea.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cSo why did you say yes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a good bet.\u201d</p><p>After ten years of Jeff telling her that her life was uninteresting and second-rate when compared with him becoming a doctor and six months of fighting with her grandfather about everything from barrel time to labels, Nic\u2019s words made her glow.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing. With a little luck and a lot of hard work, you can make your venture a success. I get good return on my investment. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first bottle I produce is yours,\u201d she said. \u201cAs my way of saying thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA measly bottle? You owe me at least a case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. A case it is.\u201d</p><p>At this point she would have promised him a kidney. He\u2019d given her the means to make her dream come true. Surely that was worth at least an organ or two.</p><p>4</p><p>The dog breeder lived in an old farmhouse on the edge of an orange grove. Nic pulled in behind a battered Jeep and turned off the engine.</p><p>\u201cThe woman I spoke with, Sara, said to follow the sound of barking down to the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy enough.\u201d Brenna glanced at him. \u201cYou do realize puppies don\u2019t come house-trained. They tend to piddle in the night and chew shoes.\u201d</p><p>He shifted to look at her. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t saying you couldn\u2019t, O Great One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mocking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m still really happy about the loan.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she slipped off her sunglasses and he saw the humor in her dark eyes. The corners of her mouth curved up and she nearly quivered with excitement. While he had an ulterior motive for giving her the money, he decided to forget about that...at least for the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cYou want a male dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so typically guy-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all, although you could try to be a little more creative in your choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are girl dogs and boy dogs. How creative could I be?\u201d</p><p>He climbed out of the car and was instantly assaulted by the sound of dozens of dogs barking. Brenna circled the Land Rover and stopped next to him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said in a loud voice. \u201cNow I know why your dog lady lives in the middle of nowhere. She wouldn\u2019t be a very popular neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>They headed down a stone path, which led them closer to the noise. Several large trees provided shade for about a dozen large kennel runs and a couple of barns.</p><p>Nic held the door open on the one marked \u201cGuests\u201d and followed Brenna into a brightly lit reception area. A teenage girl sat at a battered desk. She looked up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi. You\u2019re Nic, right? I\u2019ll let Sara know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She ducked out through a wooden door. Brenna crossed to the cinder-block wall and studied pictures.</p><p>\u201cThere seem to be some champions in the bloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuality breeding is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be showing the dog?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She continued to study the pictures.</p><p>\u201cBrenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that it\u2019s so you. You\u2019re buying a dog with a championship pedigree, but it\u2019s just a pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be very proud of that fact.\u201d</p><p>He did his best not to smile. \u201cI just offered you an unsecured seven-figure loan. Shouldn\u2019t you be a little more humble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic?\u201d</p><p>He turned and saw a pleasant-looking woman in her fifties standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sara.\u201d The woman waved them in. \u201cCome see the kids.\u201d</p><p>The puppies were kept in a large open pen partially in the shade. Eight fur balls in various shades of cream and pale gold tumbled together. The mother lay off to the side. Her weary expression explained that eight offspring were possibly seven too many.</p><p>\u201cWe try to let them out as much as possible when the weather is this nice,\u201d Sara was saying. \u201cNow, I told you that two of the puppies are already spoken for. Let me show you which ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What about their temperament?\u201d Nic asked. \u201cI run a winery and my dog will be free to roam a large area, but he\u2019ll have to interact with people. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Goldens are known for their friendly personalities. I breed family pets here, so I choose pairs that are good with children and not excitable.\u201d</p><p>Brenna tapped the gate. \u201cCan I go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into the pen and was instantly surrounded by eight excited puppies. Nic watched as she sank onto the grass and held out her arms. The fur balls climbed over her legs, scrambled up her chest, and stood on hind legs to nibble on her hair. She cuddled them close, laughing when they swiped at her mouth with doggy kisses.</p><p>\u201cTell me about their bloodlines,\u201d Nic said.</p><p>\u201cTheir great-grandfather was the first champion I raised,\u201d Sara told him. \u201cHe was a beautiful, gentle dog.\u201d</p><p>She continued to speak, but Nic only half listened. He found himself caught up in watching Brenna with the puppies.</p><p>Tiny paws messed up her sleek hairstyle. Mud prints stained her shirt and shorts. High-pitched yips of excitement mingled with her laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou are all too cute,\u201d she cooed and earned a doggy kiss.</p><p>A puppy ducked under her bent leg, drawing Nic\u2019s attention to the curve of her calf and the exposed length of thigh. She\u2019d always been curvy in a way that he found sexy as hell. That hadn\u2019t changed. His gaze slipped from her thigh to her breasts.</p><p>He stiffened as he flashed back to the first time he\u2019d seen her breasts. He\u2019d nearly lost it when she pulled off her shirt for him and had unfastened her bra. He\u2019d seen naked women before, but no one like her. For the first time in his life, he knew why the word lush had been invented.</p><p>At first he hadn\u2019t been able to touch. He\u2019d been too caught up in looking. Then he\u2019d been unable to resist what she\u2019d offered. Full, sweet-tasting with dark nipples that tightened at his every touch. He\u2019d filled his hands with her sensitive curves, exploring every inch of skin, licking and sucking until she\u2019d writhed against him and they\u2019d both been so hot that they\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Jesus. He jerked himself back to the present. Brenna still played with the puppies, Sara continued to talk about bloodlines, and he was as hard as a rock.</p><p>He shifted so that a fence post concealed his condition and did his best to think about mundane things, like dog training and what kind of leash he was going to have to buy.</p><p>He forced himself to pay attention to Sara and started asking dog-care questions. Brenna looked up, a puppy in each arm.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you pick?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey\u2019re all so adorable.\u201d</p><p>Sara unlocked the gate. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to go in and spend some time with them.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned. She set one of the puppies down and patted the ground. \u201cCome on, Nic. The grass stains will wash out.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into the pen and sat next to her. Instantly several puppies clamored over her to get to him. They sniffed and barked and licked his palms and bit his fingers. When he picked one up, he felt its pudgy belly as it wiggled close and swiped at his face with a warm tongue.</p><p>\u201cThey like you,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a likable kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I doubt puppies are wildly discerning. They just want attention.\u201d</p><p>One puppy, a light beige-colored fur ball, dived for his boots and wrestled with the shoelace. The pup pulled the bow loose and tried to run with the lace in its mouth. It got up a good head of steam for maybe eight inches, then came to a sudden stop when the lace tightened.</p><p>Unprepared for the sudden change in momentum, the puppy tumbled onto its back and looked at Nic in surprise, as if asking what had just happened. Nic scooped him up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can take me?\u201d he asked the big-eyed fluff ball.</p><p>The dog woofed in agreement, wiggled to get closer, and tried to lick his face.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Brenna warned. \u201cYou might find the puppy doing the picking rather than the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Even as she spoke, the pup cuddled close to Nic\u2019s chest, rested its head on his shoulder, and closed its eyes.</p><p>Nic knew he was a regular kind of guy. He was into sports, rode a motorcycle, and ran a successful corporation worth half a billion dollars. There was no way fifteen pounds of puppy was going to get to him.</p><p>But the warm weight felt surprisingly comfortable. Maybe Maggie had been right\u2014maybe he did need something more in his life, even if it was just a dog.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this one, Sara,\u201d he said, indicating the puppy in his arms and avoiding Brenna\u2019s knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a big guy. Just look at those paws. He\u2019s social and outgoing. A little stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t most males?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Sara held up her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t have those kinds of conversations with clients,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cYou two can argue about that on the way home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They probably would, Nic thought. Along with other things. Brenna had always been opinionated, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up for what she believed. She also didn\u2019t mind admitting when she was wrong. Rather that was how she\u2019d been ten years ago. He couldn\u2019t speak to who she was now.</p><p>He glanced at the puppy asleep in his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later they were back in Nic\u2019s Land Rover with a large box of supplies in the back and a still-drowsy puppy on a blanket on Brenna\u2019s lap.</p> <p>\u201cWe can put him in the carrier,\u201d Nic said as he started the engine.</p><p>She stroked the puppy\u2019s soft fur and shook her head. \u201cI like holding him. As long as you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Nic shrugged. She supposed the message was that simple homey things like dogs didn\u2019t get to him, but she\u2019d seen the expression on his face when the puppy had fallen asleep on his chest. He\u2019d felt a twinge of emotion.</p><p>She guessed he would rather eat glass than admit it, which was fine with her. She wasn\u2019t going to say anything. Well, not very much.</p><p>\u201cWhy a dog?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about getting one for a while, but my travel schedule made the idea impractical. I recently hired a new sales manager. He\u2019ll take over most of the accounts and do the bulk of the traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will you do in your free time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some new projects. They\u2019ll keep me busy. Not to mention training my new dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraining, huh? Probably to attack strangers on sight. I\u2019ll warn my family members to stay clear of Giovanni land. I don\u2019t want my seventy-something grandfather coming home with a dog bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRufus won\u2019t be biting anyone.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. Rufus? You\u2019d name your poor dog Rufus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. It\u2019s not a cute puppy name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be a cute puppy for long.\u201d</p><p>She cupped the dog\u2019s face in her hand. \u201cLook at those big eyes, that little black nose. Can you really call this sweetie Rufus? Think of the emotional pain from the other dogs in the neighborhood calling him Rufus the Dufus.\u201d</p><p>Nic shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out in the sun too long, Brenna. The other dogs in the neighborhood won\u2019t be calling him anything because dogs can\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to us. But they can probably talk to each other. They\u2019ll tease him. He needs a more dignified name. Or at least something fun.\u201d</p><p>Nic made a noise in his throat that wasn\u2019t exactly a growl, but darned close. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but Rufus. How about Charlie, Marvin, Jack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarvin?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m brainstorming. You can\u2019t be critical and expect the creative process to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought that naming a dog would be considered creative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important. This is a name he\u2019ll carry for the rest of his life. It will say something about who he is. He\u2019ll either live up or down to his name.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the sleeping puppy in her lap. \u201cHow about Max?\u201d</p><p>She picked up a massive paw and held it in her hand. Hard to believe this little guy would grow into those feet, but he would. \u201cMax works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Nic returned his attention to the road. Brenna stayed completely still, barely able to breathe. She knew that Nic hadn\u2019t meant the statement the way he\u2019d said it. She was reading something into his words that didn\u2019t belong there. They had a business relationship now, nothing more. She\u2019d learned her lesson about giving her heart and soul to a man and even if she was ever going to take that chance again, it wouldn\u2019t be with Nic. Loving him had been a disaster...for both of them.</p><p>But the implied connection in \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019ll call him\u201d unnerved her. She thought about the afternoon they\u2019d just spent together and realized how easily they\u2019d fallen into familiar patterns. As if they\u2019d always been friends. As if the years apart hadn\u2019t happened. As if she hadn\u2019t betrayed him.</p><p>Old news, she told herself. For both of them. Nic had gotten over her, just like she\u2019d gotten over him. They were business partners now. Nothing more. She couldn\u2019t afford for them to be anything more.</p><p>5</p><p>When they arrived back at Wild Sea Vineyards, Brenna figured she should leave, but Nic surprised her by asking if she could stick around for a little longer.</p><p>\u201cI have a few questions about how you\u2019re going to make things work,\u201d he said.</p><p>She eyed him suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to change your mind about the loan, are you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI already said yes. I don\u2019t go back on my word. You\u2019ll have the papers in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Being around Nic was hardly tough duty, and seeing as she already had a crush on Max and little to do back at the hacienda, with the exception of picking grapes or arguing with her grandfather, she agreed.</p><p>She helped him carry puppy supplies into the main house. The Marcelli hacienda was a huge Spanish-style structure, but the Giovanni home was more a one-story ranch style, with additions sprawling at both ends. Years ago, when Nic\u2019s grandfather had been out of town, she\u2019d once spent the night. She still remembered what every room looked like and how many places they\u2019d made love.</p><p>They walked through a utility room into a large remodeled kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to keep him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an old storage room where he can sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA storage room? Is it heated? Does it have a window? Are you going to keep him locked up all the time?\u201d</p><p>Nic shook his head. \u201cYou always assume I\u2019m the bad guy. Maybe you\u2019d like to check out Max\u2019s prison cell before complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a baby. He\u2019s going to miss his mother and siblings. He\u2019ll probably cry all night. You should let him sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on a bet. He\u2019s little now, but soon enough he\u2019ll be full-grown. I\u2019m not sharing my bed with an eighty-pound dog.\u201d</p><p>Brenna had the brief thought that she could offer to share Nic\u2019s bed, but she pushed the image of them together in a tangle of sheets from her mind and prepared herself to be appalled by Max\u2019s new home.</p><p>She should have known better, she thought, feeling more than a little foolish when she saw the \u201cstorage room.\u201d Maybe it had once been home to an assortment of boxes and pieces of furniture, but it was currently puppy paradise.</p><p>Indoor/outdoor carpeting covered the floor. Two big windows let in sunlight, while an alcove provided a quiet place for a big, cushy bed lined in what looked like sheepskin. Several chew toys and a bowl of water stood by the door. In the opposite corner was a large plastic container about six inches high and lined with newspaper. Sara had told them the puppies had been trained to use a \u201cdoggie litter box\u201d in the night.</p><p>\u201cI plan to feed him in the utility room. Or is that too much like torture? Maybe I should set a place for him at the table. But without a thumb, he\u2019s going to find using silverware a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>Brenna put the dog carrier in the closet and hung the leash and harness on a hook by the door. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s a great room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Nic put Max into the bed. The puppy stirred, then went back to sleep. \u201cThat would make me right and you...\u201d He paused expectantly.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWrong. Okay? You were right and I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and draped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI love it when you say that.\u201d</p><p>The second his hand settled on her shoulder, heat exploded in her body. It was like being inside of a flare. One second there was nothing, then an audible rush, followed by a bright light and instant flames. She wanted to inch closer and have him touch her in more places. She wanted to run for cover.</p><p>Fortunately she picked a more rational response than either of those choices. She stepped to the window and looked out at the view.</p><p>\u201cYou have a nice grassy area back here. Max will like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something you\u2019ll like more. Come see.\u201d</p><p>For half a second she thought he was talking about something, well, sexual. Her gaze involuntarily dropped to his crotch. The second she realized what she was doing, she jerked her head back and prayed that the heat of her face wouldn\u2019t manifest itself in a blush.</p><p>\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d she asked from her place by the window.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to learn to trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen little wine bottles grow out of grapevines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of Max\u2019s room. \u201cCome on. It will be worth it.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then slowly followed.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me about barrels,\u201d he said when she\u2019d caught up with him. They walked through the kitchen and back outside. \u201cHow are you going to get them?\u201d</p><p>She needed a beat to make the conversational switch back to business. \u201cI have some on order. I\u2019ve also been calling around. A few people ordered too many and they\u2019re happy to sell the extra.\u201d</p><p>Good wine barrels cost several hundred dollars each. They had a limited lifespan and constantly needed to be replaced. Empty barrels invited mold and rot, so wine makers preferred to keep them full at all times. The trick was that production rates varied from year to year, so it was a constant guessing game to have the exact number around for any given vintage.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be storing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at Marcelli Wines,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t rented space yet. I didn\u2019t want to make any commitments until I was sure I had the financial backing.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d led them to the winery. Several buildings created a small complex. The center building was the largest, and a recent addition. Brenna stared enviously at the new building, a state-of-the-art storage facility with several temperature-controlled rooms. Special shelves had been designed and installed to allow for easy access to any barrel. A computer kept track of what inventory was where. Everyone in the valley had heard about Nic\u2019s new facility. She\u2019d even had a talk with the contractor and had gotten a bid on a smaller version for Marcelli Wines. Her grandfather had said it was a waste of money.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any extra room in there,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. But I do have this.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to one of the smaller buildings. She followed him inside and nearly fainted.</p><p>The structure was the size of a barn, with several walls dividing the space into open rooms and a loft overhead. Empty racks for stacking barrels stood lined up in rows. Large silver ducts cut across the ceiling and down the walls, providing rudimentary temperature control from the industrial-sized heater and air conditioner outside.</p><p>Brenna instantly began calculating capacity. If Nic would rent her this space, she would be able to keep all her wines in one location. Plus the Giovanni winery was within easy distance of her day job. She\u2019d imagined having to drive across the valley to three or four different locations.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m willing to sign a two-year lease. That should lower the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re borrowing money from me only to turn around and pay me rent with it?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll fold the cost into the loan.\u201d</p><p>Brenna swallowed hard. He was already delaying payments for two years. With the accumulation of interest and the deferred rent, she was racking up some serious charges. If she failed...</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it, she told herself. Success was the only option. When she\u2019d turned Four Sisters into a viable label, Nic couldn\u2019t touch her. She only needed two years, three tops. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUntil then I owe my soul to the company store,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me no.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the open room.

She could work all night and not have to worry about being in the way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d she said when Nic ushered her back outside. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so much more than I could have hoped for.

Wouldn\u2019t the heavens crack open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>She squinted slightly into the sun and saw that it was much lower in the horizon than she would have thought.</p><p>\u201cI should be heading back,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to make an appearance so no one gets suspicious, and you have to feed Max.\u201d</p><p>Nic chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re convinced I can\u2019t take care of him on my own, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuppies are a lot of responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>At this point she figured he could handle anything. \u201cI had a good time,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd not just because you\u2019re loaning me a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fun,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Too late she realized this was the wrong conversational tack. Suddenly things seemed really personal. She found herself wanting to step closer to him, or maybe have him step closer to her. She wanted to lose herself in his brown eyes, letting past and present blur. Her body was convinced it would be as good as it had been before, and she wasn\u2019t sure the rest of her didn\u2019t agree.</p><p>She wanted...a lot of things.</p><p>It seemed like a really good time to run.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said and stuck out her hand. \u201cThanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her hand. The corner of his mouth twitched\u2014as if he knew he got to her. Maybe he did. Maybe he was doing it on purpose. If so, it was a small price to pay for the loan.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to help,\u201d he said solemnly as they shook hands.</p><p>She did her best to ignore the sensation of his skin brushing hers. For reasons that made absolutely no sense, she remembered a line from Romeo and Juliet, which she hadn\u2019t read since she was in ninth-grade English about a hundred years ago.</p><p>\u201cPalm to palm, as those the palms kiss.\u201d</p><p>There would be no kissing, she told herself. Not palms or lips or any other body parts.</p><p>She pulled free of him and edged toward her car. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019ll be by tomorrow to pick up the loan papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, um, I\u2019ll just make myself at home with the pressing equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. Let me know if you need anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I will.\u201d</p><p>She tripped as she reached her car, but caught herself before she fell. After giving Nic a quick wave, she slipped into the driver\u2019s seat and quickly started the engine. It was way past time to get to safety.</p><p>New rule number one, she thought as she drove away. Avoid Nic at all costs. The man was dangerous in more ways than she would have thought possible.</p><p>That night Nic stretched out on the sofa and picked up the old leather-bound diary he\u2019d been trying to read for the past couple of weeks. It wasn\u2019t just the small cramped handwriting that defeated him, it was that the damn thing was written in Italian.</p><p>He\u2019d studied the language at college, but his working knowledge was limited to asking the way to the library and a few good swear words. Which meant he spent more time thumbing through an Italian-English dictionary than making any progress in Sophia Giovanni\u2019s diary.</p><p>He\u2019d come across the journal nearly two years before, when he\u2019d been cleaning out his grandfather\u2019s study. The old man had been gone for nearly five years, but Nic hadn\u2019t been in any rush to get rid of his things. The house was plenty big, and for the most part Nic simply closed off rooms. But one winter afternoon he\u2019d decided to rid the house of the remnants of what had been his last living relative.</p><p>Nic\u2019s parents had been killed in a car accident in Spain nearly fifteen years ago, although they\u2019d abandoned their son ages before that. His parents hadn\u2019t been interested in much more than upscale travel and finding a really good party\u2014preferably in Europe. Nic had been four when he\u2019d awakened to find them gone and only his grandfather left to raise him.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen his parents again. They\u2019d sent occasional notes, had called from time to time. When they died, he\u2019d barely felt a twinge. For him, family had meant him and the old man. His world was nothing like the Marcellis, where relatives lived in the old hacienda, loving and laughing and curing all ills with pasta.</p><p>A soft whine interrupted his musings. He glanced up and saw Max enter the living room. The puppy looked small and lost and scared. When he saw Nic, he whined a little louder.</p><p>Nic glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Aren\u2019t you tired? I could take you back to your room.\u201d</p><p>Big brown eyes stared unblinkingly. A shiver rippled through the puppy. Max flopped onto his belly, put his head on his paws and began to whimper.</p><p>Nic swung around so his feet were on the hardwood floor and swore softly. \u201cYou\u2019re lonely,\u201d he said. \u201cI bet you miss your mom.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling to himself, he crossed to Max and picked up the dog, then returned to the sofa. \u201cHow do you feel about baseball?\u201d he asked as he settled back on the couch and propped his feet up on the coffee table.</p><p>Instead of answering, Max sprawled across his belly and sighed with contentment.</p><p>\u201cNot a big fan, huh? We\u2019re going to have to change that. I like the Dodgers, myself.\u201d</p><p>Max swiped at his chin, then closed his eyes. Nic petted the soft fur on his back while he clicked on the TV and found the game already in progress. As he checked out the score, he closed the diary. He would get to translating it later. After all this time, what did the past, or family, matter?</p><p>Two days later Maggie cornered Nic when their meeting broke for lunch. He\u2019d been watching her get more and more annoyed all morning and wasn\u2019t surprised when she grabbed his suit sleeve and tugged him out of the conference room and into her office.</p><p>Fire flashed in her green eyes and she looked furious enough to crack him over the head with a swivel chair.</p><p>\u201cYou object,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cOn several levels. First of all, your consortium is made up entirely of men. There are intelligent women in the financial community. I would be happy to supply you with names.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest and leaned against the door frame. \u201cLow blow,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s gender. The takeover target is a traditional, old-fashioned man. Not the type to sell to a woman.\u201d</p><p>She crossed to her desk and sat on the edge. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing. Why all this sneaking around? Whenever you\u2019ve wanted to buy another company, you\u2019ve simply made an offer. This time you\u2019re creating a false front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name can\u2019t come up in negotiations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d never sell to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you shouldn\u2019t be buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an option.\u201d</p><p>Maggie couldn\u2019t know, but this had been his plan all along. He\u2019d spent the last seven years of his life working toward this one goal. The Marcelli family had cost him everything. He would get his own back by taking away all that they\u2019d ever worked for.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clean deal,\u201d Nic reminded her. \u201cI\u2019ve put together an impressive group of buyers. We\u2019ll make a fair offer. When it\u2019s accepted, they\u2019ll bow out and I\u2019ll take charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything illegal. Besides, it\u2019s going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Who wouldn\u2019t be impressed by the CEO of a major bank, a senior partner in an investment firm, and the owner of the largest wine distributor on the West Coast all coming together? You do business with them, they like you, so they\u2019re doing you this one little favor. It stinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She straightened and glared at him. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not telling anyone the full truth. Not me, not them, certainly not Brenna Marcelli, who...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting for Maggie to put the pieces together. From the look on her face, she just had.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you did it,\u201d she breathed, obviously shocked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out why you would loan someone that much money without at least taking a piece of the action. You made it a callable note, but even if you took everything back, you\u2019d still come up short. The only way to make money on the deal is to have her succeed. But this isn\u2019t about her starting a winery at all, is it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s about leverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she his daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Maggie sucked in a breath. \u201cYou want to buy Marcelli Wines. But you\u2019re a Giovanni. You\u2019d never be allowed to even take a walk on the property, let alone bid on it. To get around that, you put together a group of men that would make any prospective seller get down on his knees and give thanks. You have the cash and the credit to get more, so buying the company isn\u2019t going to be a money issue. What if the truth comes out and the deal goes south? What if there\u2019s a buyer more pleasing to Mr. Marcelli? Not for financial reasons but for personal ones. You can\u2019t risk that, right?\u201d</p><p>Maggie had been with him long enough to know how his mind worked. She\u2019d nailed it. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou have to be the luckiest man alive. Because right in the middle of all this, fate hands you an ace. Lorenzo Marcelli\u2019s granddaughter comes to you for a loan, which you give her. Now you have in your possession a one-million-dollar callable note on someone who is very important to him. If he balks, you threaten to ruin his granddaughter. Because it\u2019s not about getting the money back, it\u2019s about reputation. You can make sure Brenna never works in this town again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Nic? What\u2019s so important about Marcelli Wines?\u201d</p><p>A complex question. He would give her a simple answer that didn\u2019t begin to explain the situation. \u201cI want it all. They\u2019re all that\u2019s left to buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s complete crap. There are dozens of other wineries in the valley. Why them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a long history. Think of it as my way of ending the feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t let business get personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you explain this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext to us, Marcelli is the biggest holding in the valley. They\u2019re everything we\u2019re not. Small, prestigious, almost a boutique winery. We\u2019ll modernize, expand, make a real profit. It\u2019s a smart move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>That ten years ago when he\u2019d told his grandfather he was in love with Brenna Marcelli, Emilio had been furious. The old man\u2014his only living relative\u2014had forced him to choose. Brenna or his heritage. Nic had chosen Brenna and she\u2019d chosen her family.</p><p>Always one to keep his word, Emilio had thrown Nic out and made sure no winery on the West Coast would hire him. Nic had gone to France, where he\u2019d been forced to work as a day laborer in the vineyards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a time Emilio had come looking for him. There\u2019d been no one else to inherit Wild Sea. So Nic and his grandfather shared real estate but they\u2019d never reconciled. Emilio had never forgiven Nic for choosing a Marcelli over family, and Nic...he\u2019d learned his lesson. All that mattered was winning.</p><p>Maggie walked past him and out into the hall. Once there, she paused and glanced at him over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that your plan will work perfectly. But let me ask you a question. What about Brenna\u2019s loan? Say you buy Marcelli Wines. Do you call it in?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess it depends on whether that would be an advantage to you or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>She turned away. \u201cYou\u2019re a really smart guy. It\u2019s too bad you have to be such a bastard.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific,\u201d Brenna said, going for a calm, yes-this-is-a-great-deal-for-both-of-us voice when what she really wanted to do was jump up and down, screaming like a teenage girl at a boy-band concert.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a truck there as soon as you\u2019re ready. Absolutely.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll put you down as getting a couple of bottles when the wine is ready. Talk to you soon. Bye.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone and slapped her hands on the kitchen table. \u201cI love it when a plan comes together.\u201d</p><p>Still grinning and bursting with happiness, she recorded the information in the small Palm Pilot she\u2019d bought the day after Nic had told her she was getting the loan. Three nights of cramming on the impossibly small device had brought her up to speed. She quickly entered the details on the Chardonnay grapes she\u2019d just purchased, then cross-referenced them with the information on the Voignier already on order.</p><p>Using the calculator function, she estimated tons per acre, based on what she knew about the vineyards in question. Going against conventional wisdom, and her grandfather\u2019s opinion on the subject, she would be taking the first part of the pressing for her cuv\u00e9e. She wanted her blend to be so spectacular that critics would weep and customers would buy by the case.</p><p>\u201cIn a perfect world,\u201d she murmured, entering the rest of the information, including how much she\u2019d paid, and tapped in a note on the calendar reminding her to check the status of her grapes in a couple of days. She glanced at her watch and saw she needed to get back to the winery before anyone noticed she was gone.</p><p>She was just turning off her Palm Pilot when the back door opened and Katie walked into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d her oldest sister said. \u201cLook what I found lurking by my doorstep this morning.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed when she saw Mia, her youngest sister, burst into the kitchen. As usual the eighteen-year-old was wearing too much makeup, belly-revealing clothes, and a navel ring.</p><p>Brenna stood and held open her arms. \u201cWelcome home, Baby Sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna!\u201d</p><p>Mia flew toward her. Brenna braced herself for impact, then staggered back anyway when Mia\u2019s hearty embrace turned into a collision.</p><p>\u201cD.C. was so incredibly cool,\u201d Mia said, then kissed Brenna\u2019s cheek and sighed. \u201cI met two cute White House aides, and when I told them about my broken engagement, they were thrilled to help heal my broken heart. Ah, summer love. But now I\u2019m here and it\u2019s great to be home.\u201d</p><p>Brenna released her sister and laughed. \u201cWhen did your heart get broken?\u201d</p><p>Mia sniffed. \u201cWhen I ended my engagement.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna looked at Katie, who shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your heart was even slightly cracked, let alone broken,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cThe White House aides didn\u2019t have to know that. Besides, I liked all the sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would,\u201d Brenna said as she studied her sister\u2019s pretty face.</p><p>Like Francesca, Mia was a blend of the two sides of their family. Her eyes were light brown, and while her hair was darker than Katie\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t as dark as Brenna\u2019s, even without the blond streaks she painted in every couple of months.</p><p>Mia was the shortest of the sisters, as curved as Brenna, but without her tendency to gain in the hips.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d she told her. \u201cTravel agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled her thanks, then her expression turned serious. \u201cHow are you? Getting over Dr. Dick?\u201d</p><p>Katie winced. \u201cMia, you have the worst mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Because you never say anything bad. Jeff\u2019s a jerk. Screw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s my job anymore,\u201d Brenna said with a grin. \u201cNot that it was ever that exciting.\u201d</p><p>Katie chuckled. Mia offered a high five, then headed for the refrigerator. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mom and the Grands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Santa Barbara. It\u2019s their monthly lunch-and-shopping day. They\u2019re going to be furious when they find out you showed up today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Katie said dryly. \u201cI could barely fit all her luggage in the car. I think she\u2019s moving back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d Mia pulled mozzarella and fresh basil from the refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019m staying until school starts. But I had to bring all my clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cYou might be invited to a cotillion, and then what would you wear?\u201d</p><p>Mia stuck out her tongue. \u201cI\u2019m starved. Where are the tomatoes?\u201d</p><p>Katie glanced at her watch. \u201cI really need to head back to L.A. I have meetings this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Brenna pulled several tomatoes out of the pantry. \u201cYou think the brat is going to let you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Mia said. \u201cCome on, Katie. You haven\u2019t seen me in weeks. Don\u2019t you want to hear all about my life in D.C.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard plenty on the drive up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but now you can listen to me tell Brenna. The stories are even more interesting the second time around.\u201d</p><p>Katie slipped off her suit jacket and hung it over a chair. \u201cWhy did I even bother trying?\u201d she asked, then picked up the kitchen phone and dialed.</p><p>While she explained that she wouldn\u2019t be returning to the office, Brenna removed fresh bread from a wooden box on the counter. She pulled several knives out of the drawer and passed one to Mia.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you learn?\u201d she asked as she began slicing tomatoes.</p><p>\u201cTons. Japanese is a really interesting language. Verbally I do great. I can speak and understand, although my accent sucks. But the written language is so tough. All those characters. I passed and everything, but I felt like a moron the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Brenna put the tomatoes on a plate, alternating the thick slices with thin pieces of mozzarella Mia passed her way.</p><p>\u201cShe graduated top in her class,\u201d Katie said as she hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cSmart and beautiful,\u201d Mia said with a wink. \u201cKinda makes you want to hate me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find your modesty to be your real defining characteristic,\u201d Brenna told her.</p><p>Katie opened the refrigerator and looked in several plastic containers. \u201cPasta salad, some kind of chicken dish.\u201d She sniffed the leftovers. \u201cChicken Marsala, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cWe had it a couple of nights ago. I\u2019d rather have pasta salad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Mia finished with the cheese. After taking a bowl out of a cupboard, she collected olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic to make a dressing. Brenna used kitchen scissors to cut up the basil.</p><p>\u201cSo what about this guy Francesca\u2019s engaged to?\u201d Mia asked. \u201cI was barely gone for what, two months, and she\u2019s getting married? And the whole pregnancy thing. I can\u2019t believe she got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Francesca is still getting used to that one, although she and Sam are both thrilled,\u201d Katie said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo does the thought of a new generation being born take the heat off you or make it worse?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve already announced no babies for at least a year.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cBut they\u2019re not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d Mia wrinkled her nose. \u201cSo what\u2019s Sam like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say the perfect man for our perfect sister. He also has a great daughter. Kelly. She\u2019s twelve.\u201d Brenna sprinkled the basil on the plate, then passed it to Mia.</p><p>\u201cSince when did you have an interest in kids?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted them. Jeff was the one who said we had to wait. As much as I would like one now, I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have any. It would have made the divorce a lot more complicated.\u201d</p><p>Mia poured the dressing over the cheese and tomatoes. While Brenna carried plates and flatware to the table, Katie set out a bowl of pasta salad, the bread, butter, and several kinds of sliced salami and ham. Mia slid the tomatoes and cheese plate into the center, then grabbed cans of soda for them.</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d she said as she sat down. \u201cI loved the restaurants in D.C., but after so long away, I\u2019m ready for the Grands\u2019 cooking.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sat across from Mia. Katie sat at the head of the table. Mia used a fork to spear tomato and cheese onto her plate, then reached for the bread. \u201cSo what else has been happening while I was gone?\u201d</p><p>Katie shot Brenna a \u201clet me\u201d look. \u201cNot much. Well, except that it turns out that Brenna slept with Nic Giovanni and got a million-dollar loan from him to start her own winery.\u201d</p><p>Mia froze in the act of biting into a piece of bread. Her eyes widened and the color fled her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>Katie made an X over her left breast. \u201cSwear on Grandma Tessa\u2019s rosary.\u201d</p><p>Brenna spooned pasta salad onto her plate. \u201cIt was ten years ago.\u201d She looked up and grinned. \u201cThe sex. The loan is recent. As wonderful as I may think I am in bed, I have to admit I doubt I\u2019m worth a million bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to ask about first,\u201d Mia admitted when she\u2019d chewed and swallowed her bread. \u201cThe sex or the winery. I can\u2019t believe you slept with him and didn\u2019t tell me. I hate being the youngest. I never find out anything good until years later.\u201d</p><p>Katie raised her eyebrows. \u201cObviously she decided the sex was more interesting than the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties all in a bunch. I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he was great,\u201d Mia said with a sigh. \u201cNic always looked like he knew his way around female anatomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re eating,\u201d Katie protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Because you and Zach never pushed aside dinner to do it on the table,\u201d Mia grumbled.</p><p>Katie blushed slightly, but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cJust like I thought.\u201d Mia looked triumphant, then turned her attention back to Brenna. \u201cYou\u2019re starting your own winery? For real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cGrandpa Lorenzo and I are arguing about everything. Working with him is a nightmare. Between how much he hates all my ideas and the recent discovery that we have a long-lost brother\u2014the male heir our grandfather has always wanted\u2014I figure my chances of inheriting are somewhere between \u2018unlikely\u2019 and \u2018it ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your own label?\u201d Mia sounded both impressed and terrified. \u201cA million dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I came up with a great business plan, but I couldn\u2019t get any of the banks to listen. They wanted to know why Grandpa Lorenzo wasn\u2019t backing me himself. I didn\u2019t want to go to Mom and Dad for the money because they live here and it would have been awkward for everyone. So I went to Nic and he said yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She still had trouble believing it was all coming together for her. \u201cHe\u2019s loaning me crushing and pressing equipment. It\u2019s old\u2014he\u2019s replaced his system with a state-of-the-art facility that is to die for. The crusher is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mia held up her hands. \u201cSpare us your ode to the grape crusher. The point is, that\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already spending it,\u201d Brenna admitted, feeling a little terrified herself. Although it was a good kind of terror\u2014sort of an \u201cI can\u2019t believe my dreams are coming true\u201d tension. \u201cI\u2019m buying four acres of perfect Pinot growing land down by the coast. I have barrels on order, grapes coming in. Two years from now, I\u2019ll have my first wine out in the world. In three I\u2019ll be making it.\u201d</p> <p>Mia looked a little dazed. Still, she raised her soda can. \u201cWow. To Brenna and her new adventure. May you only ever sleep with men as sexy as Indiana Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Nic,\u201d Katie added as she raised her glass. \u201cAfter all, he\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Mia picked up her fork. \u201cSo, Brenna. Ten years after the fact, does our dishy neighbor still get your motor humming?\u201d</p><p>Brenna thought about her recent encounters with Nic and how after less than thirty seconds in his company she\u2019d been ready to revisit the delights of the past in a very physical way.</p><p>\u201cThere seems to be some attraction,\u201d she said cautiously.</p> <p>Mia hooted. \u201cSome? You\u2019re lying. I can tell with my eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>Katie leaned forward. \u201cSo it\u2019s still there? The chemistry?\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded unhappily. \u201cIn a way I wish it weren\u2019t. I\u2019m having some self-control issues. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. For one thing, I don\u2019t know if the feelings are mutual.\u201d Although she kind of thought they might be.</p><p>\u201cFor another,\u201d she said, making her voice more firm, \u201cNic and I now have business together. That changes everything. I can\u2019t sleep with the guy who loaned me a million dollars. It would be too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you two?\u201d Mia asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to actually have sex with him to enjoy the experience. That\u2019s what fantasies are for.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna grinned. \u201cSometimes, Mia, I like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>Just after sunset Brenna turned into the driveway leading to Wild Sea. Ahead of her, a truck pulled to a stop in front of the old building that housed the equipment Nic had loaned her. Brenna parked off to the side and climbed out into the cool evening.</p><p>Her heart beat fast and she was having trouble catching her breath, but for once her reactions weren\u2019t about being around Nic. She was really going to do this\u2014she was about to take the first step on the road to making Four Sisters Winery a success.</p><p>She hurried toward the building and pulled open the wide double doors. The inside smelled musty, with the scent of previous harvests lingering along with the dust motes. The last rays of sun spilled in from high windows, bathing the ancient equipment in a patina of worn gold. Nic had told her he\u2019d had all the machinery scrubbed out, and she\u2019d already checked that everything functioned, so she could get right to work tonight.</p><p>Reverently she ran her hands over the crusher. Excitement flared inside of her. For the rest of her life she would remember this moment, she told herself. Years from now when someone asked where it had all begun, she would recall this night.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want them?\u201d</p><p>She looked up and saw two men carrying in baskets of grapes. She pointed to the open floor space and helped them arrange the baskets in rows. Twenty minutes later the truck was unloaded and the men left.</p><p>Brenna stood alone, surrounded by the best Chardonnay grapes she\u2019d been able to purchase. The scent of the fruit offered a hint of what could be. Possibilities, she thought, picking a grape and biting into it. Making wine was always about possibilities.</p> <p>The grape was firm, tart, with a hint of sweetness. She let the juice linger on her tongue, absorbing the layers of flavors, imagining the taste in a year and a half when fermentation and oak and time combined to work magic.</p><p>\u201cBut first there\u2019s plenty of work,\u201d she murmured aloud, before loading the crusher.</p><p>She worked quickly, then flipped the switch. The machinery began to clink and grind, slowly crushing the grapes before they were moved into the presser. As the mixture traveled, she checked the temperature. If the grapes heated too much, they would begin fermenting as early as the pressing stage, which would be a disaster. But the weather was on her side. The day had been unseasonably cool, with a fog that never lifted. Her grapes were slightly chilled and a little damp.</p><p>She hurried to the far end of the presser and made sure the first vat was in place. After pressing, the grapes would settle, allowing sediment to sink to the bottom of the vats. That was as far as she would get tonight.</p><p>Tomorrow there would be more grapes. The process would continue through late September and harvesting of the Cabernet.</p><p>As the crushed mixture moved through to the presser, the smell of grapes grew stronger. Even with the doors open and a slight breeze drifting into the building, the sweet aroma became almost intoxicating.</p><p>She had just loaded another basket of grapes into the crusher when she heard footsteps on the cement floor. Instantly her heartbeat quickened with anticipation. Brenna found herself smiling even before she turned to see who had joined her.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Nic asked as he walked over to stand next to her. \u201cI saw the truck pull in.\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the clanking equipment. \u201cThis is it. The beginning.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI thought about bringing champagne to celebrate, but that seemed like overkill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I appreciate the thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little. I\u2019m using this batch for my blend. They\u2019re premium grapes and I know I\u2019m right to do this, but I can\u2019t help feeling apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucking convention is never easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention the fact that I can hear my grandfather\u2019s voice in my head as he yells at me for wasting the best grapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed earplugs?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJust a little more time doing my own thing. I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>He was standing close enough that she could see the stubble darkening his jaw. Nothing unusual there, she told herself. Many Italian men had heavy beards. Nic was simply one of those guys who had to shave in the evening before going out on a date. But this wasn\u2019t a date and he hadn\u2019t shaved and she found herself remembering how that stubble had felt against her skin when they\u2019d kissed. The combination of rough beard and soft lips had been unbelievably erotic. Damn. It was hell to have peaked sexually at the age of seventeen.</p><p>Nic walked around to the presser. \u201cHow much are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it. I want it settling before I leave.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the baskets of grapes on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be here until dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you work today?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you working tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSleep is highly overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks for stopping by.\u201d</p><p>Brenna watched him go, trying not to feel disappointed. This was her dream, not Nic\u2019s. He had his own winery to run\u2014and he got to do it during the day, like a normal person.</p><p>She glanced around the big, open room, at the wooden walls, the staircase, and the cement floor. There wasn\u2019t a stick of extra furniture. She was going to have to dig up a desk and maybe even a radio, she thought. Otherwise the nights were going to get incredibly long.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later she checked the level in the presser. The crushed mixture filled the big container. As she watched the process, she imagined what it would be like eighteen months from now when she would see the finished wine filling bottles. Maybe she would invite her sisters to come by and they could have a party.</p><p>A clunking sound made her turn. Nic had returned with a couple of folding chairs and a box.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to make it all night without coffee,\u201d he said, putting the box on the floor.</p><p>She saw a coffeemaker along with cups and a big bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll supply the grounds for tonight, but after that, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to read too much into his friendly gesture, or the fact that he\u2019d brought two chairs. If Nic stayed, that would be nice. If he didn\u2019t, she would survive.</p><p>Nice, she thought as she picked up the coffeepot and carried it over to a wall plug. Nice? Right. Who was she kidding? Being around Nic wasn\u2019t nice, it was exciting and terrifying. It was like swimming with electric eels. She never knew where the shock was coming from. A sensible woman would stay out of the water. Funny, she\u2019d been sensible once, when she\u2019d married Jeff. And look where that had gotten her.</p><p>Nic cradled his coffee mug. It was sometime close to midnight and he knew he should head back to the house. Still, instead of standing, he stretched out his legs and watched as the first of the juice flowed from the presser into the waiting vat.</p><p>Brenna danced anxiously around the equipment as if she could make the process go smoothly by sheer force of will alone. Her brown eyes glowed with an intensity he envied. This mattered to her. She would be involved from the loading of the grapes into the crusher, through bottling the last drop of wine. If she had time, he would bet that she would be out hand cutting every single grape.</p><p>Wild Sea was important to him, but he no longer had the same intimate contact with his wine. The company was too big. While there were vineyards he controlled personally, the majority had managers who handled the day-to-day details. He checked on the process, but he didn\u2019t have a hand in every bottle they produced.</p><p>That\u2019s what comes from doubling the size of the company, he reminded himself. If all went according to plan, he would soon be adding Marcelli Wines to his holdings.</p><p>\u201cHave you picked a name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Brenna looked up. \u201cFour Sisters Winery.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but he was and wasn\u2019t able to stop himself from stiffening.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Great name.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cFamily was always important to you.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to look uncomfortable. He waited to see if she would say anything, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you how Wild Sea got its name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo one has ever told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe original plan had been to name the wineries after the family name. Your great-grandfather did that with Marcelli Wines, but Salvatore had a change of heart. In the 1920s there was only one way to come to America and that was by boat. It seems the crossing was very rough and my great-grandfather thought they were all going to die.\u201d</p><p>Brenna winced in sympathy. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t have great stabilizers back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. According to my grandfather, Salvatore made a deal with the sea. He promised to name his winery after it if it didn\u2019t swallow them up.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled. \u201cI never thought of your great-grandfather as the whimsical type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he was, but fear does strange things to people.\u201d</p><p>She sat next to him and sighed. \u201cSometimes I think it would have been very exciting to be alive back when Salvatore and Antonio started the wineries. All the promise of the future was in front of them.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t point out that the first couple of years would have been filled with backbreaking work as the soil was prepared for the vines. No doubt there had been plenty of trips to church to pray for blessings and maybe even a miracle or two. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have my great-grandmother\u2019s diary,\u201d he said. \u201cSophia started it about five years before she married Salvatore and came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading it in bits and pieces. She talks about a lot of things, including Salvatore\u2019s particularly unromantic proposal. When he returned to Italy, he was considered successful. The match was arranged without anyone asking Sophia her thoughts on the matter. She didn\u2019t complain about that in her diary, but she did mention she was eager to see America. At least I think that\u2019s what she said. My Italian is lousy. She could have been talking about the laundry instead.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna laughed. \u201cI doubt that. Women usually don\u2019t discuss laundry in their diaries. Not that I could tell you for sure. My Italian is worse than awful. Why are you reading her diary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it when I was going through my grandfather\u2019s things a couple of years ago. I pick it up from time to time and translate a page or two.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s slow going. Plus I\u2019m a present and future kind of guy, so the past isn\u2019t that interesting to me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s humor faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your grandfather. I wanted to come to the funeral, but I knew having a Marcelli there would cause a lot of talk and distract from the real purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised her eyebrows. \u201cOf course it mattered. He was your family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI know he was mad before, when you left, but after you came back...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cDidn\u2019t things turn out all right between you? He left you the winery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only living Giovanni left. Who else would inherit?\u201d</p><p>She looked away. Nic thought he read guilt in her body language. She was the reason he and his grandfather had become estranged in the first place. He considered pressing the point, but decided it had been too many years and too many miles. What did talking about all that now matter?</p><p>Silence filled the large room. Brenna shifted in her seat, then offered a shaky smile. \u201cHow\u2019s Max?\u201d</p><p>Nic sipped his coffee. \u201cGood. He\u2019s housebroken, as promised. I\u2019m currently working on his need to chew everything he can find. I also want to get him into an obedience program.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause at least one living creature in your life should come when called?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stood and checked the presser.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you get more grapes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to put your personal life on hold until harvest is over.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat would only be a problem if I had one, which I don\u2019t. I\u2019m only interested in getting the winery up and running. Besides, I have my family around if I ever get lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did, but I was talking about something else. Haven\u2019t you bothered replacing your husband with a boy toy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo not my style.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know that I have a style when it comes to men, but younger isn\u2019t it. If there were a man in my life, I\u2019d want him to be older. Experienced. What about you? Any potential Mrs. Nic\u2019s around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re both at romantic loose ends.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, closed it, then slapped her hand against her forehead. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d</p><p>He would like to, but it was too late. Tension sparked to life, filling the room and getting his attention. A smart man would change the subject, or leave. Funny how he only wanted to explore the possibilities. Playing with fire?</p><p>Not fire, he reminded himself. Fire would imply a need and he didn\u2019t have that. Anything he felt was simply mild interest. Blood heated and stirred. Okay, mild sexual interest, but nothing more. He\u2019d learned that lesson a long time ago.</p><p>Brenna turned and moved to check the vat. Somehow Nic found himself on his feet, walking toward her. The smell of the grapes surrounded them, reminding him of all those times they\u2019d made love in the Wild Sea Winery. They\u2019d done it in this very room. Did she remember?</p><p>She turned and found him standing next to her. Brenna didn\u2019t jump, but she looked uneasy. He studied her eyes, searching for an awareness that matched his own. He found caution and desire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, um, really late,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay and keep me company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He found himself wanting to push her. Or was he pushing them both? Was he testing to see how much attraction still flared between them? Was he trying to punish her?</p><p>\u201cNic.\u201d</p><p>His name lingered on her lips, forcing his attention to her mouth. He reached for her and lowered his head at the same time. She could have backed away, but she didn\u2019t. Instead she stood still as he kissed her, softly, gently.</p><p>It was an innocent kiss. Their mouths remained closed and, except for his hand on her arm, there wasn\u2019t any body contact.</p><p>He waited for some hint of what had existed before. A flare of heat, a spark of some uncontrolled need. But there wasn\u2019t any of that. Kissing Brenna felt\u2014</p><p>Hot, thick, and heavy desire slammed into him. He nearly staggered from the impact of the blow. A hunger so deep it gnawed down to his soul grew exponentially until it threatened his ability to maintain control. Aching need exploded, blocking out every thought, rational or not. He wanted with a fury that left him barely standing.</p><p>He parted his lips and deepened the kiss. For a nanosecond he thought she wouldn\u2019t respond, that he would be forced to take what he needed more than his next breath. But then she moved against him and her mouth opened. His tongue brushed against the sweetness of her lower lip before slipping inside.</p><p>She welcomed him with a hot, aggressive kiss that told him she felt it, too. The taste, the fiery wanting building inside of him, the pressure of her body against him, were all familiar. Passion spiraled between them, as it always had\u2014frantic, desperate, amazing. She clung to him, straining to get closer. He rested his hands on her back and explored her from shoulders to hips, relearning her body. At the second he dropped his hands to the curve of her rear, she flexed forward, bringing her belly in contact with his erection.</p><p>His first thought was that they could do it on one of the chairs. He would sit down and she would straddle him. They\u2019d done it that way before, and if his memory was anything to go by, it had worked like a charm. His second thought was that if she kept rubbing against him, he was going to lose it right there\u2014something he hadn\u2019t done since he was about fourteen. His third thought was what the hell was he thinking?</p><p>Brenna pulled back at the exact second he released her. They were both breathing hard. He didn\u2019t doubt that the fire flaring in her eyes matched the heat in his own. Her gaze dropped from his mouth to his hard-on, then made a quick return trip. She half turned away and cleared her throat.</p><p>Nic found himself both aroused and furious. Not the safest combination. He knew why he wanted her, but he didn\u2019t want to think about why he was pissed off. The anger surprised him. He didn\u2019t want to know what it meant, so he ignored it.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>Brenna nodded without looking at him.</p><p>Nic headed for the door, then hesitated. He wanted to say something, but right now there weren\u2019t any words. He swore under his breath and walked into the night.</p><p>The hours after midnight had turned cold. He waited for the decrease in temperature to do something to ease his arousal, but blood continued to pulse painfully in time with his rapid heartbeat.</p><p>Okay, the passion shouldn\u2019t have come as such a surprise. It had always been there between them. As long as he was aware it was a possibility, he could control it. Would control it. Tonight he\u2019d been caught off guard, but that wouldn\u2019t happen again. The anger was something else, though. He should be over the past. He wouldn\u2019t let it control him. Not ever.</p><p>As he walked to the house, he reminded himself that he had a plan. That\u2019s all this was. Playing with Brenna was a side benefit. He wouldn\u2019t let it be more. He wouldn\u2019t let her matter. Not again.</p><p>7</p><p>Why had Nic kissed her?</p><p>As the question passed through her brain for the four thousandth time that day, Brenna found herself no closer to an answer. She didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d kissed her, and she sure didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d let him. It had been stupid. He was her...She hesitated. Not business partner, but something. The man had loaned her a lot of money. She shouldn\u2019t go around kissing him. Their relationship had to be strictly business. Actually, in the best of all worlds they wouldn\u2019t have a relationship at all. They would nod as they passed each other at the grocery store, nothing more.</p><p>But last night she\u2019d done a lot more than nod. If she hadn\u2019t come to her senses when she did, she probably would have been ripping off her clothes and begging him to take her.</p><p>She crossed to the large fermenting vat in the main building of the Marcelli Winery and checked the temperature of the pale liquid inside. After noting the number on her clipboard, she walked to the next vat.</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean anything, she told herself. It couldn\u2019t. She and Nic were old news. Last night had been...a warning, she decided. That was it. He\u2019d kissed her, she kissed him back, and that was certainly something they couldn\u2019t do. Not if she was going to stay sane, not to mention safe. As far as she was concerned, Nic Giovanni was still dangerous. Pathetic, but true. She would avoid him and thereby avoid the problem. And should she find herself in his company\u2014because she was spending a lot of time at his place\u2014she would treat him like a co-worker. There would be no intimate conversations, no lip locking of any kind, and certainly no naked body parts pressing and slipping together in a way designed to make both people feel as if their entire\u2014</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it,\u201d she muttered as she walked to the next vat. \u201cWork. Concentrate on work.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done when the yeasty smell filling the room reminded her of making love with Nic. She sighed. Why couldn\u2019t he have been a car mechanic? Then they could have made love in an auto shop instead of a winery. She could easily go the rest of her life without smelling motor oil. Wine and wine-making scents, on the other hand, were impossible to avoid.</p><p>So why had he kissed her?</p><p>Brenna nearly screamed out loud when she realized she\u2019d mentally circled around to the damn kiss again.</p><p>\u201cBrenna? Are you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>A distraction, she thought. That was something.</p><p>She wove her way through the massive vats toward the door. Grandpa Lorenzo stood just inside the fermentation room. He held several sheets of paper in his hand. She recognized the brightly colored logo in the top corner and felt her need to scream increase. Judging from the look on the elder Marcelli\u2019s face, this wasn\u2019t going to go well.</p><p>\u201cI have the new label designs,\u201d he said when she stopped in front of him. \u201cFor the Reserve Chardonnay.\u201d</p><p>She clutched her clipboard to her chest and vowed she would not react, no matter what he said.</p><p>Despite his seventy-plus years, her grandfather stood straight and tall, several inches taller than she. He might have gray in his hair, but his dark eyes were still young and expressive. They could flash with anger and disapproval. Gee, they were doing it right now. She braced herself for the complaint.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked, holding up the first design. \u201cA horse? A goat? We now have animals on our labels?\u201d</p><p>Abstract designs in cool colors swirled together in the center of the label, before bleeding out into the mossy green of the border.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a goat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything. Just colors and shapes together.\u201d</p><p>He turned the paper around so he could squint at it, then shook his head. \u201cNo goats.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flipped through the six remaining designs. \u201cToo flashy. Too new. Why do we have to change the labels on the Reserve Chardonnay? The old labels work fine. People know what they look like. Simple. Marcelli Wines in big letters. Not this.\u201d</p><p>He flung the sheet with the picture of the arch over the entrance to the winery at her. Brenna caught it and set the paper on her clipboard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been using the same label for five years, Grandpa. It\u2019s time for a change.\u201d She willed herself to be patient. \u201cWe discussed this. You agreed.\u201d</p> <p>He dismissed her with a flick of his hand. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t agree to such nonsense. I hate them all. Who did you hire to come up with these?\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s teeth ached from grinding them together. \u201cA firm in Los Angeles. I picked them because they were innovative and excited by the project.\u201d She took the rest of the pages from him. \u201cI happen to like what they\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNot the goat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my favorite, but I thought the others were great. Obviously you didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll phone them and have them send us out some more ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them to make the new labels like the old ones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you want them exactly the same, what\u2019s the point in bothering with a new design?\u201d She sucked in a breath. \u201cI know our loyal customers recognize our label, but they would still find us with a new one, and we might attract new buyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you know what our buyers think, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading up on marketing. I\u2019ve given you several articles. Didn\u2019t you look at them?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m busy. Besides, what do they know? My father started Marcelli Wines from nothing. He took this earth and he created all that you see around us. When they respect that, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Brenna wasn\u2019t even sure who \u201cthey\u201d were. Before she could ask, her grandfather sighed heavily and tossed the labels on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou need to respect the old ways.\u201d</p> <p>Hardly a news flash, she thought as she gauged the distance to the door and wondered if running screaming into the afternoon would make her feel better. It wasn\u2019t quite as good as running screaming into the night, but a woman had to make the best of what was available.</p><p>\u201cI respect the old ways,\u201d she said, striving for calm. \u201cI\u2019m also interested in what the new ways have to offer.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in obvious disgust. \u201cYour brother, he would listen.\u201d</p><p>Brenna was so stunned, she nearly dropped the clipboard. \u201cWhat? My brother? The guy you\u2019ve never even met? How on earth do you know what he would do or not do? That is such an unfair thing to say to me. If Joe has any interest at all in this winery, it\u2019s only for the money.\u201d</p><p>She would know. When she and Francesca had gone to meet Joe Larson, their long-lost brother, he\u2019d shown little or no interest in the Marcelli family until he\u2019d heard there was a winery worth about forty million dollars.</p><p>Lorenzo drew his thick eyebrows together. \u201cThe wine is in his blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. You can\u2019t be serious about leaving everything to him.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather shrugged. \u201cI do what I have to do.\u201d</p> <p>He turned and left.</p><p>Brenna sank onto the floor and rested her head on her knees. \u201cThis is not happening,\u201d she murmured. Her eyes burned, her chest hurt. There was no way her grandfather could really leave the winery to someone he\u2019d never met. Blood or no blood. And doing it just because Joe was a guy?</p><p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It more than sucked. It hurt down to her bones. Of course she\u2019d known that having a brother changed things, but she\u2019d hoped she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>The designs for the labels lay where Grandpa Lorenzo had tossed them. Apparently her disagreements with him over the labels were the least of her problems. Things had gotten so difficult that she and her grandfather couldn\u2019t go a day without arguing about something. Half the time she expected him to fire her. Except she was family and he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have to keep her in charge. If he hated everything she was trying to do, why not hire someone who would hang on his every word and do things exactly as he wanted? He could also change his will, if he hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>\u201cJust a reminder of why starting my own label was the right thing to do,\u201d she told herself as she scrambled to her feet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he does. I\u2019ll have my own winery to worry about.\u201d</p><p>But the words didn\u2019t offer as much comfort as she would have liked. Nothing in her world was the way she thought it would be. Not her past and certainly not her future.</p><p>\u201cFinal figures,\u201d Nic said when he entered Maggie\u2019s office and slapped the folder on her desk. \u201cRead them in awe.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows, then flipped through the pages. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not letting success go to your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswering that the way I want to would be unprofessional.\u201d She closed the folder. \u201cI\u2019ll work up a projection based on these numbers. You\u2019ll have it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He sat down in the chair in front of her desk. \u201cWhat about the numbers for Marcelli Wines?\u201d</p><p>She flipped through a stack of papers by her computer and handed him several sheets. He read the estimations for gross sales, broken down by region.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as good as we can do without looking at their books,\u201d Maggie told him. \u201cI had the sales guys nosing around, but they can only find out so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d he said.</p><p>The sales projections were even better than he\u2019d thought. There was plenty of profit to be had. Once he\u2019d modernized everything and streamlined operations he would\u2014</p><p>He glanced up and saw Maggie watching him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou still disapprove of what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too strong a word. I don\u2019t like it, but liking it isn\u2019t part of my job. I keep thinking about that loan to Brenna Marcelli. What are you going to do with her? Destroy her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little melodramatic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Maggie shook her head. \u201cGee, Nic, you\u2019ve loaned her a million dollars and given her the chance to start her own winery. She\u2019s moving ahead with the belief that all her dreams are about to come true. Yet at any moment you could call the loan and pull the rug out from under her. I\u2019m guessing when that happens she\u2019s going to be a little broken up. What would you call it, if not destroyed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>The callable note gave him options. Now that he\u2019d seen Brenna in action, he knew that given time, she could make a go of Four Sisters Winery. Maybe he would sit back and collect interest like one of the good guys. Maybe not. The only thing he knew for sure was that seducing her hadn\u2019t been part of his plan, but since that damn kiss he hadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else. Maybe it was time for a different plan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking very predatory,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go meet Brenna Marcelli and see for myself what she\u2019s like. If I hate her, I won\u2019t feel so guilty about being a part of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything but your job. You have no guilt in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d</p><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t talk Maggie out of her feelings. She\u2019d always been a soft touch. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to warn me not to say anything about the secret plot to purchase her family\u2019s winery?\u201d</p><p>Nic stood. \u201cNo. You work for me. You\u2019d never be indiscreet. That would mean breaking the rules. Something you don\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I always win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past you\u2019ve won without breaking the rules. Something tells me that this time is different. Be careful, Nic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he promised as they walked to the door.</p><p>They both knew he was lying, but Maggie wouldn\u2019t say anything. Had Brenna been privy to the conversation, she would have called him on it in a heartbeat. Of course if she knew about his plans for Marcelli Wines, she would have his head mounted on the fence dividing their property.</p><p>Not something he wanted to think about. He would be fine just as long as Brenna didn\u2019t find out the truth until it was too late to stop him.</p><p>It had been a good night\u2019s work, Brenna thought sometime after midnight as she watched the last of the grapes move from the crusher to the presser. Her second load of Chardonnay grapes had arrived on time. The quality had been everything she\u2019d hoped for\u2014each bunch had been ripe and bursting with flavor and juice. She\u2019d managed to put her latest fight with her grandfather behind her. She refused to think about him or her brother showing up and claiming everything. Even better, she was only thinking of Nic every forty-eight seconds, a marked improvement from earlier in the week. In a day or two she might work up to ten whole Nic-free minutes at a time.</p><p>It was that damn kiss, she acknowledged. He was too sexy by half. If that hadn\u2019t happened, she might have been able to convince herself that whatever she remembered from the past was simply time rewriting history. She could have convinced herself that no one was that good. Unfortunately reality had been better than her memories. She\u2019d gone from zero to take-me-now in less than five seconds. Just her luck\u2014she was hotter than a Ferrari.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll get over it,\u201d she told herself, stepping back from the presser.</p><p>She would have to. She and Nic were all about the past and that was a place neither of them was likely to want to go. Her life was here in the present.</p><p>She crossed to the open doors and breathed in the cool air. She could hear crickets and other night creatures. The sky was clear and it seemed as if she could almost reach up and grab a star or two. Would it grant her a wish if she promised to set it free? What would she wish for?</p><p>Brenna returned to her equipment. Not success, that was too easy. Not love. She might be alone right now, but she wasn\u2019t lonely. Peace, she thought. Or maybe contentment.</p><p>Before she could decide, she heard a fast, clicking sound, followed by a yip and a slide. She glanced at the open door and saw Max slipping around the corner before loping into the big room. He looked around, saw her, and barked with delight.</p><p>Brenna barely had time to brace herself for the fact that where Max was, Nic was soon to follow, when the puppy plowed into her. She laughed and bent down to gather him into her arms. He wiggled and licked at her face, his whole body vibrating as his tail wagged so hard it went in circles.</p><p>\u201cHey, good-looking,\u201d she said, holding the puppy close.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>She had to swallow before looking up to watch Nic enter. She hadn\u2019t seen him in a few days, and she hated that she\u2019d actually missed him. He wore his usual uniform of jeans and T-shirt, which managed to emphasize his broad shoulders and long legs. Every cell in her body went on alert, while a small biplane flew through her brain, dragging a banner behind that read \u201cI want some more of that.\u201d</p><p>Honest to Pete, she really had to get a grip.</p><p>\u201cActually I wasn\u2019t talking to you,\u201d she said. \u201cMax and I were having a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat dog has quite the life.\u201d</p><p>She set the puppy on the ground. When Max went off to investigate exciting smells, Brenna tried to keep her attention off of Nic\u2019s mouth. Was it her imagination or could she actually see the sparks arcing between them? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked, moving closer to the presser.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help grinning. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s going great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cModest as ever.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fourth night you\u2019ve worked late. Have you been getting any sleep at all?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed how many nights she\u2019d been here? She told herself not to read anything into the comment. Nor would she allow herself to think about how he\u2019d circled around the equipment to stand fairly close to her. The sparks continued to arc, but she was determined to ignore them, too. If Nic was going to pretend nothing had happened, she could pretend five times better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting by on an hour or two. This is my last batch of Chardonnay. Then I get a break until the Pinot comes in, then the Cabernet.\u201d</p><p>Max trotted by, heading for a dark and puppy-appealing corner. \u201cHe\u2019s up late,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI was doing some paperwork. I like to walk him before I head up to bed.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the b word. It took her a second to clear her brain of the erotic images that had instantly popped up. She and Nic had mostly made love in nontraditional places, but they\u2019d done it in bed just enough for her memory to provide the appropriate erotic slide show.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d be a lousy dog owner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help chuckling. \u201cOkay, maybe I was a little concerned that you weren\u2019t ready for the responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this where I remind you I run Wild Sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness and puppies are very different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. The business has never chewed my shoes.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling at her. Despite the attraction and the yet-to-be-discussed kiss, she felt some of her tension ease. Why was it that being around Nic always felt so right?</p><p>On second thought, she didn\u2019t want an answer to that.</p><p>He jerked his head toward the vat. The first of the juice spilled into the big stainless-steel container. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He collected a plastic cup from the bag she\u2019d left on the floor and held it under the stream. To the untrained palate, the liquid would be little more than intense grape juice, but Nic would taste the subtleties and the possibilities.</p><p>He sipped, frowned, and sipped again. Then he looked at her and swore. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe grapes are from three different vineyards. Instead of getting one delivery from each location, I arranged for five smaller deliveries. I\u2019ve coordinated so I get grapes from all three locations on the same day. It cost a little more, but I\u2019ve been able to blend from the crushing stage instead of later in the process. The different grapes are already working on each other. Isn\u2019t it the best?\u201d</p><p>He took another sip. \u201cHow did you pick the grapes?\u201d</p><p>She explained how she\u2019d spent a lot of the past couple of months driving around the valley, figuring out what vineyards got what kind of sun.</p><p>\u201cI might have snuck on and tasted a grape or two over the past month,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThen I placed my order. My quantities were small enough that even people who don\u2019t usually sell were willing to give me a ton or two. Including one of your foremen.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re using Wild Sea grapes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few of your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to feel smug, but it was difficult. \u201cYou have all the raw material, Nic. You need to use it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Want a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have one, but if things change, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t seriously offering her employment, but it was nice to know she\u2019d impressed him.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re hot shit,\u201d he complained. \u201cThis is like the time you lectured me on the quality of the oak we were using for our wines. You were what, sixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. You can\u2019t go cheap if you\u2019re going to ferment in wood. It would be better to go straight to stainless.\u201d</p><p>He finished the juice and tossed the cup in the trash. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to know I listened. Thanks to you I made a lot of changes here at Wild Sea.\u201d</p><p>She appreciated knowing that. \u201cIf only I could say the same thing about my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Nic crossed to one of the chairs and pulled it out. Brenna sat down and he settled across from her.</p><p>\u201cIs Lorenzo still making things difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifficult being an understatement. We\u2019re arguing about everything. First he complains that the labels are too old-fashioned. We need something new. I happen to agree with him\u2014in fact, I\u2019ve been bugging him about it for a while. So I get new labels designed. Suddenly he says there\u2019s nothing wrong with the old labels, we shouldn\u2019t change anything, yada, yada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he forget? Is this an age thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a make-Brenna-crazy thing. He\u2019s always been a curmudgeon, but it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been. He\u2019s on my case about everything. Now he\u2019s talking about my brother. \u2018Joe would listen to me about the old ways,\u2019\u201d she said, lowering her voice to sound more like Lorenzo\u2019s. \u201cI always knew having a brother show up didn\u2019t help my case, but I guess...\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and looked at him. \u201cJoe inheriting is more real to me now. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Nic\u2019s expression tightened. \u201cAt least if he inherits, it will stay in the family. It beats Lorenzo selling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by much. I can\u2019t believe he would leave everything to a virtual stranger. That would kill me. I would almost rather he sold.\u201d She tried to smile. \u201cI guess you would, too. That way I would inherit cash instead of a piece of the winery and I could pay you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d</p><p>Must be nice not to worry about a million dollars, she thought wistfully. She suddenly had a thought.</p><p>\u201cYou could afford to buy Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>Nic raised his eyebrows. \u201cWas that an invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My grandfather would never sell to you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cCrazy. I know you wouldn\u2019t try to buy Marcelli, but who else would? Never mind. I don\u2019t want to think about it. Everything is so complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang tough,\u201d Nic told her. \u201cIt will get better. You\u2019ve always been important to your grandfather. He\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stiffened and leaned back in her chair, instantly wary. Her family wasn\u2019t exactly a safe topic of conversation.</p><p>Nic held up his hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cI meant that in a good way. You two used to argue, but in a lot of ways you\u2019re the granddaughter closest to him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI guess I still am. I know some of the problem is that I moved away.\u201d She hesitated, not wanting to start down that path, either. For people who hadn\u2019t seen each other in years, she and Nic sure had a lot of things they couldn\u2019t talk about.</p><p>\u201cWas your grandfather angry about the divorce?\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know what to say. Talking about her marriage to Jeff\u2014even the dissolution of the marriage\u2014felt very twisted.</p><p>Nic shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer that if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d She didn\u2019t. Not exactly. \u201cMy grandfather was pretty cool about the whole thing. The whole family was. Everyone claimed to adore Jeff right up until he asked for a divorce, then suddenly they all claimed to have hated him from the beginning. I know they were rewriting history to make me feel better, but I didn\u2019t care. Besides, it worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good Italian family like yours. I\u2019m surprised no one offered to take him out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI never thought of that. You\u2019re right. They should have.\u201d</p><p>The night seemed very quiet now. Brenna wasn\u2019t sure why Nic had shown up tonight or why they were talking about her divorce, but she didn\u2019t want to break the spell by asking. Sitting here like this felt really good. Awareness kept her blood zipping through her body in a way that made her feel alive and breathless. While a foolish part of her wanted a repeat of the kiss they\u2019d shared before, the sensible side was grateful for something as uncomplicated as conversation.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do feel about your ex now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shifted in her chair, slightly less grateful for uncomplicated conversation. He wanted to talk about Jeff? What did that mean?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to answer the question,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cAre you still mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was angry and bitter for a while, but that got old. I still resent that I worked my butt off at jobs I hated to put him through medical school. I paid the bills for him to become a doctor and then he left. It\u2019s never fun being a clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Nic stared at her. Something flickered in his dark eyes, but she didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not rich?\u201d</p><p>The question hit her like a slap. Logically she knew she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but she was. After all this time did he really think she\u2019d done what she\u2019d done for money?</p><p>\u201cJeff was dirt poor. I never married him for his fortune.\u201d</p><p>She waited for Nic to ask why she had married him, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWas there someone else?\u201d he asked instead.</p><p>\u201cFor him, yes. In fact he\u2019s marrying her as soon as our divorce is final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with that?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no longer fantasizing about him contracting a disease that makes his privates fall off, which I think makes me a broad-minded and mature individual. It\u2019s not exactly the same as wishing him well. Most of the time I don\u2019t think about him. I regret marrying him, but I can\u2019t change the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce can be a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Not the reaction she\u2019d been hoping for. She\u2019d thought maybe Nic would express his feelings about the past...namely theirs. Eventually they were going to have to talk about what happened. Just not tonight. She was dealing with too much already.</p><p>\u201cYou never married,\u201d she said, then realized how he could take the question and hoped he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Nic raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to explain that she hadn\u2019t meant to imply anything by her question. It wasn\u2019t as if his decision not to marry had anything to do with her. Although now that they were talking about the subject, she really wanted to know why he hadn\u2019t picked up a wife somewhere along the way. It couldn\u2019t have been due to lack of female interest.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t brave enough to ask and he didn\u2019t offer. Instead he sat there looking both relaxed and dangerous, which was quite the trick.</p><p>The tension returned. She fought against the urge to throw herself at him, and he...well, she didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.</p><p>Obviously not about their kiss, she realized when he looked at his watch and said he had to be getting back.</p><p>\u201cMax needs his beauty sleep,\u201d he told her as he stood.</p><p>She rose and looked around for the puppy. Max had curled up on her jacket in the corner. Nic walked over and scooped him up. Max barely stirred.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Nic said, jerking his head toward the vat. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you promised me a couple of cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it was just one case, but I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he headed for the door.</p><p>Nic was that irresistible combination of dangerous and sexy. The sleeping puppy in his arms only added to his charms. Sexual predator and nice guy. Women had sold their souls for a whole lot less.</p><p>Brenna liked to think that she was smart enough to have learned from her past mistakes. Falling for Nic all those years ago had only complicated her life. Falling for him now would mean she hadn\u2019t learned anything. The problems they\u2019d had before still existed, along with a couple dozen more. Nope, the best course of action was a business-only relationship. Nothing personal, nothing intimate. Nothing stupid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unfortunately, where Nic was concerned, she\u2019d never once done the right thing.</p><p>8</p><p>Brenna was so tired, her eyelashes hurt. But it had been worth it, she reminded herself as she opened the back door and stepped into the hacienda.</p> <p>Three days ago she\u2019d been offered some premium Chardonnay grapes that were normally never available for sale. It had meant working the better part of a week from dusk until dawn, which also meant little or no sleep for her. But now that the work was done, she could walk into the fermenting room and see all the gallons of wine she was going to produce. Four Sisters Winery would open with a bang.</p><p>The downside was she only had a couple of days until the Pinot grapes were ready, so if she wanted to sleep, this was her day. She\u2019d managed to duck out of the Marcelli Wines office early. Now all that lay between her and fifteen blissful hours in her bed was the distance of the house.</p><p>She crossed the kitchen, then came to a stop when she heard voices in the living room. She recognized the Grands, her mother, and her sisters. There was also a less familiar voice belonging to Francesca\u2019s soon-to-be stepdaughter.</p><p>Brenna hesitated. While she adored Kelly, she really, really needed to get some sleep.</p><p>There was a low murmur of voices followed by loud laughter.</p> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d Brenna muttered, walking toward the sounds. She was a sucker for her family.</p><p>\u201cHi, all,\u201d she said as she entered the living room.</p><p>Everyone looked up and called out a greeting.</p><p>The women were sewing, beading lace for Katie\u2019s and Francesca\u2019s wedding gowns. It was slow, meticulous work that made Brenna\u2019s hands cramp.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to help,\u201d Katie said holding up a lace rose.</p><p>\u201cI would love to except I\u2019m really busy right now. You know, with extra work.\u201d</p> <p>She emphasized the last two words, hoping her sister would get it. Katie wasn\u2019t slow-witted, so she must have chosen to ignore the hint. Instead of giving Brenna a break, she simply batted her eyes and said, \u201cCome bond. You know you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, stay, Brenna,\u201d twelve-year-old Kelly said.</p><p>Brenna could have blown off her sister, but she had a harder time refusing Kelly. Grumbling under her breath that this was her own fault for not slipping up the stairs when she had the chance, she sighed heavily and crossed to the large coffee table. She chose a piece of lace from the pile there, and collected a bag of beads. Katie passed over needles, and Kelly shifted to make room for her on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d Brenna asked the girl.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and the Grands are discussing menus, but Katie and Francesca aren\u2019t saying what they want, which is making everybody else crazy. Not me. I don\u2019t care, but I think Grandma Tessa is getting a twitch.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at her grandmother, who was deep in conversation with Francesca. \u201cWhy is the menu changing?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned and her green eyes sparkled with humor. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s just, like, food, right?\u201d</p><p>Brenna pulled one of her curls. \u201cYou are so not, like, Italian.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly giggled.</p><p>\u201cSo are you excited about school starting in a few weeks?\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so totally not. Although my dad said I can have a lot of new clothes because I finally convinced him that styles are completely different here on the West Coast. Francesca helped. She told him it wouldn\u2019t be good for my self-esteem to look like a geek.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cDo we still use the word geek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys do, because you\u2019re, well, old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, brat.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Brenna. It\u2019s just you guys haven\u2019t been in school for a while. You can\u2019t know what\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019ll accept. You\u2019re going to have to be the one to keep us informed of the coolness factor.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cI can do that. Francesca\u2019s wedding dress is really beautiful. Have you seen the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cGive it up, Sis.\u201d</p><p>Francesca passed over a photo torn out of a bride\u2019s magazine. Brenna studied the elegant gown and knew that her twin would look stunning.</p><p>\u201cI tried to get her to wear my dress,\u201d Mia said. She shifted and tucked her legs under her. \u201cBut she said it was too fitted at the waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we could take it out,\u201d Katie added. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that would mess up the lines.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her head. \u201cEven if we could do it, I don\u2019t want to wear Mia\u2019s dress. It\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>Mia raised her eyebrows. \u201cIs that a statement about my taste? Because if it is, I\u2019m going to remind you that I\u2019m only eighteen and I\u2019m still in college, so by Kelly\u2019s standards, I\u2019m the queen of cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you\u2019re the queen of is annoying,\u201d Brenna said mildly.</p><p>Mia stuck out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s mature,\u201d Katie said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Francesca smiled. \u201cMia, your dress is beautiful, but it wouldn\u2019t look nearly as nice on me as it did on you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly bounced on the sofa. \u201cMia, I never saw your dress. Do you still have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Mia started to put down her lace, but Katie, Brenna, and Francesca all glared at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Francesca warned.</p><p>Mia grinned at Kelly. \u201cWe\u2019ll sneak upstairs later, when the wardens are sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded happily.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the menu?\u201d Grandma Tessa asked. \u201cWe have to decide on what we\u2019re eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about burgers?\u201d Brenna offered.</p><p>Even her mother frowned at her for that one.</p><p>Brenna held up one hand. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me. I was just kidding. Are you serious about changing the menu just because it\u2019s going to be a double wedding?\u201d</p><p>Her mother frowned. \u201cThis isn\u2019t for the wedding, dear. This is for the engagement party.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at her two engaged sisters. \u201cYou\u2019re having an engagement party? When was this decided?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of nights ago,\u201d Katie said. \u201cYou were otherwise occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo people still do that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Grandma Tessa said firmly.</p><p>\u201cIt was Katie\u2019s idea,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>Katie sighed. \u201cYou are so lying. It was your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were both wantin\u2019 a special celebration,\u201d Grammy M said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fine idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be bringing Grandpa Gabriel?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Grammy M shrugged as if it didn\u2019t much matter, but there was a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. Her seventy-something grandmother had found romance with Francesca\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s grandfather. The two seniors were forever sneaking out to dinner together and had even planned a cruise in the fall. Grandma Tessa claimed to be appalled that they would share a room without the benefit of a priest blessing the union, but Grammy M simply said that she was too old for sex outside of marriage to be considered a sin. Brenna was thrilled to know that she came from a gene pool that was still interested in the wild thing far into the December years.</p><p>\u201cWe want something fairly casual,\u201d Katie said. \u201cMaybe a buffet outside with white lights strung all over. Just family and good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds nice,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>She looked at her sister as she spoke and saw Katie was watching her carefully. She turned her attention to Francesca. Her twin\u2019s expression matched Katie\u2019s. She could tell they were once again caught up in \u201cpoor Brenna not having a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Grammy M said fondly. \u201cWhy would you be otherwise?\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head. How could she convince her sisters that she was completely happy for them? She couldn\u2019t be more happy. As for wanting a relationship for herself...right now her schedule didn\u2019t allow for a lot of boy-girl time. She was too busy trying to make her dreams come true. Besides, as long as Nic showed up every couple of days and made her toes curls, she didn\u2019t actually need the real thing. Fantasizing about him was about twenty times better than any reality with a guy she was likely to meet.</p><p>Nope, right now single felt exactly right. Well, except for missing sex.</p><p>Three days later Brenna parked in her usual spot at Wild Sea and headed in to check on her wines. Amazingly enough, it was still daylight. Her nonnocturnal visit was due to yet another argument with her grandfather, this one about what wines they were serving at a tasting dinner for the Marcelli distributors in town for a promotional weekend. After asking her opinion, her grandfather had detailed what he thought was wrong with every one of her choices. Rather than throw a temper tantrum\u2014which had been her first choice\u2014she\u2019d made a graceful exit and ended up here.</p><p>She crossed to what she\u2019d begun to think of as \u201cher building\u201d and stepped inside.</p><p>Instantly the scent of fermentation assaulted her. Brenna inhaled deeply, savoring the changes from yesterday, knowing tomorrow would be different, too. The subtle alterations told her things were going well.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock. Brenna?\u201d</p><p>Brenna turned and saw a woman entering the building. Her guest was tall, with thick auburn hair and a model-perfect face. Brenna didn\u2019t know if she should be more bitter about that or the woman\u2019s slender body. Just being in the same room with her made her feel short and lumpy.</p><p>She tried reminding herself that while she couldn\u2019t be considered tall, except by the vertically challenged like Mia, she was of average height. If she wanted to be less lumpy, she would have to stop eating the Grands\u2019 cooking.</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d Brenna asked as the woman approached.</p><p>The woman smiled and held out her hand. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been introduced, but I know who you are. I\u2019m Maggie Moore, the chief financial officer for Wild Sea. I work for Nic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Brenna said, fighting a sudden blast of jealousy. How like Nic to hire a beautiful woman in a job traditionally held by men.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for him, he\u2019s not here,\u201d she said.</p><p>Maggie smiled. \u201cActually I was looking for you. I wanted to meet the infamous Brenna Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m infamous?\u201d Brenna asked. \u201cGee, no one sent me a memo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure the title extends past my office. I handle the finances for Wild Sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of guessed that by your job description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about the loan.\u201d</p><p>Now Brenna was really confused. \u201cThat was a private loan. I didn\u2019t borrow the money from the corporation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. But even Nic doesn\u2019t happen to have a million dollars in his checking account. Once he decided how he wanted to structure the deal, he had me draw up the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>Brenna wasn\u2019t sure why she needed to know this. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Maggie\u2019s smile was friendly. \u201cLike I said, I just wanted to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>Brenna wondered what Nic might have told this woman about her. Somehow she couldn\u2019t see him spilling his guts about the past, but then, she\u2019d been wrong before. Was Maggie more than just an employee?</p><p>As soon as she asked the question, she realized it wasn\u2019t likely. For one thing, Nic wouldn\u2019t have kissed her the way he had if he\u2019d been involved with someone else. For another, a quick glance at Maggie\u2019s left hand told her that the woman was married.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you worked at Wild Sea?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost nine years.\u201d Maggie grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad because even though I\u2019m around all this wonderful wine, I don\u2019t really drink it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brenna chuckled. \u201cDoes Nic know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it really bugs him. He tried to teach me about different wines once, but I kept nodding off during his explanations.\u201d She pointed at one of the vats. \u201cWhich explains why I have to ask what you\u2019re doing in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking Chardonnay,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI\u2019m fermenting a portion in oak and the rest in stainless steel. The stainless allows for easier temperature control. Barrel fermenting is more expensive, but it allows me to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She broke off and shrugged. \u201cSorry. I get a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. I\u2019m impressed by your enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is important to me. I\u2019ve wanted the chance to run things my way, and now I finally have it. I plan to take all the credit, but I\u2019m also putting myself on the line to take all of the blame if things go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Wine making is as much art as it is science. I pay attention to both.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cMost do. But once a winery gets big, it\u2019s difficult to be intimately involved in every step. That isn\u2019t going to happen here.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stopped again and sighed. \u201cI did it again.\u201d</p><p>Maggie shook her head. \u201cI can see your determination in your eyes. The only thing I\u2019ve ever felt so passionately about is my daughter.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThat sounds horrible. I love my husband completely. He\u2019s wonderful, but it\u2019s not the same as loving my child. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Maggie glanced at her watch. \u201cSpeaking of Annie, I have to head home so I can spend the evening with her. Daddy has to work late, so it\u2019s girls\u2019 night at home.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cIt was great to meet you, Brenna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Brenna said, shaking hands.</p><p>She watched Maggie leave. What on earth had that been about? If she didn\u2019t know better, she would say that Nic\u2019s CFO had been checking her out. But why? He\u2019d already given her the loan. Maggie couldn\u2019t stop what had already happened.</p><p>\u201cNot that it matters,\u201d she told herself. But it was curious.</p><p>Was it wrong to love a grape? Brenna hoped not, because she had a serious case of hero worship for her Pinots.</p><p>She stood just off a gravel road, on the edge of her perfectly wonderful four acres. To the west stretched the Pacific Ocean for as far as the eye could see. To the east were the foothills, and tucked in between was paradise.</p><p>She knew there were those who thought that land this incredible would be wasted on something like grapes when dozens of million-dollar homes could have been built here, but Brenna considered those kind of people not only shortsighted but lacking a soul.</p><p>She crouched down by a mature vine and studied the well-shaped clusters.</p><p>Did it get any better than this? The grapes had ripened evenly. They were plump and rich in color. She could smell the promise of their flavor, and when she picked a single grape and bit into it, she actually moaned. Another day, maybe two, and then they would be ready to pick. She was going to kick butt with this harvest.</p> <p>As she stood, she heard something in the distance. She recognized the rumble of a motorcycle, but even as her body went on alert and her thighs heated, she told herself that hundreds of people rode motorcycles on this narrow coastal road and that she was a fool if she allowed herself to think it might be Nic. It was the middle of harvest, for heaven\u2019s sake. The man had better things to do than ride up like some leather-clad sex god just to jump-start her motor.</p><p>Unfortunately the thought of him got her heart pounding the way it did those rare afternoons she dragged her ample backside to aerobics class. Did that mean being around him constituted an actual workout? Could she start the next exercise craze? The Nic Giovanni workout plan? Think about sex with Nic for twenty minutes a day and lose ten pounds a month? If only. All she got from thinking about Nic was unbearably horny.</p><p>She told herself to stop staring at the road and pay attention to the grapes she\u2019d come to admire, but she couldn\u2019t make herself turn away until she\u2019d actually watched the non-Nic person ride by. Maybe she would even wave.</p><p>The motorcycle rounded the bend and she was able to see the driver. The helmet did nothing to disguise the rider\u2019s familiar features. Okay, so it was Nic. That didn\u2019t mean he was going to stop...did it?</p><p>Before she could decide, he pulled up behind her car and turned off the engine. The sound of the waves was audible again, along with the call of the seagulls. Brenna told herself that she should take this opportunity to be one with nature. Instead she watched as he took off his helmet. Sunlight brought out the brown highlights in his dark hair and emphasized his tanned arms. He looked as if he\u2019d walked out of a movie poster for a 1950s bad-boy movie. White T-shirt, black jeans, motorcycle boots. Where was a poodle skirt when you needed one?</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d be here,\u201d he said as he set his helmet on the seat and started toward her. \u201cEscrow closed today and I knew you couldn\u2019t resist gloating over your purchase.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d come looking for her? Wow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit to having a moment or two with my grapes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow are they?\u201d</p><p>She waved out a hand. \u201cTake a look. You\u2019ll kick yourself for thinking the lot was too small to bother with.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows, then turned his attention to the tidy rows of grapevines. He walked in a couple of paces, then crouched to examine the grapes.</p><p>It was close to sunset. Rather than stare at Nic, or his spectacular behind, she turned her attention to the western horizon, where the sun sank toward the edge of the sea. Already the heat of the day had faded from this patch of land.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Nic admitted when he walked over to stand next to her. \u201cThey\u2019re nearly ripe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot perfect. Did you see the color? How plump they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky. I don\u2019t understand why they sold this land to you for pennies when they could have gotten millions from a developer.\u201d</p><p>Brenna hadn\u2019t paid pennies; buying these four acres had taken a chunk of her loan, but she also knew that she\u2019d gotten an amazing deal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the wine. They didn\u2019t want this land to become another exclusive development community. I had to promise to only grow grapes on this land for at least ten years.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. You had to promise?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs it in writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ll keep my word. They understood what I was trying to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re not, they should be.\u201d</p><p>Brenna tried not to smile, but she couldn\u2019t help grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re such a businessman. Pragmatic, unfeeling, only interested in the bottom line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. And you\u2019re the wine-making genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to pretend you were serious and offering me a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d</p><p>Nic watched the breeze tug at Brenna\u2019s hair. The shoulder-length style was different from the waist-length hair she\u2019d had as a teenager. While he liked them both, the longer hair was more erotic. There had been plenty of times when he\u2019d felt the silky ends trailing down his belly as she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>He consciously slammed the door to that particular memory. Instead he searched for a distraction. When he found it, he had a hard time keeping his face straight as he anticipated the explosion.</p><p>\u201cToo bad the rows are so close together,\u201d he said casually. \u201cIf they were farther apart, you wouldn\u2019t have to pick the grapes by hand.\u201d</p><p>As he expected, Brenna turned on him with all the intensity of a mama bear protecting her only cub.</p><p>\u201cThere is absolutely no way in hell I would let a machine on this land. I know you\u2019re in favor of anything that saves money, but I\u2019m more interested in getting it right than getting it cheap.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed fire as she spoke. She planted her hands on her hips, glaring at him as if he\u2019d just spit on her shoes. She was insulted, ill-tempered, and more than ready to take him on. Damn if she didn\u2019t look sexy as hell.</p><p>The more she glared, the more his blood heated. He thought about pulling her close and kissing her, but the last time he\u2019d done that, he hadn\u2019t been able to sleep for two days. The wanting had been relentless. Worse, it had been specific. He hadn\u2019t been interested in finding someone else to scratch his itch. For reasons he didn\u2019t understand, the need had only been about Brenna, not just about getting laid.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to get them picked in time?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had time to line up a crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling in a few favors. I\u2019ll do some of the work myself. It will get done.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t doubt that. Brenna was nothing if not determined.</p><p>Some of the annoyance faded from her expression. She dropped her hands to her sides and tilted her head. \u201cGuess who I met the other day?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour CFO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you run into Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ran into me. She said she wanted to put a face to the name.\u201d</p><p>So Maggie had kept her word about meeting Brenna. Had she gotten her questions answered? \u201cMaggie was impressed by the amount of money I loaned you. I\u2019m not usually such a soft touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what it\u2019s called?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any complaints?\u201d</p><p>She considered the question. \u201cCan I get back to you on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the setting sun and knew that he should be heading back home. He had books to go over and a meeting with one of his managers. But he found himself reluctant to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still working on my great-grandmother\u2019s diary,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spend more time looking up words in the dictionary than translating, but I\u2019m making progress.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cI could have it all wrong, but from what I can figure out, Sophia was in love with Antonio Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at him. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too, but it\u2019s all there in the diary. There\u2019s some mention of Antonio leaving for America and how much she missed him. He told her he would be back for her and asked her to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Brenna frowned. \u201cThen how did she end up married to Salvatore, and why didn\u2019t she marry Antonio and come here with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t get back in time. The Marcelli family wasn\u2019t as respected as the Giovanni family, which is why her father was reluctant to let her marry Antonio and go off with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I lie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you thought it would bug me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cAll right, but this time I\u2019m not. She waited for Antonio to return for her, but he didn\u2019t. When Salvatore came back, talking about his success and asking for Sophia\u2019s hand in marriage, her father agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t consulted?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Brenna rolled her eyes. \u201cThat is just so typical. Let me guess. They got married and Antonio showed up the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about. She tried to put off the wedding, but her parents wouldn\u2019t let her. The night before her wedding, she vowed to put her love for Antonio behind her and swore she would be a good wife.\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cI never heard about any of this. Do you think Sophia is the reason for the feud? Did the two friends fight about loving her or something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that. Sophia and Salvatore married in the late 1920s. Salvatore and Antonio went to Europe during the Second World War to collect the European cuttings. They grew fine for a couple of years before the Marcelli vines died out and Antonio accused Salvatore of destroying them. Who would wait over fifteen years for revenge? From what I\u2019ve heard about my great-grandfather, Salvatore wasn\u2019t the patient type. If he\u2019d suspected something, he would have taken care of business a whole lot earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Still, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d Brenna looked at him. \u201cI wonder what would have happened if Antonio had married Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us would have existed.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cFamilies are so complicated. My grandfather is getting completely weird on me. Your parents walked out when you were still a kid and\u2014\u201d She pressed her lips together. \u201cSorry. I know you don\u2019t like to talk about your folks.\u201d</p><p>He swore. Once, years ago, he\u2019d made the mistake of telling what had happened with his parents. He\u2019d admitted his ambivalence. How he\u2019d refused to miss them, yet couldn\u2019t help wondering what would have been different if they\u2019d stuck around. Brenna had understood. She\u2019d held him and somehow being in her arms had eased the confusion. He\u2019d trusted her. Not a smart move, considering what had happened later.</p><p>Silence stretched between them. Nic glanced at his watch. He was going to be late for his meeting. He should\u2014</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you Francesca and Katie are having a double wedding?\u201d Brenna asked in what he guessed was an attempt to change the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over Thanksgiving. Things should be interesting, what with Francesca being pregnant and all. At least we know she and Sam are a fertile couple. Anyway, because that\u2019s not enough work, they\u2019re having a double engagement party, too. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m afraid to walk into the house. If everyone isn\u2019t knee-deep in beading lace, there are tastings for various menu selections and arguments about invitations. I think they should just elope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it. I work all day for my grandfather and then all night on my new business. I\u2019m exhausted, which means when I bead lace for the wedding gowns everyone is making, I end up sticking myself. It\u2019s not fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m awake for it.\u201d</p><p>She shoved her hands into her back pockets, which made her chest stick out. He tried not to notice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the family stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s really twisted, but it\u2019s a part of who I am. I can\u2019t seem to escape it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p> <p>She winced. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I can see that very little has changed.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>It had always been true. Family was the most important thing in Brenna\u2019s life. He would bet that wasn\u2019t different. In fact, to prove it, if only to himself, he would conduct an experiment to see exactly how far he could push her before she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking anyone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs in a date?\u201d She laughed. \u201cThat would require a social life, which I don\u2019t have. Not that I\u2019m complaining. I would rather have the beginnings of a winery than a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn behalf of my gender, thanks for the compliment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He did, but that wasn\u2019t important. \u201cIf you\u2019re not seeing anyone, then you could invite me.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Invite Nic? Brenna blinked several times. Invite Nic? Sure. Of course. She didn\u2019t have a date and he was available. It was the perfect solution.</p><p>Not.</p><p>Take Nic? A Giovanni? Great-grandson of the hated Salvatore Giovanni? She stared at him, unable to think of a single thing to say. He couldn\u2019t be serious. He had to know that it was impossible. He had to remember\u2014</p><p>She sucked in a breath. Of course he remembered and maybe that was the point. All those years ago she had been so worried about what her family would think if they knew she was involved with Nic. He\u2019d wanted her to tell them, to declare her feelings for him. She\u2019d wanted that, too\u2014sort of. But she\u2019d been afraid of what they would say. Of what would happen. The reality had terrified her.</p><p>It might have been ten years, but she could still feel that cold fear swirling in her stomach.</p><p>The humor faded from Nic\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I was kidding.\u201d</p><p>Was he? She still didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a really big party,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cJust family and friends.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. That had certainly made things all better. What? If there were going to be a lot of strangers there, she would be more comfortable inviting him?</p><p>She reached out to touch his arm. \u201cNic, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Whatever.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019m late for a meeting.\u201d He jerked his head toward the grapes. \u201cCongratulations. You picked a winner.\u201d</p><p>He walked to his motorcycle and pulled on his helmet. Before she could think of a single rational, intelligent explanation for how she was acting, he was gone.</p><p>\u201cThat went well,\u201d she muttered and kicked at the dirt.</p><p>What was going on here? Was Nic actually serious about going to the party with her? They weren\u2019t seeing each other\u2014not in the dating sense. She wasn\u2019t sure she would even categorize their relationship as \u201cfriendship.\u201d They had business dealings and more sexual chemistry than should be legal, but little else. She sighed. Okay, they had a past that would make a soap-opera writer jealous, but no one was talking about that.</p><p>She turned toward the road and stared at the bend where Nic had disappeared. Telling herself to forget the whole thing wasn\u2019t going to work, mostly because she found herself wanting to take him to the party.</p><p>How strange was that? Did she think that one family social event would make up for all she\u2019d done\u2014or not done\u2014in the past?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>She crossed to her car and pulled open the door. If she didn\u2019t know better she would have sworn he\u2019d been playing with her when he\u2019d first mentioned going to the party, but something had changed. It was almost as if her inability to say yes had hurt him.</p><p>No way. Nic hurt by her? Now? Right.</p><p>Except he\u2019d almost looked...wounded.</p><p>She slid into her car and pulled the door shut. What was going on? Were they both experiencing flashbacks? Were the blasts from the past confusing an already complicated situation?</p><p>Until she and Nic had met up again, she had believed with every fiber of her being that she was long over him. That what they\u2019d once had didn\u2019t matter. After close contact of the Nic kind, she knew better. There were some things that simply didn\u2019t go away, regardless of the passage of time. Those life-altering moments lingered, and Lord knew that every second with Nic had changed her life.</p><p>Talk about a complication. If only she could forget the past, things would be a lot easier between them. Forgetting Nic would be\u2014</p><p>Impossible, she thought. Even if it was smart, she didn\u2019t want to. She liked that they\u2019d been young and in love. She liked that he had been her first time. She liked remembering how his hands had trembled when he\u2019d undressed her and how his dark eyes had promised to make everything perfect between them.</p><p>And he had. He\u2019d been tender and caring. She could still see the expression on his face as he\u2019d entered her. He\u2019d been much more experienced, but he\u2019d lost it in about thirty seconds after declaring it had never been like that for him before.</p><p>She remembered the first time he\u2019d told her he loved her. They\u2019d been sitting out in the vineyards on a warm summer night. The stars had bathed them with a soft, sparkly light as they\u2019d made love on an old blanket. Afterward, Nic had pulled her to her feet. They\u2019d both still been naked and she\u2019d shivered a little. He\u2019d touched her face, her shoulders, her breasts, and had kissed each of her palms. Then he\u2019d placed her hand on his chest, right over his heart.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Brenna,\u201d he said, his expression intense, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time, but I wanted to wait until the perfect moment. I\u2019ll love you forever. With my heart, my mind, and my body.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d started to cry and he\u2019d held her. Finally she\u2019d managed to whisper that she loved him, too. For always. At seventeen, eternity had seemed possible.</p><p>Brenna turned off the coastal road and headed back for the hacienda. She had to blink against the burning in her eyes as she recalled Nic leaving to go back to college. She\u2019d done her best to be brave. He\u2019d been so sensible, promising that he would love her but saying he wasn\u2019t going to tie her down. He wanted her to enjoy her senior year of high school.</p><p>She\u2019d known what he\u2019d meant. She\u2019d been free to date other guys, none of whom had interested her. How could they? She was in love with Nic.</p><p>The year had crawled by. They\u2019d managed to steal a few hours together over Christmas, but nothing after that. He\u2019d been working and unable to get away more. Brenna had been so afraid he wouldn\u2019t still love her come the summer. They\u2019d met out in the vineyards, at a prearranged time. She\u2019d practiced acting casual in case he told her he didn\u2019t love her anymore.</p><p>They\u2019d taken one look at each other and they\u2019d known. It was as if the time apart had been seconds instead of months. Looking at Nic was like falling into the sun. Their reunion had been one of her life\u2019s perfect moments.</p><p>There had been so many. Nights and mornings. Conversations, quiet times, laughter, and even tears. There had never been anyone like him for her. Jeff had never come close.</p><p>Brenna pulled under the arch at the entrance to the Marcelli lands. Her grip tightened on the steering wheel. She could still see the diamond ring he\u2019d slid onto her finger.</p><p>Marriage and children. She could have had that with Nic. She could have had it all. Brenna thought about Kelly, Francesca\u2019s soon-to-be stepdaughter. If she\u2019d accepted Nic\u2019s proposal, she would have children of her own now. They would be a family. Instead she\u2019d married Jeff.</p><p>She parked her car and slowly climbed out. Her body ached, as if she\u2019d just fallen down a mountain. It was always that way when she allowed herself to revisit the past for too long. Regrets, what-if s, could-have-been s. They flung sharp weapons that cut her heart and burned her soul.</p><p>Ten years ago she\u2019d made the safe and easy choice, and she\u2019d been paying for it ever since. She\u2019d walked away from her heart\u2019s desire because she\u2019d been afraid of what it would cost. Never again. That was why she\u2019d wanted to start the winery\u2014to prove to herself that she\u2019d learned her lesson. Nothing was ever going to stand in the way of her dreams again.</p><p>A nice sentiment, but it had little to do with the problem at hand. Had Nic been serious about accompanying her to the party? And if so, was she going to invite him?</p><p>Maggie tore off the crust from the sandwich she hadn\u2019t finished and tossed it to Max. The puppy caught it in midair and swallowed without chewing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make him fat,\u201d Nic warned.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I can\u2019t resist his big brown eyes. He\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to learn table manners.\u201d</p><p>Maggie wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cYou\u2019re too strict. You need to lighten up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when Max is ninety pounds of begging dog?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI guess we eat indoors and keep him out.\u201d</p><p>Nic sipped his iced tea. \u201cI can see I don\u2019t want you around when he starts his obedience classes. You would never insist he behave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I wouldn\u2019t. I guess it\u2019s something of a surprise that my daughter is somewhat civilized, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we have your husband to thank for that.\u201d</p><p>She picked up another bread crust, but this one she tossed at Nic. \u201cYou\u2019re insulting me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly a little.\u201d</p><p>Maggie sighed, then picked up her pen. \u201cOkay. Back to business. We\u2019ve been over the expansion, the new equipment on order, and the Far East deal. Oh, Jeremy wanted to talk about the bottling equipment. I told him to make an appointment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>While Maggie made more notes, Nic let his attention wander to the vineyards in the distance and the clusters of grapes ripening in the bright sun.</p><p>Today was a good day. Rather than have their meeting inside, Maggie had suggested lunch on the lawn. A table had been set up in the shade, and the lunch-room catering staff had provided the food.</p> <p>The sun was warm, the sky clear. It was the kind of afternoon that made him want to take off on one of his bikes. Except he\u2019d done that yesterday and he\u2019d ended up somewhere he never should have been.</p><p>At the time driving by Brenna\u2019s newly acquired acres had seemed like a good idea, but later...he\u2019d regretted the impulse.</p><p>Or maybe he just regretted mentioning the party.</p><p>He\u2019d offered to be her date as a joke. At least, that\u2019s how it had started. But as soon as he spoke the words, something had shifted inside of him. He could rationalize the slight tightening in his chest and stiffness in his legs by saying he remembered being that twenty-year-old kid who\u2019d been desperately in love with a girl whose family hated him. But he had a feeling his reaction was about more than that.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Nic,\u201d Maggie said, waving a hand in front of his face. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack about ten years.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him. \u201cAbout the time your grandfather sent you away?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI always felt bad about that.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here when it happened and you didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. How could you feel bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did. When you came back from France, I could tell you\u2019d been hurt even though you never talked about what had happened between you two.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou were family. Emilio had no right to send you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to him he had every right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>His grandfather had asked him to choose and Nic had. Unfortunately he\u2019d chosen Brenna instead of Wild Sea, and the old man had never forgiven him for that. Nic had been equally furious about being kicked off the property. The fact that his grandfather had come back eighteen months later, begging him to return hadn\u2019t been enough.</p><p>He thought about that difficult first year when he\u2019d finally come home. Maggie had been there for him. \u201cYou got me through some tough times. You were good to me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I good for you?\u201d</p><p>Her smile turned tender. \u201cMore than you\u2019ll ever know. You made me feel special. For the first time in my life I wasn\u2019t a tall, gawky carrot-top with freckles. You thought I was beautiful and I could almost see myself that way. You gave me confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo go out and marry someone else.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cCome on, Nic, you weren\u2019t really hurt when I broke up with you. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not willing to concede the point, even if she was right. \u201cIf I was so great, why did you end things?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, as if not willing to tell him the truth.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cI\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d She smiled wryly. \u201cBut if you insist. The reason I ended things was I knew you\u2019d never fall in love with me, and I didn\u2019t want to fall in love with you. I\u2019d already had enough heartache in my life. So I broke it off while I still could.\u201d</p><p>Love? Nic had never known, never guessed things were that serious for her. He studied her green eyes and wondered if he\u2019d inadvertently hurt her all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cSo I got you all primed, and then your husband came along and plucked you like a ripe peach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She grinned and whatever shadows had drifted into her eyes faded away. \u201cBesides, I wanted to get married and you weren\u2019t interested in anything permanent. You still aren\u2019t.\u201d She pointed a finger at him. \u201cAt some point you have to be willing to give your heart and take a chance. Do you really want to die old and alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre those my only options? I took your advice and got a dog. That should count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough. What about letting people in your life?\u201d</p><p>Nic understood the theory, but didn\u2019t get the point. Everyone he\u2019d ever cared about had walked away from him. As far as he could tell, the love thing wasn\u2019t working in his world.</p><p>\u201cI have people in my life,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou have friends, but no romantic interest. When was the last time you were serious about someone? And before you ask, no, a three-week sexual relationship doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a four-week one?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He did, and he wasn\u2019t answering the question. What was the point? He avoided serious relationships. The last one he\u2019d had had been with Maggie. Before that, Brenna. While he hadn\u2019t minded when Maggie ended things, Brenna\u2019s betrayal had destroyed him.</p><p>\u201cStick to your numbers,\u201d he said, tapping the papers on the table. \u201cThey\u2019re what you know best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dismissing my concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Be lonely. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>They both knew that she was lying. While Nic would never admit it, he liked that Maggie cared. She was a good friend.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the advice,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She eyed him. \u201cSpeaking of women...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. I met Brenna Marcelli the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard. What was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I wanted to check her out and see if I had to feel guilty.\u201d Her gaze narrowed. \u201cShe\u2019s very nice and she\u2019s working hard to make her winery a success. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to take advantage of her.\u201d</p><p>Nic had lots of plans to take advantage of Brenna, but not in the way Maggie meant. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she? Are you really going to give her the time she needs to get her business up and running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Nic, why not? Why did you offer her the loan if you\u2019re just going to screw her over?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the question. \u201cI told you. I haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs all this because she\u2019s Lorenzo Marcelli\u2019s granddaughter, or is there something else I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is an open book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. One that\u2019s written in invisible ink.\u201d She collected her papers. \u201cUntil recently I\u2019ve always admired how you did business. You\u2019ve always been completely straightforward. Because of that, you\u2019ve always been able to look yourself in the mirror. I would hate to see that change.\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked away. Nic watched her go. He told himself that Maggie didn\u2019t understand what he was trying to do. She saw things as black and white, but life was more complicated than that. Sometimes winning was expensive, but he\u2019d always been willing to pay the price.</p><p>Besides, he\u2019d yet to find a deal he couldn\u2019t afford. There was no reason to think this one was different.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Francesca stepped into the basted gown and pulled it up over her hips. Brenna waited until the bodice was in place, then carefully pinned the back closed.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d she asked her twin. Grammy M had just finished the initial assembly of a thin cotton dress they would use as a pattern for the actual wedding gown. Once it was fitted, the garment would be taken apart. When there was eighty-dollar-a-yard silk involved, it was best to experiment on cheap fabric first.</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s a little loose in the waist. I wish I could know how big I\u2019m going to get between now and the wedding. Should we let it out more?\u201d</p><p>Brenna fingered the cotton and found she could pinch about two inches of fabric. \u201cI\u2019ll ask one of the Grands. They have more experience with that sort of thing.\u201d She bent down to see where the hem should be. \u201cAre these the shoes you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She slipped several pins into the fabric, then straightened. \u201cSo the party is this Saturday. You must be excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it will be fun.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly the word Brenna would have used. She cleared her throat. \u201cSo here\u2019s the thing. I was thinking of maybe, you know, bringing someone.\u201d</p><p>Francesca spun around to face her. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Like a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t think you were seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She and Nic weren\u2019t \u201cseeing\u201d each other. They were...She sighed. She had no idea what they were doing. \u201cThe problem is I don\u2019t want to make trouble. It\u2019s your party, it\u2019s your special day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat trouble? The Grands will be thrilled that you\u2019re dating. They want you to get married again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to Nic Giovanni.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s perfect mouth dropped open. \u201cNic? You want to bring Nic?\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. She\u2019d been mulling over the concept for three days, and she\u2019d come to the conclusion that, kidding or not, Nic\u2019s feelings had been hurt when she hadn\u2019t instantly agreed to take him. While that wasn\u2019t exactly her responsibility, she still felt bad. Maybe it had something to do with the chemistry bubbling between them or maybe she was still feeling guilty about the past or maybe she\u2019d slipped into madness. Whatever the reason, she wanted to ask him. But only if her sister agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe were talking the other day and I mentioned the engagement party and he said he would like to go and I thought maybe I\u2019d bring him.\u201d She looked at Francesca. \u201cBut I know it will be really uncomfortable, so I didn\u2019t want to do that and ruin the party.\u201d</p><p>Her sister grinned. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrific idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Talk about the fur flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s perfect. We haven\u2019t actually booked any entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. It could get ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Francesca returned her attention to the mirror. \u201cGrandpa Lorenzo will grumble, but I don\u2019t think anyone else will care. You should bring him. A nice, romantic night under the stars. Anything could happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Brenna mumbled. She sighed. \u201cI talked to Katie and she pretty much said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Francesca met her gaze in the mirror. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him and see if he wants to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cAre you sure there isn\u2019t anything between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d Brenna said. But when she turned away to busy herself with the box of pins, she crossed her fingers. There was something; she just couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re offering a lot of cash,\u201d Bill Freeman said. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo Marcelli is an old-fashioned businessman.\u201d Nic glanced down at the final draft of the offer. \u201cCash will appeal to him. I want to keep things clean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bill grinned. \u201cAny cleaner than this and I\u2019d sell to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own Marcelli Wines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me wish I did.\u201d</p> <p>Roger White flipped to the second page. \u201cYou\u2019re promising to keep all the employees for at least two years. I heard that he\u2019s got his granddaughter running things these days. Will that apply to her as well?\u201d</p><p>Nic understood Roger\u2019s concern. An angry family member who had just lost an inheritance could be a liability. \u201cThe clause stands.\u201d He held up his hand before Roger could interrupt. \u201cBrenna Marcelli will quit the second she finds out I\u2019m the actual buyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Nic thought about Brenna\u2019s temper and how she was going to feel about the deal. They\u2019d even discussed him buying Marcelli, however briefly, before she\u2019d dismissed the idea. As much as she would hate him buying out her inheritance, she was going to be even more furious at being played for a fool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She would want to skin him alive. Not that he would blame her. If someone was doing to him what he planned to do to her, he would be out for blood. Brenna\u2019s need for revenge would be hampered by the million-dollar callable note he held. No matter what, he was going to win.</p><p>They discussed a few more points, then adjourned the meeting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hell of an opponent,\u201d Roger said, shaking hands with Nic. \u201cRemind me not to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Nic grinned. \u201cYou want that in an e-mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He opened the conference room door for the men. Bill paused. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a lot of enemies with this one, Nic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>The older man studied him for a second, then shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve wanted Marcelli for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to get them.\u201d</p><p>Nic watched them leave, then returned to the table to pick up his copy of the offer. One more pass and it would be ready. Bill and Roger would present it, and then the real game began.</p><p>Lorenzo Marcelli would be a fool to dismiss the deal, but Nic knew his acquisition wasn\u2019t a sure thing. Marcelli Wines was a family business. There was more than just money at stake. But he was confident.</p><p>He crossed to the window and stared out at the winery. To the left was the building where Brenna\u2019s wines were fermenting. She showed up every night and worked until dawn. Despite her years away from the business, she still had the magic touch. He didn\u2019t doubt that every one of her wines was going to be a medal winner and sell out in days.</p><p>If he gave her the time she needed.</p> <p>He felt a twinge right between his shoulder blades. Guilt? Not possible. He hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. This was business.</p><p>The phone on the conference table buzzed. He walked over and hit the speaker button.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic, you have a call on line seven. A Brenna Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He hesitated before pushing the flashing button. Why would she be calling him?</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said by way of greeting. \u201cYou sold your four acres of Pinot to a theme-park developer for a cool five million.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNot even on a bet. Your assistant said you were just getting out of a meeting. Are you planning to produce wine coolers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to blend them with tropical fruits.\u201d</p><p>She made a gagging sound. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. Not even you would do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if the profit margin was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. What about family pride? Anyway, I didn\u2019t call to lecture you about your shady business practices.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cGood to know. Why did you call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s an interesting question.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI, ah, I told you before about the engagement party. For my sisters. Anyway, if you\u2019re not busy Saturday, I thought maybe you\u2019d like to go with me. Not as a date or anything. Just as, well, I guess I don\u2019t know. Friends. Or something.\u201d</p><p>He sat and stared at the phone. Brenna inviting him to the family homestead? For a party? Unbelievable. He would never have guessed she would change her mind.</p><p>\u201cNic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. Just tell me if you want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Why not? This was a chance to see operations up close. Brenna would be happy to give him a tour. They would spend the evening together, which wasn\u2019t much of a hardship. \u201cI\u2019d like to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell if she sounded relieved or horrified.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSay six-thirty. But I\u2019ll pick you up. It might be dangerous for you to drive onto Marcelli property by yourself.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWill I be shot on sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstant death would be the least of your problems. So I\u2019ll see you Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Funny. When he hung up the phone, he found he really was.</p><p>10</p><p>Brenna was so nervous, her knees were knocking. Since she was trying to drive her car, this wasn\u2019t a good thing. Fortunately it was an automatic, and she didn\u2019t have to worry about using a clutch.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth was I thinking?\u201d she muttered as she turned onto the main highway. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking. Okay, I was, but with the wrong part of my brain.\u201d</p><p>Actually, there was no excuse for what she\u2019d done. She wasn\u2019t even a guy, so she didn\u2019t have the \u201clittle head\u201d to blame for her poor decision. The night was going to be a disaster and she had no one to blame but herself.</p><p>She\u2019d invited Nic to the party in part because she felt guilty, in part because her grandfather was driving her crazy and she wanted to act out against him, and in part because she wanted to spend some time in Nic\u2019s company. Were those good reasons or bad reasons? Did it matter at this point?</p><p>And what about her family? Should she have warned her parents? Her sisters all knew and had been supportive, if Mia teasing her about still having the hots for Nic counted as support. She pressed a hand to her stomach to try to calm the uneasy rumbling that was the result of her nerves.</p><p>At least she looked good, she thought, trying to find a bright spot in the one-act spoof that was her life. Over the past couple of weeks she\u2019d actually been too busy to eat, and, miracle of miracles, she\u2019d lost a couple of pounds. So the sleeveless black sheath she\u2019d wanted to wear had slid over her hips without a single whimper of protest. She\u2019d chosen fashion over comfort and had borrowed a pair of impossibly high black strappy sandals from her mother\u2019s department-store-sized collection. Mia had fussed with her hair, using a combination of mousse, gel, and hair-spray that gave her normally uncooperative hair lift and shape. A touch of makeup, a spray of perfume, and she was ready to go.</p><p>Except for the chorus line warming up in her midsection.</p><p>She turned from the road onto Wild Sea property. If only this didn\u2019t feel so much like a date. Was it a date? It couldn\u2019t be. She and Nic didn\u2019t date. Some days they barely spoke. But she\u2019d asked him to a party and she was picking him up in her car, so it looked like a date. Sort of.</p><p>She arrived at the house far more quickly than she\u2019d wanted to. Once there, she didn\u2019t have an excuse to linger in the car, so she forced herself to get out and walk to the door. She was shaking and hyperventilating. What the hell had she been thinking?</p><p>After knocking on the front door, she tried to calm herself. She was a mature adult who could handle any situation. She was\u2014</p><p>Nic opened the door and smiled at her. Just like that, one smile and her brain went from al dente to mush. She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak, probably couldn\u2019t breathe, although who cared about that? The man looked amazing.</p><p>Dark slacks, dark shirt, dress shoes, gleaming hair, freshly shaved cheeks, and a delicious glint in his brown eyes. Italian sex appeal at its very best.</p><p>While she was still trying to collect her synapses and force them into functioning, Nic leaned forward and kissed her cheek. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and managed a smile. \u201cThanks. You, too.\u201d</p><p>He held open the door and she stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m early,\u201d she said as she clasped her hands together. \u201cI was ready and I couldn\u2019t stand the waiting. Plus I had to get away while I could. The place is complete chaos. Between the Grands trying to get the food ready at the last minute\u2014because God forbid we should hire a caterer instead of just serving staff\u2014my mom rearranging the flowers, and Grandpa Lorenzo changing his mind about the wine, I thought a timely escape the best course of action.\u201d She glanced around the living room. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t changed much, has it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tell herself that the two of them being alone in Nic\u2019s house after dark didn\u2019t mean anything. She\u2019d been here before when they\u2019d needed lamps. Of course, that had been many years before, in the dead of night, and for the sole purpose of finally making love in a bed.</p><p>Best not to think about that, she told herself. Best to just study the furniture and pretend she was completely fine with her plans for the evening.</p><p>Nic watched Brenna\u2019s gaze dart around the room. She looked nervous enough to jump out of her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them about me coming to the party, did you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cMy sisters know. They\u2019re all really excited about meeting you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBetween the motorcycle and black leather jacket, not to mention your reputation for being a troublemaker as a kid and a ruthless businessman now, you\u2019re something of a legend in these parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the sofa. While she sat, he crossed to the table by the window and poured them each a glass of Cabernet.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d Brenna asked as she took the drink. She stood up and clutched it in both hands. \u201cI guess it won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be like this all evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Insanely tense? Maybe. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>He studied her large eyes, the fullness of her mouth, then looked lower at the simple black dress that skimmed over her lush curves. He didn\u2019t even get as far as her bare legs before he felt interest stir.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem at all.\u201d He touched his glass to hers. \u201cTo your sisters\u2019 happy engagements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo not throwing up on any of the guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a real possibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope not.\u201d</p><p>She held the glass up to the light and studied the color, then inhaled the fragrance. After swirling it around several times, she inhaled again.</p><p>\u201cBrenna, just drink the damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She glanced from the glass to him. \u201cOh, sorry.\u201d She took a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019re really nervous. You never compliment my wines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I guess I should. Some of them are very nice.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cNice, huh? Maybe you\u2019d like to be our spokesperson.\u201d</p><p>She set her glass on the coffee table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nic. I know tonight is going to be fine. I\u2019m really glad I\u2019m taking you.\u201d</p><p>He waited for the \u201cbut\u201d part of the sentence.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019m terrified. Silly, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I pace?\u201d</p><p>He waved his arm. \u201cFeel free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She kicked off her sandals, then, barefoot, walked the length of the living room. \u201cI\u2019m a grown-up. I\u2019m a capable person. My parents are going to be fine with this. We\u2019re going to have a good time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are you trying to convince?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t look the least bit worried, so I guess just myself.\u201d</p><p>He watched her resume her pacing. She crossed and uncrossed her arms, then paused by a window and stared out at the night. Her apprehension didn\u2019t surprise him, but his reaction to it did. He would have thought he would be pleased by her discomfort, that this night would be a victory for him. Instead he felt badly for putting her in this position and he wanted to do something to make her feel better.</p> <p>\u201cBrenna, I don\u2019t have to go,\u201d he said before he could stop himself.</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cOh, yes, you do. I\u2019m prepared to bring you onto Marcelli land and have it out with my grandfather. I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen with my parents, but my sisters are all waiting to watch the show. I have a bunch of crap in my hair just so I can look nice, and I\u2019m wearing shoes that are going to cripple me. I didn\u2019t do all that just so you can back out at the last minute. You\u2019re going to the party if I have to drag you there by your ears.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cAll right, then. A gracious invitation like that is difficult to refuse.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cYou think this is all pretty funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it ranks up there with war and pestilence.\u201d He set down his wineglass. \u201cYou need to relax.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She held up a hand and watched as it trembled. \u201cI\u2019m shaking.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to stand next to her and took her hand in his. After rubbing her fingers, he bent down and kissed the inside of her wrist. He could feel her rapid pulse fluttering against his lips.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should give you something else to think about,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNic, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waited, but she didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Truthfully, he hadn\u2019t planned this. He\u2019d been more focused on the party and seeing the Marcelli family close up than on spending the evening with Brenna. Now that she was here, he found himself mesmerized by the sweet scent of her body and the way her breasts rose and fell with each breath. She\u2019d always been attractive, but tonight she was beautiful. Soft, vulnerable, all woman, and sexy as hell.</p> <p>He could hate her, he could ignore her, he could even do his best to forget about her, but he\u2019d been unable to stop wanting her. Just being close was enough to get him hard. As blood pooled in his groin, he moved in closer. She didn\u2019t back away, not even when he lowered his head and kissed her.</p><p>Nic tasted of wine and temptation, Brenna thought when his mouth brushed against hers. It was a heady combination, one she didn\u2019t think she could resist.</p><p>As their lips pressed together, she pulled her hand free of his and wrapped her arms around his neck. Okay, this probably wasn\u2019t the smartest thing she could be doing right now, but leaning against him, kissing him, wanting him just felt too good.</p><p>She parted her lips and he swept into her mouth. The second his tongue brushed against hers, she felt her good sense sizzle into smoke and drift away. She lost herself in the heat that exploded between them. He\u2019d always had the ability to make her body respond on the most primal level, and tonight was no exception.</p><p>She clung to him, wanting their bodies to touch as much as possible. At the same time she needed to explore, to remember, to feel all those magical things that had only happened with Nic. As he deepened the kiss, she moved her hands down his shoulders to his back. His was broader than she remembered. Stronger. Yet his muscles still clenched and released as she touched him. She traced his narrow waist and hips, then circled back to cup his rear. When she squeezed, he thrust his hips forward and she felt his erection.</p><p>He was hard and thick and the things he\u2019d been able to do to her filled her mind. Her memory flashed pictures of them making love while her body remembered the pleasure. Every part of her ached as liquid desire pooled low in her belly. Her panties were already wet, her breasts swollen, and both she and Nic were wearing way too many clothes.</p><p>He cupped her face and broke their kiss. Before she could complain, he pressed his lips to her cheeks, her eyelids, then her jaw. After nibbling his way to her neck, he licked the sensitive skin behind her ear. Shivers danced across her skin.</p><p>He kissed his way down to her throat, where he paid homage to the hollow before kissing her chest, just above the neckline of her dress.</p> <p>When she felt the slow slide of her zipper being eased down, she reached for the buttons on his shirt. She got three of them undone before she had to drop her arms to her sides so he could pull her dress off her arms and let it settle at her waist. The silky fabric barely paused before slipping to the floor, leaving her wearing nothing but panties and a bra.</p><p>Nic returned his attention to her mouth. He kissed her thoroughly, exploring her with a devastatingly erotic dance that left her boneless. Had she been in the mood to protest her undressed state, she was too occupied to speak a word. Not that she wanted to complain. Not when she felt his warm hands move from her waist to her breasts. Not when he cupped her curves through the lace of her black bra and brushed his thumbs against her already tight nipples.</p><p>Need spiraled through her. Her breath caught as she waited for the next sweep of his fingers, then the next. Had anything ever felt this good? Even as his touch eased the pressure in her breasts, need continued to build between her legs. She reached for the bra clasp and fumbled with the hooks. When she managed to unfasten them, she pulled off her bra, then grabbed Nic\u2019s hands and placed them back on her body.</p><p>The flesh on flesh made her moan. He held her breasts in his palms and squeezed them gently. Long fingers explored her sensitive skin, then teased her nipples. He seemed to know exactly how she liked to be touched, how fast, how hard, how...everything.</p><p>This time when he broke the kiss, she caught her breath in anticipation. He bent his head and pressed his open mouth to her breast.</p><p>Wet heat surrounded her. He circled her with his tongue, then sucked her deeply into his mouth. Brenna held on to his head, holding him close, barely breathing as she concentrated on the pleasure spiraling through her body. He moved to her other breast and continued the dance. She felt him tug off his shirt.</p><p>When he pulled back and straightened, she opened her eyes. He was bare to the waist. His hair was mussed, his eyes were heavy-lidded with passion. As his hands reached for his belt buckle, she slipped off her panties. He unfastened his slacks, then took her hand and pulled her to the couch.</p><p>When he was seated, he shoved down his trousers and briefs, allowing his erection to spring free. Brenna sucked in a breath as she stared at him. At one time she\u2019d known his body as intimately as she\u2019d known her own. She knew what he liked to do, what he fantasized about, and how to make him come in less than fifteen seconds. Of course he knew the same things about her.</p><p>She liked being on top, she liked him playing with her breasts while he was inside of her, and most of the time she liked it slightly less than civilized. Had he remembered or was this just dumb luck on her part?</p><p>He reached for her hand and drew it to his mouth. But instead of kissing her fingers or her wrist, he bit down on the thick pad by her thumb. A silly thing that had always driven her wild. Shivers rippled through her. Damn him. He remembered everything.</p><p>Still watching her, he released her hand and grabbed her by the waist. She knelt on the sofa, straddling him. With their eyes locked and a part of her unable to believe this was really happening, she lowered herself onto him.</p><p>She was hot, slick, and more than ready. He was hard as a rock. He filled her completely, making her stretch to accommodate him, and before they\u2019d even begun to move, she felt the first quivering promise of her release. So much for self-control. The only saving grace was the way his eyes dilated and his mouth stretched into a straight line. She wasn\u2019t the only one barely hanging on.</p><p>Still watching him watch her, she shifted so that she could raise and lower herself. He cupped her breasts and rubbed her nipples. The combination was pure paradise.</p><p>Tension built from the inside out. She rested her hands on muscled shoulders that were as hard as the rest of him. As she moved up and down, she found herself falling into a rhythm that felt familiar and incredible. He pulsed his hips in time with her movements. When the pitch of her need increased, she tried to look away but couldn\u2019t. Not even when the first deep contractions pulled at her.</p><p>She told herself to hold on, to make it last, to\u2014</p><p>The shudder of her release made her cry out. She moved faster as her body convulsed around him, pulling him in deeper. More. There was so much more. He dropped his hands to her hips and urged her to keep moving, his body matching her pace, taking her through every ounce of her release.</p><p>It was only when the last muscle relaxed that he tightened his hold on her and groaned. She felt him push in as far as he could. He shook violently and closed his eyes, then was still.</p><p>Brenna tried to catch her breath. Aftershocks rippled through her as she lost herself in the sense of well-being that flooded her. Strong arms pulled her close. She nestled against Nic\u2019s bare chest. His heat and familiar scent surrounded her. He stroked her back, slowly moving along the length of her spine. She smiled. Talk about amazing. Talk about\u2014</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>She sat up and stared at him. He had the contented expression of a well-pleasured man. One corner of his mouth turned up.</p><p>\u201cUnexpected, but very nice,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nice? Nice! What on earth had she been thinking? She and Nic had just had sex. Sex!</p><p>She closed her eyes and shifted so she could slide off him. When she was free, she curled up on the sofa, her bare butt against his hip and covered her face with her hands.</p><p>\u201cJust shoot me now,\u201d she muttered, wondering how things had gotten so out of hand so fast.</p><p>Nic placed his hand on her hip. \u201cLook at the bright side,\u201d he told her. \u201cAt least you\u2019re not still worried about what your family is going to think when you show up with me.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. Great. Not sure if she should cry or burst into hysterical laughter, Brenna stayed where she was. Maybe she could disappear into the fabric and never be heard from again. She didn\u2019t plan to ever move again...right up until Nic leaned close and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s ten to seven. Want to get dressed and go to the engagement party, or stay here and do it again?\u201d</p><p>For reasons that still didn\u2019t make sense, she\u2019d chosen the party. Brenna sat in the passenger seat of Nic\u2019s Jag, smoothing her hands over her dress and trying not to think about how mussed she must look.</p><p>Five minutes in the downstairs bathroom had allowed her to repair her makeup and smooth her hair. Her dress wasn\u2019t even wrinkled. She should have looked exactly as she had when she\u2019d left the hacienda an hour before, but something was different. Maybe it was the sated, slightly stunned expression in her eyes, or the shape of her mouth\u2014now swollen from Nic\u2019s kisses. Or maybe it was the aura of guilt and stupidity surrounding her.</p><p>If the dashboard hadn\u2019t been covered in such a lovely, soft leather, she would have banged her head against it in an attempt to knock some sense into herself. Sex with Nic? Could she have been more impulsive? She was no longer a starry-eyed teenager who still believed in happily ever after. She was a mature woman with a plan for her life. A plan that didn\u2019t include screwing up an important business relationship.</p><p>She drew in a slow, steady breath. Time to be calm. Time to be one with the universe. Time to ignore the fact that her panties were soaked and that the trembling in her body no longer had anything to do with nerves.</p><p>Was anyone going to be able to figure out what they\u2019d just done?</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Nic asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. He looked calm and in control. How like a man.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. What was there to say? That she was sorry she\u2019d lost control and given into the desire that seemed to always be on the fringes of their up close and personal encounters? Of course she was sorry...almost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just then he turned from the road onto the long driveway that led to the hacienda. Brenna stiffened. Sex or no sex, she\u2019d just brought the enemy onto Marcelli land.</p><p>Nic pulled in behind a silver BMW. There were several dozen cars parked along the wide road. White lights hung from trees and illuminated the walkway up to the three-story hacienda.</p><p>He\u2019d grown up only a few miles from this house, but his world couldn\u2019t have been more different. How many times had he crept out in the early evening and made his way to the Marcelli home? How many nights had he hidden in the bushes and watched through the brightly lit windows, hungry for the family he\u2019d seen living inside? They\u2019d belonged to each other, and to a boy who had belonged to no one, their lives had been perfect.</p> <p>When he and Brenna had met and fallen in love, he\u2019d actually thought he might one day be a part of this. A part of them. Welcomed into the family as one of their own. He\u2019d wanted that nearly as much as he\u2019d wanted her. In the end he\u2019d lost both.</p><p>He shook off the memories. He wasn\u2019t that kid anymore. He was a successful adult who had a shot at owning all this. Not the house\u2014he no longer cared about that\u2014but the land and the name.</p><p>\u201cFor the first time in my life, I\u2019m wishing for a few minutes with Grandma Tessa\u2019s rosary,\u201d Brenna murmured. She turned to him. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and stepped out of the car.</p><p>From where he stood, he could see the large tent filling the backyard. The sides had been rolled up, allowing the evening breeze to drift across the set tables. More lights crisscrossed through the trees. People stood in groups, talking, laughing, holding wineglasses, no doubt toasting the happy couples with the best Lorenzo Marcelli had to offer.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all going to be okay,\u201d Brenna said when he moved next to her. She glanced at him and gave a faint smile. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a tour later, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it include your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>He followed her toward the party-goers. The sound of music drifted to them, and as they neared the house, he spotted a dance floor set up in a garden. Two couples stood out in the swaying crowd. He recognized Brenna\u2019s sisters\u2014Katie and Francesca.</p><p>A uniformed young woman approached with a tray of drinks. Brenna took a glass of champagne, handed it to Nic, then snatched another for herself.</p><p>\u201cIf this is a small get-together for family and friends,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat does a big party look like?\u201d</p> <p>She gulped half her glass of wine. \u201cI know. My mother doesn\u2019t do things by halves, so that\u2019s a problem. This time it was compounded by the fact that Katie is a professional organizer who specializes in giving parties for the rich and famous. It\u2019s not a good combination if you\u2019re going for small and intimate. I should warn you that dinner has about seventy-five courses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t fill up on hors d\u2019oeuvres.\u201d</p><p>She finished her champagne and set the empty glass on the edge of a garden planter. Nic took his first sip. Rather than admit he might be a little nervous at the prospect of meeting the Marcelli clan, he concentrated on the light scent and blend of bubbles and flavors in the sparkling wine. It was good. He tasted it again and decided that when he was in charge, he would expand production.</p><p>Brenna scanned the crowd. \u201cOver there,\u201d she said and linked her arm with his. \u201cWe\u2019ll start easy and work our way up from there.\u201d</p><p>He followed her gaze and saw her mother talking with an older couple he didn\u2019t recognize. As they approached, Colleen Marcelli glanced over at her daughter, smiled, looked at him, and froze.</p><p>Her eyes widened, her mouth dropped open, and she nearly spilled her glass of wine. But as quickly as it had come, the shock faded. Colleen excused herself from the older couple and approached them.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, oh, God,\u201d Brenna muttered. Her fingers tightened around his arm. \u201cStay calm. Just stay calm.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if the instruction was for her or for himself. Either way it was good advice.</p> <p>\u201cBrenna,\u201d Colleen said as she approached. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>Brenna cleared her throat. \u201cThanks. Um, Mom, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I already know your friend.\u201d</p><p>Nic braced himself for the attack. Colleen handed her glass to her daughter, took his free hand in hers, and studied his face. \u201cI see a lot of your grandfather in you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd your father. Do you go by Nicholas or Nic?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected the question. \u201cNic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Nic, this night has been far too long in coming.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have you here.\u201d</p><p>Then she leaned forward and raised herself on tiptoes and kissed his cheek. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>Her graciousness surprised him. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Marcelli. I want you to know I\u2019m here as Brenna\u2019s guest. Not to make trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen,\u201d she said. \u201cTrouble was the furthest thing from my mind.\u201d Her expression turned wry. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought the feud between our families was pretty silly, although my father-in-law would disagree. Now that you\u2019re here, I can\u2019t help thinking this meeting is years too late. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>He spoke the words easily. She sounded sincere. As if she were sorry. Brenna had always said her mother was a warm and caring person. Until now, Nic had never believed her.</p><p>Colleen glanced through the crowd. \u201cNow, where is my husband?\u201d</p><p>As she turned to look at the people standing by the tent, Brenna finished her mother\u2019s champagne.</p><p>\u201cOne down, the rest of the clan left to go,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOf course she\u2019s going to want an explanation later. Any ideas on what I should tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re hot for my body and think nothing of seducing me at a moment\u2019s notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhen and where?\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s gaze narrowed, but before she could snap at him, Colleen reached for his hand again. \u201cThere\u2019s Marco. Come along. I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d She smiled at her daughter. \u201cI won\u2019t keep him long.\u201d</p><p>Brenna waved her hand. \u201cKeep him for as long as you want. I won\u2019t mind a bit.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back and mouthed \u201cliar\u201d as Colleen led him away to introduce him to their guests.</p><p>Marco Marcelli concealed his surprise better than his wife had, but he was just as gracious. Family friends from the area were obviously shocked to see him on Marcelli land, but they smiled politely. Nic figured there would be more than one midnight call about the party.</p><p>The grandmothers were reserved, Tessa Marcelli more so than Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea. Still, they welcomed him. Nic wondered if they would be so friendly if they knew that he and Brenna had once planned to run away together.</p><p>He knew what their reaction would be if they figured out he was going to use every means at his disposal to buy Marcelli Wines. But he understood that. If the situation were reversed, he would be just as furious.</p><p>Nic found himself an observer rather than a participant in the evening. He\u2019d known about the Marcellis all his life. His grandfather had talked about the family, he\u2019d run into them at local events, passed them in the post office. But except for Brenna, he\u2019d never spoken to them. Now they were accepting him as one of their own.</p><p>He\u2019d always seen them as the enemy. Funny how they were turning out to be just regular people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mia,\u201d a young woman said, slipping between Nic and Colleen. \u201cThe youngest, the smartest, the most fun. And you\u2019re Nic Giovanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. Streaks of blond lightened her dark hair. She wore a strapless dress that barely came to mid-thigh and high heels that looked expensive and dangerous. Heavy makeup emphasized her big eyes and full lips. She was Lolita at eighteen.</p><p>Mia took his hand in hers and brought his arm around behind her so he rested his palm on her hip. \u201cEveryone is talking, but then you expected that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like making trouble.\u201d</p><p>He thought about the trouble he and Brenna had made early that evening. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>Mia placed her fingers on his chest. \u201cAll my sisters had wild crushes on you when they were growing up, even me. Of course, I\u2019m the only one who will admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>Her brown eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cBut not shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the hots for my sister?\u201d</p><p>Before he could decide on a politically correct answer to a charged question, he heard a low murmur of voices behind him. He disentangled himself from Mia and turned to find Lorenzo Marcelli stalking toward him.</p><p>\u201cWho let you in?\u201d Lorenzo demanded. Anger and insult pulsed in every word.</p><p>Suddenly Marco was at Nic\u2019s side. \u201cNic is a guest.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo moved closer. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t invited. No Giovanni would ever be invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Brenna.\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched in the old man\u2019s cheek. He muttered something in Italian, something Nic couldn\u2019t catch or translate, then turned and moved away.</p><p>Marco put a hand on Nic\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse my father. He\u2019s an old man. Very stubborn. For him the feud between our families lives on.\u201d</p><p>Nic glanced at Lorenzo as he disappeared into the crowd, then turned back to Marco. \u201cI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t agree with him.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled. \u201cIt was sixty years ago. I have trouble remembering last week.\u201d He dropped his hand and held open his arm. \u201cHere comes your date.\u201d</p><p>Nic saw Brenna approaching.</p><p>\u201cI heard the thunder of disapproval clear across the lawn,\u201d she said. \u201cDid he say anything awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing unexpected,\u201d Nic said. \u201cI\u2019m an intruder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTermites are an intruder. You\u2019re a welcome guest,\u201d Marco told him. \u201cWe will have dinner soon. You\u2019ll eat, you\u2019ll talk, you\u2019ll enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled at her father. \u201cYou sound like Grandma Tessa.\u201d</p><p>Marco winced. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I sound like an old woman.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and stepped away. Brenna pulled Nic to the edge of the crowd. \u201cHow\u2019s it going? Is it too awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is being very gracious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. I wonder if he\u2019ll fire me.\u201d</p><p>Nic raised his eyebrows. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sank into a chair. \u201cHe\u2019ll be crabby for a few days, but nothing more. I saw my mom introducing you to people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been very nice.\u201d He took the seat next to hers. \u201cMia said all your sisters had crushes on me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna rolled her eyes. \u201cGreat. Like you need an ego boost. I gotta tell you, Nic, you\u2019re not as hot as all that.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close. \u201cYes, I am. Do I need to remind you what we were doing\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off with a frantic shake of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything. My grandmothers could hear. Do you know how completely creepy that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t want the old ladies knowing, either.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cIs this too weird? Being here like this? I mean I never invited you before.\u201d</p><p>Before. When they\u2019d been desperately in love. When belonging had mattered as much as loving her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I expected,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that his feelings would make him change his mind about buying. Liking or not liking didn\u2019t affect business decisions.</p><p>Katie and her fianc\u00e9 joined them. Nic listened to the conversation more than he participated. Most of his attention was captured by the lands around the hacienda. The sun had fully set and most of the view was in shadows, but he could make out rows of vines stretching into the distance.</p><p>Behind them were the winery buildings, and the tasting room beyond that. Marcelli Wines was smaller than Wild Sea. Smaller, but more prestigious. Once they were a part of his holdings, he would have achieved everything he wanted. He would be the best. It was all here, within his grasp.</p> <p>Dinner was the blur of courses that Brenna had promised. Colleen had rearranged the seating, putting Nic on her right and Brenna next to him. Lorenzo was at a different table, with his back to them.</p><p>\u201cSave room for dessert,\u201d Brenna said, leaning close to speak in his ear. \u201cThe Grands outdid themselves with this amazing cake they make. The cream filling is probably illegal, it\u2019s so good.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been living here since March. I don\u2019t dare get my cholesterol checked. As for dieting, forget it.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her breasts, and he instantly remembered them bare and filling his hands. The memory expanded to include the sight of her, naked, flushed with need and riding him with an abandon that had left him so hard, he practically winced with pain. As far as he was concerned, there wasn\u2019t a damn thing wrong with her body, except that it was too clothed and they weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>He reached for his wine. The full-bodied Cabernet did nothing to stop the flow of blood south. In three seconds he was shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t figured out how making love with Brenna fit in with his plan. His first thought had been that while it had been great, they probably shouldn\u2019t do it again. But on second thought...</p> <p>He reached for her hand and slid it across his thigh until her fingers encountered his erection. She looked at him, her eyes wide, her mouth slightly parted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that all about?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cYou naked, riding me to hell and back.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and pulled her hand free. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk about this. My mother is right next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That makes it more exciting.\u201d</p><p>She reached for her water glass. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but trouble.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned close again. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not wet and I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d</p><p>She took a drink of water, deliberately turned her back, and started speaking with the man on her other side. Nic chuckled. While Brenna was pretending to ignore him, he ran his finger down her spine. He was rewarded by a slight shiver and goose bumps breaking out on her arm.</p><p>Nearly an hour later, as the plates were being cleared, Marco stood up. The crowd quieted. He picked up a microphone from a stand by the table and walked to the front of the tent.</p><p>\u201cI would like to thank all of you for coming to help our family celebrate. Engagements and weddings are always special, but Italian weddings\u201d\u2014he grinned\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re events.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cThe Marcelli family has a long, proud history.\u201d</p><p>Marco outlined the founding of the winery, omitting any reference to the connection with the Giovanni family or the feud that had occurred. As Nic listened, he glanced at those in attendance. Lorenzo had turned his chair to face his son, but never glanced in Nic\u2019s direction. Mia winked when he caught her eye and Katie smiled. Even Grandma Tessa raised a glass of wine in his direction.</p><p>His plan to buy Marcelli Wines had been born nearly ten years ago. Except for Brenna, the Marcellis had been faceless enemies. He\u2019d never connected them with people he might come to know.</p> <p>He told himself nothing had changed. So what if he\u2019d met them? Was he going to walk away from years of hard work just because he\u2019d been treated well at a party? He was a man who went after what he wanted, and he wanted Marcelli Wines. End of story.</p><p>But he had the uneasy feeling that despite his conviction, something had changed. Something he couldn\u2019t define or even explain.</p><p>He shook off the thought and returned his attention to Marco.</p><p>\u201cMy daughters, Katie and Francesca. I would ask that you raise your glasses to toast them and the fine men they will marry. To my\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud gasp from Colleen silenced him. Beside him, Brenna turned to see what had shocked her mother.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said with delight and got to her feet. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Nic frowned. He saw a man walking toward the gathering. He was tall and casually dressed, with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder.</p><p>Brenna walked toward him, which got Nic on his feet and moving toward her. The man stopped in the light of a hanging lantern. Nic knew he\u2019d never seen the guy before, but his features were oddly familiar.</p><p>\u201cSeems like my timing is off,\u201d the stranger said to Brenna as she approached.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you weren\u2019t planning on making an entrance.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling and happy. Nic glared. So who the hell was this asshole and how did he know Brenna?</p><p>11</p><p>Brenna had figured the day\u2019s roller-coaster events had peaked when she\u2019d brought Nic to the party. But she\u2019d been wrong. The fun just kept on coming, this time in the unexpected arrival of her long-lost brother.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been this confused about one person. Joe Larson could destroy her hopes and dreams with a single sentence. She should hate him. Yet she didn\u2019t. She was actually happy to see him, in a twisted, ambivalent, why-was-this-happening sort of way.</p><p>\u201cHave any trouble finding the place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here for the money?\u201d</p><p>Joe grinned. \u201cYou cut right to the chase, don\u2019t you? Maybe I\u2019m interested in meeting my family more than collecting an inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the watching crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a reception than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn engagement party for two of my...our sisters. Francesca, the one you met with me, and Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of those folks are actual relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you\u2019d think. At least you can meet them all at once.\u201d</p><p>Joe Larson, all six feet plus of Navy SEAL\u2013honed muscle and brawn, actually took a step back. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a hundred of their closest friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to make a guy feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be worse than night ops in enemy territory.\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze settled on her face. His expression was unreadable, but she thought she might have seen wariness in his eyes. One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She turned toward the tables. \u201cIt\u2019s Joe.\u201d</p><p>A whispered buzz swept through the crowd. Most of the guests wouldn\u2019t know who Joe was, but her parents did, as did her sisters. Mia spilled the beans by popping to her feet and clapping her hands together.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brother?\u201d she asked in obvious delight. \u201cThis is so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d Brenna murmured for Joe\u2019s benefit. \u201cShe\u2019s the baby of the family. Too smart for her own good and we all adore her. You met Francesca already, and the guy beside her is Sam, her fianc\u00e9. Katie is standing over there. Next to her is Zach, her fianc\u00e9. Grandpa Lorenzo is the fierce-looking old guy. His wife, Grandma Tessa, is next to him, and Grammy M is sitting with her date.\u201d</p><p>The Marcelli family walked slowly toward them. Brenna\u2019s parents arrived first. Tears filled her mother\u2019s eyes and her father looked stunned, which made sense. Outside of soap operas, events like this didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Brenna cleared her throat. \u201cSo, everyone, this is Joe. Joe, my...um, make that our parents. Colleen and Marco Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>There was an awkward moment when no one moved. Finally Joe approached their father and held out his hand. They shook. Joe glanced anxiously at their mother, who continued to cry.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>She blinked several times, then reached up and touched his face. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d</p><p>Looking more than a little uncomfortable, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019m Joe Larson.\u201d</p><p>The Grands approached, along with Grandpa Lorenzo. Brenna\u2019s sisters hovered in the background. Grandma Tessa pulled out her rosary.</p><p>\u201cGod is blessing our family,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo moved close and clutched Joe by the shoulders. \u201cI see my father in you.\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned close. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen pictures, so I can\u2019t tell you if that\u2019s a good thing or not.\u201d</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo ignored her. \u201cYou are welcome, Joe Larson.\u201d He frowned. \u201cJoe. That isn\u2019t right. You were to be named Antonio, after my father.\u201d</p><p>Joe winced. \u201cTough luck for me, huh?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, then everyone laughed. Grandma Tessa pushed her husband aside and reached up to pinch Joe\u2019s cheek. Brenna was pleased when her macho brother flinched. Grandma Tessa had some power in her old fingers. Grammy M linked arms with her daughter. Katie and Mia approached for an introduction.</p><p>Her mother took over, saying again and again, \u201cThis is my son.\u201d Her father seemed content to simply smile at his firstborn.</p><p>Brenna stepped back to watch the family interact with Joe. Despite what his existence meant to her, she\u2019d liked him from the first moment she\u2019d met him. Now he was here, and judging from the reaction, he would be welcomed with open arms.</p><p>Not a surprise, she told herself as Grandpa Lorenzo moved close and spoke in low tones. No doubt the elder Marcelli was spelling out the possibilities of inheriting the winery. Only an idiot would turn down an inheritance like the Marcelli winery, and Joe didn\u2019t look like a fool. She was going to lose everything, just because she didn\u2019t have a penis.</p><p>\u201cWe never meant to let you go,\u201d her mother was saying. She touched Joe\u2019s arm over and over as if reassuring herself that he was really there. The Grands were pressing in, and Brenna realized that Joe had the trapped look of a cornered animal. Oddly, she felt responsible for him, which meant she should probably come to the rescue.</p><p>\u201cOkay, break it up,\u201d she said, slipping between Joe and the family. \u201cGive the guy a couple of minutes to catch his breath. I\u2019m going to take him up to the house and get him settled. Why don\u2019t the rest of you go satisfy the curiosity of our guests?\u201d</p><p>Her mother hesitated. Brenna leaned close and hugged her. \u201cI won\u2019t let him get away,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s too many of us for a first meeting.\u201d</p><p>Their mother nodded. Tears filled her eyes again. \u201cWe\u2019re happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Joe gave a clipped nod. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cma\u2019am\u201d was there at the end of the sentence, but silent. Brenna wondered if he would ever think of Colleen Marcelli as his mother.</p><p>\u201cI can come back in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can, ah, talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back?\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo exclaimed, sounding outraged. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a motel. I saw one not far from here.\u201d</p><p>Brenna winced. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>She barely got the words out before conversation exploded.</p><p>\u201cYou must stay here,\u201d Grandma Tessa said forcefully. \u201cYou\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be no trouble a\u2019tall,\u201d Grammy M informed him.</p><p>\u201cYou getting away is so not going to happen,\u201d Mia said with a grin.</p><p>Brenna looked at Joe and shrugged. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just plain easier to give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I guess I could stay for a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Joe picked up his duffel. Brenna glanced toward the tables and wondered if she should say something to Nic about joining him in a few minutes. Then Joe started toward the house and she hurried after him.</p><p>Temporary staff filled the kitchen. Brenna collected a plate of food, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, then led the way into the dining room.</p> <p>\u201cTake a load off,\u201d she said, jerking her head toward the large table.</p><p>Joe set the duffel on the floor, then pulled out a chair. He took the plate she offered, along with flatware.</p><p>\u201cIs that wine all for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I\u2019m not trying to get you drunk. I thought it would take the edge off. Besides, Marcelli Wines is your heritage. Think of this as the beginning of your education. Your inheritance won\u2019t come for free.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her statement and glanced toward the kitchen. \u201cYou have any beer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeasant,\u201d she muttered as she expertly opened the bottle of Cabernet. After pouring them each a glass, she took the seat opposite his and sank onto the chair.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He sliced off a piece of chicken. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look a little shell-shocked.\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze narrowed. \u201cThe hell I do.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSensitive, aren\u2019t we? Does this have something to do with your rough-and-tumble reputation? Do you really know fifty-seven ways to kill me?\u201d</p> <p>He chewed without speaking. Brenna sipped her wine and studied his face. His coloring was more Italian than Irish, but his features were a blend of the two.</p><p>\u201cSecond thoughts about coming here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m way past that.\u201d He picked up his wineglass and frowned at the contents.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to admire the color,\u201d she told him. \u201cAppreciate the blends of reds and purples. Next, smell the bouquet.\u201d She demonstrated. \u201cBlack cherry, chocolate, a little plum.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cIt smells like wine.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cRight. Next, a sip. Let the liquid roll around on your tongue as you experience all the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Joe chugged about a third of the wine, swallowed, shrugged, and set the glass on the table. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wine received a ninety-two from Wine Spectator,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cIt was so highly allocated we had people offering nearly double the retail price per case. I won a gold medal for that wine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in her chair. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>How on earth could her grandfather consider leaving everything to a man who said their prize wine was fine? It was so wrong, it was almost funny. She would start laughing just as soon as the pain faded a little.</p><p>The door to the kitchen opened and Mia entered. \u201cHi, Joe,\u201d she said as she sashayed toward them.</p><p>He eyed her cautiously.</p><p>Mia rested one hip on the table and leaned toward him. \u201cSo, you\u2019re quite the hunk. Are there more like you at home?\u201d</p><p>Joe made a show of glancing at his watch. \u201cAren\u2019t you up a little late.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cI\u2019m eighteen, Big Brother. All grown up.\u201d</p><p>Brenna waved her hand toward the door. \u201cTorture Joe tomorrow. He\u2019s already nervous enough to bolt.\u201d</p><p>His intense gaze swung toward her. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a little uneasy. It\u2019s perfectly understandable.\u201d</p><p>Mia pouted. \u201cBut I want to ask about his friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Her baby sister ignored the hint. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t want to talk about yourself, what about us? Are we family yet?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSorry, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna says Grandpa Lorenzo is going to want to leave you everything. That has to be exciting.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s expression turned unreadable. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about offending me. I was never going to run the place. I\u2019m sure there will be cash settlements on the girls, which makes me happy. But still, it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA forty million dollar big deal,\u201d Brenna murmured, feeling sick to her stomach.</p><p>Joe frowned. \u201cThe old man doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Brenna told him. \u201cTraditional Italian grandfathers love to leave the family business to their grandsons. That would be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you accept?\u201d Mia asked eagerly. \u201cI would. I mean you can sell it or leave Brenna in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the endorsement,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>She wanted to run from the room, but it was like watching a car accident. She couldn\u2019t seem to tear herself away, even though the truth was going to cut her to her bones.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say no,\u201d Joe admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s not an issue yet.\u201d</p><p>Brenna swallowed hard. \u201cIt will be. Try to act surprised. It will make my grandfather happy.\u201d</p><p>Mia pushed off the table. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go now. But I\u2019ll be hanging around tomorrow. We can get to know each other and you can tell me all about your hunky friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Joe muttered and returned his attention to his dinner.</p><p>Brenna was grateful for the few minutes of silence. She had to collect herself, to figure out how to act normal. This wasn\u2019t news. She\u2019d known that Joe showing up was a possibility, and if he did...</p><p>Maybe Grandpa Lorenzo wouldn\u2019t offer him everything, she told herself, even as she didn\u2019t believe the words. Maybe...</p><p>She sighed. Maybe she should just get used to the fact that the odds of her ever running Marcelli Wines was about zero. She had a plan, a chance for success with her own thing. That was good. Better than good. It was great.</p><p>Five minutes later Joe finished dinner. Brenna led him upstairs to the guest room at the end of the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou have your own bathroom,\u201d she said as she pushed open the bedroom door. \u201cSleep as late as you would like.\u201d She grinned. \u201cUnless you want to rejoin the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He tossed his duffel onto the floor, then crossed to the window. It faced the backyard. From there he could see the people milling around.</p><p>\u201cSorry I came?\u201d he asked without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy being here could change a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your grandfather, too. Even though you\u2019ve just found out about us, you\u2019re still family.\u201d She searched her heart. \u201cI can\u2019t regret that you exist.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She moved to the window and stood next to him. \u201cI know this is all a little overwhelming, but you\u2019ll get used to us with time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d settle for keeping the names straight.\u201d</p><p>He was big and tall and despite her teasing, he probably did know fifty-seven ways to kill her. But that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t currently out of his element.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think about what your real family was like?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d He closed the blinds. \u201cI never pictured anything like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so. Who could possibly dream up the Marcellis?\u201d She touched his arm. \u201cI need to get back to the party. Want me to check on you later?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d She walked to the door. \u201cYou will still be here, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you didn\u2019t get to be who and what you are by quitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door and stepped into the hall. \u201cDespite everything, I\u2019m glad you decided to pay us a visit, Joe. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The party buzz about the stranger reached Nic about the same time he figured out why the guy looked familiar and who he was. The Marcelli family\u2019s long-lost son.</p><p>Marco finally returned to the microphone. He looked shell-shocked, but happy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had something of a surprise,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cAfter many long years our firstborn son has returned to us.\u201d He waited for the swell of conversation to die down. \u201cJoe is going to be staying with us for a few days, so most of you will get the chance to meet him. In the meantime, I would like to return to the reason for our celebration and toast the engagement of my daughters Katie and Francesca.\u201d</p><p>Nic raised his glass. Brenna had gone into the house with her brother and had yet to return. Not sure why it mattered, or why he gave a damn, he kept an eye on the back door. The emotional surge he\u2019d experienced when she\u2019d hurried off to greet a strange man had faded, leaving behind a certain level of confusion. Why did he care if Brenna was interested in some other guy? He and Brenna weren\u2019t together. He had no claim on her. No way he\u2019d been jealous.</p><p>The rational part of his brain assured him there was a logical explanation. The penis-run part grunted something about wanting sex again. He did his best to remember his plan and why it was important. Nothing personal, he reminded himself. Just business.</p><p>And his business plan might have just taken a dump...at least for the moment. The existence of a male heir could change things. Lorenzo Marcelli was nothing if not traditional, and traditional Italian patriarchs left the family business to the firstborn son. Did that mean Marcelli wasn\u2019t going to be for sale? Or did it mean he only had to wait?</p><p>Joe Larson was unlikely to enjoy running a winery for very long. Nic was pretty sure he could convince the man to take the money and run.</p><p>Nic started for the house, only to stop when Lorenzo stepped in front of him. The old man glared at Nic.</p><p>\u201cNo Giovanni is welcome here.\u201d</p><p>Nic shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cThere\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get tired of the past? It\u2019s done. No one cares about what happened over sixty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care.\u201d Lorenzo\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cI know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is Antonio Marcelli screwed up. Something happened to his vines, and rather than admit that, he blamed my grandfather. Antonio was jealous of his friend\u2019s success. It\u2019s an old story.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo stared at him for a long time. \u201cYou think you know so much,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThat the new ways are always better. Things happened for a reason. You claim that your family is the injured party, accused of a crime they didn\u2019t commit. Are you sure? You weren\u2019t there. What do you know of the truth?\u201d</p><p>Mia sidled up to Lorenzo and beamed at the old man. \u201cAre you torturing our guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the old days.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cGrandpa, it\u2019s a party. You need to have a little fun. Why don\u2019t you take Grandma Tessa for a spin around the dance floor and show her a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. This one...\u201d He moved closer to Nic.</p><p>\u201cTrying to take me on, old man?\u201d Nic asked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fight you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but you\u2019ll do something.\u201d Lorenzo\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you want with my granddaughter?\u201d</p><p>Mia winced. \u201cGrandpa, you really don\u2019t want to ask that question. I mean what if Nic answers it?\u201d</p><p>The old man took a step back. \u201cThis is not the time, not with guests here. But soon. You and I, we are not finished.\u201d</p><p>Nic liked the idea of a challenge. \u201cI look forward to our next meeting.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo muttered something in Italian, then stalked away. Mia watched him go.</p><p>\u201cWant me to tell you what he said?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well. It wasn\u2019t very polite.\u201d She linked arms with Nic. \u201cThis has been the best party. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so exciting. Joe arriving, you fighting with my grandfather. So what did you think of our brand-new big brother? Isn\u2019t he a hunk? Cute, but very annoying. He practically accused me of being a baby. I mean, come on. Do you really think it\u2019s so awful that I want to meet some of his manly Navy SEAL friends?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat I really think is that I\u2019m glad I\u2019m an only child.\u201d</p><p>Mia huffed out a breath. \u201cOh, please. I\u2019m the best sister. I\u2019m newly single and I\u2019m not in school for a few more weeks. This is my time to cut loose and be wild. Once classes start, I have to be all mature and stuff. So if I can\u2019t do the Navy SEAL thing for a while, how about a ride on your motorcycle?\u201d</p><p>He removed her hand from his arm. \u201cYou accused me of being trouble, but you\u2019re the one who needs watching.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips curved. \u201cReally? You like to watch?\u201d</p><p>He took a step back. \u201cDon\u2019t go there, Mia. I\u2019m not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re for Brenna?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNever mind. I know you\u2019re not going to answer that. Come on. You can dance with me until my sister returns to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the couples already on the dance floor, then back to the eighteen-year-old sex kitten in front of him. \u201cNo slow dances.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cFine. No touching. What is it with you older guys? You\u2019re all so uptight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot uptight. Afraid. We\u2019re all very afraid.\u201d</p><p>Brenna kicked off her shoes and shifted on the top step of the porch. It was well after two and while she knew she had to get back home, she didn\u2019t want to leave. Not that she wanted to stay. Being around Nic made her nervous.</p><p>She stared up at the night sky. They were far enough away from any large city for the stars to be visible. Hundreds of lights twinkled like rhinestones on black velvet.</p><p>\u201cMia needs a keeper,\u201d Nic muttered.</p><p>Brenna chuckled. \u201cProbably. I think she completely freaked out Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she wanted to meet his friends. She\u2019s only eighteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMia has always been older than her years. Don\u2019t forget, she\u2019s been in college since she was sixteen and she\u2019s been engaged. She\u2019s way more worldly than I was at her age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day someone is going to take her up on one of her blatant offers, and then where will she be?\u201d</p><p>Brenna turned to look at the man sitting next to her. \u201cIn someone\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your baby sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Her relationship to me doesn\u2019t prevent her having sex.\u201d</p><p>Nic glanced at her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Mia? I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about Mia. About Joe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that. Can I say I don\u2019t want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She thought about all that had happened. \u201cHis arrival changes everything. He\u2019s interested in inheriting. Who wouldn\u2019t be? It\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather hasn\u2019t left him anything yet. Maybe you should wait to panic.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and managed a smile. \u201cOh, sure. Be rational. So like a guy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI mean it, Brenna. Lorenzo may be old-fashioned, but he\u2019s not an idiot. Why would he leave everything to someone who knows nothing about the business?\u201d</p><p>She desperately wanted to believe Nic, and in a way, what he said made sense. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cMia told me my grandfather tried to take you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if the situation got ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe discussed the feud, taking opposite sides, of course. Don\u2019t worry. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt that. Nic was more than capable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been quite an evening,\u201d she said as she pulled her legs to her chest and rested her arms on her knees. \u201cSo what did you think? This was your first Marcelli party and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of surprises. Your brother showing up was unique entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. I hope we don\u2019t have an even bigger surprise at the double wedding.\u201d</p><p>They were sitting close enough that when he moved, his shoulder brushed against hers. In the still night she could almost hear him breathing. Her skin prickled with awareness.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh, no they didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I have the emotional energy to deal with one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use any birth control.\u201d</p><p>Those six words exploded in her brain. Brenna swore under her breath. No way. That wasn\u2019t possible. She was more responsible than that. Never once in her life, not even all those years ago when she\u2019d been so in love with Nic had she ever allowed herself to be so swept away that she didn\u2019t even think about birth control.</p><p>She straightened her legs and crossed her arms over her midsection. Talk about going from sexual interest to horrified panic in less than fifteen seconds. Thank God for modern science and birth control pills.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t health issues with me,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut there are other considerations.\u201d</p><p>He sounded remarkably calm. In his position she would have been shrieking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the Pill,\u201d she told him hastily. \u201cI meant to go off it after Jeff and I separated, but my doctor warned me I would have mood swings. With all the stuff going on with my grandfather and the winery, followed by my decision to start my own winery, this didn\u2019t seem like a good time to be emotionally unstable.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to justify being on the Pill to me. I\u2019m not in a position to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>Now that he\u2019d brought it up, she had no choice but to remember everything they\u2019d done and how fast it had all happened. One second they\u2019d been talking and the next clothes were flying and bodies joining. Her insides quivered at the memory.</p><p>\u201cWe always did have that effect on each other,\u201d she said, not looking at him as she spoke. \u201cI would have thought we\u2019d outgrown it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell from his tone if he thought that was a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cI try to keep my business life and personal life separate,\u201d he said.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWe have a lot of history. Between working together after all this time and our past, it was probably just one of those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was.\u201d</p><p>Damn. That was not the answer she wanted. She wanted their close encounter of the intimate kind to have meant something to him. If the passion was still alive, didn\u2019t that mean that other things from their past could be lurking under the surface? Did she want that?</p><p>\u201cWomen frequently view me as a sex object, so what happened tonight isn\u2019t a surprise.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled confidently. \u201cWomen want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in there\u2019s a herd of them roaming the world, lusting after your person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women in my office think I have a great butt. Maggie told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m amazed there\u2019s room for you and your ego in the same room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t make this up. I\u2019m just passing along the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I hate being part of a crowd, I\u2019ll do my best to rein in my baser instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it on my account.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if that was an invitation or more teasing. Not that she wasn\u2019t tempted, but she\u2019d already played with fire once this evening. She should probably stop while she was unscathed and give thanks that she got off easy.</p><p>She stood. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to head home. I\u2019ll leave you to deal with your fan club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I made you president? You\u2019d be great at the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if it paid enough to make a dent in my loan to you.\u201d</p><p>He rose and followed her to the car. Once there, he opened the door and she slid inside. She rolled down the window, then closed the door.</p><p>He leaned close and touched her cheek. \u201cIt just happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re adults. We can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The truth was she didn\u2019t know if she could handle it, but she didn\u2019t have much choice.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt was a hell of a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I know how to show a guy a good time.\u201d She started the engine. \u201cSee you, Nic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safely.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and stepped back. She put the car in gear and headed down the driveway. Toward home. Yet she felt as if she\u2019d left a part of herself behind.</p><p>12</p><p>Brenna stood beside the truck and randomly picked up bunches of Cabernet grapes. After inspecting the color to make sure they had ripened evenly, she picked off a grape and tasted the fruit.</p><p>The foreman of the picking crew watched her. She let the rich flavors settle on her tongue, then swallowed.</p><p>\u201cJust right,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ram\u00f3n smiled. \u201cI told you. Wait one more day and the grapes will be perfect.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou said wait one more day because you were still working at Wild Sea.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNic wanted more handpicked than he\u2019d first said.\u201d</p><p>Brenna would like to think that was her influence, but she had her doubts. Nic\u2019s idea of a perfect vineyard would be one that was completely mechanized. Imagine the profit margin if no human ever had to get involved in the process from planting to slapping the label on the bottle.</p><p>Not that she planned to tell him any of that to his face. She still owed him for what he\u2019d told her the night of the party. That her grandfather wasn\u2019t crazy enough to leave the winery to a stranger.</p><p>Nic\u2019s words made sense and she clung to them with all her strength. So far they\u2019d allowed her to relax enough to get on with her life. Not that she had much choice in that.</p><p>She waved the truck in and stepped back to let it drive into the courtyard, where dozens of workers stood ready to unload the baskets of grapes. While Ram\u00f3n discussed the yield per acre, she made notes. The sun was high in the sky, the afternoon warm. Perfect harvesting weather. The seven-day forecast didn\u2019t show any rain. If that held true, they could be finished with the Cabs by next Wednesday. This was turning out to be a very good year.</p><p>Humming to herself, she pulled several baskets off the truck, then climbed onto the flatbed and picked several clusters of grapes from baskets toward the front. The dark purple color made her smile. Ram\u00f3n\u2019s crew knew their business.</p><p>\u201cHow ever much you\u2019re paying him it\u2019s too much,\u201d her grandfather called as he came around the corner of the winery.</p><p>Brenna jumped off the truck. She hadn\u2019t seen her grandfather since the party the previous Saturday. Work had kept her busy. It wasn\u2019t as if she was actually avoiding him...well, not too much.</p><p>As her grandfather picked a handful of grapes from the baskets being carried inside, she braced herself for the inevitable criticism. Lorenzo Marcelli was all backslapping good humor with Ram\u00f3n, but Brenna wasn\u2019t fooled. He would taste the grapes and then turn on her with one complaint or another.</p><p>\u201cGood harvest,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bottle more this year than we did last year.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cYou dishonored the family. Last Saturday was about your sisters. You brought an enemy into this house and turned all the attention on yourself.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know what to say to that. The accusation was so unfair that words failed her. Not that it mattered. He wasn\u2019t finished with her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who that boy is? Do you know what his family did to us?\u201d</p><p>For a second Brenna was so caught up in Nic being called a boy that she didn\u2019t catch the rest of it. But when her grandfather\u2019s words sank in, she threw down her clipboard and planted her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly who Nicholas Giovanni is, Grandfather. Not only did I grow up next door to him, but you\u2019ve told us all the story of the great grapevine scandal so many times, I could recite it in my sleep. And you know what? I don\u2019t care.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her grandfather flinched.</p><p>She narrowed her gaze. \u201cHere\u2019s a news flash for you. Ten years ago I fell in love with Nic. Yup, me. One of your precious granddaughters, flesh of your own flesh. We met and started dating.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then decided it was best not to mention that she and Nic had been lovers. Her grandfather probably wanted to hear about that as much as she wanted to hear about him and Grandma Tessa doing the wild thing.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked about wine and life and I really cared about him. In fact, I almost married him. And you know what? The heavens didn\u2019t open. The sky didn\u2019t fall. The feud is long over, and it\u2019s time for all of us to move on.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather\u2019s expression turned thunderous. \u201cHow dare you tell me this? You go behind my back and see the son of my enemy? You disrespect the family so much?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands to her sides. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? No one cares about that but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI follow tradition. I listen to the counsel of those wiser than me. Something you could learn from. Already you have one husband who leaves you. Nearly thirty years old and what do you have to show for your life?\u201d</p><p>Brenna felt as if he\u2019d slapped her. She took a step back. But he wasn\u2019t done with her.</p> <p>\u201cYou disappoint me, Brenna. I can find nothing to be proud of. Not with you. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>She told herself he was going for the cheap shot, but that didn\u2019t make his words hurt any less. Her throat burned and her chest tightened. When exactly did one become grown-up enough to hear the words \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you\u201d and not want to crawl under a rock?</p><p>She picked up the clipboard and headed for the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d her grandfather asked.</p><p>\u201cAway from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will stay. I asked Joe to come out and see the grapes as they came in today. Ah, there he is.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna looked up and saw her brother heading toward them. Joe glanced from her to Lorenzo, as if sensing tension.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d her grandfather said. \u201cThe Cabernet grapes are just ripe. We will produce a beautiful wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw some guys out picking today,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt looks like hard work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Brenna said. \u201cWant to volunteer to join the crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I\u2019m on vacation.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather motioned to the vines by the winery. \u201cCome. We will walk and I will tell you how we take grapes and make the best wine anywhere. Brenna, you come, too.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if this was another form of torture or her grandfather\u2019s way of saying he forgave her. As she didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done anything wrong, she wasn\u2019t thrilled with either alternative.</p> <p>They headed east to where the Cabs were being picked.</p><p>\u201cSee there?\u201d her grandfather said. \u201cWe still pick by hand for our best grapes. The rest are harvested by machine. Not the old way, but the cost of the labor is so high.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe have to make compromises.\u201d</p><p>Brenna clenched her teeth. Right. Talk to Joe about compromises and talk to her about betrayal.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know which grapes deserve hand-picking?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about quality,\u201d her grandfather said. \u201cThe history of the vines. What we have made before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are several factors,\u201d Brenna told him. \u201cYield per ton, for example. Some grapes produce more juice; some are sweeter, more tart. Some blend better; some stand on their own. It can change from year to year, but our most consistent quality vines get the best treatment. Those vines produce the premium wines, the Reserves. Hand-picking means we pick only the best, ripest grapes. The machines pretty much grab everything, so there\u2019s less control.\u201d</p><p>Joe wore a loose T-shirt over his jeans. He tugged on the crew neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarm and dry.\u201d Brenna kicked at the loose earth. \u201cWe pray for warm and dry during harvest. Before that, it\u2019s a balance. Too little sun and the grapes won\u2019t ripen. Too much and they burn, overripen, or produce too much sugar. We need rain for irrigation, but not so much that there isn\u2019t sun and the plants get mold.\u201d</p><p>Joe glanced around at the vines. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work. To be honest, I don\u2019t get the whole wine thing. I\u2019m more of a beer drinker myself.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned when her grandfather\u2019s mouth pinched as if he\u2019d just tasted a lemon.</p><p>\u201cYou will learn to appreciate the subtleties of wine.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not a real subtle guy. A good steak and a beer is more to my taste.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather seemed unamused. \u201cYou see all that we have created here. Can\u2019t you feel the pull of the soil? This is where you belong, Joe. This is your heritage. This could all be yours if you were only to ask.\u201d</p><p>Brenna froze. Nic had been wrong. Her grandfather was that crazy.</p><p>Oh, it hurt. She\u2019d known this could happen. The discovery of a long-lost brother had been one of the reasons she\u2019d started Four Sisters. But to have her grandfather spell it out like that\u2014right in front of her, as if he didn\u2019t care that he was ripping out her heart...</p><p>Without saying anything, she turned and walked back toward the winery. Her grandfather didn\u2019t say a word. No doubt with Joe there, he wouldn\u2019t even notice she was gone.</p><p>Lorenzo turned to watch Brenna go. She walked stiffly, as if her muscles wouldn\u2019t cooperate. He\u2019d seen her pain when he\u2019d spoken of Joe inheriting. Seen it, felt it, and regretted it. But he had no choice.</p><p>His grandson shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cSo you\u2019d leave all this to me. Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not \u2018just like that.\u2019 You would have to be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna said the place is worth about forty million.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo shrugged. \u201cPerhaps a little less, perhaps a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a lot of money.\u201d Joe stared at the vines.</p><p>\u201cSo you could be interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your granddaughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would be provided for. A nice settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Joe turned to him. Lorenzo tried to read his face, but the young man\u2019s expression didn\u2019t give away his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Brenna love this place?\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo brushed off the information with a flick of his hand. \u201cShe is a woman. This land, this heritage, it must be in the hands of a male heir.\u201d</p><p>Joe snorted. \u201cHas anyone told you what century we\u2019re in?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI am very aware of the passage of time. That is part of the problem.\u201d His smile faded as he continued to watch Brenna move away.</p><p>\u201cWomen can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d he said, more to himself than to his grandson. \u201cThey marry. They move away. They no longer care about what is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking about Brenna. She loves this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow. But before?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe left as if we all meant nothing. And for what?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d disappeared as if she had never been. He remembered how he\u2019d waited for her to realize that the juice of the grapes flowed through her body like blood. That she was one with the land. But no. Instead she\u2019d devoted herself to her husband. And last week. He sighed heavily. A Giovanni, here? His father would never have permitted it. Lorenzo himself had dishonored the memory of his father by letting that boy stay and dine with his family on a night of celebration.</p><p>\u201cYou may know the wine business,\u201d Joe said, \u201cbut I know something about surviving. Ignoring your best resource is a real good way to end up dead. Brenna is the best you have. If you dismiss her, you\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo nodded slowly. \u201cMaybe you are right. Maybe not. Eh? It\u2019s not as if I haven\u2019t been a fool before. Come, I will show you more of what could be yours.\u201d</p><p>Nic walked out of his staff meeting to find Max had abandoned his bed and was nowhere around. Despite being overly friendly, the pup didn\u2019t usually abandon his place by Nic\u2019s office for anyone. With one exception.</p><p>Brenna.</p><p>He checked his watch. It was barely two. Brenna tended to keep late hours when she was at Wild Sea. So if the dog wasn\u2019t waiting for him, where was he?</p><p>Nic went in search of Max and found him ten minutes later. He was stretched across Brenna\u2019s lap in the shade of an old lemon tree by the back of the house. Nic hesitated when he saw the two of them. Brenna sat on the ground, with her head down. Something about the slump in her shoulders told him this had not been her best day. He was torn between wanting to go be a friend and the natural male need to avoid female upset. Friendship won.</p><p>As he approached, Brenna wiped her face and tried to smile. Max barely opened an eye. His tail thumped once in greeting, then he drifted back to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d Nic asked as he settled next to her.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cGood news. I get to tell you you\u2019re wrong. After that, I\u2019m likely to burst into tears and sob all over your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never wrong,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Everything. I mean, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know. I knew. It\u2019s not a surprise or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to translate that into English?\u201d</p><p>She scratched Max\u2019s ears. \u201cMy grandfather told Joe that the winery could be his if he wanted it. Just like that. No training, no love of anything Marcelli, just \u2018here\u2019s your inheritance.\u2019\u201d She turned to look at him. \u201cWhat is it about male heirs? Would I be so damn different if I had a penis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be to me,\u201d he said honestly, more than a little startled that Lorenzo would play his cards so quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she told him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be any more interested in the winery, or smarter or good at my job.\u201d</p><p>That he could agree with. Nic leaned back against the tree. Lorenzo leave the winery to a virtual stranger? Was it possible? If the old man went ahead with it, Nic would have a slight delay of his own plans.</p><p>Brenna looked at him. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re supposed to make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t believe your grandfather is going to leave Marcelli Wines to someone he just met. Joe doesn\u2019t know one end of the bottle from the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he knows that much, but little else.\u201d Despite her obvious pain, she smiled. \u201cJoe admitted he\u2019s more of a beer drinker.\u201d</p><p>Nic leaned toward her and lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve had a beer or two in my life. It wasn\u2019t bad. Don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt last. Blackmail material.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened, then quivered and faded. Tears filled her eyes before falling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so horrible,\u201d she said, covering her face with her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s never happy. Everything is a fight. No matter what I suggest, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She kept talking, but as her tears increased, her voice shook and Nic found it difficult to understand her.</p><p>He reached toward her, then dropped his hand to his side. What was it about a crying woman that made a man feel awkward and inept? \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u201d</p><p>She wiped away the tears. \u201cJust when I think it\u2019s getting b-better, it all falls apart again. He s-said he was disappointed in me. I hate that. I\u2019m twenty-seven years old. Why d-do I care what he thinks? But I do.\u201d</p><p>The last couple of words came out on a sob. Max raised his head and looked at Nic as if asking him why he wasn\u2019t doing something. Oh, because Nic was so clear on the next course of action. Right.</p><p>Feeling like an idiot, he shifted so that he could wrap his arms around her. He drew her close, resting her head on his shoulder and stroking her hair. Max jumped off her lap, stretched, and began sniffing their shoes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry,\u201d Brenna whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m here. When had he ever said those words to a woman? When had he last offered comfort? The situation between himself and Brenna Marcelli was more than a little complicated, but he couldn\u2019t think about that. At this moment she wasn\u2019t the enemy. She was simply Brenna.</p> <p>Slowly her sobs faded. The tears fell less often and her breathing grew more relaxed. He continued to stroke her hair, liking the fresh smell of her shampoo and the way she curled up against him. She was familiar in the best way possible.</p><p>When she straightened, her face was blotchy and her eyes swollen. He dropped his hands as she wiped her face with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured, not looking him in the eye. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get all weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>He handed her a handkerchief. She used it to mop up the last of her tears. Her mouth was swollen, as if she\u2019d been kissing someone. As if they\u2019d been kissing.</p> <p>Once the thought took root, he couldn\u2019t seem to think about anything else. Nor could he stop himself from leaning close and pressing his lips to hers.</p><p>Her skin was damp and salty, and this close she smelled like sunshine and grapes. He wrapped his arms around her again. The passion that was never far below the surface made an instant and powerful appearance, but he ignored the heat and the pressure in his groin. Instead of deepening the kiss, he pulled back and looked into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not incompetent,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re gifted. I admire what you\u2019re doing with Four Sisters, and if your grandfather doesn\u2019t appreciate your vision for Marcelli Wines, then he\u2019s a fool.\u201d He brushed her hair off of her face. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, you\u2019ve impressed the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he spoke the words, he realized he meant them. When he\u2019d first loaned her the money, he hadn\u2019t been sure what was going to happen, but now he knew she would be really big, if given half a chance. Ironically, he and her grandfather were the two men who held her fate in their hands.</p><p>The corners of her mouth turned up. \u201cYou sure know how to turn a girl\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. Maybe that\u2019s why Lorenzo is riding you so hard. He sees that you\u2019ll do better than he did and it bugs him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe. But it\u2019s a stupid reason to leave everything to Joe or sell out.\u201d Her dark eyes clouded. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he would really sell, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already talked about that.\u201d He rose and held out his hand. \u201cCome on. You can help me with my homework. That will distract you from all these questions.\u201d</p><p>She placed her fingers on his palm and stood. \u201cWhat homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Sophia\u2019s diary?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about three pages further along in it. You took Italian in high school, so it can\u2019t be as bad as mine. We\u2019ll work on it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much help I\u2019ll be,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>An hour later he had to concede that her Italian was worse than his. They\u2019d managed to work through half a page, and he wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d gotten any of it right.</p> <p>Brenna picked up the old book and flipped through the densely written pages. \u201cWe could be at this for the rest of our lives. Do you want the practice of translating it or do you just want to know what it says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Mia is the language expert in our family. She\u2019s disgustingly fluent, both reading and writing. This wouldn\u2019t take her very long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d</p><p>She closed the diary. \u201cIf she finds directions to a gold mine on Wild Sea lands, I can\u2019t promise to share the information with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>She took the book. He thought she might say she had to go, but instead of leaving, she leaned back in her chair.</p><p>\u201cI told my grandfather about us.\u201d</p><p>Nic wasn\u2019t sure what \u201cus\u201d she meant. That she had borrowed money from him or that they had made love the other night? No, he told himself. She couldn\u2019t have mentioned\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat we used to go out,\u201d she clarified. \u201cThat we\u2019d met ten years ago and had become important to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She placed the diary on the kitchen table. \u201cHe was going on and on about how horrible it was that I\u2019d brought you to the party. Did I know who and what you were? Who your family was? That sort of thing. I snapped. I told him we\u2019d gone out and that the sky hadn\u2019t fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that impressed him.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He makes me crazy, but that\u2019s hardly news. Unfortunately, he\u2019s getting better at it. This thing with Joe...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wish I could hate my brother, but I don\u2019t. In his situation I don\u2019t think I\u2019d act any differently. Mia\u2019s torturing him about his friends, which makes him squirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you enjoy.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cOh, hell. I need to get back.\u201d She rose and touched his arm. \u201cThanks for listening and letting me blubber all over your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Then she bent down and kissed him before heading for the back door.</p><p>His mouth burned where she\u2019d brushed it with her own. The fact that she\u2019d already left the house didn\u2019t stop his body from responding. He\u2019d always been a sucker where she was concerned.</p><p>He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth as if he could erase the fleeting contact. As if he could change things and make her not matter. She didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t. And yet...</p><p>Things were different. He couldn\u2019t say how exactly, but he could feel them changing. Brenna\u2019s comment about her grandfather\u2019s questions reverberated. Did she know who and what he was?</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t. To her he was Nic, her next-door neighbor, an ex-lover, the guy who had offered to fund her dream for the future. She didn\u2019t know anything about his plans for her family\u2019s business. Brenna might be the better wine maker, but Lorenzo was the smarter businessman. It never hurt to find out too much about a potential enemy.</p><p>Not that Lorenzo knew. No one knew, save his handpicked front men. And Maggie, who disapproved. Maggie, who had spent the last seven years being his conscience. Only this time he wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>13</p><p>Late that afternoon Brenna tapped on Mia\u2019s door. When there was no response, she knocked louder, then pounded on the wood. Finally Mia opened the door and grinned. Her baby sister wore headphones and was dancing to a wild beat only she could hear. In a tank top and shorts, without her makeup, she looked about fifteen.</p><p>\u201cYou scare me,\u201d Brenna said as she stepped into the room. Mia clicked off the Discman and set the headphones on her desk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because I have rhythm.\u201d She proceeded to demonstrate a couple of dance steps that involved fast foot movement and flailing arms.</p><p>\u201cI think what you have is a seizure.\u201d</p><p>Mia stuck out her tongue and sank onto the unmade bed. As usual, her room was a disaster area. Books were piled three deep on the desk in the corner. Piles of clothes covered the bed, the dresser, and the only chair in the room, while several open CD cases formed a free-style hop-scotch pattern on the floor.</p><p>Brenna picked two bras, a skirt, and three T-shirts from the chair and tossed them at her sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to your apartment by school. You keep it relatively picked-up. Why do you live like a wild animal here at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m reverting.\u201d Mia clutched a pillow to her chest. \u201cWhen I\u2019m away I\u2019m an adult, but somehow here at the hacienda I find myself acting like a twelve-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Brenna could think of several humorous and biting comments to make to that statement, but she was here to get Mia\u2019s help. She held up the diary.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>\u201cSophia Giovanni\u2019s diary. Nic has been working on translating it, but his Italian is almost as bad as mine. I thought maybe you could take a look at it. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>Mia took the old book from her, carefully turned the pages, and began to read. \u201cSometimes I walk to the edge of the ocean and let the spray wash my face. I imagine that I\u2019m on a boat that will take me to the ends of the earth.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>Mia looked up. \u201cWhat? That she really wrote that or that I can translate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNever mind. Whenever you demonstrate your proficiency with languages, I remind myself that I can make better wine.\u201d</p><p>Mia chuckled. \u201cOh, right. Because I make you so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot jealous, exactly.\u201d Sometimes Mia was brilliant enough to be intimidating. Not that she would share that thought with her baby sister.</p><p>Mia dropped the diary on the bed and shifted so she was sitting cross-legged. \u201cOkay, so I can pick up a language really easily, but I\u2019m always missing out on the fun stuff. Like you and Nic. When he was twenty, I was maybe seven or eight. No way was he ever going to notice me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t interested in boys when you were seven or eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I am now.\u201d She sighed dramatically. \u201cHere I am in the fresh flower of my womanhood, and Nic is only interested in you.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know what to deal with first. Mia\u2019s \u201cfresh flower of womanhood\u201d or her assertion that Nic was interested in her. If only. He was...</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know what he was, which was probably for the best.</p><p>\u201cWe have a business relationship,\u201d she said primly.</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cNo way. Maybe it started that way when you got the loan, but you brought him to the engagement party. This is not something you do with a business associate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked to be invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Brenna shrugged. She had a feeling his request had something to do with their past, but she wasn\u2019t going to bring that up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just wanted to get back at Grandpa Lorenzo for making my life hell and leaving the winery to Joe.\u201d</p><p>Mia pressed her lips together. \u201cI wish I could do something about that. You know, talk to Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be wasting your breath, but I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should kidnap Joe. If he didn\u2019t show up back at the base or wherever he\u2019s stationed, they\u2019d send some guys to rescue him. Then we\u2019d both win. Grandpa Lorenzo would think Joe was a flake and disinherit him, and I\u2019d get access to a bunch of cute guys.\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cI like that plan. Let\u2019s work on the details.\u201d</p><p>Mia threw herself back on her bed. \u201cOkay. How do we let the base know we only want really attractive single guys on the rescue team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you broke up with David, all you think about is dating. Why is that? I thought you went out when you were in D.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did and it whetted my appetite for the whole boy-girl touching thing. Which is why I\u2019ve been after Joe\u2019s friends, but he\u2019s really uncooperative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s uncooperative?\u201d</p><p>They both turned and saw the man in question standing in the doorway. He surveyed Mia\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cThis place is a mess.\u201d</p><p>She sat up. \u201cI know. It\u2019s part of my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a disorganized mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I\u2019m still too adorable for words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of a few words.\u201d He glanced at Brenna.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing okay?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d been ambivalent when Joe had first arrived, the feeling had only intensified over the past few days. The logical side of her brain told her none of this was Joe\u2019s fault. Oh, sure, he could be a great guy and refuse the offer of more money than he\u2019d ever imagined. But that would make him certifiable. The fact that he\u2019d won the inheritance lottery was just plain lucky for him and sucky for her.</p><p>So she shouldn\u2019t resent him or really want to kidnap him. But a part of her did.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Mia said, patting the mattress.</p> <p>He crossed to the bed and grabbed a handful of clothes, which he tossed onto the dresser, then settled on the mattress, as far from Mia as possible.</p><p>\u201cWe were talking about dating. I\u2019m in desperate need of a meaningless relationship,\u201d Mia told him.</p><p>\u201cGo fishing somewhere else,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIs this a metaphor about my dating your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so macho and brotherly.\u201d She glanced at Brenna. \u201cWas he like this when you first met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I tortured him as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>Mia turned her attention back to Joe. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to protect me, it\u2019s really sweet, but I\u2019m not a virgin. I haven\u2019t been for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Joe winced. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to know that.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned at his discomfort. \u201cIn the girls-against-boys battle, you\u2019re a little outnumbered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuit complaining. You love us,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Brenna wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cWe\u2019re still unfamiliar,\u201d she said. \u201cA regular family would be a big adjustment, but I\u2019m not sure how one gets used to the Marcelli clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d Joe admitted. \u201cYou told me who everyone was when we first met, but I\u2019m not sure I believed there were really that many people living in one house.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and rested his forearms on his thighs. \u201cI don\u2019t remember when my folks told me I was adopted. I always seemed to know. Until they died, I never much thought about my real parents. Then I figured Colleen had given me up because she didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stretched out her hand and touched his. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that at all. She and Dad were too young to stand up to their parents. They weren\u2019t given much of a choice in the matter. Now things are different, but thirty years ago not many sixteen-year-olds were able to keep their babies.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI never thought about how hard it would be to find out you had a whole family you\u2019d never known about. You must be feeling really confused.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019m a SEAL. I don\u2019t have feelings.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna smiled. He looked up, met her gaze, and winked. Mia socked him in the arm.</p><p>Joe glanced around, looking puzzled. \u201cIs there a fly in here? I think it just landed on my arm.\u201d He brushed at the place she\u2019d hit him. \u201cHuh. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>Mia shoved him. He didn\u2019t budge. She sighed heavily, then rested her head on his shoulder again.</p><p>\u201cYou have to like us at least a little,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSome more than others.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHowever you\u2019re acting, I\u2019m glad you decided to come visit. We\u2019re all enjoying getting to know you. Even when you\u2019re uncooperative.\u201d</p><p>Joe put his arm around her. \u201cYou\u2019re tough, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Her curving mouth straightened into a line. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s kinda cool having you around. Things would have been so different if Mom had been able to keep you. Our parents got married anyway. If they\u2019d married then, you would have been one of us from the beginning. Would you have liked that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Joe admitted. \u201cMy parents aren\u2019t Colleen and Marco, and I can\u2019t imagine that changing. If I\u2019d been raised here...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>Brenna understood his ambivalence about even considering an alternative life. If Joe had been around, if she\u2019d known about him, her world view would have changed completely. He would have been the acknowledged heir. While she believed her interest in the vineyards would have always been there, she wasn\u2019t as sure about family pressure. With Joe in the picture, would she have been more willing to take a chance on Nic? With Joe as the one inheriting, would she have been more willing to risk her family\u2019s disapproval?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d been raised here, I would never have been born,\u201d Mia stated.</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cSure it is. I\u2019m okay with it. We all know that the doctors told Mom not to have any more children after you and Francesca were born. Yet she risked her health to try for a boy one more time. With Joe around, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>Brenna couldn\u2019t imagine growing up without Mia tagging along, nor did she want to.</p><p>\u201cLorenzo is too hung up on gender,\u201d Joe muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Brenna\u2019s theory,\u201d Mia said brightly. \u201cThe family business is wine, not breeding, so what does having a penis matter.\u201d</p><p>Brenna winced. \u201cI don\u2019t phrase it exactly like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>Joe ruffled Mia\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you adore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked at Brenna. \u201cAbout this whole winery thing...\u201d he began.</p><p>Brenna cut him off with a shake of her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it. What happens, happens. If Grandpa Lorenzo doesn\u2019t leave it to you, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s going to sell. I can\u2019t...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI have to make my own plans.\u201d Which she\u2019d done. Sure it hurt now, but eventually she would be fine.</p><p>\u201cEveryone says you do a hell of a job.\u201d</p><p>Brenna appreciated the compliment. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to matter much. You\u2019re the firstborn son, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been getting in the middle of all of you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s family. Loving but messy.\u201d</p><p>Mia pouted. \u201cExcuse me, but I\u2019m still in the room. I want to talk about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou\u2019re only interested in dating inappropriate guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I think it\u2019s more about sex,\u201d Brenna said helpfully.</p><p>Joe winced again. \u201cWhat is it with you two?\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised her eyebrows. \u201cNothing. We\u2019re just normal, healthy women looking for love.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cI guess this is where I tell you I\u2019m not a virgin, either?\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cI\u2019m so out of here.\u201d</p><p>Mia raised her palm toward her sister. Brenna slapped her hand against Mia\u2019s in a gesture of victory. Joe groaned.</p><p>He was saved by Grandma Tessa calling up the stairs, telling them it was time for dinner, and to be sure to wash their hands before coming down.</p><p>Joe headed for the door. \u201cWe do this every night,\u201d he complained. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we eat separately, like normal families?\u201d</p><p>Brenna was the last to arrive at the restaurant. She found her three sisters sitting at an outdoor table, in the shade of an oversize umbrella. Between the work she had at home and her new winery, she was running in fourteen directions at once. Mia\u2019s demand that she join them for lunch had been inconvenient. But as she approached the table, she found herself smiling in anticipation. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time the four of them had done something together.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Francesca said as she pulled out the empty chair next to her. \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, we\u2019re going to have to stop talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mia asked as she batted her eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more fun to talk about someone in front of them. Then you get a reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she getting on everyone else\u2019s nerves or just mine?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Katie handed her a menu. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty much annoying us all. Do I want to ask how things are going?\u201d</p><p>Brenna took the menu and shook her head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared. He was in his early twenties, with the tanned good looks of a surfer. \u201cHave you ladies decided?\u201d</p><p>Brenna scanned the menu and nodded. Katie went first. They all ordered salads and iced tea. Mia asked for a side of fries. When the young man had written it all down and left, Mia sat straighter in her chair and cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why I called this meeting,\u201d she said.</p><p>Brenna thought she was kidding, but when she glanced at Mia, she saw her baby sister was completely serious.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing specific,\u201d Mia said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that everything in our family is changing. I\u2019ve felt uncomfortable for a while, and I\u2019ve been trying to figure out where it all started. Maybe with my aborted engagement or Brenna\u2019s separation. Suddenly what was familiar isn\u2019t anymore. Katie, you and Francesca are getting married. Brenna\u2019s starting her own winery. I\u2019m growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we take a vote on that?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>Mia laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d Her humor faded. \u201cI wanted us to get together one more time before everything is different forever.\u201d</p><p>Brenna felt her throat tighten. \u201cGood idea, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Francesca and Katie both nodded.</p><p>Mia preened. \u201cYou keep talking about how smart I am, but then you never pay attention to me. I\u2019ve had tons of brilliant plans that you\u2019ve dismissed over the years.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared with their drinks. When he was gone, Katie picked up her glass.</p><p>\u201cI sense trouble coming,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Mia ignored her. \u201cIt\u2019s true. What about the time I wanted to get Grammy M a membership in a dating service for her birthday? You three wouldn\u2019t listen, but look. She\u2019s dating Gabriel and is really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have met through a dating service,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but she might have met someone else. My point is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cWe are clear on your point, but we don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d</p><p>Mia scowled. \u201cYou guys are always like this. It\u2019s the three of you against me. You stick together because I\u2019m so much younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>Brenna disagreed. It was often true. There were ten years between Mia and Katie, nine years between Mia and herself and Francesca.</p><p>Brenna patted her shoulder. \u201cWe still love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but sometimes I want a little respect.\u201d She brightened. \u201cThe good news is I\u2019m still cool while the three of you are seriously old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow flattering,\u201d Katie murmured.</p><p>Mia picked up her glass. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s why I wanted you all here. So we could reconnect.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at Francesca. \u201cNot a bad idea for a baby.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nodded.</p><p>Katie looked less convinced.</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou have that \u2018Mom\u2019 look you sometimes get.\u201d</p><p>Katie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re really okay. Do you have any regrets about breaking off your engagement?\u201d</p><p>Mia put down her glass. \u201cNo. David and I were really good together, but we were more caught up with having a relationship than actually thinking about what getting married would mean. I reacted to family pressure, and he reacted to being on his own for the first time. We\u2019ve stayed friends and that works.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The waiter appeared with a basket of bread. Mia lunged for it and pulled out a piece, then passed the rest to Brenna.</p><p>\u201cI will admit that I miss the sex,\u201d she said as she scooped up a pat of butter.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Katie said.</p> <p>Francesca looked at Brenna. \u201cWas that just Miss I-Only-Want-Romance expressing interest in sex?\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cProbably because it\u2019s so good with Zach, she can relate now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always relate,\u201d Katie told them archly.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s annoying,\u201d Brenna said. She turned to Mia. \u201cI guess you and I are the only two not getting any these days. I resent that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mia grumbled. \u201cWhen I get back to college, I\u2019m finding a boy toy right off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Katie said. \u201cIf you still plan to rule the world, you need to consider staying single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Mia sighed. \u201cBut single and sex-free aren\u2019t the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sipped her tea. \u201cHow are you doing, Brenna? It was stressful enough when you were just working at Marcelli and starting your own thing. But now, with Joe\u2014are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Brenna wasn\u2019t surprised her sister had brought up the subject. If only talking about it would make things more clear.</p><p>\u201cI like him,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cAnd I hate that Grandpa Lorenzo is going to leave him everything. So while I\u2019m glad Joe is here, I can\u2019t help wishing he\u2019d never been born. Pretty awful, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Katie said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly understandable.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca patted her hand. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you have mixed feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being really brave about it,\u201d Mia said. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d get serious about the kidnapping plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>Mia filled them in on the idea she\u2019d had for getting rid of Joe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll ignore that he\u2019s a trained professional,\u201d Brenna murmured. \u201cI doubt the four of us could take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow embarrassing for him if we could,\u201d Mia said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re overreacting,\u201d Katie said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all just cheap talk on Grandpa Lorenzo\u2019s part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish, but I was there,\u201d Brenna said, trying not to sound as if she cared. \u201cHe flat out told Joe that all of Marcelli could be his. Joe was more than interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich means you were really smart to start your own label,\u201d Francesca told her.</p><p>\u201cI agree. I have to make it a success. And I\u2019m going to. Thank God Nic came through with the money.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d saved her, she thought. Without him she\u2019d be totally screwed.</p><p>The waiter appeared with their salads. Once he left, Brenna picked up her fork. She glanced around and saw her sisters were all staring at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou really brought Nic to the party,\u201d her twin said.</p><p>Brenna nodded slowly. \u201cI asked you and Katie if you would mind and you both said it was fine.\u201d</p><p>Katie glanced at Francesca, then back at her. \u201cSure, but we didn\u2019t think you would actually do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Brenna speared a piece of lettuce. \u201cYou guys could eat.\u201d</p><p>They ignored her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something going on there,\u201d Francesca said firmly.</p><p>\u201cIs this your professional opinion?\u201d Brenna asked, then took a bite of her salad and chewed.</p><p>\u201cThe question is what,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cCut to the chase.\u201d Mia looked at Brenna. \u201cHave you had sex yet?\u201d</p><p>Brenna started to choke. She managed to swallow the food, then drank her tea. While her discomfort was genuine, she couldn\u2019t help but be grateful for the distraction. Mia\u2019s unexpected question had caught her off guard. While she didn\u2019t exactly want to lie to her sisters, she wasn\u2019t willing to tell the truth.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSorry. That went down the wrong way.\u201d She pointed at their untouched plates. \u201cAre you going to eat?\u201d</p><p>Mia looked at Francesca and Katie. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d her youngest sister breathed.</p><p>Francesca reached for Brenna\u2019s hand. \u201cTell us you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Now Brenna felt cornered. \u201cDidn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep with Nic,\u201d Katie said, her voice low.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound convincing, even to herself.</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cYou are so lying.\u201d</p><p>Brenna put down her fork. \u201cLook, Nic and I have a working relationship, nothing more. We used to have something significant, and because of that, we have a past to deal with. Which we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about psychobabble,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Mia grabbed a fry and took a big bite. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the only one not getting laid,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt just happened one time,\u201d Brenna insisted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s gaze was steady. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Absolutely. Cross my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Katie started in on her salad.</p><p>Mia looked smug.</p><p>Francesca dropped her hand to her lap. She didn\u2019t say anything; she didn\u2019t have to. Her knowing look was enough to get on Brenna\u2019s nerves.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that \u2018all things happen for a reason\u2019 crap,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not cosmic. It\u2019s hormones and circumstances. Given the past Nic and I had together, it was practically inevitable. But it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t your fault?\u201d Mia asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Francesca warned.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be careful about. We\u2019re just working together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd having sex,\u201d Mia said with a grin. \u201cWas it amazing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not answering that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means yes,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Brenna wanted to scream with frustration. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not being honest with us or yourself,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cNic is appealing on many levels. You have a past, now you work together. You said there\u2019s chemistry. It\u2019s a volatile situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that matter if she cares for him?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>Francesca considered the question. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Brenna growled. \u201cI\u2019m still sitting here at the table.\u201d</p><p>Mia poked at Brenna\u2019s avocado. \u201cAre you going to eat that?\u201d</p><p>Brenna slapped her fingers. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you care about him?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>This time Brenna was telling the truth. Did \u201ccare\u201d describe her feelings for Nic? While having any emotional vulnerabilities where he was concerned made her nervous, \u201ccare\u201d was a whole lot safer than several other feelings she could name.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for me,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI appreciate that. He\u2019s the reason I had the chance to start my own thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was pretty cool at the party,\u201d Mia pointed out.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa Lorenzo tortured him and everything and he was polite. He could have gotten all huffy. Obviously he\u2019s ready to put the past behind him, at least about the feud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the rest of it behind you, too?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>Brenna considered that. \u201cMost of it.\u201d But not all. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the diary,\u201d Mia said. \u201cI give him a big thumbs-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat diary?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cSophia Giovanni\u2019s.\u201d Brenna explained how Nic had been translating it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get very far into it, but what he found was interesting. Before Sophia married Salvatore Giovanni, she was in love with Antonio.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOur Antonio? Our great-grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one. They knew each other before he and Salvatore came over to start the wineries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s too early to have contributed to the feud. The falling-out between the friends didn\u2019t happen for another fifteen or twenty years. Unless they were still in love.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cThey were married to other people. No way they could have stayed in love that long. Absence doesn\u2019t make the heart grow fonder, it makes it forget.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cHow did you come by this tidbit of knowledge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just makes sense. Without nurturing, love dies.\u201d</p><p>Brenna knew Mia was right. Years ago she would have sworn she would love Nic forever, but she hadn\u2019t. With time and a different life, she\u2019d let her feelings go. Or maybe they\u2019d faded on their own. Once there had been so much promise, and then one day it had all been gone.</p><p>\u201cLet us know what you find out from the diary,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Mia reached for her iced tea. \u201cSo have you two lovebirds picked honeymoon destinations yet?\u201d</p><p>Francesca murmured something about Hawaii, while Katie mentioned a cruise. Brenna only half listened. Her mind was still on Nic and what had once been. The two of them had managed to have dozens of conversations without ever discussing what had happened. She\u2019d often thought of their past as an elephant in the room that neither of them was willing to talk about. Was it time to change that? Was she willing to go there with Nic?</p><p>Did she have a choice?</p><p>14</p><p>Nic left his office a little after ten. The building was silent and dark, except for the hallway lights the cleaning staff had left on for him. He went out the side door, locking it behind him.</p><p>The night was cool, clear, and quiet. Beyond the main building Wild Sea Vineyards stretched out to the horizon. An owl took flight with a silent flutter of massive wings. Leaves rustled. No light shone a welcome from the house. Nic felt like the last man standing.</p><p>Alone but not lonely. He\u2019d always believed in that. Circumstances, or maybe his own nature, had dictated that he stand on his own. He\u2019d been content to walk life\u2019s path by himself. Friendship was important but not defining, while love...</p><p>Love was a crock of shit.</p><p>He turned from the view and started for the house. As he walked, he caught sight of a familiar vehicle parked by the trees. Brenna\u2019s car.</p><p>It was late, he was tired, and he had a seven A.M. meeting with his managers. While he hadn\u2019t seen Brenna in several days, he told himself he wasn\u2019t interested in talking to her now. Even so, he found himself walking toward the building and entering through the open double doors.</p><p>He found Brenna crouched by a fermenting vat. She checked the temperature, then stood and walked around the large container. Fierce concentration pulled at her features. She inhaled deeply, as if determining how well the process was going by smell alone.</p><p>He remembered the first time he\u2019d found her snooping around the winery. She\u2019d been tasting samples from the reserve barrels. Instead of being afraid or even embarrassed at being caught, she\u2019d had the balls to tell him everything he and his grandfather were doing was wrong. The hell of it was, she\u2019d been right.</p><p>He remembered listening to her talk about wine. All these years later he could still recall the way the sunlight had slipped through the open windows to highlight the hint of red in her brown hair. She\u2019d been pretty, mouthy, and arrogant, and he\u2019d wanted her as he never wanted another woman before or since.</p><p>Nic leaned against the wall and crossed his arms over his chest. She moved to the next vat and made several notations on a clipboard. She was so focused on her work, she hadn\u2019t spotted him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Back then she\u2019d been just as driven, but for different reasons. She\u2019d argued passionately, mocked him, challenged him, and delighted him. For weeks he\u2019d told himself that she was only seventeen to his twenty. Whatever he was thinking about her was not only inappropriate, it was illegal. But he\u2019d been unable to resist. The first time he\u2019d kissed her had been magic.</p><p>It had been in this room with the scent of the wine all around them, on a night not unlike this one. She\u2019d worn shorts and a T-shirt, and her long hair had been pulled back into a ponytail. She\u2019d been talking about grapes or wine because that\u2019s what she always talked about, and he\u2019d cupped her face and kissed her. He could still hear the catch in her breath as his mouth had claimed hers.</p><p>\u201cThe process works even if you don\u2019t check on it every fifteen minutes,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>Brenna dropped her clipboard and jumped. As she turned to face him, she pressed a hand against her chest.</p><p>\u201cStop creeping up on me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m getting old. I could have a heart attack or something.\u201d</p><p>He pushed off the wall and shoved his hands into his jeans pockets. \u201cI think that\u2019s a few years off, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She picked up her clipboard. \u201cWhere\u2019s Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe flaked out a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at her watch. \u201cIt can\u2019t be this late. I got here at seven and was only going to stay a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how you get when you\u2019re making wine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What about you? Lorenzo still making you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019s really good at it. His stubborn streak only makes things worse.\u201d</p><p>Nic took a step toward her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you quit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I already did that once. This time I\u2019m in it until the bitter end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to say that. The words had come out before he could stop them, and now they hung in the air like a flashing neon sign. Would Brenna ignore them or take the bait?</p><p>\u201cFunny you should say that,\u201d she told him, speaking softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about us a lot lately.\u201d She gave a slight smile. \u201cThe old us, not the new us.\u201d</p><p>Was there a \u201cnew\u201d us? he wondered. \u201cForget about it,\u201d he told her as he realized he didn\u2019t want to talk about them or the past. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot acknowledging what happened won\u2019t make it go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cIt matters to me. A lot. I\u2019m going to talk about it. If you leave, I guess I\u2019ll just be talking to myself.\u201d</p> <p>He thought about heading out. He could walk away, and they would never have this conversation. But he didn\u2019t. There were probably a thousand reasons why, but right then he couldn\u2019t think of one.</p><p>\u201cSo talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>She walked to the chairs set up by the small table. He considered staying where he was, in the shadow of the vats, in darkness. He didn\u2019t want to have this conversation; he didn\u2019t want to feel anything. Not again. Time was supposed to heal all wounds. Had it healed this one?</p><p>Silence filled the big room. Finally he gave in to the inevitable and walked over to where she was seated. He pulled out the other chair and settled across from her. She looked at him, then at the floor.</p><p>\u201cI was so in love with you,\u201d she began.</p><p>Her first blow hit below the belt. He stiffened. \u201cYou could have fooled me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to believe me.\u201d She sighed. \u201cActually, I did think you would. Or maybe I just hoped. But whatever you want to believe, I loved you more than I had thought possible. You were my world.\u201d</p><p>Something cold circled inside his belly. \u201cI was third on a short list of two. First was your family, second was the wine. You weren\u2019t willing to give up either, but you walked away from me fast enough.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mattered so much, but my family was...they complicated things. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them, and I was terrified of defying them. My grandfather saw the world in such black-and-white terms.\u201d</p><p>What she meant was she hadn\u2019t been willing to pay the price. \u201cYou think my grandfather was any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was a whisper. \u201cI know he was angry.\u201d</p><p>Angry? Did that begin to describe what had happened when Nic had finally confessed his feelings about Brenna to Emilio? Anger meant yelling and throwing things. Emilio had turned his back on Nic, exiling him from the only home he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Brenna shivered. \u201cI was young, I was scared, and in the end, I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t turn my back on my family. I couldn\u2019t walk away.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been doing his best to avoid the past. Simply talking about it in vague terms allowed him to stay emotionally distant. Nic grabbed hold of his self-control with both hands and vowed to keep the barriers intact. But the first crack had already formed. It grew, ripping through years of trying to forget and pretending it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYou were seeing him,\u201d Nic growled. \u201cThe entire time we were planning to go away together, you were making it with that asshole you married. Did you fuck us both on the same day or did you need a little space to clear your head?\u201d</p><p>Brenna sprang to her feet. Her face paled. \u201cYou know it wasn\u2019t like that. You know I didn\u2019t care about him the way I cared about you. I never slept with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even after the wedding?\u201d</p><p>She turned away. \u201cTalking about this was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>He waited to see if she would walk away\u2014if she had the guts to finish what she\u2019d started. As Brenna had never been one to enjoy confrontation about anything but making wine, he would bet on a quick escape.</p><p>She surprised him by returning to the chair and sitting down. \u201cI met Jeff one weekend when I was down in Los Angeles with Francesca. She and Todd were engaged. There was a big party at someone\u2019s house. Jeff was the younger brother of one of Todd\u2019s friends. I didn\u2019t care about him, I didn\u2019t even think about him again. All I wanted was to get home to you.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. The act was meant to look casual, but it was also instinctive protection. All these years later and he still didn\u2019t want to know what had happened.</p><p>\u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know that you and I were seeing each other, so as far as they were concerned I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend and I showed no interest in dating. They were worried and pressuring me. Francesca mentioned Jeff, which made them happy. They got off me, which meant I was more free to come see you. So when Jeff called to ask me out, I said yes because it made things easier.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. That if I\u2019d told them the truth, Jeff wouldn\u2019t have been a part of my life. I know that now. At the time I just wanted to avoid the fight.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d been thinking. Parts of the story were new, parts he\u2019d figured out. Back then, he\u2019d been aware she had a \u201ccover\u201d boyfriend. He\u2019d pretended he didn\u2019t care, even though he had. He\u2019d pretended not to be hurt by her betrayal, even when it had cut him down to his soul.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with him? Why did this old news claw at his gut? He told himself to get up and leave, but he couldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to hear, and he couldn\u2019t stop listening.</p><p>\u201cI went out with him a few times.\u201d She twisted her fingers together. \u201cI just wanted to be with you. When Jeff went off to Europe with his family for some vacation they\u2019d been planning for years, I was grateful to have him gone. I needed time to figure out what to do. I knew I was making a mess of things, but I still thought I could fix it all. Then you asked me to run away with you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled without humor. \u201cI asked you to marry me. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>She looked scared and miserable. Funny how he would have thought he would find pleasure in her obvious discomfort, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say yes,\u201d she told him. \u201cDeep in my heart, I wanted it so much. I still remember your exact words. You said we\u2019d be like Romeo and Juliet, but with a happy ending.\u201d</p><p>The last of the barrier crumbled to rubble as the past rushed in to surround him. He, too, recalled his exact words. He\u2019d bought a ring, taken her to the beach, and at sunset had asked her to marry him. He\u2019d been idealistic and in love. Whatever challenges the world wanted to offer, they would take on. If their families rejected them, they would start over. Together. Back then his future had been filled with the promise of loving Brenna.</p><p>\u201cYou managed to resist the calling of your heart,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cSmart girl. I made the mistake of following mine.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in her eyes, but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Now it was Nic\u2019s turn to stand. Energy poured through him, and he had nowhere to put it. He paced to the vats and back, then braced his hands on the back of his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me you were just playing,\u201d he said, his voice low and angry. \u201cThat none of it was ever real to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d she insisted. Tears spilled onto her cheeks and she brushed them away. \u201cI was afraid. Is that so wrong? I was eighteen years old, and I was scared of what my parents and grandparents would do.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cYou mean they might make you choose?\u201d</p><p>She flinched visibly.</p><p>Before she could say anything, he continued. \u201cI told my grandfather. I told him I loved you and was going to marry you. He said he wouldn\u2019t let that happen. That if I chose you, I would have to give up everything. My name, my connection with the family, the land, all of it. I chose you, Brenna. I packed my bags and I left. I was ready to go to the ends of the earth with you, and you turned me down. Just like that. I proposed and you dumped me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. More tears ran down her face. She wiped at them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d He shouted the word. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? My grandfather did as he promised. He disowned me. I walked away with nothing, and you married Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Brenna wanted to run. The open doors beckoned her out into the night. If she could go far enough, fast enough, maybe she would forget. Maybe none of this would matter anymore. But she had to stay. She\u2019d started this and it was her responsibility to see it through to the end. She owed Nic and maybe she owed herself as well.</p><p>\u201cI was heartbroken when I heard,\u201d she told him. \u201cI never thought Emilio would really send you away. I wanted to come after you.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her without speaking. She knew he was wondering why she hadn\u2019t. Why she\u2019d let him disappear from her life.</p><p>Sometimes she asked herself the same questions. Those days and weeks were a blur in her memory. Pain was the only constant.</p><p>Nic shook his head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t willing to risk it. Not your family, not the winery. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t come after me.\u201d</p><p>He spoke as if all the anger had drained out of him, leaving behind an empty man who had no energy for anything but resignation. When he released the back of the chair and settled on the seat, he looked weary.</p><p>\u201cSo Jeff was there, waiting,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She rested her elbows on her thighs and dropped her head to her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s all jumbled together. He came back from his trip and spent a lot of time at the house. Later I figured out that he thought we were rich. He must have been really disappointed to find out that my grandfather owned everything and kept very tight purse strings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rubbed her temples. Those days had been among the worst of her life. She\u2019d missed Nic with every breath.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends, nothing more,\u201d she said. \u201cI was shocked when he proposed, and refused. Then my parents found out and they told the Grands. Suddenly everyone but me thought marrying a guy entering medical school was a wonderful idea. You were gone, I was alone.\u201d She swallowed and forced herself to raise her head and look at him. \u201cI took the easy way out. Jeff seemed like the safe choice....\u201d</p><p>Nic\u2019s contempt was as real as the structure of the building. It leaped across the space between them and chilled her bones until they were so brittle she thought they might crack. Words of protest rose to her lips. She wanted to remind him that she\u2019d been barely eighteen, and not very experienced in the ways of the world. That until meeting him, she\u2019d been a good daughter, always doing what was right, what was expected. She wanted to say a lot of things, but knew they wouldn\u2019t matter. Not anymore.</p> <p>Nic\u2019s gaze slid away. He leaned back. \u201cThe hell of it is you weren\u2019t willing to give up the winery for me, but you gave it up for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give it up. I lost it. Somewhere between my two or three jobs at a time to support us and the distance, I realized I couldn\u2019t do it all. I never wanted things to turn out the way they did.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders and glared at him. \u201cYou talk about all of this like you\u2019re the only victim. The truth is we both lost something important. You paid by being exiled by your grandfather. I paid, too. I had a lousy marriage. Okay, I said yes and I walked down that aisle of my own free will. I took the easy way out and I lived to regret it. I lost ten years of living my dream. I didn\u2019t have the children I always wanted. In the end, because I got married and went away, my grandfather no longer trusts me with the winery. You\u2019re back and running Wild Sea. You have everything you\u2019ve ever wanted. There must be some comfort knowing that in the end, you won.\u201d</p><p>Nic shifted on his chair and looked away. An emotion she couldn\u2019t identify moved across his face, then was gone.</p><p>\u201cI spent eighteen months cut off from the only family I\u2019d ever known,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I came back, Emilio was a stranger to me. We never reconciled. I don\u2019t consider that a victory.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna didn\u2019t doubt he\u2019d been scared and angry when his grandfather had sent him away. Nic had gone to France and found work at different wineries there. He\u2019d honed his skills, and when his grandfather had come looking for him, he\u2019d been in a strong position to negotiate.</p><p>\u201cWhat about when he begged you to return?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe was forced to admit he was wrong and he needed you. My grandfather would never have done that. He would have let me go without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>Nic\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cBullshit. Your grandmothers would have ganged up on him so fast, he would have been begging for mercy inside of a day. No Marcelli would ever let one of their own walk away. Family is everything to you people.\u201d</p><p>Brenna straightened. Something in Nic\u2019s voice, something in the tone and the way he spoke the words, sparked memories. All those years ago he\u2019d always wanted to talk about her family. He\u2019d enjoyed hearing about celebrations and arguments and their loud, loving Sunday dinners together. She remembered thinking he\u2019d looked almost hungry to hear the stories.</p><p>Had he been living vicariously through her experiences? Had the Marcellis been the family he\u2019d always wanted? Was his request to go to the engagement party a chance to thumb his nose at them, or had he wanted to see the one thing he\u2019d never had?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if you love my family or hate them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Nic surprised her by saying, \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHate is too strong a word. I resented their hold over you. I didn\u2019t want you to choose them, but I always knew you would. Now it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t it? She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d let the past go. Neither of them had. There was too much energy, too much anger and hurt still alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I did. I\u2019m sorry for being immature, for letting you put yourself on the line and then turning my back on you. I\u2019m sorry I chose Jeff and that I let what was really important get lost in my fear. I\u2019m sorry you got sent away.\u201d</p><p>She could do her \u201csorry\u201d list for fifteen minutes, but it would get boring, so she stopped.</p><p>\u201cNic, I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe there wasn\u2019t anything left to be spoken. Maybe there wasn\u2019t anything left at all.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered involuntarily. \u201cThis can\u2019t be all there is. There has to be more.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cYou know what else there is.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, not sure what he meant, then she got it. Sex. The attraction that was always there, drawing them together, making them want and ache and...</p><p>He stood and moved toward her. She rose as well, but only to back away. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot now. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSo walk away.\u201d</p><p>He moved like a predator. Like a man willing to take what he wanted. She wasn\u2019t afraid, not exactly. And damn it all to hell, she didn\u2019t want to walk away.</p><p>Awareness rippled along her spine. Her skin prickled. Logic dictated that this was a mistake. Making love right now, like this, would be really dumb. She would leave. Right this second.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath to calm herself, but that turned out to be a mistake. The heady smells of fermentation reminded her of all the other times she and Nic had made love in this room. Ghosts of their passionate selves surrounded them. She felt more than heard their sighs of surrender.</p><p>One of them moved closer. She wanted to say it was him, but it could have been her. His gaze settled on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis is just a reaction to the emotionally intense conversation we just had,\u201d she said desperately</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOr chemistry. We\u2019ve always had chemistry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>This time she was sure he was the one who moved, because she was too stunned to get her leg muscles to react. Without thinking, she licked her lower lip. His gaze sharpened, then narrowed.</p><p>Her fingers itched to reach for the hem of her T-shirt and pull it off over her head. She wanted to be naked right this second. She wanted his hands everywhere on her body, his tongue in her mouth, and then she wanted him to take her hard and fast, right up against the wall.</p><p>What she should do was back away. Or tell him no. Saying no would be really, really smart.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cSo shouldn\u2019t we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She had the feeling they were talking about different things.</p><p>He touched her face with his fingers and she was lost.</p><p>Maybe if he\u2019d grabbed her, pulling her close and demanding, she might have been able to resist. Right now strong passion, strong anything, would be a little unsettling. But he didn\u2019t demand or take or use. Instead he stroked her cheek with a light, gentle touch. His dark eyes smoldered with restrained passion, yet he moved as if he had all the time in the world. As if this moment was special and to be savored.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed. In the darkness of not seeing, she depended on her other senses to tell her what was happening.</p><p>She heard the low sound of his breathing, the brush of his shoes against the concrete floor as he stepped closer. She inhaled the scent of his body as it mingled and blended with the yeasty smell of the wine. She felt warm fingertips drifting down her cheek to her jaw and the sweep of his thumb across her throat.</p><p>Her heartbeat sped up. Blood raced through her body. Heat bubbled. Electric anticipation grounded her in place as she waited for the inevitable. The first kiss. The beginning of their\u2014</p><p>His mouth pressed against hers. The warm, tender contact caught her unaware. She jumped slightly, even as her arms rose and closed around him. They pressed together, hard to soft\u2014she wiggled her hips and shifted closer\u2014very hard to soft. He settled his hands on her waist and his lips more firmly on hers. She tilted her head in a movement as familiar as breathing.</p><p>A few minutes ago she\u2019d wanted sex\u2014fast and hot and out of control. But now that he was touching her, she didn\u2019t want that anymore. She wanted to make love with Nic. Maybe it was all the emotions they\u2019d dredged up with their conversation. Maybe it was days and weeks of spending time together. Maybe, given their past, it was simply inevitable.</p><p>She surrendered herself to the moment and the man. When his tongue touched her bottom lip, she parted for him. Last time they\u2019d plunged together, taking, wanting, needing. While the fire still burned within her, making her breasts ache and her thighs tremble, she wanted a slow seduction, not an explosion of uncontrollable need. Either Nic felt the same or he could read her mind.</p><p>Instead of sweeping inside her mouth to claim her, he slipped in with a gentle caress. They kissed leisurely, deeply, rediscovering favorite movements and old resurrected passions. She buried her fingers into the cool, silky strands of his thick hair. His hands moved from her waist to her hips, then slid together and drifted up her back. He circled his palms so he both soothed and excited. When he reached her shoulders, he stopped, then retreated to the middle of her back. Her body clenched in anticipation.</p><p>So much the same...so much different, she thought hazily as Nic broke the kiss. Even before he pressed his mouth to her throat, she\u2019d dropped her head back, exposing herself to him. As his hands came around to her breasts, she grabbed his upper arms. When his fingers grazed her hard nipples, she was already holding on so that when her knees gave out, she wouldn\u2019t fall.</p><p>Even so, the jolt of pleasure left her breathless. She ached there and between her legs. Heat spiraled through her belly, radiating in all directions. She felt her insides melting, as her most sensitive places became swollen and ready.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brenna opened her eyes, then blinked as if coming awake from a dream. Nic\u2019s face was tight with need. As they stared at each other, a muscle twitched by his jaw. He looked exactly the same as he had ten minutes ago, save for the light of desire in his eyes. But as she watched, she would have sworn that parts of the younger man he\u2019d been all those years ago were still visible.</p><p>At some point she\u2019d dropped her arms to her sides. Now he picked up one hand and brought it to his mouth. Still looking at her, he licked the center of her palm, then bit gently on the fleshy pad by her thumb.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out all over. She shivered in both delight and anticipation. It was a game she knew well.</p><p>When he dropped her hand, she reached for his. But instead of bringing it to her mouth, she turned it palm up. He wore a T-shirt. Starting just below the hem of his sleeve, she ran her nails down the length of his arm. She moved slowly, scratching with the lightest touch she could manage. When she reached his hand, she circled the palm.</p><p>He managed to maintain complete control until she raised his hand and took his index finger in her mouth. As she closed her lips around the base and sucked, he flinched. When she circled his finger with her tongue, he groaned.</p><p>His turn was next. Brenna tried to brace herself for whatever he had in mind, but when he reached for the hem of her shirt, she knew she was going to be in trouble. He pulled the garment up and over her head in one smooth movement. Her bra quickly followed.</p><p>The night air was cool against her heated breasts, but she barely noticed. Not with Nic\u2019s smoldering gaze settling on her. As much as she wanted to close her eyes, she knew she had to watch. That was part of the game.</p><p>Using the finger she\u2019d recently had in her mouth, he brushed the very tip of her right nipple. She gasped as pleasure shot through her. He licked his left index finger and touched it to her left breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was too good, she thought as her legs began to tremble. It was too much and yet not enough. Without thinking, she cupped his hands in hers and pushed so that he held the fullness of her curves. Then she leaned forward and kissed him.</p><p>This time they joined in a frenzy of need and wanting. As he plunged into her mouth, she fumbled with the hem of his T-shirt. She thrust her hands up under the fabric so she could rub against his hard chest.</p><p>He took a step back, drawing her with him.</p> <p>She explored the width of his back and the broadness of his shoulders. With each step, they moved farther into the shadows. She had a sense of their destination, and with that realization came impatience. She reached for the button at the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>The fabric was soft from dozens of washings. The button yielded easily enough, but the zipper was another matter. He was so hard, he pushed against the metal teeth and made it difficult for her to draw down the tab. Nor did he seem inclined to help her.</p><p>When they came to a stop by the stairs in the corner, he dropped his hand and took her left nipple in his mouth. The combination of lips and tongue, wet heat and unquenchable desire, made her cry out. She gave up on the zipper and clutched his head to hold him in place. She wanted his mouth there for hours, if not days.</p><p>When he shifted to her other breast, then sensations grew even more intense. As he sucked, need spiraled directly from there to the dampness between her legs. Then she felt his hands on her jeans. Unlike him, she was happy to help. She pushed him away and quickly popped open the button, then jerked down the zipper. After kicking off her sandals, she pushed down both jeans and panties, leaving herself completely exposed.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t in this alone. While she\u2019d removed her clothing, Nic had pulled off his T-shirt, stepped out of his shoes, and was in the process of removing his jeans and briefs.</p> <p>When they were both naked, they stopped. It was unplanned and completely spontaneous, yet as in sync as if it had been choreographed a dozen times. As it had been, she remembered. They\u2019d both loved to look at each other\u2019s bodies. She\u2019d explored the powerful length of his legs, his narrow hips and waist, the muscles across his shoulders. He\u2019d followed every dip and curve until he\u2019d known her body as well as his own.</p><p>Now she started at his feet and worked her way up, looking for the changes in him she hadn\u2019t had time to notice the last time they\u2019d made love. He seemed more muscled, a little more filled out. When her gaze met his, he raised an eyebrow as if asking her opinion.</p><p>By way of an answer, she reached between them and grasped his penis. With a practiced move designed to humble him, she wrapped her fingers tightly around him and stroked from base to head. As she reached the top, she brushed her thumb against the opening, along the seam, then circled around.</p><p>His breath caught, then came out in a slow hiss. She started a second stroke. He responded by reaching between her legs. One finger moved deeply within her, searching through the swollen dampness until settling on that one engorged place of pleasure. They moved together. She moved up and down while he circled her. In a matter of minutes they were both breathing hard.</p><p>When Nic pulled away, she did the same. Arousal pulsed within her. His eyes were dilated and she didn\u2019t doubt hers were the same. A flush spread across her chest. She felt the heat, along with the growing need for release.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d he said, drawing her to the stairs leading to the loft.</p> <p>He bent down and picked up his shirt, then set it on the fourth stair. She sat down and spread her legs.</p><p>He moved between them, but not to enter her. Not yet. Instead he knelt on the first stair and pressed a kiss to the inside of her knee. Tension coiled within her. He kissed his way up her thigh. As he got closer, she reached down and parted herself for him.</p><p>She knew exactly how it was going to feel. She knew that the first touch of his mouth would send her spiraling into another time dimension and that she would quickly lose control. She knew once they started, her orgasms would take on a life of their own with Nic as their master, making them return again and again as he bid them. She braced herself both physically and emotionally.</p><p>Even so, she was unprepared for the impact of his soft, wet, openmouthed kiss.</p><p>The feel of tongue and lips swirling together against her most sensitive, intimate place made her toes curl. She pulled her legs back even more. Her entire body arched into his caress. He licked all of her, then sucked on her swollen center, all the while flicking the very tip with his tongue. At the same time he slid two fingers into her and slipped them back out. On the second thrust, she came.</p><p>Her orgasm rocked her very being. Shudders originated from between her legs, flowing outward until every muscle had clenched and released dozens of times. She couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t do anything but feel the pleasure sweeping through her.</p><p>And Nic...he didn\u2019t stop. Just when she\u2019d slowed and started to relax, he plunged into her again. At the same time, he used his mouth to push her back to the place of unbearable tension. He knew exactly how hard, how fast, how everything.</p><p>She came over and over until she could only gasp for breath and whisper his name.</p> <p>Finally he raised his head. She opened her eyes and saw him looking at her. She tried to relax, but it was too late. She was within his sexual power, and please God, may it never stop.</p><p>He continued to move his fingers inside of her. She told herself it wasn\u2019t enough, but of course it was. Tension seized her again and she found herself convulsing around him. She felt the spasm of her release, and from his expression of satisfaction, knew he did, too.</p><p>He watched her climax at least half a dozen more times, then he moved up a step or two so that when he pulled out his fingers, he pushed in his erection.</p><p>She screamed with her release. The sound of her pleasure filled the old building. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer. She went willingly. Despite the tremors rippling through her body, she managed to draw her legs around his hips.</p><p>They clung to each other as they made love there on the stairs, surrounded by fermenting wine and echoes of the young couple who had matched their every move so many years before. Brenna found herself watching Nic as he watched her. She climaxed with nearly every thrust. They were naked and joined in the most intimate way possible. She should have felt embarrassed or awkward, but everything about this felt exactly right.</p><p>Suddenly he stiffened. He pulled her closer still, then shuddered. She felt the convulsion of his muscles as his body surged through its climax, and then they were still.</p><p>15</p><p>Reality returned in the form of stiff muscles and a growing sense of the cold. Brenna dropped her feet to the stairs and felt the first flicker of second thoughts. Could they really have done this again? She expected Nic to pull away, but he didn\u2019t. Instead he brushed his fingers against her face, as he had when all this had started.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI will be when my heart rate returns to normal. Currently it\u2019s in the active range for a hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check out the damage.\u201d</p><p>He slid out of her, then pushed to his feet. Brenna tried to straighten her legs, but she wasn\u2019t used to being so pretzellike, and everything hurt.</p><p>Nic rubbed the small of his back. \u201cMe, too,\u201d he said. He held out a hand to her.</p><p>She took it and let him pull her to a standing position. They both hobbled for a couple of seconds, then Brenna started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so old,\u201d she said. \u201cTen years ago this was nothing. I can\u2019t even remember all the positions we did it in.\u201d</p><p>Nic started to look insulted, then he shook his head and chuckled. He wrapped his arm around her and pulled her close. She snuggled against him. He kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. You\u2019re going to be limping tomorrow because of this.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her. \u201cSo are you and not because your legs are stiff.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the flush that heated her cheeks and his satisfied male \u201cI pleased my woman\u201d expression. \u201cGo get my clothes.\u201d</p><p>He handed over her bra and panties, then picked up her jeans and shirt. He pulled on his jeans but simply tossed his T-shirt over his shoulder.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak. By mutual agreement they walked out of the building together. She turned off the lights, and he closed the door. After wrapping his arm around her, he led her toward her car.</p><p>Once there, he brushed her hair off her face and kissed her. She clung to him as long as she dared, then sighed.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d half hoped he would ask her to spend the night. A part of her wanted to go to sleep in his arms and then wake up in them. But even as the vision of how they would actually spend their night formed in her head, she knew it wasn\u2019t possible. Her? Here? If her car wasn\u2019t parked by the garage when the Grands woke up, they would call in the FBI.</p><p>Her mouth twisted. When exactly was she going to grow up enough not to care what her family thought of what she was doing?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust me. I think I need therapy.\u201d She raised herself on tiptoe and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m saying good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, then got into her car. He stood watching her drive away. As she turned onto the highway, she glanced in the rearview mirror. He was still standing there, as if making sure she was safe. Or was that just wishful thinking on her part?</p><p>Lorenzo wrote slowly on the lined yellow pad in front of him. Since turning seventy, he\u2019d endured the steady encroachment of arthritis, first in his knees, then his hips, and now in his hands. Brenna insisted a computer would be easier for him, that tapping the keys would hurt less than writing, but he had yet to find out. Despite the fact that a large, ugly machine had been installed in his office, and that his secretary turned it on for him every morning, Lorenzo hadn\u2019t used it for more than a place to drape his jacket. He ignored the flashing cursor and the occasional clicks and whirs that drifted from the rectangular box on the floor. The new ways were not for him. He was too old to want to change so much.</p><p>Tessa, his wife of over fifty years, disagreed. She enjoyed new technology. When Mia was at her language school in Washington, Tessa had e-mailed her every day, then printed out the responses and read them to him before they went to bed.</p><p>Women dealt with change better than men, he acknowledged grudgingly. Perhaps because they were born knowing that time was liquid and always moving. They understood that the babies to come from their bodies would eventually grow and leave. Hearts were broken and then mended. For women, the world was shades of gray. Men saw only black and white.</p><p>He finished writing and carefully tore off the page. His secretary would type up his letter and send it out, but first she would remind him that even if he didn\u2019t want to use the computer, he could simply dictate into a tape recorder. She would transcribe his words, saving him the pain of carefully forming each word. He did not bother to tell her that he\u2019d used his tiny handheld recorder to prop up an unsteady table and that when Mia had later sat on the table, the small machine had been crushed.</p><p>He read over the letter, then dropped it into his out basket. Now that he was finished, he slowly flexed his aching hands, then opened the top drawer and reached for the pain medicine he kept there. At his age, pills were tangible markers of time. Each hour or two meant another medication, another glass of water, another aftertaste left on his tongue. Whenever he complained, Tessa reminded him that the alternative was no pills, no bitter taste, only darkness and the earth reclaiming his body. Then she would pull the rosary from her pocket and take a quick trip around the beads to ward off any inadvertent invitation of death brought on by their conversation.</p><p>He smiled at the thought of his wife. He was an old man, and yet he loved her more today than on the day they married. God had blessed him in many ways. His son, his grandchildren, the bounty of the earth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lorenzo shook his head. Was his mind to go next? He refused to become maudlin about his good fortunes. Despite his complaints, his doctor assured him he would probably see eighty and beyond. Plenty of time to annoy those he loved most.</p><p>A knock on the door to his office distracted him. Lorenzo glanced up. \u201cCome,\u201d he called.</p><p>The door opened and Joe entered.</p> <p>Antonio, Lorenzo thought sadly. That was the name he had picked out for Marco\u2019s firstborn son. There had been so many hopes and plans. So much that went wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou come to see me,\u201d Lorenzo said, trying not to sound too pleased.</p><p>Joe crossed to the chair in front of the desk and pulled it out. He moved like a man used to trouble\u2014carefully and with purpose. Lorenzo liked that. Joe was young and strong, all the things his heir should be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to say good-bye,\u201d Joe said as he took a seat. \u201cI\u2019ve reached my limit of family bonding.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo frowned. \u201cYou cannot go. Your life is here now. With the vines.\u201d</p> <p>Joe shook his head. \u201cNot my style. I told you, I\u2019m a beer drinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your inheritance? You could have all this.\u201d He spread open his arms. \u201cHow can you walk away from what I have to give you?\u201d</p><p>Joe chuckled. \u201cYeah, right. This isn\u2019t a gift. Not any of it. If you were handing me a check, I\u2019d give it some thought, but you want me to buy into what you have here. The whole Marcelli heritage. Sorry, but I\u2019m not in the market for that kind of responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You must stay. I insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your call.\u201d He leaned toward Lorenzo. \u201cYou\u2019re playing some game with everyone, especially Brenna, and I won\u2019t be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game? There is no game.\u201d Lorenzo pushed painfully to his feet and walked to the far wall. He motioned for Joe to come with him. When they were standing next to each other, Lorenzo realized the younger man topped him by several inches. That pleased him. Every generation should be bigger, more powerful. It was the way of the world. Strength improved the family.</p> <p>He pointed to the map on the wall. It was old, dating back to the 1920s, and drawn by hand. It detailed much of the county, oriented so the Marcelli land was in the center.</p><p>\u201cFrom the old days,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father, your great-grandfather, drew this himself. This is who we are.\u201d He tapped the yellowing paper. \u201cThis is what is important to us.\u201d</p><p>Joe studied the map. \u201cDid he do this before the feud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Many years before. Things were much simpler then.\u201d Friends were friends, he thought. When friends became enemies, the world became a more difficult place.</p><p>Lorenzo looked at Joe. Marco\u2019s son. His grandson. A stranger. All those years ago, he\u2019d been so sure he was right. He\u2019d stood against his wife, his son. He\u2019d insisted. Tessa had warned him, but he hadn\u2019t listened. The mistake was his.</p><p>\u201cYou will stay,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou are family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Joe said quietly. \u201cMy family is my SEAL team. You folks have been nice and all. I appreciate the hospitality, but it\u2019s time for me to head out.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo wanted to argue the point. He had plans for this young man. He would stay, learn, take the family name. Was it not to be?</p> <p>He touched Joe\u2019s arm. \u201cIt was me,\u201d he told his grandson. \u201cYour grandmother, she wanted to allow Marco to marry, even though he was only a boy. Her parents, they weren\u2019t sure what they wanted, but I\u2019m the one who convinced them. My son, your mother\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey were in love. They wanted each other and they wanted you. I\u2019m the one who made them send you away. I was wrong. I wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s steady gaze never wavered. Lorenzo would have given half the Chardonnay harvest to know what the young man was thinking. But Joe was too wily. He kept his thoughts and feelings to himself.</p><p>\u201cNone of that matters now,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, but Lorenzo wanted to undo it. \u201cIf you had grown up here, you would have learned our ways. You would understand about the wine. It would be in your blood. It\u2019s there now, singing to you, if only you will listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would have made a difference,\u201d Joe admitted. \u201cMaybe not. We\u2019ll never know. In the here and now, I\u2019m not interested in the winery. I want you to be clear about that. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? The money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Like there wouldn\u2019t be strings attached to all of it. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to, old man, but I\u2019m not interested. You\u2019ve tried to use me against Brenna. I don\u2019t know why and I don\u2019t want to know. If you don\u2019t listen and decide to leave all this to me anyway, be warned. I\u2019ll give it to Brenna.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo frowned. \u201cGive it? Not sell it?\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled. \u201cNo way, old man. I\u2019m not going to be a pawn in whatever game you\u2019re playing.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo raised his eyebrows. \u201cCan you be so sure you haven\u2019t already?\u201d</p><p>Joe shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a slick one, Grandpa. Be careful. If you take this too far, you\u2019ll hurt the ones you love.\u201d</p><p>Grandpa. Joe\u2019s casual use of the word tugged at his heart. He held open his arms. His strong grandson stepped close and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d he said, releasing Joe. \u201cCome to see me again. I will show you that you\u2019re wrong about us not being your family. You belong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo reached up and cupped his face. \u201cYour work. I know it is dangerous. Be careful. Now you have a family to come home to.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t say anything, but Lorenzo thought he understood. They shook hands and the younger man left.</p><p>When he was alone, Lorenzo once again touched the map. He traced the outline of Marcelli Wines. Joe had accused him of playing a game. There was no game. But a plan? Ah, that was something different.</p><p>Brenna stood in the center of the vineyard and watched as the last of the Cabernet grapes were harvested by the awkward-looking machine being driven between the rows. The difference between her own small winery and this one could be measured in the number of days it took to bring in the grapes. Marcelli would produce over ten thousand cases. Hers would number in the hundreds.</p><p>But it was a start, she told herself, basking in a glow of pride. She\u2019d done what she wanted and everything had gone well. Now she just had to wait for time and chemistry to produce magic.</p><p>She bent down and touched a denuded vine. The mechanical harvester was only used on the less-than-premium grapes. She hated how the machines stripped away too many leaves and left tire tracks on the hard earth. While she understood the financial necessity, she wished each cluster of fruit could be treated with gentle reverence.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ve been out in the sun too long,\u201d she murmured as she straightened and laughed. Having philosophical thoughts about grape picking couldn\u2019t be good. Next she would be waxing poetic about each fallen leaf. The bright spot in her morning was that she\u2019d managed to think about something other than Nic. Given their last very intimate encounter, that was something close to a miracle.</p><p>Nic. Just letting his name echo in her brain made her smile. She wasn\u2019t clear on what exactly had happened or what it meant. Three days after the fact, she was still experiencing aftershocks. She had a suspicion it was illegal for sex to be that good.</p><p>Feelings she didn\u2019t want to acknowledge or name fluttered through her. Something had happened that night when they\u2019d finally talked about the past. Clearing the air had changed things between them. She wasn\u2019t ready to deal with it, but in time she would have to. What happened after that was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201d</p><p>The voice came from directly behind her. Brenna jumped and screamed. When she spun around, she saw Joe standing less than three feet away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on me. What is it with the men around here. First Nic, then you.\u201d She slapped her hand over her mouth. \u201cPretend I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Nic? Too late. The Grands told me all about you bringing one of the enemy to the engagement party. They were pretty shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet. Fortunately you showed up and offered a fine distraction. Did I ever thank you for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust doing my job, ma\u2019am. Speaking of which.\u201d He glanced around at the vineyard. \u201cI wanted you to know I\u2019m heading out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the general idea. I need to get back to work. This has been a great vacation and all, but a guy can only take so much of the Marcelli clan.\u201d</p><p>Leaving? \u201cBut you can\u2019t,\u201d she said, stunned. \u201cIf you go...You\u2019re supposed to stay and inherit everything. What about the money?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGet real, Brenna. Lorenzo was just jerking both our chains with all that talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re wrong. He would gladly leave you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? He\u2019d leave me the winery? Like I know what to do with that? You think I\u2019d own Marcelli outright? No way. He\u2019s a wily old coot. I guarantee you everything would be tied up so tight, I couldn\u2019t get so much as a bottle of wine for myself. He offered the winery as a bribe to get me to stay and as a way to piss you off. I\u2019m not sure why, but I think that was his plan. Judging from how you two go at each other, I\u2019d say it was working.\u201d</p><p>Brenna couldn\u2019t breathe. The earth seemed to be moving beneath her feet, but she didn\u2019t think it was because of an earthquake. Could Joe be right? Had her grandfather just been playing with them both?</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was wise to him. And if he tried to leave me everything, I\u2019d just give it to you. He didn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>Her brain wasn\u2019t working. She couldn\u2019t think straight. Was this really happening? Was Joe not a threat anymore?</p><p>She touched his arm. \u201cStay a little longer. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, now that I\u2019m not a threat, you want me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I wanted you around before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He glanced around at the vineyard. \u201cThis has been great, but I don\u2019t belong here. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Will you come back? Is the family too much to deal with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d Lord knows they got to her and she was used to them. \u201cAre you glad you came?\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze settled on her face. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I know my folks have been thrilled having you around. And my grandparents. I guess all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re the one I worry about the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI worry about you, too. You\u2019re the one putting your life on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a pro. Don\u2019t sweat it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cThank you\u201d seemed wildly inadequate after what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cYou could have had it all,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot even on a bet. Not with the old man\u2019s rules. You\u2019re the only one who can handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do a very good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe! Joe!\u201d</p><p>Brenna looked past her brother and saw Mia running toward them. Her baby sister crashed through a row of vines, making Brenna wince.</p><p>\u201cWalk between the rows!\u201d she yelled, but Mia ignored her.</p><p>She stumbled through another row of vines and came to a stop in front of Joe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay it\u2019s not true,\u201d she demanded. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Mia\u2019s brown eyes.</p><p>Joe shifted uncomfortably. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about me leaving\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He never got a chance to finish his sentence. Mia flung herself at him and clung as if she never wanted to let go. \u201cYou can\u2019t go. Not yet. I\u2019ve never had a big brother before, and I really like it.\u201d</p><p>Joe stood awkwardly for a couple of seconds, then gingerly patted Mia\u2019s back. He was big and broad to Mia\u2019s petite frame. He looked like a bear hugging a kitten. As Brenna watched, his expression tightened and something that might have been regret twisted his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI have a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dangerous job.\u201d Mia stepped back and jammed her hands onto her hips. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare die. That would really piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to stay safe.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019d better. I swear, Joe, if you don\u2019t come back, I\u2019ll hunt down every single one of your friends and have sex with them. I\u2019ll even let the others watch while I do it.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m motivated to stay alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Brenna. \u201cI guess this is good-bye.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stepped into his embrace. He hugged her hard.</p><p>\u201cStay strong,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to work out.\u201d</p> <p>She hoped he was right. \u201cDitto what Mia said,\u201d she told him. \u201cMinus the sex part. We want you to come back to us. We\u2019re your family now, and the fact that we give you the willies is no excuse to stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Mia moved close and he hugged them both, then bent down so they could kiss his cheek. With a last wave, he turned and walked away. Brenna watched him go. Like Mia, she would miss him.</p><p>\u201cThe time will go fast,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore we know it, he\u2019ll be underfoot and getting on our nerves.\u201d</p><p>Mia sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a very good liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>When Nic stepped out of his office, he saw an unfamiliar SUV pulling up beside the building. The door opened and a tall man stepped out of the Jeep Wrangler.</p><p>It took Nic a second to place the guy, then he recognized Brenna\u2019s long-lost brother.</p> <p>Max pushed past him and raced toward the visitor. As usual, the pup tried to wiggle the stranger to death by leaping and licking, then rolling onto his back to beg for a belly rub.</p><p>Joe crouched down and obliged, then looked at Nic. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a real watchdog here.\u201d</p><p>Nic strolled toward the duo. \u201cI\u2019m figuring he\u2019ll grow up and turn vicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely.\u201d</p><p>Max sprang to his feet and got one good swipe on Joe\u2019s face before taking off for a run around the yard.</p><p>Nic held out his hand. \u201cWe weren\u2019t introduced the night you came home. I\u2019m Nic Giovanni.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIf you\u2019ve spent any time with your grandfather, then you know I\u2019m the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Joe rose and shook his hand. \u201cJoe Larson.\u201d He looked around at the winery. \u201cNice place you got here.\u201d</p><p>Nic nodded, but didn\u2019t speak. There had to be a reason Brenna\u2019s brother had stopped by, although he couldn\u2019t think of one offhand.</p><p>Joe leaned against the fender of his Jeep. \u201cLorenzo told me a lot about the feud between your two families. It sounds like something right out of Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s old news. Lorenzo worries about the past, but the rest of us are willing to let it go.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cMakes sense. Things change. People move on.\u201d He jerked his head toward the back of his SUV. \u201cWhich is what I\u2019m doing. Heading back to work.\u201d</p><p>Nic couldn\u2019t have been more surprised if Joe had started line dancing. Leaving? Did that mean he wouldn\u2019t be inheriting? If so, Marcelli Wines was still up for grabs.</p><p>He did his best to act as if Joe\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t mean anything to him.</p><p>\u201cBrenna mentioned you were a Navy SEAL.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I have a lot of specialized training.\u201d He paused to let the words sink in. \u201cI guess it\u2019s not right for a brother to have a favorite sister, so I worry about all of them. But sometimes I worry about Brenna the most. I wouldn\u2019t want anything happening to her. Anything that would...hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Nic didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or prepare for a fist-fight. Logic told him that Joe was pissing in the dark, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. Had he learned anything or was he fishing?</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Nic asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Damn it all if Nic wasn\u2019t pleased that Brenna had someone on her side. Which made him the village idiot, seeing as the person on her side was capable of killing him with little more than dental floss.</p><p>\u201cBrenna\u2019s a grown-up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>Nic chuckled. \u201cBrenna for one. If she knew you were here, she\u2019d have your hide as a rug.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019d have to catch me first.\u201d</p><p>Nic realized he liked Joe. \u201cHurting Brenna isn\u2019t part of my plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she going to get hurt anyway?\u201d</p><p>Nic considered the question. Would Brenna be hurt by his plan to buy Marcelli Wines? His humor faded. Easy question, easier answer.</p><p>Joe pushed off the Jeep. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I can\u2019t protect her, as much as I want to. But something tells me you can. You might want to think about that.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and slid onto the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll see you the next time I\u2019m in town.\u201d</p><p>Nic nodded.</p><p>As Joe drove away, Maggie stepped out of the office and walked toward Nic. \u201cWho was that handsome stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to being happily married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am. But I can still look.\u201d She stopped in front of him. \u201cAre you going to tell me who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you have the final numbers on the financing for buying Marcelli?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cEverything\u2019s ready. Lorenzo Marcelli simply has to sign on the dotted line. But I thought you weren\u2019t sure he would be willing to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just changed.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I wish you wouldn\u2019t do this. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for your opinion, I\u2019m asking you to do your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Boss.\u201d</p><p>She sounded fine, but he saw the flash of hurt in her green eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the information on your desk,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She started back for the door, then paused. \u201cYou used to be one of the good guys, Nic. Why did that have to change?\u201d</p><p>Before he could come up with an answer, she went inside.</p><p>He stalked toward the house. One of the good guys. What did that mean? She was\u2014</p><p>He stopped in the center of the path and turned to look at the building Brenna was using. Just a few nights ago she\u2019d forced them both to relive the past. For the first time in years he\u2019d found himself locked back in the hurt and the anger. At one time he\u2019d thought it would destroy him. It hadn\u2019t and he\u2019d moved on. Everything was different now.</p><p>Or was it? They\u2019d made love. Somehow, despite the harsh words and aching feelings, they\u2019d come together in a way that had both exhilarated and terrified him. As much as he\u2019d tried to ignore it, he\u2019d known that night that something was different.</p><p>No, he told himself. Nothing was different. The past was long gone and the future had nothing to do with it. What could have been didn\u2019t matter. He and Brenna were old news. He had a plan and he was going to stick with it no matter what.</p><p>16</p><p>Brenna sipped her double mocha latte as she exited the Starbucks and crossed to the tables and chairs set up along the wide sidewalk. She chose a seat in the shade.</p><p>The midafternoon was quiet, with few people around. Warm temperatures and a light breeze made her feel sleepy, so the coffee would provide a much-needed jolt.</p><p>September had come to an end. Harvest was finished, and all across the valley, wine makers were taking a moment to draw a breath. There were the usual tasks to tidy up at the end of the season, barrel orders to be placed for the following year, discussions about more plantings, what vines to rip up, and how everyone expected the wines to be when the first barrels were opened and tasted.</p><p>Every so often Brenna wished she\u2019d picked another line of work, but not today. Today her world was exactly right. All of her wine was in place, and the future of Four Sisters Winery was in the hands of yeast microbes and fate. And at Marcelli, well, life was good. Even her grandfather couldn\u2019t destroy her good mood. No matter how much he disagreed with her, argued his points, and ignored her advice, the truth was he had no one interested in the winery but her. Not her sisters and not Joe.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should nominate him for sainthood,\u201d she murmured to herself as she set her coffee on a small round table and took a seat. He\u2019d turned down the chance to be a part of the family business, leaving her free to take over.</p><p>Assuming her grandfather didn\u2019t up and sell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d she told herself. \u201cNot today.\u201d Not when the sun was shining and the air was warm and everything was as it should be.</p><p>She\u2019d weathered the latest storm and she\u2019d survived. She would get through the next one and the next one. Some she would endure with grace and style, and some she would simply endure. But that was okay. She\u2019d moved on.</p><p>Look at how far she\u2019d come. A year ago she\u2019d been working two jobs she hated, while going through the motions of having a marriage with a man she\u2019d never truly been in love with. How sad was that? Now she was happy, living her dream, and starting her own business. She had\u2014</p><p>Brenna sat up straight, then tried to calculate the date. It was the beginning of October.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d she said as she picked up her coffee and took a sip. Her divorce had become final and she hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, she remembered receiving a thick, legal-size envelope sometime in the past couple of weeks. But between harvest and arguing with her grandfather and Nic and Joe and everything else going on, she\u2019d tossed it onto a shelf in her bedroom and had never given it another thought. No doubt the final papers were inside. She was a free woman. Even better, Jeff would be sending her a fat check every month for three years to pay her back for putting him through medical school and supporting him during his internship and residency.</p><p>While she wasn\u2019t going to be wealthy by anyone\u2019s standards, she was about to have a cash flow that set her heart to fluttering. So the five-thousand-dollar-a-month question was what did she do with it? Use it to make payments on her loan? Save it? Get a new car?</p><p>She eyed her battered Camry parked on the street and figured she probably needed to pay for a tune-up and some tires, but other than that, it should last her a few more years.</p><p>A sound caught her attention. A familiar sound that got louder. The way her heart had fluttered at the thought of money was nothing when compared with the kickboxing style workout it was getting now. Brenna rose and shaded her eyes as she looked down the street. Sure enough, a good-looking guy on a motorcycle was headed in this direction.</p><p>What was it about a man in a leather jacket? She was too young to remember James Dean, yet that\u2019s instantly who she thought of as Nic pulled up in front of her car. He cut the engine and turned toward her.</p><p>Neither of them spoke. They hadn\u2019t seen each other since \u201cthe night,\u201d so this moment was supposed to be awkward. She probably should have wanted to bolt. Instead she found herself smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A helmet covered his hair and dark glasses shaded his eyes. She didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, which was probably for the best. She didn\u2019t know what she was thinking, either. The situation with Nic was more complicated than ever, thanks to what had happened a week before. Intellectually she knew that making love with him had been foolish. Emotionally she\u2019d never felt happier about anything. No doubt the differing sides of her brain were at war, meaning she should probably schedule some quality time with her sister, the psychologist. Or at the very least visit her doctor and find out if the pharmaceutical community had a pill or two to help her out. Instead she sipped her coffee.</p><p>Nic pulled off his glasses. \u201cYou look like a woman with a lot on her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know how to help.\u201d</p><p>He reached behind for the spare helmet fastened to the seat. After pulling it free, he held it out to her.</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t hesitate. If she was going to celebrate the joy that was her life, she knew no better place than on the back of a motorcycle. She tossed her coffee in the trash and crossed the sidewalk. After securing the helmet, she climbed on behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cGo fast,\u201d she told him with a laugh.</p><p>He grinned and nodded.</p> <p>While he drove out of town at the speed limit, as soon as they hit the freeway, he accelerated the bike until Brenna felt as if they were flying. Cool air blew in her face. The heat of Nic\u2019s body kept her warm, while her thighs hugging his reminded her of other rides on other sunny days.</p><p>They drove north out of Santa Barbara, past the small towns that lined the freeway until they reached a deserted stretch of beach. Nic took the next exit. He pulled up beside the sand and cut the engine.</p><p>Brenna climbed off first. She set her helmet back on the seat and smoothed her hair. Nic took off his headgear and shrugged out of his jacket. By silent agreement they turned toward the water.</p><p>They walked side by side along the firm, damp sand. The tide was out and seagulls floated overhead, allowing the breeze to carry them back and forth with no effort on their part. She inhaled the scent of salt water and brine. A few clouds hurried across the blue sky.</p><p>Occasionally their shoulders bumped. After a few minutes Nic took her hand in his.</p><p>They were out of time, Brenna decided. This wasn\u2019t now, wasn\u2019t then; the moment simply existed with no expectation, no pressure. She raised her face to the sun. If only they could stay like this forever.</p> <p>A seagull flew down in front of them and pecked at the sand. As they approached, the large bird flapped its wings and ran a few feet up the beach.</p><p>\u201cMax would enjoy this,\u201d she said, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a motorcycle kind of dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Nic stopped and pulled Brenna toward him. As she stepped into his embrace, he put his hands on her shoulders and turned her so she stood with her back to him. He moved close behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. She settled her hands on top of his.</p><p>They faced the ocean, staring out to the line of the horizon.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever want to sail to the edge there and see what\u2019s beyond it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you head south and west, you\u2019ll hit Hawaii.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>Days lolling on a white, sandy beach. A cabana boy to bring her drinks with umbrellas.</p><p>\u201cYour brother came to see me.\u201d</p><p>Nic\u2019s words were so at odds with her thoughts that at first she didn\u2019t know what he meant.</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s gone. He went back to the base.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his cheek against her hair. \u201cI know. He stopped by on his way out of town.\u201d</p><p>She tried to turn to look at him, but his arms held her in place. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo warn me off. He said if I did anything to hurt you, he would have my head on a platter.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned. \u201cHe did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that he had special training he was very willing to use and that he wanted to make sure nothing happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014He\u2014\u201d She closed her mouth, opened it, then closed it again. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making this up.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think. Joe? Threatening Nic? How like a guy. She turned in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all he did,\u201d she told him happily. \u201cHe turned down the winery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wondered about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. My grandfather grumbled about it for an entire day. Joe figured out no one was going to write him a check for what the winery was worth and that it was more than likely that our grandfather would tie things up such that he couldn\u2019t sell it and walk away. Joe said there were too many strings attached.\u201d</p><p>Even three days after her brother had left, Brenna still had trouble believing it all herself.</p><p>Nic touched her face. \u201cSo it\u2019s all yours now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I guess he could still sell, but I\u2019m not going to think about it. For right now, my life is pretty damned perfect, and after all the crap I\u2019ve been through, I intend to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Good for me.\u201d</p><p>She turned so she once again faced the ocean. Nic held her close, her back nestling into his chest. This felt right in so many ways.</p><p>\u201cIs Joe going to come back?\u201d Nic asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so. We were more than he could deal with the first time out, but I doubt he\u2019ll get away for long. I spoke to Mom, and she said Joe promised to stay in touch. She and my dad are going down to visit him next month. I think the Marcelli family is a lot easier to take in small doses.\u201d</p><p>Nic didn\u2019t say anything. Brenna thought about asking what he was thinking, but then decided she didn\u2019t want to know. This moment was perfect and she didn\u2019t want it ruined by anything. Not the present, the future, and certainly not the past.</p><p>Although there was plenty there to mess things up. So many mistakes. So much pain.</p><p>With the clarity of hindsight, she knew she\u2019d made a huge mistake in not marrying Nic all those years ago. She should have defied her family and run away with him and the consequences be damned. When his grandfather threw him out, they could have gone to France together.</p><p>Instead she\u2019d been afraid and Nic had lost everything.</p><p>Did getting Wild Sea back make up for it? she wondered. Not that she was going to ask. If the answer was no, she would feel guilty and more than a little ashamed for her part it in. Nic had been treated badly by the people who were supposed to love him.</p><p>His parents. His grandfather. Her.</p><p>Had anyone he\u2019d ever loved not betrayed him?</p><p>Regret filled her. Regret for her part in his pain and regret for the little boy who had been left alone.</p><p>She wanted to say something, but what? She wanted\u2014</p><p>He turned her toward him and kissed her. The soft pressure of his mouth made her eyes sink closed and her arms circle around his neck.</p><p>Yes, she thought hazily, parting her lips. This was what she wanted. This was what felt right. Being here with him on a sunny fall day when the air was sweet with possibilities.</p><p>He broke the kiss and looked at her. As she stared into his dark eyes, she saw down to the very essence of the man who had been so much a part of her life. She touched his cheek, then the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s never go back,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe could stay here forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when the tide comes in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tempted.\u201d</p><p>She wanted him to be more than that. She wanted him to be\u2014</p><p>In love with her.</p><p>The truth crashed into Brenna like one of the waves slapping onto the sand. She wanted Nic to remember how good they had been together and know they could have all that again, plus the wisdom that comes with maturity. She wanted him to sweep her up in his arms and confess that he\u2019d never stopped loving her, thinking about her, needing her, because\u2014her breath caught\u2014it was more than possible she\u2019d never stopped loving him.</p><p>\u201cBrenna? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said automatically. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019d better head back.\u201d</p><p>She led the way to the motorcycle and slipped on her helmet. But her mind wasn\u2019t on the task. Instead she couldn\u2019t stop wondering if it was really true. Had she spent the past ten years living a lie? Had she really never stopped loving Nic or had she been foolish enough to fall in love with him all over again?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Lorenzo walked into the small restaurant a little before ten in the morning. He knew the names and reputations of the men who wanted to meet with him, if not their faces. He even knew what they wanted.</p><p>A young man looked up from setting the two dozen or so tables in the main room. \u201cWe\u2019re not open, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lorenzo Marcelli. There is to be a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, sir.\u201d The young man straightened. \u201cRight this way.\u201d</p><p>He led Lorenzo into a back room filled with a long table. There weren\u2019t any place settings here. Only pads of paper and a pot of coffee along with a few cups. Two men stood as he entered.</p><p>\u201cMr. Marcelli, thank you for coming. I\u2019m Bill Freeman and this is my associate, Roger White. Please, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo sat down heavily on one side of the table while the two men settled across from him. He knew what they were after, and while he wanted them to come to the point, he waited while they poured him water and offered coffee, which he declined.</p><p>\u201cAs you may have guessed, we\u2019re very interested in your winery,\u201d Bill Freeman said.</p><p>\u201cI have little else that would interest men like you,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cI\u2019m an old man. I don\u2019t think you want to offer me a job with one of your companies.\u201d</p><p>The two men chuckled. \u201cWould you take one?\u201d Bill asked.</p><p>Lorenzo shrugged. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re left with Marcelli Wines.\u201d</p><p>He detailed the long history of the company, as if Lorenzo hadn\u2019t lived it all himself. He was polite, well informed, and when he started talking numbers, even Lorenzo was impressed by the bottom line.</p><p>The words flowed on and on. Employees would be guaranteed their jobs for at least two years. His family would never want for anything. The family house was not to be touched, and he was welcome to retain a few acres around the house for his private use.</p><p>What would his father think of all this? Lorenzo wondered, then smiled faintly. Antonio would raise his fist to the heavens, then turn it toward the men. Never would a Marcelli sell.</p><p>But that was a long time ago. Much had changed. Once he had believed he would create a dynasty of fine sons to inherit. Marco was a good man, but there had been no other children, and no male grandchildren. Tessa always whispered it was because God punished Lorenzo for his arrogance in forcing Marco and Colleen to give up their baby. For many years Lorenzo had refused to believe, but now he was not so sure.</p><p>So these men, these strangers, offered him more money than he had ever imagined in exchange for Marcelli Wines. Which made him wonder why.</p><p>He listened as they continued to talk, all the while questioning what lay behind the words. These two were not interested in wine. They represented a soulless corporation. Wine making was an art. It got into the blood. So who was behind this? Who really wanted to buy the company?</p><p>When they had finished, he rose to his feet. \u201cI will consider the offer,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I will be in touch.\u201d</p><p>He left the way he\u2019d come\u2014alone and feeling very old.</p><p>Brenna looked over the new designs for the Chardonnay labels and had a feeling her grandfather wasn\u2019t going to like these any better than the last ones. Still, it was her job to show them to him and then stand back to absorb whatever joy he might want to send her way. Besides, after her motorcycle ride with Nic the previous day there was virtually nothing that could upset her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Humming \u201cI\u2019m a Little Teapot,\u201d she left her office and walked down the corridor into his. The door was open and she entered without knocking.</p><p>\u201cHey, Grandpa,\u201d she said, doing her best to sound upbeat and cheerful. Actually it wasn\u2019t much of a stretch. \u201cI have the new wine labels. You\u2019re going to love them.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather\u2019s response was a grunt. Not a very promising start, but she was determined to look on the bright side of things. She set the large pages in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cI explained what you liked and didn\u2019t like about their previous work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying I liked anything,\u201d he grumbled as he flipped through the designs.</p><p>Brenna ignored him and perched on the edge of his desk, which she knew he hated. \u201cYou adored at least two of them,\u201d she said, carefully crossing her fingers behind her back to negate the potential cosmic effects of the lie.</p><p>He grunted again.</p><p>She grinned, then noticed how he was dressed. While her grandfather usually wore a long-sleeved shirt and the old man equivalent of Dockers, today he was in a suit and tie.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look spiffy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the special occasion? Did you and Grandma Tessa sneak away for a romantic lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cActually it\u2019s just my naturally sunny nature coming through. So did you go to lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I met with some businessmen. They wanted to talk about buying the winery.\u201d</p><p>It was like being by the ocean again. Brenna heard the sound of rushing water. The noise filled her head until it seemed to surround her. She was drowning. That had to be what was wrong.</p><p>The temperature in the room dropped to near freezing. She felt cold, then numb, then very, very sick.</p> <p>No. No, this wasn\u2019t happening. Selling? He couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d just survived the Joe crisis. This could not be happening.</p><p>She closed her eyes and accepted the truth. The winery was his. He could do whatever the hell he wanted.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, then pushed to her feet. Somehow she got out of the office, then she was running and running. Through the rows of bare vines, up over the slight hill at the edge of their property and across the fence lines. She ran until the pain in her side forced her to walk, and still she kept going. Her eyes burned from her tears, her chest ached. She couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t speak, couldn\u2019t do anything but keep moving.</p><p>Some time later she saw a group of buildings and she headed for them. A voice in her head kept screaming \u201cNo!\u201d as if by sheer force of will, she could make it not be true. She choked on her sobs. The unfairness of it all, the futility of her hopes and dreams, filled her with pain.</p><p>When she reached the building, she pushed through the unlocked door and into the office. It was the middle of the day, and several of the office staff were at their desks.</p><p>She felt their curious looks, heard the whispered questions. Should they stop her? Who was she? She ignored them all. Instead she walked faster until she reached the one door she sought and jerked it open.</p><p>Nic was on the phone. He looked up when she entered. His expression tightened with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to call you back,\u201d he said and hung up. He was already on his feet.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you okay? Was there an accident?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but couldn\u2019t catch her breath enough to speak. Tears poured down her cheeks.</p><p>He put an arm around her and helped her out of his office. They left the office building and headed for the house.</p><p>When she was settled on the living room sofa, with a glass of brandy, Nic crouched in front of her and took her free hand in his.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her throat was so tight, she didn\u2019t think it would be possible to speak, yet she did her best to force out the words.</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather is going to sell the winery.\u201d</p><p>Nic had expected her to say that someone was dead. Maybe Joe or one of her grandmothers. Wide-eyed and shaking, Brenna looked as if she\u2019d barely survived a car crash. He\u2019d been so concerned about her, he\u2019d momentarily forgotten about the meeting that morning.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She gave a strangled cry and tightened her grip on his hand. \u201cHe said he met with some men. He was all dressed up in a suit. Why would he have bothered if he wasn\u2019t serious?\u201d She gasped. \u201cJoe. Joe told him that he wasn\u2019t interested in the winery. He said if he inherited, he would just give it to me. That\u2019s why my grandfather is doing this. Without Joe, there\u2019s no male heir. He doesn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking so badly some of the brandy spilled on the floor. Nic grabbed the glass and set it on the end table, then sat next to her and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in his chest. Nic stroked her hair and rocked her back and forth. But even though his actions were gentle, his mind was racing. Was Brenna right? Would Lorenzo sell? As much as Nic had hoped and planned, he\u2019d never been sure the old man would take the bait. Was everything he\u2019d worked for finally within his grasp?</p><p>\u201cBrenna,\u201d he began, not sure what he was going to say. The truth? A part of the truth?</p><p>She raised her head. Pain filled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to change. Mia already figured that out. She had the four of us go to lunch because nothing was ever going to be the same again. We\u2019re all changing. I\u2019m going to lose the winery.\u201d</p><p>Tell her now, he thought. Tell her the truth.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh, Nic, what would I have done without you? When I came to you for the loan, I really wanted to start my own label, but I don\u2019t think I actually believed I would need to. I think deep inside I believed I would inherit. I figured he would make the four of us equal owners and that I would run things. I started Four Sisters to hedge my bets.\u201d She blinked back tears. \u201cNow that\u2019s all I have. And it\u2019s because of you. You were so generous and willing to take a chance on me. I really appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He was slime. \u201cBrenna, it wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>She gave a shaky smile. \u201cIt was exactly like that. Ten years ago I treated you horribly. I loved you, but I wasn\u2019t willing to defy my family. But you forgave me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where she was going with this, but he had to stop her now before she said something they would both regret.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou need to recover from the shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Or has the shock given me the courage to say what needs saying?\u201d She leaned forward and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019ve always regretted not marrying you. I tried to love Jeff, but I couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I gave my life away\u2014I felt guilty. I devoted my time to him because I couldn\u2019t give him my heart. It belonged to you. It still does.\u201d</p><p>This was not happening. Nic stood and paced to the window. He spun back to Brenna.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always had lousy timing. This only proves it, huh?\u201d She rose. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nic. You don\u2019t have to say anything back. I\u2019m not expecting a declaration of your undying love and a proposal or anything.\u201d She paused. \u201cWell, it would be nice, but I understand a lot of things have changed. You may not feel the same way. I just wanted you to know. I still love you. I guess that gives you a win in all this.\u201d</p><p>A win? The irony should have made him laugh, but instead he wanted to stop time and figure out how this had all gotten so screwed up. Brenna wasn\u2019t supposed to love him. Not now. Not like this.</p><p>Not after what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cBrenna, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys in here? Nic? Brenna?\u201d</p><p>He swore in frustration.</p><p>\u201cMia?\u201d Brenna called. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>Mia burst into the living room. \u201cBrenna, are you okay? I saw you running through the vineyards. I thought maybe you\u2019d finally gone over the deep end. I figured you\u2019d come here, so I drove over. I went to the office first, but they told me you were in here.\u201d She waved her right hand and he recognized his grandmother\u2019s diary. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what I found.\u201d</p><p>Nic clenched his hands into fists. \u201cMia, this isn\u2019t a really good time. Your sister and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you\u2019re gonna want to hear this. See, I\u2019ve been translating the diary. When I got into it, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was reading. I didn\u2019t want to say anything until I reached the end. I wanted to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Nic wanted to grab Mia by her shirt collar and propel her from the room. He needed time with Brenna to figure out what he was going to say to her. How he was going to explain the truth? But Mia wasn\u2019t interested in anything but her news.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so amazing,\u201d she said gleefully. She looked at Nic. \u201cHang on to to your privates, Nic. Grandpa Lorenzo was right all along. Salvatore Giovanni really did poison the Marcelli vines all those years ago\u2014and you\u2019ll never guess why.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Brenna asked. Her head was swimming. With all she\u2019d already been through, she didn\u2019t think there were more shocks to be had. Apparently she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Mia pulled several folded sheets of paper out of her shorts back pocket. \u201cOnce I realized what was going on, I took notes. It\u2019s so incredible.\u201d</p><p>She plopped into a wing chair by the sofa and waved at the couch. \u201cYou guys want to take a load off while I read this or are you going to stay standing?\u201d</p><p>Brenna pressed a hand to her stomach. She felt as if an entire platoon of butterflies was fighting it out in there. Her chest hurt, her eyes burned, and she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d just told Nic she loved him. Emotional meltdown, she told herself. She\u2019d reacted to a horrific situation by spilling her guts. Unfortunately, she\u2019d told him about the same time she\u2019d figured it out for herself, so she hadn\u2019t had a chance to get used to the information. Worse, he hadn\u2019t reacted.</p><p>She eyed him now and saw him watching her. She was unable to read his expression or figure out what he was thinking. Obviously she\u2019d shocked him with her confession, but had it been in a good way or a bad way? Did he want them to be alone so he could take her in his arms and tell her how much he\u2019d always loved her, too, or did he just want to bolt for safety?</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Mia said, sounding impatient. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this interest anyone but me?\u201d</p><p>Brenna slowly sat on the sofa. Whatever she and Nic had to say to each other could wait. Great. In the space of an hour she\u2019d found out that her grandfather really was selling the winery, and she\u2019d handed her heart over to Nic without finding out how he felt about her. Somehow she doubted anything Mia had to say could even come close.</p><p>Nic crossed to the window and stared outside. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he told Mia.</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cOkay. So if you started translating at the beginning, you probably already know that Antonio and Sophia were in love. According to this, they had been for years. But there was a problem with Antonio\u2019s family. It\u2019s not clear what, but he wasn\u2019t considered a desirable match for her. When he and Salvatore decided to start over in America, Sophia vowed to wait for her one true love. Heartfelt good-bye, etcetera. Flash forward six years. Sophia is still the beauty of the village, but she has refused every suitor. Her father grows impatient and begins to pressure her. She gets a letter from Antonio telling her that he and Salvatore are coming back to claim brides. The wineries are already starting to show a profit. By village standards he\u2019s a rich man now, and he\u2019s coming to get her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia glanced up from the paper. \u201cShe waited six years. How crazy is that?\u201d</p><p>Brenna thought about how long she\u2019d loved Nic. \u201cHe was her one true love.\u201d</p><p>Mia wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou sound like a greeting card. I say cut your losses and find the best guy who\u2019s available now, but that\u2019s just me. Anyway, weeks go by, Sophia\u2019s family gets impatient. She promises to marry by the end of spring. Who shows up the following week? Not darling Antonio, but Salvatore. He\u2019s successful, his family is respected, and he comes bearing gifts. The family is thrilled. When he makes an offer for Sophia, they accept on her behalf. Sophia is distraught. Where is her beloved?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Nic asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. The diary doesn\u2019t say. But Sophia\u2019s in a panic. She tries to delay the wedding, but the folks won\u2019t have it. Antonio is MIA until the night before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Brenna can\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He shows up at some fancy dinner. Now that he\u2019s not going to be family, her parents make him welcome. Sophia is heartbroken. He\u2019s her one true love, yada yada. They meet out by the fountain close to midnight. He wants her to come away with him, to elope. But she can\u2019t shame her family. Salvatore is a good man. They fight, they make up, they have sex.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>Mia grinned. \u201cOh, she\u2019s pretty delicate in her description, but there\u2019s no doubt the deed gets done. Salvatore gets the bride, but not the cherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that start the feud?\u201d Nic asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Apparently Antonio settles on a different bride. Our great-grandmother Maria. There\u2019s another wedding and the four of them head back to America. I can only imagine how interesting that boat crossing could have been. I mean the four of them dining together. Sophia and Antonio married to people they don\u2019t love. Talk about a conversation stopper.\u201d</p><p>Brenna thought of her own miserable marriage. \u201cHow did she stand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was plenty of work to keep her busy. After a year or so, the first of her babies came along. The wineries flourished, then the war came. As we\u2019ve been told forty billion times, Antonio and Salvatore went to Europe and were given cuttings from different vineyards in an effort to protect the horticultural heritage from the Germans. They brought them back, planted them and all went well, right up until Salvatore got a letter that his father was dying. This was right after the end of the war. Being a good son, he headed home for Italy. Sophia stayed behind with the family and the grapes.\u201d</p><p>Mia waved the papers. \u201cBrace yourself. Here\u2019s the good stuff. There was an early frost\u2014just days before the harvest. Antonio and Sophia did everything they could to save the grapes. They worked tirelessly for days. It\u2019s not clear where Great-grandma Maria was during all this, but when the harvest was finally in and they\u2019d saved the grapes, they celebrated by falling into each other\u2019s arms. They admitted they were still in love. The affair went on for nearly two weeks until Sophia put a stop to it, telling Antonio she couldn\u2019t continue to betray her husband. But it was too late. Sophia was pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThere was a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Sophia was frantic, as you can imagine. Salvatore wasn\u2019t the nicest guy around, and he didn\u2019t like coming home after being gone for nearly six months and finding his wife five months pregnant. He badgered her for the name of her lover, then turned his back on her, threatening to throw her bastard into the streets. It turns out he didn\u2019t have to. The baby was stillborn.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at Nic. He looked as shell-shocked as she felt. \u201cHow did he find out it was Antonio\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her grief she told him the truth. All of it.\u201d Mia shook her head. \u201cThat was the beginning of the feud. Sophia found out later that Salvatore went to the Marcellis\u2019 vineyards and poisoned all the vines they\u2019d brought from Europe. Whatever he used acted slowly, strangling the new cuttings until they all died. She said when he told her, he sounded as if he were proud of what he\u2019d done. Sophia blamed herself, but she wouldn\u2019t betray her husband again by telling Antonio what had happened. The two men fought, Salvatore refused to confess because to his mind, Antonio\u2019s sin was greater. The families never spoke again. Well, until you guys.\u201d</p><p>Mia folded the papers. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. Our sordid past. Think we could sell the story to Hollywood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore really poisoned the grapes,\u201d Brenna said slowly. \u201cAll these years I thought Grandpa Lorenzo was crazy, but he was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was just cause,\u201d Mia said. \u201cYou know how Italian men are about fidelity. It obsesses them.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t dare glance at Nic. Infidelity. That\u2019s what he had considered her relationship with Jeff, and she wasn\u2019t sure he was wrong. But unlike his great-grandfather, he\u2019d come to understand why and he\u2019d forgiven her instead of seeking revenge.</p> <p>Nic walked toward Mia. \u201cYou agree with what Salvatore did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I agree, but I understand. His best friend screwed his wife. That was pretty low. I mean, Sophia had the chance to run off with Antonio the night before her wedding, but she was too frightened to defy her family. She chose a stranger over the man she really loved. Then she cheated on her husband with the guy she\u2019d loved all along. Somebody needed to bitch-slap some sense into that girl. She gave up the right to Antonio the second she turned him down. She\u2019d picked her life, so she should have honored it.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s comments hit a little too close to home for comfort. Brenna didn\u2019t want to see any similarities between herself and Nic, and Sophia and Antonio. Unfortunately, they were too obvious to miss.</p><p>She stood. \u201cMia, we should get home. I want to talk to Grandpa Lorenzo about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it change anything?\u201d Nic asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably not.\u201d</p><p>Still, the need to escape pressed in on her from all directions.</p><p>Mia rose and pulled her keys from her front pocket. \u201cYou want to do the Forrest Gump cross-country run again or you want a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna, wait.\u201d Nic moved close. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>Of course they did. She\u2019d spilled her guts to the man. The problem was she didn\u2019t know if he was going to match her feelings or try to let her down gently. She didn\u2019t think she could handle one more shock today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d she said vaguely. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Nic stood alone in the living room. In the space of an hour his world had shifted on its axis. First Brenna\u2019s fears that her grandfather would sell\u2014implying he was about to get everything he\u2019d ever wanted. Then her claims to be in love with him. Love? Now? Fate had a twisted sense of timing. Finally the news about his great-grandfather.</p><p>All his life Nic had thought the feud was a joke. He\u2019d figured the Marcellis\u2019 claims were little more than a rationalization of their own failure. He\u2019d felt superior because his family had been successful on a grand scale. The European cuttings had given Wild Sea an edge in the market. By the early 1980s that edge could be measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue. Today the difference was in millions.</p><p>When Nic had been called back from his exile, he\u2019d been determined to make Wild Sea one of the biggest and the best. His plan, born during those long days working in the vineyards of France, had started with blinding hate and rage, then had evolved into something more concrete. He\u2019d had something to prove\u2014not just to his grandfather, but to Brenna. He wanted her to regret all that she\u2019d lost when she\u2019d left him.</p><p>Once Wild Sea was everything he could make it, he would buy Marcelli Wines. Over time he would incorporate their vineyards, their processes, then he would eliminate their name.</p><p>During the past seven years, he\u2019d accomplished everything he\u2019d wanted, with one exception\u2014he hadn\u2019t bought out Marcelli Wines.</p><p>Wild Sea had three times the sales and four times the profits, but that hadn\u2019t mattered. He\u2019d had a goal.</p><p>Now that goal seemed to rest on shaky ground.</p><p>He walked to the rear of the house and stepped outside. He couldn\u2019t see them from here, but they were just beyond the rise. On the acres bordering the Marcelli lands were the European cuttings. They had grown strong, producing some of the best grapes. Old had been grafted into new, year after year.</p><p>\u201cA stolen legacy,\u201d he murmured to himself.</p><p>Max trotted over and nosed his hand. Nic patted the dog.</p><p>He\u2019d built his dreams of revenge on a lie. Nothing he\u2019d built was his alone. It had been stolen by a man twisted and bent by revenge.</p><p>Was Nic so very different?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Nic drove along the coast road for nearly an hour. He\u2019d pulled on his helmet, but forgotten a jacket. The cool air stung his chest and arms, but he didn\u2019t turn back. He couldn\u2019t\u2014not until he\u2019d seen the proof.</p><p>The highway turnoff was clearly marked, but after that, he had to rely on memory more than signs. It took him nearly thirty minutes to find the well-cared-for cemetery on the bluff. Once inside the wrought-iron gate, he made his way to the fenced section overlooking the ocean. Large marble statues and benches declared those resting here to be persons of substance with financial means. However ill-gotten those means might be.</p><p>Nic turned off the motorcycle and slipped off his helmet. The afternoon was silent except for the wind rustling leaves and stirring the grass.</p><p>For once he ignored the giant column over his great-grandfather\u2019s grave and the small stone that marked Sophia\u2019s resting place. His grandmother held a place of honor, but he didn\u2019t stop there. Instead he searched by the back corner for something he\u2019d seen years ago and had not understood.</p><p>When he found the simple marker, it contained only a date. No name, no words of comfort or loss. Sophia\u2019s stillborn child. Antonio Marcelli\u2019s son or daughter. Mia hadn\u2019t said which. Maybe Sophia had hurt too much to say in her diary.</p><p>He bent down and touched the smooth stone, as if he could somehow reach beyond and connect with the past. Behind him, Salvatore\u2019s grave loomed like a dark shadow. Nic had never thought much about his great-grandfather. He knew now he should have done his best to understand the man so he wouldn\u2019t be doomed to repeat the same mistakes.</p><p>He sat on the grass and stared up at the heavens. To have come so far only to find out he\u2019d been wrong from the beginning.</p><p>The truth was here, in the quiet, and at last he was forced to acknowledge that which he\u2019d never admitted even in the darkest recesses of his soul.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted Marcelli Wines to prove he was good enough.</p><p>Wild Sea had been the business success, but Marcelli Wines had the family. How many times as a child had he hovered just out of sight, watching the girls play together? How many nights had he stolen up to the window and pressed his nose against the dining-room glass to see them all sitting around the table? In the summer those big windows had been open, so he had heard their conversation, their laughter, and he\u2019d ached to be a part of that.</p><p>For years he\u2019d worked to prove he was good enough. And for whom? His parents, who had never cared? His grandfather, who sent him away? Brenna, who had chosen someone else?</p><p>The plan had formed the night he\u2019d been forced to leave home. He\u2019d vowed he would show them all. He would prove he was the best, and he would make them crawl to him.</p><p>His grandfather had returned first, begging him to come home and run the winery. The old man had needed him for business, but had never taken Nic back into his heart. When Emilio had died, the two of them had barely been speaking.</p><p>Over the next few years he\u2019d expanded, growing in money and power until only Marcelli was left to be conquered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d spent seven years of his life battling ghosts. It was a war he could never win. And if he did, what would he have? A few acres? The right to use a label? He would still be alone. He would still have to look at himself in the mirror. He would still not have Brenna.</p><p>He dropped his chin to his chest and closed his eyes. Brenna. She had reappeared without warning, offering what he thought was the perfect way to ensure his plan worked. He\u2019d loaned her money because he thought the callable note gave him leverage, but was that the only reason? Hadn\u2019t he also done it so that she would be nearby?</p><p>Of course, he thought, wondering why he hadn\u2019t seen it before. Brenna, whom he\u2019d never been able to forget. She\u2019d exploded into his life like a shooting star, her light reaching all the way into the dark corners of his soul. He\u2019d tried to hate her, but couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d tried to forget her, to love someone else. Anyone else. He\u2019d failed. Brenna, who had told him she loved him.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t now. Not when she learned the truth.</p><p>Nic\u2019s eyes opened. Panic seized him. In that moment he knew his only chance was to get to Brenna as quickly as possible and tell her everything. If he was able to explain, to apologize, to take it all back, then maybe she would understand. Maybe she would still love him.</p><p>Brenna was not in the mood to face her grandfather again, but she didn\u2019t have a choice. Mia dragged her into the house and found him in the library, sitting at his desk.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d Mia said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe what I found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must speak as well,\u201d he said. His gaze settled on Brenna.</p> <p>She had the thought that he looked old. Concern threaded its way through her until she reminded herself that he was going to sell the winery and destroy her world.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, this is important,\u201d Mia protested.</p><p>\u201cSo is this. It\u2019s about the sale.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat sale?\u201d She sucked in a breath. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t. Brenna\u2019s going to run the winery.\u201d</p><p>Brenna appreciated the support. Unfortunately it wouldn\u2019t have any influence on her grandfather. She ached everywhere. As much as she wanted to crawl in bed and pull the covers over her head until this all went away, she refused to show weakness again. She braced herself for the next blow and vowed she would handle it just fine.</p><p>\u201cHave you already signed the papers?\u201d she asked, pleased when her voice didn\u2019t shake.</p> <p>\u201cNo. The men who approached me aren\u2019t the ones interested in the winery. They are a front. Very respectable, very generous. A man could go a lifetime without hearing such a fine offer.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know if he was trying to make her feel worse, but if he was, he was succeeding. She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I do not deal with faceless corporations. I made a few phone calls to the bank who would handle the loan. A friend talks to another friend. Eventually I have a name.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was her imagination, but she would have sworn his hard expression softened a little. She didn\u2019t think that was good news.</p><p>Brenna clutched the back of the chair in front of her. She repeated to herself that she would handle it. Everything would be fine. There was no name her grandfather could say that would hurt her more than she\u2019d already been hurt.</p><p>No name except one.</p><p>Her grandfather nodded. \u201cYou already know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. It couldn\u2019t be possible.</p> <p>\u201cNicholas Giovanni.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mia cried, her voice thick with outrage. \u201cNot Nic. He couldn\u2019t. We were just...\u201d She threw down the diary. \u201cHe just can\u2019t be the one.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know what to think. Or maybe she simply couldn\u2019t form coherent thoughts. She wouldn\u2019t have guessed it was possible to be more stunned, more hurt, more disbelieving than she\u2019d been before. Nic buying the winery? Nic going about it in secret, hiding?</p><p>Betrayal was both bitter and cold, she realized as ice swept through her. Muscles trembled, then refused to support her weight. She leaned heavily against the chair she\u2019d been holding, before she staggered around so she could drop onto the seat.</p><p>Her vision blurred as she covered her face with her hands. No. He couldn\u2019t. Over the past few weeks they\u2019d spent so much time together. They\u2019d talked and laughed and made love. They\u2019d\u2014</p><p>She straightened with a gasp of horror. She\u2019d apologized for her behavior. She\u2019d said she loved him.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be wrong,\u201d she told her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. He\u2019s been planning this for a long time. It\u2019s all in place. His offer, the financing, everything.\u201d</p><p>But...it couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cI trusted him,\u201d she whispered. With everything. Her heart and her dreams. Oh, no. The loan\u2014in the form of a callable note. Her wine, her plans.</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandpa, it\u2019s even worse.\u201d She forced out the words when all she wanted to do was run so far and fast that she could forget everything that had happened in the past few hours. \u201cI\u2019ve done something.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked at her, then her eyes widened in comprehension. \u201cBrenna, you don\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded slowly. \u201cIt had to be part of his plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was part of his plan?\u201d her grandfather asked.</p><p>\u201cI was a fool,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. He made it so easy and I wanted it so much, I refused to consider that he was being anything but kind and generous.\u201d</p><p>She felt both helpless and stupid, and she had no one to blame but herself. \u201cI went to Nic for a million-dollar loan and he gave it to me. It\u2019s a callable note.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself for the explosion, but her grandfather only sighed heavily. \u201cA lot of money,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cA smart move on Nic\u2019s part. If I balk, he calls in the note. Even if I make good on the money, he can ruin your reputation. So he plays on my feelings for my granddaughter. He thought of everything.\u201d</p><p>Brenna doubted he\u2019d planned on her falling for him again, but no doubt he\u2019d simply considered that a lucky bonus. Being heartbroken was one thing, but a heartbroken idiot was unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Mia stepped close and squeezed her shoulder. \u201cI thought the past was twisted, but this is even worse.\u201d</p><p>Their grandfather turned his attention to her. \u201cWhat do you know of the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot more than I did a couple of days ago.\u201d Mia leaned toward the desk and slapped the top of the book she\u2019d dropped. \u201cSophia Giovanni\u2019s diary. It starts before she married Salvatore and finishes up shortly after the death of her stillborn child. She writes about everything, including why Salvatore poisoned the Marcelli vines.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather put his hand on top of Mia\u2019s on the diary. The color drained from his face and his fingers trembled.</p><p>\u201cIt is all here? The truth?\u201d</p><p>Mia nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo many lives changed,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSo much bad blood. More wrongs on top of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew the truth?\u201d Brenna asked. \u201cYou knew all this time and never said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put it together over the years. A word here, a whisper there. I was a boy when it all happened.\u201d</p><p>Brenna thought of all the times she and her sisters had decided their grandfather was crazy for worrying about an old family tale. \u201cIf we\u2019d known what really happened...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat would it have changed? The young and the old have fought since the beginning of time. It is the way of things.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, Brenna thought. She felt cold and broken, as if she\u2019d fallen from a great height. Her heart had shriveled into hard, brittle pieces. She wanted to cry, she wanted to scream. She wanted to hit something...or someone.</p><p>Footsteps clicked in the hallway. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Grandma Tessa called as she approached. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready. What? Mary-Margaret and I prepare the food and no one eats?\u201d</p><p>She walked into the library. \u201cLorenzo, you come and eat. Mia, Brenna.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her husband spoke to her in Italian. Mia probably understood, but while Brenna didn\u2019t know what he was saying, she could guess at the content. Even before he\u2019d finished, Grandma Tessa reached for her rosary and began fingering the beads.</p><p>All Brenna could think about was escape. Too many feelings swirled inside of her. She couldn\u2019t name them all, but she sensed they were about to spiral out of control.</p><p>She stood. Grandma Tessa was at her side and hugged her close. \u201cSweet, sweet girl. You come. We put you to bed, and in the morning you\u2019ll see. Things, they aren\u2019t so bad. Maybe some pasta, eh? To fill your tummy.\u201d</p><p>Brenna hugged her close. \u201cNo pasta. I don\u2019t want to eat.\u201d</p><p>What she wanted instead was revenge. Damn Nic for what he\u2019d done to her. And damn his whole family. How dare he play with her? Use her? They\u2019d had sex...she\u2019d given him her heart.</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d her grandmother asked. \u201cBrenna, hate is a sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet, Tessa,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cLet the girl be.\u201d</p><p>One small part of Brenna\u2019s brain acknowledged her grandfather\u2019s support, but she couldn\u2019t deal with that right now. Rage swept through her until she thought she might explode.</p><p>The need to move filled her. She headed for the hallway, but before she\u2019d reached it, she heard a familiar sound outside. The sound of a motorcycle.</p><p>The anger in her grew to a life force.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAll that Italian blood coursing through your veins,\u201d Mia said, taking her arm. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of you telling him exactly what you think, but not right now. You\u2019re too raw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not raw. I\u2019m empowered. I could rip him apart with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a visual.\u201d</p><p>Mia tugged on her arm, and Brenna let herself be led to the back of the house. \u201cCome on, Sis. You need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to destroy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. Let Grandma Tessa handle him.\u201d</p><p>Brenna started to protest, but an odd thing happened when she sat down in one of the kitchen chairs. She couldn\u2019t get up. In a matter of seconds her entire body shook as if she were having a seizure. Then she was crying. Great gulping sobs that nearly split her in two.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mia,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Her sister sank down next to her and pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d Brenna sobbed. \u201cOh, God, it hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him.\u201d</p><p>Mia squeezed her tight.</p><p>Brenna was grateful that her sister didn\u2019t offer any pat phrases of comfort. The truth was, there weren\u2019t any words left that would heal this wound. She\u2019d trusted Nic with her dreams and her heart, and he\u2019d never been interested in either. Instead he\u2019d wanted to destroy her and her family.</p><p>How could she have been so wrong about him? How could she have been such a fool?</p><p>Sometime close to midnight Brenna told herself she couldn\u2019t cry forever. Eventually she would run out of tears, although that didn\u2019t seem close to happening anytime soon. She felt drained and puffy and more than a little sorry for herself. Every twenty minutes or so, a fresh wave of anger gave her energy, but then the sadness drowned it out, and she was left feeling broken again.</p><p>In the past few hours she\u2019d tried to figure out which was worse\u2014her stupidity or Nic\u2019s betrayal. So far it was a toss-up. How could she have been so blind? Hadn\u2019t she learned anything by being married to Jeff and having him leave her? And how could Nic have turned out to be such incredible slime? Worse, he was slime that was damn good in bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her life had just hit bottom. Not only was she a moron, but she was a moron with a million-dollar debt.</p><p>Mia stuck her head in. \u201cI know you don\u2019t feel like it, but the Grands are fussing, so I said I\u2019d bring you up a tray.\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Just put it on the dresser.\u201d She sniffed, then pushed herself into a sitting position on the bed. \u201cWhat are they doing up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorrying about you.\u201d Mia set the tray on the dresser, then approached the bed. \u201cWe\u2019re all worried.\u201d</p><p>Brenna pulled a tissue from the box and wiped her face. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet, but not necessary. I\u2019ve already figured out I\u2019m not going to die because of this. I can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat, but that won\u2019t last very long. Eventually I\u2019ll snap out of it. Maybe I\u2019ll lose ten pounds in the process.\u201d</p><p>Mia settled on the edge of the mattress. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Do you want me to call Joe and have him bomb Nic\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Brenna blew her nose. \u201cNo, that would be a bad idea. I wouldn\u2019t want Max hurt. I\u2019ll have to figure out my own form of revenge. If I had a chance with Four Sisters, I would go the success route. Man, I would love to rub his nose in it by winning awards and becoming the darling of the wine community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could still happen,\u201d Mia said.</p> <p>\u201cNot likely. I have a feeling an attorney is going to come calling in the morning. Nic\u2019s going to want his money back.\u201d And she had no way to repay him.</p><p>She looked at her baby sister. \u201cI told him I loved him. Can you believe it? Right before you drove up, I actually said that. Do I have lousy timing or what? Actually I have lousy taste in men.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cI never knew he was such a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. I hate him.\u201d</p><p>There was another knock on the door. Brenna was surprised when her grandfather walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t anyone sleeping tonight?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI sent Tessa and Mary-Margaret to bed. Mia, it\u2019s time for you to be there, as well.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes, then kissed Brenna\u2019s cheek. \u201cIf you want to talk later, come wake me up. I\u2019m happy to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Her sister stood and left. Grandpa Lorenzo took her seat on the bed. He took her hand in his and patted her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou have been crying,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Brenna did her best to smile. \u201cI already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the boy or the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d More Nic than the money, which just proved how stupid she was. A sensible person would be more upset about the loan.</p> <p>\u201cA million dollars is a lot to cry over. What did you do with it? I know you didn\u2019t buy a new car.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh, then tears filled her eyes. She brushed them away. \u201cI wanted to start a winery,\u201d she whispered, despite the pain in her chest. \u201cRidiculous, huh?\u201d She braced herself for the explosion of temper.</p><p>But instead of yelling, her grandfather only shrugged. \u201cNot ridiculous. Not a surprise. How far did you get?\u201d</p><p>The calm response caught her off guard. She blinked away the tears. \u201cPretty far. I bought those four acres of Pinot grapes I told you about, along with crops. I\u2019m doing a cuv\u00e9e, a Chardonnay, a Pinot, and a Cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery ambitious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted Four Sisters to be up and running in two to four years. I figured I knew enough people to get my wines in the right places once it was ready. There would be a few lean years, but once I was through them, I could keep expanding.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes never wavered. \u201cFour Sisters?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Nic\u2019s.\u201d She explained how he\u2019d loaned her equipment, a building, and storage facilities. She outlined his seemingly generous offers, only now realizing how each one got her deeper and deeper in debt.</p><p>\u201cI should have realized,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have seen what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? He\u2019s a smart man. Driven. Competitive. I suspect he didn\u2019t plan to use you until you showed up wanting the loan. Then you were an opportunity he could not resist.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been easy both in and out of bed. Easy and easily fooled.</p><p>\u201cDid you try getting your loan from the banks?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd the Small Business Administration. I had no collateral, no formal education. They weren\u2019t impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father? Marco has money in trust. He could have made the loan.\u201d</p><p>In hindsight going to her father made a lot of sense. \u201cI thought...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make him choose between you and me. There\u2019s been so much fighting already. I knew you\u2019d be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look mad?\u201d</p><p>She eyed him. \u201cNo. You actually look okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee. I\u2019m not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stubborn and set in my ways?\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, she smiled. \u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather squeezed her hand. \u201cI understand.\u201d He leaned close and kissed her forehead. \u201cNow you sleep. Things will look better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Brenna doubted that was true, but she was ready to be alone so she didn\u2019t argue. She slid down on the bed and closed her eyes. Her grandfather clicked off the light as he left the room.</p><p>Once she was by herself, her eyes popped open and she stared into the darkness. Morning wouldn\u2019t bring relief. Instead it would simply be one more day to survive knowing she\u2019d been a fool for love and a sucker for her dreams.</p><p>Nic waited until after nine the following morning before calling to talk to Brenna. The previous evening when he tried to see her, Grandma Tessa had claimed she was ill. He knew that finding out about what had really happened between the Marcellis and the Giovannis all those years ago had been a shock, but he doubted it had been enough to make her sick. He reminded himself that Brenna had also learned that her grandfather might be willing to sell Marcelli. Still, she\u2019d always been tough.</p><p>He had to speak with her. He hadn\u2019t slept and had nearly gone over there a dozen times in the night. Only the thought of embarrassing her in front of her family had stopped him. But he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He had to tell her the truth, explain what had happened and why. Make her understand.</p><p>He waited impatiently through three rings. Finally the phone was answered.</p><p>\u201cMarcelli residence.\u201d</p><p>At least Lorenzo hadn\u2019t picked up. He thought he recognized the voice. \u201cMia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nic. I\u2019d like to speak with Brenna. I came by to see her last night, and your grandmother said she wasn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cDid she catch a bug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you could say she escaped from one. Or would worm be a more descriptive term?\u201d</p><p>He got a hollow feeling inside. \u201cMia, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Nic. The charming, successful Nicholas Giovanni. I would have thought with all your land and money you would be beyond using any means to get what you want, but I guess I\u2019d be wrong. I mean you\u2019re the great-grandson of a weasel bastard; why wouldn\u2019t you be just as devious and backstabbing?\u201d</p><p>Shit! \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve been planning to buy Marcelli Wines using a front of respectable businessmen because you knew my grandfather would never sell to the likes of you? If you mean that, then yes, we know. We all know. It was quite the surprise. I\u2019ve gotten over it, but Brenna\u2019s having a more difficult time. I wonder why. Hmm, you think maybe for her it got a little personal? You think she\u2019s having a little trouble with the whole betrayal thing?\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Of course Lorenzo had the means to find out who\u2019d set up the deal. \u201cI have to talk to Brenna. I have to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d Mia asked, cutting him off. \u201cNobody here gives a damn about you or your explanations.\u201d She sucked in a breath. \u201cWe took you in, Nic. We made you welcome in our home, and all that time you were planning to screw us. I never understood the feud before, but I do now. I want revenge, and if you think I\u2019m pissed off, just imagine what Brenna would like to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia, you have to listen. I know it looks bad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, Nic. The world would be a better place without you.\u201d</p><p>She hung up.</p><p>He carefully replaced the receiver, as if by moving slowly he could keep his life from shattering. But it was already too late.</p><p>He\u2019d lost.</p><p>Owning Marcelli Wines had driven him for years. Now he\u2019d lost his chance. Funny how that barely troubled him at all. What had kept him up last night, what haunted him now, was knowing that he\u2019d lost Brenna. He hadn\u2019t even known that he\u2019d had her, or how much he needed her, and now she was gone.</p><p>\u201cI mean this in the nicest possible way, Nic, but you look like crap.\u201d</p><p>Nic looked up as Maggie walked into his office. She tossed several folders onto his desk, then leaned against the door frame.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Talk? What was there to say? It had been nearly two days of hell as he tried to figure out how to fix everything that had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cNic?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBrenna found out.\u201d</p><p>He braced himself for the sympathy and kind words. They wouldn\u2019t help. Nothing filled the empty crater growing inside of him. Nothing offered relief, or better yet, a solution.</p><p>Maggie raised her eyebrows. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cWhat do you mean, so? She found out. She won\u2019t speak to me. I haven\u2019t seen her and I can\u2019t get her on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the problem. You knew she would find out eventually, and you had a good idea she wouldn\u2019t be happy, so why is this a shock?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not taking my side in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? I told you I thought it was a bad idea from the beginning. From what I could tell, you and Brenna were getting pretty tight. You were more interested in her than in anyone I\u2019ve seen you with ever. But you didn\u2019t want her as much as you wanted the win. Now she\u2019s hurt and angry. I\u2019m still confused. Why is this a surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMe, either. Until it was too late. The Marcelli deal is off, too.\u201d</p><p>Maggie didn\u2019t even pretend to look sorry. \u201cSpeaking as a friend, and not your employee, I have to tell you, you earned this, Nic. You can\u2019t play with people\u2019s lives and not expect there to be ramifications. You got caught and now you have to pay.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hear this. He wanted her to say things would work out fine. He wanted her to tell him that Brenna would understand.</p><p>\u201cShe said she loved me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>That got a reaction. Maggie dropped her arms to her sides and stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that was before she knew what you were trying to do.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou are so screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If she loves me, she has to forgive me.\u201d He hated the hopeful, pleading tone in his voice. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. Haven\u2019t you figured it out yet? Loving someone doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always okay. Some acts are simply unforgivable. I\u2019m sorry, Nic, but I have a bad feeling you\u2019ve committed one of them.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>Forty-eight hours later Brenna knew she had to drag herself down to the winery or spend the rest of her life in bed. As her sheets desperately needed washing almost as much as she needed a shower, she forced herself to get up and dressed. One of the Grands snuck in while she was in the bathroom and stripped the bed, which left her no choice but to venture out into daylight. From there it was a short walk to her cramped office in the winery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The battered old desk was both comforting and familiar. The stack of mail and messages needing response gave her a sense of purpose, even though she still felt as if she were moving under water. Everything was slow and out of sync. Still, she sorted her phone messages into tidy piles. There weren\u2019t any from Nic. Had he not called or was she not being told?</p><p>Did it matter? Why did it matter? The man had used her in every way possible while lying to her. Did she really care if he\u2019d called? Was she that weak and spineless?</p><p>Yes, she thought sadly. She was.</p> <p>But she was also really, really mad.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that he didn\u2019t love her back. She could accept that. Feelings existed for reasons no one could explain. So Nic not loving her wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. But the man had screwed with her future. He\u2019d played with the one thing she\u2019d loved even longer than him and there had to be something like a suitable punishment. Nobody messed with her wine and got away with it.</p><p>There was only one problem\u2014the money. Circumstances being what they were, she doubted Nic was going to let her have access to her barrels. Which meant she couldn\u2019t produce wine, which meant never paying him back. She was trapped, all because she\u2019d trusted Nic.</p><p>Worst of all, because there was something uglier than the situation with the wine, she didn\u2019t know how to stop loving him. Oh, she hated him with every fiber of her being, but for how long? And when she got over hating him, wouldn\u2019t the love return? It had lasted through ten years of separation; why would she be lucky enough to have it end now?</p><p>Her grandfather appeared at her open door. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he said as he entered. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>A white lie, she told herself. Telling him about her pain would only make him hurt, too, and what was the point in that?</p><p>He took the seat in front of her desk and pointed to a pad of paper. \u201cI want you to make a list for me. Outline everything you have at Wild Sea. How many barrels, what is in them.\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re through fermenting, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you mean the wine and not me personally.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather smiled. \u201cYes. The wine. Also, give me your copy of the loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo Marcelli will be beholden to that man.\u201d</p><p>His kindness eased some of her pain. \u201cYou\u2019re being really sweet, Grandpa, and I appreciate that. But we\u2019re talking about over a million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re my granddaughter. The loan will be paid back with interest, and your wine will be moved here as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have shocked her more if he\u2019d broken into a chorus of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m happy and thrilled beyond words. But this isn\u2019t your responsibility. I\u2019m the one who messed up. Nic will probably just dump the wine anyway. Not that it matters now.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt God to strike you down. The wine must be saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think God\u2019s a little busy with more important matters.\u201d She tried to explain. \u201cI may not have a choice about the loan. Nic will have to be paid back one way or the other, and without Four Sisters, I don\u2019t have a prayer of doing it myself. As for my plans...\u201d She looked at him. \u201cGrandpa, I love you and you\u2019ve been terrific through all of this, but you hate everything I do. Why would you want my experiments here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate what you do.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled for the first time in days. \u201cOh, please. We argue about everything. The blends, the day to start harvest, the temperature for fermentation. Label designs, pay raises, if it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually right about the weather.\u201d</p><p>She gave a strangled laugh. \u201cYou think you\u2019re right about everything. That\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to start my own label. I wanted to make all the decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you happy doing that?\u201d</p><p>She thought about the long nights and the endless hours of work. \u201cYes. Happier than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly the word I would use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with your winery. The success of that will be measured later. I mean here. With me.\u201d He watched her as he spoke. \u201cYou have passed the test.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be sure. When you were little, I knew you were the one. You loved the vines as much as I did.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cBy the time you were six, you could tell the type of grape by taste alone. I was so proud. You worked hard. Always up early, especially during harvest. When you were eleven, you were directing the men.\u201d</p><p>Brenna remembered that summer. She\u2019d been in charge of the Chardonnay grapes, and she\u2019d felt so grown-up. The foremen had patronized her until they realized she knew what she was talking about, and then they\u2019d treated her as someone to be reckoned with.</p><p>\u201cWhen you married Jeff, I was pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would have a good man at your side while you worked the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t turn out that way,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI went away.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI waited for you to return, for you to realize where you belonged, but you didn\u2019t. Year after year I watched your husband bleed the life out of you until the granddaughter I had been so proud of disappeared. Then one day you came home. Not because you longed to be here, but because your husband had left you. You wanted to come back. To work here. But I asked myself, for how long now?\u201d</p><p>Understanding clicked in her brain like a light going on. \u201cYou wanted to make sure I was staying,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes. So I tested you to see if I could drive you away. I wanted to make sure that this time you wouldn\u2019t give up. Not for anything.\u201d</p><p>She both understood and resented his methods. \u201cWhat about Joe? You offered him everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but he would never have run things. I hoped...\u201d He sighed. \u201cAn old man\u2019s wishes. I wanted him to stay, and I thought with the winery, he would. But he would never have been the one. It was always you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou were never going to sell.\u201d</p><p>His expression turned sly. \u201cYou think not?\u201d</p><p>Brenna covered her face with her hands. \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t. Oh, God. One more place I\u2019ve been an idiot.\u201d She put her hands back on the desk. \u201cIf worse came to worst, you would have left everything to Dad and had him hire a manager. After all, one of your granddaughters could have a child interested in the winery.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. But that\u2019s not necessary. You have proved yourself. You wanted it so much, you started your own label. You fought for what you believed, and you have earned your chance. You will carry on the tradition of Marcelli Wines and in time pass that tradition on to the next generation and the one after that.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t know what to say. She rose and circled around the desk. Her grandfather stood and held out his arms. She stepped into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cMarcelli is yours,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll be here to watch over you, but you can start to make a few changes.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t talk. It was too much.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll argue a little,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe difference is now you get to win some of the time, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and held her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cThis makes you happy?\u201d</p><p>She nodded because it was still difficult to speak. There were details to be worked out. While she would be in charge of the winery, she knew it would be owned jointly by her sisters and Joe. But regardless of logistics, she would be the one shaping Marcelli Wines.</p><p>Bittersweet joy swept through her as relief mingled with pain. She finally had what she\u2019d always wanted. She should be content...whole, even. So why did Nic have to be the first person she wanted to tell?</p><p>The rumble of several trucks interrupted Nic\u2019s meeting with his sales managers. Despite his interest in the report being discussed, he found his attention straying to the window where the first large vehicle came into view. For several minutes he did his best to ignore the noise, but finally he was forced to excuse himself to check on what was happening.</p><p>He already knew, he told himself. Ever since his conversation with Mia, he\u2019d been waiting for something like this. Confirmation had arrived that morning in the form of a cashier\u2019s check for the amount Brenna owed him, plus accrued interest. The debt had been paid in full.</p><p>She\u2019d come clean with her grandfather, and the old man had come through for her. Nic had never doubted his love and devotion, even if Brenna had questioned Lorenzo\u2019s feelings. The Marcellis were family, and for them, the word meant something. Sacrifices were made. Acts of rebellion were explained and pardoned. In the end, no matter what, they had each other.</p><p>Nic crossed to the old fermentation building. A dozen or so men carefully loaded barrels of wine into the trucks. A man with a clipboard checked off the inventory. He saw Nic but didn\u2019t speak to him. Nic was about to return to his office, when he heard a familiar voice. He froze.</p><p>Brenna?</p><p>He hurried toward the sound. Was she here? Could he explain?</p><p>\u201cBrenna,\u201d he said as he circled around one of the trucks.</p><p>Then he saw her standing beside several barrels, directing the men. Strong and sure and still not aware of him. She spoke with a firmness he recognized.</p><p>She looked tired, sad, yet beautiful. She\u2019d always been beautiful.</p><p>\u201cBrenna,\u201d he repeated, and this time she heard him.</p><p>She turned and stared at him. There was no expression on her face, no way for him to gauge what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cBrenna, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t try weaseling your way out of all of this, Nic. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. There aren\u2019t enough words in the world to excuse what you\u2019ve done. There is nothing you can say to ever make me understand or forgive you.\u201d She laughed harshly and without humor. \u201cBig assumption on my part. That you\u2019re here looking for absolution.\u201d</p><p>He stepped toward her. \u201cI am. I\u2019m sorry. About everything.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Not anymore. Not ever again. Take your cheap apologies somewhere else. You\u2019ve lied to me for the last time.\u201d</p><p>With that she walked to one of the trucks and climbed into the passenger seat. The driver had already secured the wine barrels. Now he closed the back gate, climbed into the cab, and started the engine.</p><p>Nic stood there, watching them drive away.</p><p>He waited through the rest of the loading, and when the last truck disappeared down the driveway, he stood alone in the old building.</p><p>He\u2019d known it was over\u2014had realized that there was no way to undo what he\u2019d done\u2014but until her wine had been taken away, he\u2019d thought maybe she might be willing to listen. If he could speak with her, explain, maybe he could make her understand.</p><p>Or was that just an ego-based fantasy? In truth she was gone because he\u2019d never been willing to acknowledge she was important to him. She\u2019d been a means to an end, not a person. Not a woman he loved. Had loved.</p><p>Hell, who was he kidding? Brenna was as much a part of him as his fingerprints. She\u2019d stolen his heart a lifetime ago, and he would never get it back.</p><p>He crossed to one of the chairs still in the building and touched battered wood. They\u2019d sat in these seats, talking, arguing, rediscovering the possibilities. She shared her dreams with him, he\u2019d relived their past. Somehow ten years after the fact, they\u2019d made peace with what had happened before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d made love in this room. They\u2019d shared bodies and hearts, and until this moment he hadn\u2019t known how much that meant to him. Now there were only ghosts and echoes of what could have been. He\u2019d fallen in love and he\u2019d been too blind to see his feelings for what they were. He\u2019d put away the past, but had lost the future.</p><p>Even without Marcelli Wines, Wild Sea would go on. The company would grow and prosper. The Giovanni family would never want for anything. As he had wanted, Nic had created a legacy that would continue indefinitely.</p><p>He sank into the chair and rested his head in his hands. Oh, yeah, he should be damn proud. He\u2019d created a legacy for one. There were no children to carry on the family name, no wife to come home to. He lived with a dog. At the end of the day he stood alone.</p> <p>For years he\u2019d told himself that was what he wanted. That he needed no one. But he\u2019d been lying. He ached for Brenna. Her voice, her laughter, her touch, her grit and determination, her fearlessness, her love, gave his life purpose. He\u2019d never loved anyone else because he\u2019d never stopped loving her. They were a part of each other. She\u2019d seen that, but he\u2019d been blinded by pride and ambition. Now they were all he had to keep himself warm at night.</p><p>The fault, the blame, the responsibility was all his. There was no delegating this disaster.</p><p>For the first time Nic wondered if Salvatore had ever regretted his act of revenge. He\u2019d exacted a price for his best friend\u2019s betrayal. Had he ever considered the cost too high? Had Salvatore lost more than he had gained?</p><p>For nearly a hundred years the Marcellis and Giovannis had been linked. First by friendship and dreams, and later by hatred and destruction. What was that old saying? Those who do not learn from the past are destined to repeat it. Well, Nic had finally learned, even if his great-grandfather had not. Success through destruction or revenge was an empty victory, and the price was paid by generations. He couldn\u2019t change what Salvatore had done, nor could he undo his own reckless behavior. But he could make amends. They might not win back Brenna, but they would end the feud. Maybe that was the best he could hope for.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Twelve-year-old Kelly, Francesca\u2019s soon-to-be stepdaughter, bounced in her seat. \u201cSo you, like, own the whole winery?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re rich?\u201d</p><p>Mia wrinkled her nose as she threaded a bead onto the needle. \u201cWe all own it equally, but Brenna gets to run things.\u201d She turned to Katie. \u201cCan we fire her if her head gets too big?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cI have an anti-big-head clause in my contract.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be enough.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled because Mia was trying to be funny, and if she could convince her sisters that everything was fine, maybe they\u2019d stop hovering around her.</p><p>They were trying to be kind. She understood they were concerned about her and wanted to help. But there wasn\u2019t anything for them to do just now. She alone could endure and recover. In time she wouldn\u2019t hurt so much.</p> <p>Francesca finished beading the piece of lace and set it on the coffee table in front of her. \u201cLook at the bright side, Mia. If Brenna gets out of hand, we can always threaten to take over those ocean-front four acres where she\u2019s growing her precious Pinot grapes. Imagine the views we\u2019d have from our front windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime,\u201d Brenna growled.</p><p>Katie grinned. \u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll talk to Grandpa about it,\u201d she said in a mock whisper.</p><p>Kelly glanced at Francesca\u2019s watch. \u201cIt\u2019s been fifteen minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cookies should be cool enough to frost. May I be excused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Francesca smiled at Kelly. \u201cWhile beading lace can be pretty exciting, I know it doesn\u2019t compare with icing cookies. Why don\u2019t you bring us a plate of them when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stood and dropped her piece of lace onto the loveseat, then raced into the kitchen.</p><p>Francesca glanced toward the kitchen, then back at Brenna. She lowered her voice.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Brenna forced a smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me. I\u2019m going to be okay. I have the winery and my family. I feel very loved and supported.\u201d She glanced at her sisters and saw none of them looked convinced. She made an X over her heart. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should get in touch with Joe,\u201d Mia grumbled. \u201cHe\u2019d know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her head. \u201cJoe can\u2019t help with the real problem.\u201d</p><p>She exchanged a look with Katie that told Brenna the two of them had been talking about her.</p><p>Brenna sighed. \u201cOkay. Out with it.\u201d</p><p>Katie shrugged at Francesca. Brenna\u2019s twin sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe know you\u2019re still in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t consider that a news flash. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can tell, nothing happens. I keep moving forward. I work, I plan, I recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want him back?\u201d</p><p>Trust Francesca to cut to the heart of the matter. Did she want Nic back in her life? \u201cYes,\u201d she said, then sighed. \u201cHow sick is that? The man betrayed me in the worst way possible, and I still want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to, though, are you?\u201d Mia asked. \u201cI mean he was so awful. Trying to buy the winery like that and using you. You\u2019ve got to be mad at him.\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cFurious.\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked at Mia. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Loving someone can be a complicated, multilayered situation. You hate the act, but still love the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Brenna promised, then hoped she wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to help with the dresses,\u201d Katie said. \u201cNot if it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m still a member of this family,\u201d Brenna reminded her. \u201cI want to work on the dresses. I want you both to be wildly happy with the men you\u2019re going to marry. I\u2019m thrilled for you both, and I can\u2019t wait to dance at your wedding. I just need a little time.\u201d</p><p>None of her sisters looked convinced, but they dropped the subject. Mia talked about the classes she would be taking when school started the following week, and Katie told funny stories about an office party she\u2019d catered. Brenna listened and nodded, laughing where she was supposed to and adding a comment now and then. She thought she did a pretty good imitation of someone getting by. Her goal was to never let them know how much she hurt inside. Forgetting Jeff had been a snap, which went to show how little she\u2019d cared about her ex-husband. She knew loving Nic was a slick road to hell, but she couldn\u2019t figure out how to make the feelings go away.</p><p>Give it time, she told herself. Time and wisdom and possibly an ocean of tears.</p><p>By early October the vines were ready for their winter rest. Brenna and her grandfather strolled through the rows of plants. A bright afternoon sun warmed the temperature into the low seventies, but as always, Brenna felt cold. She didn\u2019t sleep much these days and food didn\u2019t appeal to her. The previous night she\u2019d actually not been in the mood for dinner. If she kept this up for long, she would be able to give Francesca a run for her money as the skinny sister.</p><p>\u201cI tasted your Pinot yesterday,\u201d her grandfather said. \u201cStill too soon to tell, but I think maybe you were right about that land.\u201d</p><p>Brenna pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cCareful, Grandpa. Too many shocks like that and my heart will fail.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cI think maybe we find another few acres right on the coast and plant some more. With the fog to keep the vines cool and salt air to add that touch of magic, we could create something very special.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stared at him. \u201cYou want to buy land? Non-Marcelli acreage and put our name on the grapes?\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cYou never showed me the proper respect as a girl. As a woman, you\u2019re no better at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but that\u2019s so beside the point. Wow. I don\u2019t know what to think. Last week you let me make the final choice on the Chardonnay labels. So maybe next year I can use more of the premium Chardonnay for my white-wine blend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want it all,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in wanting only half of it?\u201d</p><p>The old man grinned proudly. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Brenna chuckled. She and her grandfather still argued, but not as much as they once had. Now he listened to her opinions. In return, she was more open to the values of the old ways. While a part of her resented that he\u2019d felt the need to test her, most of her understood his somewhat twisted reasoning. He was a traditional man. Leaving a woman in charge was a big step for him.</p><p>He pulled a book out of his jacket pocket and tapped the cover. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading this.\u201d</p><p>Brenna recognized Sophia\u2019s diary. Mia had brought it back with them when they\u2019d gone to talk to their grandfather.</p><p>Seeing the old, battered cover made her think of Nic, but it took so little to bring him to mind.</p><p>\u201cMia already told you what Sophia wrote,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see the truth for myself.\u201d He put the diary back in his pocket. \u201cWho is to say which wrong is less hurtful? Antonio loved his best friend\u2019s wife. A sin perhaps, but the greater sin was acting on that love. Sophia was not faithful to her husband. Salvatore insisted on her naming the man who betrayed him, then punished them both. Friends torn apart by a night of passion and a night of revenge. Families growing up to hate each other. The past circles around us, molding us. We seek to hold the past in our hands, but it cannot be caught. Perhaps it can only be set free.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cMaybe it is time to let old grudges go.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Because her grandfather and the feud had been woven into a single entity for as long as she could remember. Because hating the Giovanni family had helped define who she was as a person. Because if loving Nic hadn\u2019t meant defying her family, she would have married him ten years ago.</p><p>It was too little too late, she thought sadly. She\u2019d been given control of the winery, been told the feud should end, and now neither could ease the ache inside her heart.</p><p>She started to head back to the house, only to realize she didn\u2019t recognize where they were. At some point in their walk, they\u2019d left Marcelli land and walked onto Wild Sea property.</p><p>\u201cThe fence is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of it.\u201d</p><p>She turned in a slow circle, searching for the thick posts and lengths of wire, but they had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNicholas came to see me.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather spoke matter-of-factly. As if a visit by Nic was no big deal.</p><p>Brenna gaped at him. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame to see me. We talked.\u201d The old man shrugged. \u201cAbout the past, and the future. How anger and revenge destroyed so much. He wanted to apologize for his great-grandfather. To make up for what went before.\u201d</p><p>Nic had visited her grandfather? When? Why hadn\u2019t anyone told her?</p><p>\u201cHe gave me this to give to you.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather held out a piece of paper. Brenna took it and tried to read it, but the words blurred together. Her chest ached and her stomach felt as if it were test-driving a new roller coaster.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d She gave back the paper.</p><p>Her grandfather smiled. \u201cThe land, Brenna. He\u2019s deeded you all the land where Salvatore had grafted in the European vines. He couldn\u2019t give you back what his grandfather had killed, so he\u2019s giving you what he has. Not to me. Not to the Marcelli family. Just to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think, she couldn\u2019t think. It was too much. It didn\u2019t make sense. Terror and hope and confusion swirled together in her mind. Then suddenly she saw a silhouette in the distance. She was too far away to see his features, but she knew him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her grandfather gave her a gentle push on the back. \u201cSo go listen. You like what he says, then fine. You don\u2019t like, we get your brother to flatten him.\u201d</p><p>Brenna didn\u2019t think it was possible to move, but suddenly she found herself walking. Nic hurried toward her from across the field. In less time than she would have thought, they were standing in front of each other.</p><p>He looked awful. Dark shadows stained the skin under his eyes, and his face was gaunt. For the first time in her life she saw uncertainty in his eyes. Uncertainty and pain.</p> <p>She understood both feelings. She was delighted to be close to him and terrified of being involved in another emotional hit-and-run. She loved him. She despised him. She wanted to throw him in the grape crusher and grind his bones to dust.</p><p>\u201cI had this great speech I\u2019ve been working on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all logical and detailed. I explained why everything happened the way it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn it did you remember to call yourself a lying weasel dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I settled on a shit-for-brains bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hate me.\u201d He sounded resigned.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sort of hoped...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaggie warned me that some acts are unforgivable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. You used me, Nic. You took advantage of my dreams. You let me think you believed in me, when all the while you were looking for angles. You weren\u2019t ever going to give me a chance to make Four Sisters a success. You led me on, and when the timing was right, you were going to rip it all out from under me.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cYou know what\u2019s the worst of it? All the time you were planning to destroy my life, I was falling for you. I trusted you with my future and my heart, and you tried to screw with them both.\u201d</p><p>She turned to walk away, but he grabbed her arm and held her in place.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cI did all that. You waltzed into my office, wanting a loan, and I saw it as a golden opportunity. I didn\u2019t plan to use you, but when I got the chance, I took it. I gave you the money to get leverage with your grandfather and because I never thought you\u2019d make Four Sisters work. I figured you\u2019d fall on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think I could do it?\u201d Now he\u2019d not only hurt her, he\u2019d insulted her.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. You\u2019d been away from the business for years. I gave you six months.\u201d He narrowed his gaze. \u201cBut I was wrong. About all of it. I\u2019d forgotten how good you were and how hard you were willing to work. I saw you there night after night, and I realized you had the guts and the skill to do it. You earned my respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig fat hairy deal.\u201d She ground her teeth together.</p><p>\u201cYou think I care about your respect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p> <p>She jerked her arm free. Damn him, she did care. Despite everything, Nic\u2019s opinion mattered.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d She glared at him. \u201cYou respected me, but you still lied to me and made love with me knowing all the time you were trying to destroy everything that made my family special.\u201d</p><p>She waited for Nic to yell something back at her, but instead he looked away.</p><p>\u201cI told myself I wanted to be the biggest and the best, but it wasn\u2019t about that at all,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI wanted to be a part of what you had with them. If I couldn\u2019t get it any other way, I would buy it. Maybe a little of it was to punish you for what you\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her. \u201cI offered you all I had, and it wasn\u2019t enough. I wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s anger crumbled. \u201cIt was never about you. It was about me. I was too afraid to follow my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that now, but back then...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both were.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and touched the backs of his fingers to her cheek. The warm contact made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid anymore and there\u2019s no excuse for what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cI was wrong. If I wanted to buy the winery, I should have been up front about it. As for loaning you the money\u2014you\u2019re right. I took advantage of your dreams, and that\u2019s the lowest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m not proud of the man I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for hating me. I tell myself at least that\u2019s better than you not caring at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you give me the land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d His dark eyes flashed with pain. \u201cBecause I love you and I don\u2019t know how else to tell you I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He pulled a leaf off a nearby plant and pressed it into her palm. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve always had this in common. Maybe, with time, it can mend what\u2019s been broken.\u201d</p><p>Brenna realized that Nic was just as stupid as every other man on the planet. In the middle of the most life-changing conversation they were ever likely to have, he\u2019d given her a leaf?</p><p>\u201cYou want to pass that middle part by me again?\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned as he tried to remember. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>His expression turned cautious. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry? I put myself on the line for you, Nic. I threw my heart at your feet, and you trampled over it. An \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and a leaf aren\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cBrenna, when you told me you loved me, it was the best and worst moment of my life. I wanted to be with you more than I wanted my next breath, but I knew what I\u2019d done was going to destroy us. You talk about going back in time and changing your answer to my proposal. If I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t listen when you said no. Even then I knew it was your fear talking. But I was young and proud and you\u2019d hurt me. Given the chance to do it over, I would tell you that your fears weren\u2019t bigger than both of us. I would stand in the back of the church where you were marrying Jeff and tell the world you loved me and that I loved you.\u201d</p><p>He took her hands in his. \u201cIf I could change time, even go back just a few months, I would still offer you that loan. But this time I would do it because I wanted you to have your heart\u2019s desire. I would spend every moment I could with you, convincing you that the magic was still there. I love you. I\u2019ve loved you since the first moment I saw you sneaking tastes from that damn barrel.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been hoping for a heartfelt confession. She hadn\u2019t expected him to sweep her off her feet and set her soul free.</p><p>\u201cYour whole family hates me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hate me. But I\u2019m hoping you still love me, too. I want to win you back. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to prove to you that we belong together. I want to marry you, have babies with you, and grow old with you. I want to talk about the old days until our grandchildren know the stories by heart. I want to make wine with you, make love with you, cherish you, and be the one safe haven you can always depend on. Just give me a chance. Please.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever groveled to her before. Nic was unlikely to do it much in the future, so Brenna did her best to memorize everything about this moment so she could remember it later, when he was making her crazy. She knew that he would. They were both stubborn and creative and passionate about what they did. Clashes were inevitable. But there was no one else she wanted to disagree with, or hold long into the night. Or love.</p><p>She leaned forward and brushed her lips against his.</p><p>\u201cHow many babies?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned, then the grin turned into laughter. He swept her up in his arms and spun her around. \u201cAs many as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I marry you, I want some say in how you run Wild Sea. It\u2019s way too mechanized. You need to start hand-picking more. And your barrel choices are really...\u201d</p><p>He silenced her with a kiss. A deep, hungry, passionate kiss that spoke of too much time apart, of pain and missed chances. Tears filled her eyes, and she knew she wept for them both.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Nic,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze met hers and he smiled. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She rested her hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think my parents have sent out the invitations for Katie\u2019s and Francesca\u2019s wedding yet. We still have time to make it a triple ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea? Won\u2019t your grandfather glower at me through the whole ceremony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He told me it\u2019s time for the feud to be over.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, then I say go for it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cMy mother is going to absolutely have a fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of logistics, or because you\u2019re marrying me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the trauma of more guests, more food, that sort of thing. But don\u2019t worry about it. With Katie helping her, the whole event will be organized with military-like precision.
