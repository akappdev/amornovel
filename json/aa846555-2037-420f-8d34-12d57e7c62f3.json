Shelley had left work the previous evening excited about her appointment at a new and trendy salon. She\u2019d gone in expecting some subtle highlights and a few layers. She\u2019d left with a botched body perm, orange brassy color and a cut that could only be described as...unfortunate.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I have a great idea.\u201d Jill stood and walked around her desk where she flipped through her electronic Rolodex. \u201cI know exactly who can fix this for you.\u201d</p> <p>Shelley looked up. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnton.\u201d</p><p>Shelley sucked in a breath and for the first time that morning, hope filled her swollen eyes. \u201cAnton? You know him?\u201d</p><p>Anton, like Madonna, was famous enough not to need a last name. Two-tone highlights and a styling cost as much as a small imported car, but the rich and famous swore by his magic fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his lawyer,\u201d Jill said with a grin. \u201cNow let me call him and explain we have a hair emergency. I\u2019m sure he can take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Shelley had an appointment for early that afternoon. Jill promised to let her make up the time by coming in early for the next couple of days.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best,\u201d Shelley said as she walked to the door and stepped out into the hallway. \u201cIf you ever need me to do anything, let me know. I\u2019m serious. A kidney. Have your baby, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could look over the brief I left on your desk,\u201d Jill told her with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s due first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Right this second. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jill chuckled as she turned back to her computer. If only all of life\u2019s problems could be solved so easily.</p><p>Two hours later, she looked up from her research. Coffee, she decided. A nice, little jump start to keep her brain going. She stood and headed for the centrally located lunchroom where jumbo carafes full of liquid energy waited.</p><p>On her way back, she detoured around to the other side of the offices where her husband, also a third-year associate, had his office. They\u2019d been working so many hours the past few weeks, they\u2019d barely seen each other. Her calendar was free. If Lyle\u2019s was, too, maybe they could grab lunch together.</p><p>His assistant was gone and his door closed. Jill knocked lightly once, then pushed inside. She moved quietly, not wanting to interrupt if he was on the phone.</p><p>He was busy, all right, but not with a call. Jill stopped in the center of the room. Breath left her body as the mug of coffee fell to the carpeted floor. She didn\u2019t remember letting go, but she felt the hot liquid splash onto her legs.</p> <p>Her husband of three years, the man she lived with, worked with and cooked for, stood beside his credenza. His jacket was over his chair, his pants around his ankles and he was busily banging his assistant. So busy, in fact, he hadn\u2019t noticed Jill\u2019s entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, baby,\u201d Lyle breathed. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>But the woman saw Jill. Her face paled and she shoved Lyle away.</p><p>Later Jill would remember the silence and how time seemed to slow. Later she would recall the way papers had fluttered to the floor as his assistant scrambled off the credenza and jerked up her panty hose. Later she would want to kill Lyle. But right now she could only stare in disbelief.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening, she told herself. He was her husband. He was supposed to love her.</p><p>\u201cNext time you should knock,\u201d he said as he bent over and grabbed his pants.</p><p>She had, she thought, too stunned to feel much of anything. Then she turned on her heel and ran from the room.</p><p>FORTY-NINE HOURS and eighteen minutes later, Jill decided that being buried alive was too good for Lyle. Still, she was due some serious revenge. Unfortunately, as she had no idea on how to get the revenge she so desperately needed, she contented herself with imagining him lying on the edge of a desert highway, gasping for breath as she zoomed by at a comfortable ninety miles an hour. She liked the vision of her soon-to-be ex-husband as roadkill.</p><p>\u201cLying weasel rat-fink dog,\u201d she muttered as she slowed at the bottom of the freeway off-ramp and turned west.</p><p>The lying weasel rat-fink dog was currently back in San Francisco, moving into what should have been her junior partner office with a window. No doubt he would celebrate what should have been her promotion by taking out his assistant, then seducing her with wine from the collection she\u2019d put together, and carrying her off to what had been their bed.</p><p>Yes, it was true. Jill\u2019s day had gone from bad to worse. It wasn\u2019t enough to catch her husband in the act; later that afternoon she\u2019d been fired.</p><p>\u201cI hope Lyle gets a sexually transmitted disease and Big Willie falls off,\u201d she said aloud, before correcting herself. \u201cNot exactly \u2018Big\u2019 Willie. In fact, nothing to be proud of. I had to fake most of those orgasms, you rat bastard lying weasel dog.\u201d</p><p>Worse, she\u2019d cooked for him. Jill could accept a bad sex life, but to think she\u2019d ducked out of important meetings so that Lyle could come home to meals she\u2019d prepared really made her teeth ache.</p><p>She wanted to roll down the windows and scream into the sea-soaked air that she hated her husband and couldn\u2019t wait until their divorce was final. She wished she\u2019d never met him, had never fallen for him and had never married him. But there was no point in frightening the seagulls on the sidewalk and the two old guys playing checkers in the park.</p><p>The only bright spot in an otherwise completely black situation was that Shelley\u2019s hair had turned out movie-star gorgeous. Something to hang on to, Jill thought as she pulled to a stop at a red light and looked around for the first time since leaving San Francisco. Really looked.</p><p>Jeez, she was back in the one place she never wanted to be. Obviously her string of bad luck had continued, she thought, as she realized she was the only person on the planet who really could go home again.</p><p>Los Lobos, California\u2014a small, touristy coastal town where folks vacationed every year. You could get homemade ice cream at the local Treats \u2019n Eats, homemade pie at Polly\u2019s Pie Parlor, and the best fajitas in the state at Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill. Residents never locked their doors, except during tourist season. The pier was a national treasure and the Halloween Pumpkin festival on the beach was one of the biggest events of the year. For some it was paradise; for Jill, it was like being sentenced to serve time in hell. It was also something else Lyle was going to have to answer for.</p><p>At least the family home had been turned over to the Conservancy Society, so she was saved the humiliation of having to live in her old bedroom. The house where she\u2019d grown up was in the process of being restored to its original Victorian prissiness, and so she was temporarily moving in with her aunt Beverly.</p><p>The thought of the older woman\u2019s gentle smile and potpourri-filled house pushed Jill\u2019s foot down on the accelerator. She drove through the center of town\u2014such as it was\u2014and came out on the south side. After making a series of turns, she pulled up in front of a two-story house built in the 1940s. The wide porch had an over hang supported by stone-covered pillars. Several worn pieces of rattan furniture filled the space and offered a place to sit and watch the world go by. Jill found her self in more of a \u201ccurl up and lick her wounds\u201d kind of mind-set, but that would pass, and when it did she would appreciate the old rocking chair by the swing.</p><p>She parked in front of the house and climbed out. Aunt Bev must have been watching from the big bay window because she stepped out of the house and started down the stairs.</p><p>Beverly Antoinette Cooper, known as Bev to her friends, had been born into money. Not gobs and gobs but enough that she\u2019d never had to hold a job, even though she\u2019d spent a couple of years as a schoolteacher when she\u2019d first graduated from college. Petite, with fiery red hair and a big smile, she\u2019d been the younger of the two children in her family. She\u2019d moved to Los Lobos when her sister had married Jill\u2019s father and had decided to stay.</p><p>Jill had never been more grateful for the family connection. Her aunt wasn\u2019t one to judge or criticize. Mostly she offered hugs, affection and occasionally odd advice. Bev considered herself gifted\u2014psychically\u2014al though the jury was still out on that one. Feeling better than she had since walking in on Lyle and his assistant going at it on his credenza, Jill walked around to the sidewalk, where she stopped and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt grinned. \u201cNice wheels.\u201d</p><p>Jill glanced at the gleaming black BMW 545. \u201cIt\u2019s transportation,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cUh-huh. Lyle\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia is a community-property state,\u201d Jill said primly. \u201cAs he acquired the asset after our marriage, it\u2019s as much my car as his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took it because you knew it would piss him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Her aunt glanced at Jill\u2019s shirt and raised her eyebrows. \u201cTakeout?\u201d</p><p>Jill looked at the stain on the front of the hundred-percent Egyptian cotton custom-made shirt she\u2019d shrugged on over her jeans. The sleeves hung well past her fingers and she could have fit inside the garment two and a half times, but this was Lyle\u2019s special shirt that he\u2019d ordered from Hong Kong at the tidy price of five hundred dollars. He\u2019d owned four. The other three were tucked inside her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cBurrito,\u201d she said as she rubbed at the brownish-red smudge just under her right breast. \u201cMaybe some hot sauce. I stopped at Taco Bell on the way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you ate in the car,\u201d Bev said impishly. \u201cLyle always did have a thing against eating in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery bite,\u201d Jill told her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Bev held out her arms. Jill hesitated only a second, then flung herself into the smaller woman\u2019s warm embrace. She\u2019d been holding it together for two days, only allowing herself to deal with the logistics of packing up her world. All her emotions had been stuffed down until it was safe to let them go. That moment turned out to be right now.</p><p>Her face heated, her chest tightened and a shudder raced through her.</p><p>\u201cI saw him doing it with her,\u201d she whispered, her voice thick with pain and the tears she tried to hold back. \u201cAt the office. It was so disgusting. He didn\u2019t even take his clothes off\u2014his pants were hanging around his ankles and he looked ridiculous. Why wouldn\u2019t she make him get naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome women don\u2019t have any self-respect.\u201d</p><p>Jill nodded. \u201cAt least I always made him get naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t what hurt the most,\u201d she continued, her eyes burning. \u201cHe stole my promotion. I\u2019d been working so damn hard and I brought in all that business and he got my promotion and I got fired.\u201d</p><p>The tears broke free. She tried to hold them in, but it was too late. They scorched her skin and dripped onto her aunt\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAnd what I really d-don\u2019t understand is why I\u2019m more mad than hurt,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cWhy do I care more about my job than my marriage?\u201d</p><p>Jill asked the question rhetorically. She had a feeling they both already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cWant to scratch his car?\u201d her aunt asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jill straightened and wiped her face with the back of her hand. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made cookies. Let\u2019s go have some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p> <p>Bev took her hand and led her toward the house. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some research. I think I might be able to put a curse on Lyle. Would that help?\u201d</p><p>With each step, Jill felt her pain easing just a little. Maybe Los Lobos wasn\u2019t her idea of a good time, but her aunt\u2019s house had always been a haven.</p><p>\u201cA curse would be good. Could we give him boils with pus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could sure try.\u201d</p><p>TWO HOURS LATER Jill and her aunt had split nearly a dozen double-chocolate-chip cookies and had knocked back several brandies.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything malicious,\u201d Jill said, pretty darned proud she could say malicious, what with the way the liquor had heated her blood and turned her brain to foggy mush. \u201cSo instead of outright scratching the Beamer, maybe I\u2019ll just park it by the high-school baseball diamond. All those foul balls could make a real impact on it.\u201d She giggled. \u201cGet it? Impact? The two meanings of the word?\u201d</p><p>Her aunt sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betcha. And I feel pretty good, if I do say so myself. I didn\u2019t think I would. I thought I\u2019d be depressed for days. I mean practicing law here.\u201d She grimaced and felt her good mood slipping away. \u201cOkay\u2014that goes on the do-not-think-about list. Not my new practice here, although I use the term loosely. At least that\u2019s just until I get a real job. Not Lyle. The divorce is good, though. I really want that. I want our marriage to never have been.\u201d She reached for another cookie. \u201cCould we vaporize him? Would that technically be murder?\u201d She sighed. \u201cNever mind. I know it would be. I don\u2019t want to be disbarred. That would be too depressing for words.\u201d</p><p>Cookie crumbs fell on her shirt right next to the damp spot where she\u2019d sloshed her brandy. She brushed at the crumbs only to smear chocolate on the shirt.</p><p>\u201cI need to go clean up,\u201d she said, and put down the half-eaten cookie. \u201cI didn\u2019t shower before I left San Francisco this morning.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she reached behind her head to grab her mass of curly, frizzy hair. While she\u2019d showered the previous morning, she hadn\u2019t bothered with her usual blow-dry, flatiron, forty-seven-hair-care-product regimen required to tame her impossible hair. As a result, she was left with a mass resembling Frankenstein\u2019s bride after the woman stuck her finger in an electrical socket. On the attractive scale, she knew she approached absolute zero.</p> <p>Jill pushed herself to her feet. Between not sleeping much in the past two days and the brandy, the roses on the wallpaper in the kitchen began to swirl.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after a shower,\u201d her aunt said. \u201cYou remember where everything is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Top of the stairs.\u201d Although right now the thought of climbing stairs made her dizzy.</p><p>A timer dinged at the same instant that someone knocked on the front door. Her aunt rose from the round table by the window and motioned for Jill to head for the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cSee who it is. I don\u2019t trust you to remove hot cookie sheets in your present condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>Jill walked down the hall, only plowing into the wall once. She got a vision of herself as a bumper car, which made her giggle. She was still caught up in the humor when she pulled open the front door.</p> <p>There were only a handful of things that could have made her present situation worse: The death or injury of someone she loved, the belief that she would never escape from Los Lobos to work in a big-city law practice again, and seeing Mackenzie Kendrick while she looked like cat gack.</p><p>So it was a one-out-of-three chance, she thought, as she stared at the man standing on her aunt\u2019s doorstep. Couldn\u2019t she have just been struck by lightning?</p><p>Apparently not, she thought as she looked into dark blue eyes and studied the familiar, painfully handsome and strong features that made up his face. He looked older, but who didn\u2019t? He could still make her toes curl and her heart convulse like the bouncing ball on a karaoke monitor. Or maybe that was the brandy acting out.</p><p>Last she\u2019d heard, Mac Kendrick had moved to Los Angeles where he\u2019d been zipping up the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department. Last she\u2019d seen of Mac, she\u2019d been eighteen and he\u2019d been home on leave from the army. She\u2019d shown up in his bedroom, dropped her dress to the floor, offering her very naked self to him, and he\u2019d promptly thrown up.</p><p>Memories like that put the end of her marriage in perspective.</p><p>\u201cMac,\u201d she said, going for pleasant and cheerful and hoping she didn\u2019t end up sounding manic.</p><p>He frowned. The movement made his brows surge together and his eyes get all crinkly. Jill had to work hard not to sigh at how delicious he looked. She remembered the stains on the huge shirt she wore just as his expression cleared.</p><p>\u201cJill?\u201d</p><p>She offered a little waggle of her fingers. \u201cUh-huh. Hi. I\u2019m uh...\u201d Visiting wasn\u2019t the truth and she knew she was too drunk to lie. Maybe better to avoid the issue of why she was in town. \u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cIn town? Here? In Los Lobos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the new sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. The curve of his mouth made her stomach somersault.</p><p>\u201cI like it here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI guess everyone gets an opinion.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long time, then touched the edge of his upper lip. \u201cYou have some crumbs....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. The cookies.\u201d She swiped with her hand, then reached for the edge of the shirt and wiped it across her mouth. A quick glance told her there had been chocolate in those crumbs. Great.</p><p>\u201cMac? Is that you?\u201d Bev joined them. \u201cI\u2019m sure you want to confirm everything. Come on in. Jill, step back and let Mac inside.\u201d</p><p>Jill did as ordered. Somewhere between the first and third brandy, she\u2019d kicked off her shoes, which meant she was barefoot on the gleaming hardwood floor. The sensation reminded her too much of the last time she\u2019d seen Mac and she hurried to lead the way into the living room where at least there was carpeting against her toes.</p><p>She heard the thud of his footsteps as he followed, along with her aunt\u2019s pleasant conversation as she chatted about the warm afternoon and how pretty the sunrise had been. Bev was big on watching the sunrise. Something about the first light of morning cleansing her psychic energy.</p><p>Jill crossed to the rocking chair and sank down. The chair swayed forward and back, causing the corners of the room to fold in just enough to make her want to giggle. Maybe this was good, she thought, as she curled up on the thick cushion. She\u2019d always wondered what would happen if she ever saw Mac again. After that disastrous last meeting, she\u2019d been afraid of what she would say or he would say. Or how he would look at her. But being drunk seemed to take the edge off. If he pitied her, well, wasn\u2019t that just how her life was going?</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the sheriff,\u201d she said when he\u2019d settled on the long sofa opposite the window and Bev had disappeared for refreshments. Jill had a feeling Mac wasn\u2019t going to be offered brandy.</p><p>\u201cJust. I started work two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the date we agreed on.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear and froze when her fingers encountered the Brillo mop. Oh...my...God. She\u2019d completely forgotten about her appearance. Now what?</p><p>She winced silently and realized there was nothing she could do but tough it out and hope he hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cI meant, why did you take the job of sheriff?\u201d</p><p>His dark blue eyes settled on her face. Even as she felt her insides begin to melt, she reminded herself that he was probably trying to figure out why she had chocolate stains on her cheeks. She rubbed her skin and let the alcohol make her not really care.</p><p>\u201cI wanted a change,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus it\u2019s a great place for Emily to spend the summer.\u201d</p><p>Emily? What were the odds of that name belonging to his aging but adored Saint Bernard? Zero, she decided, as her string of bad luck continued.</p><p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d she said with a smile and what she hoped was an expression of polite interest.</p><p>\u201cHis daughter.\u201d</p><p>Bev spoke as she walked into the living room. She set down the tray of cookies along with three glasses of milk.</p><p>\u201cMac\u2019s little girl is eight.\u201d</p><p>Jill tried to get her mind around the concept. Over the years she\u2019d imagined him with an assortment of women who were nothing like her, but she\u2019d never thought of him as a father.</p><p>\u201cI have her for the summer,\u201d he said, and took a cookie from the plate. \u201cBev has agreed to help out with day care.\u201d</p><p>Jill turned her attention to her aunt, at the same time swinging her head. Instantly the entire room tilted on end before settling back to a normal axis. Two thoughts filled her brain\u2014the first, that Mac wasn\u2019t married. At least, not to his daughter\u2019s mother. The second thought was more troubling.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like children,\u201d she reminded her aunt. \u201cThat\u2019s why you gave up teaching.\u201d</p><p>Bev handed her a glass of milk. \u201cI don\u2019t like them in groups,\u201d she corrected. \u201cMaybe I read Lord of the Flies too many times\u2014I\u2019ve always felt children could turn rabid at any moment. But individually they\u2019re fine.\u201d She smiled at Mac. \u201cI\u2019m sure Emily\u2019s an angel.\u201d</p><p>Mac looked startled by Bev\u2019s theory on children and their potential. \u201cWhat?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, she\u2019s just a regular kid.\u201d</p><p>There was something in his voice, Jill thought, as she grabbed a cookie and took a bite. Something...wistful. Or was that her liquor-laced brain doing the talking?</p><p>She sipped her milk, swallowed and nearly gagged. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, thrusting the glass at her aunt. \u201cAfter the brandy, my stomach won\u2019t like this at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it will. Just pretend you\u2019re having a Brandy Alexander. In two courses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Mac looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking?\u201d</p><p>Faint disapproval sharpened his gaze and tightened his mouth. A quick glance at the clock told her it was a little past three in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after five in New York and I\u2019ve had a bad day.\u201d</p><p>Make that a bad week, possibly a bad life.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Jill\u2019s not a wild woman,\u201d Bev said with a comforting smile. \u201cShe\u2019s just a little out of sorts. When does Emily arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround five. I\u2019ll bring her by in the morning. I didn\u2019t want to work on her first day, but I have to appear in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think a thing about it,\u201d Bev told him. \u201cI\u2019m ex cited at the thought of the two of us spending the summer together. We\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>Jill thought about warning Mac about her aunt\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d and how she sometimes passed from normal to just plain odd. But what was the point in worrying him? Besides, Bev had a way of making a person feel special and loved and maybe that was something every eight-year-old little girl needed.</p><p>Mac rose and murmured something about heading home. Jill wanted to rouse herself enough to ask where exactly that was. His house. Not that she planned any more midnight intrusions. One humiliating moment like that was enough for anyone\u2019s life. Nope, she would avoid Mac as much as she could while trapped in the hell that was Los Lobos. She would practice whatever form of law they expected here, handling their petty problems while sending out her buffed-up r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to large law firms all over the state. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And in her free time, she would plot revenge. Mean, hard-hearted, satisfying revenge that would reduce her rat-bastard ex-husband to a quivering mass. She smiled at the thought and felt something cold and wet drip onto her leg.</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt sounded concerned, which made Jill want to ask her what was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t seem to open her eyes or speak. Something was taken from her hand.</p> <p>\u201cHow much brandy did she have?\u201d a man asked.</p><p>Mac, Jill thought hazily. Yummy, sexy Mac. She\u2019d had a crush on him since she was thirteen years old. But he\u2019d never noticed her. Not really. He\u2019d been nice and friendly, but in a distant, big-brother kind of way.</p><p>It was because she hadn\u2019t gotten breasts. Not real ones like her best friend Gracie. Nope, Jill had what Gracie\u2019s mom had referred to as \u201cdiscreet curves.\u201d Jill didn\u2019t want discreet. She wanted blatant, sexy, in-your-face boobs.</p><p>She felt herself slipping down in the chair, then suddenly she was high up in the air. It was like floating or flying or both.</p><p>\u201cOn the sofa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll get a blanket. I\u2019m sure she just needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr drink less,\u201d a man said with a chuckle. \u201cShe\u2019s going to feel like crap in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>That won\u2019t be anything new, Jill thought as she burrowed into the pillow that found its way under her head. She\u2019d been feeling like crap for two days. Only this was better. It was warm and cozy and she felt safe again. She let herself drift off and vowed that when she woke up, everything would be different.</p><p>MAC GAVE UP the pretense of not watching the clock somewhere around four forty-five. He had the thought that the waiting would be a whole lot easier with a beer in his hand, but he wasn\u2019t going there. Not with Emily on the line. Not with it all being his fault.</p><p>He wanted to blame someone else, to point the finger and say he wasn\u2019t responsible, but he couldn\u2019t. Not when he\u2019d taken every step himself. He couldn\u2019t even blame Carly. His ex-wife had been more understanding and forgiving than he deserved.</p><p>Because she was organized and didn\u2019t see the value in making him sweat, she arrived five minutes early. He watched the Volvo pull up into his driveway and was outside before either of the occupants had a chance to open their doors.</p> <p>\u201cHey, kiddo,\u201d he said as Emily stepped out.</p><p>His daughter was slight and blond, with big blue eyes and a smile that could light up the heavens. Only she wasn\u2019t smiling now. Instead her mouth quivered at the corners and she wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye. She clutched Elvis, her tattered, stuffed rhino, to her chest and stared at the ground.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen her in nearly two months and it was all he could do not to grab her and hug her forever. He wanted to tell her he loved her, that she\u2019d grown and got ten more beautiful, that he\u2019d thought about her every day. Instead he tucked his hands into his jeans pockets and wished he could go back in time and make things different.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mac.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention to Carly. Petite, well dressed, with her gold-blond hair cut to her jawline, she walked around the car and moved toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d he said, bending down to kiss her cheek.</p><p>She squeezed his upper arm. \u201cYou, too. Cute little town. So this is where you grew up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow does it feel to be back?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spent the past two weeks torn between hope and impending disaster. Too much was on the line.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said with a casual confidence he didn\u2019t feel. \u201cLet\u2019s get the luggage and go inside.\u201d He turned to Emily. \u201cYour bedroom is upstairs, kiddo. Want to go check it out?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her mom as if asking for permission. When Carly nodded, Emily darted inside.</p><p>\u201cShe hates me,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cShe loves you, but she\u2019s scared. She hasn\u2019t seen you in weeks, Mac. You didn\u2019t show up the two week ends like you promised. You broke her heart.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and swallowed the rising guilt. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the trunk and waited for her to unlock it.</p><p>\u201cApologies don\u2019t work on an eight-year-old,\u201d Carly told him. \u201cYou disappeared from her life without a word and now you\u2019re going to have to prove yourself to her.\u201d</p><p>He already knew that. The question was how? How did a father go about regaining the trust of his daughter? Was it possible? Had he crossed the line and was it already too late?</p><p>He wanted to ask Carly her opinion, but he figured he\u2019d already used up all his currency with her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he said as he lifted out two suitcases.</p><p>Carly grabbed a cooler. \u201cI know. Part of me wanted to turn my back on you, but you\u2019ve always loved her more than anything.\u201d She closed the trunk and stared at him. \u201cI want to believe you, Mac. I want you to have this chance. But make no mistake. If you screw up even one time, I\u2019ll haul your ass back into court and make sure you never see your daughter again.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>JILL WOKE in darkness to the sound of the grandfather clock in the hall. She counted ten chimes, then shoved back the blanket and gingerly pushed into a sitting position.</p><p>Her memory blurred as she tried to figure out where she was and why she\u2019d fallen asleep on a sofa. Bits and pieces returned as she recalled arriving at Aunt Bev\u2019s place and the liberal consumption of brandy.</p><p>The quiet of the house told her that her aunt had already headed upstairs. Not a surprise\u2014those who liked to be awake and perky for the sunrise usually had to go to bed fairly early. Jill was more of a sunset kind of gal, although she\u2019d missed it today, what with sleeping off her stupor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be another sunset tomorrow,\u201d she reminded herself as she stood and tensed in anticipation of a blinding headache or double vision. Neither occurred. Actually, she felt pretty good.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a plus.\u201d</p><p>She made her way to the guest room and smiled when she saw the folded-back covers and fluffed pillows. Her aunt had even left a tray with water, a glass and a package of Alka-Seltzer.</p><p>\u201cAn amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>Jill ignored the bed and walked to her suitcase. After collecting toiletries, she hit the bathroom and turned on the shower.</p><p>Twenty minutes, one shampoo and an application of sweet-pea-scented body lotion later, she felt practically normal. She debated between PJs and sweats before settling on the latter. With her hair still in a towel and a wide-tooth comb in her hand, she walked downstairs and out onto the back porch.</p><p>The wooden structure was nearly as wide as the front porch and just as furnished. There was an old swing, a rattan table and chair set along with a bench, a few bug-zapper lamps and a trellis covered with bougainvillea.</p><p>Jill ignored it all and sat on the rear steps leading down to the grass. The night was cool and pleasant. A clear sky twinkled with a thousand stars she couldn\u2019t see when she was in the city. She supposed there were those who thought small-town life was made perfect by things like stars and unlocked doors. They were, of course, hideously wrong.</p><p>She pulled off the towel and reached for the comb. Just then the back door of the house on the left opened and someone stepped out.</p><p>Jill froze, her arm raised, the comb barely touching her hair. Even in the dim light of the porch she recognized the tall, broad-shouldered man. Mac.</p><p>She figured the odds of him visiting a neighbor at this hour were slim, which meant he probably lived next door to her aunt. Wasn\u2019t that just how her life was going? No doubt he\u2019d moved in with his wife and...</p><p>Hazy memories clicked into place. Something about a child. A daughter maybe? But no wife. Or at least not the kid\u2019s mother. Or had that been wishful thinking on her part? Horror swept through her as she thought she remembered passing out in his presence.</p><p>She shifted to stand and creep back inside, but a board creaked, Mac turned, then started toward her. Jill glanced down at the T-shirt she\u2019d pulled on over sweatpants. Oh, yeah, a fabulous \u201caren\u2019t I sexy\u201d look. She supposed her lack of bra could be considered provocative, if she had actual breasts larger than fried eggs.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked as he approached.</p><p>His voice rumbled into the quiet of the night. The sound seemed to rub against her skin like velvet on silk. Her insides clenched and her mind emptied of all rational thought.</p><p>\u201cAh, better,\u201d she managed. \u201cI needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nap, the brandy or passing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe all three.\u201d</p><p>He paused in front of her and leaned against the railing. One corner of his mouth curved up.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything that happened this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>She had a feeling that he wasn\u2019t talking about the drive from San Francisco. The question made her uneasy.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did I do anything memorable before, um, passing out?\u201d Had she thrown up, or worse? Was there worse than throwing up?</p><p>\u201cNope. You got very quiet, spilled your milk and passed out.\u201d</p><p>Inwardly she winced. \u201cSounds charming.\u201d She recalled waking up. \u201cSo how did I get to the sofa?\u201d</p><p>Mac\u2019s half smile widened into a full grin. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d carried her? She\u2019d actually been in Mac\u2019s arms and she hadn\u2019t been conscious for the moment? Could her life get any more unfair?</p><p>\u201cAh, thanks. That was really nice of you.\u201d</p><p>What she wanted to know was had he enjoyed the experience? Had he thought of it as anything more than a chore? Had she even once crossed his mind in the past ten years?</p><p>He moved to the foot of the stairs and sat down. His thigh was amazingly close to her bare toes. If she moved her foot a scant inch, they would be touching. Jill jerked the comb through her still-wet hair and swallowed a sigh of frustration. One would think she would be more grown-up and mature by now, but one would be wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re back in town,\u201d she said when no wittier bit of conversation occurred to her.</p><p>He pointed to the house on the left. The one she\u2019d seen him walk out of. \u201cRight next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your daughter?\u201d she asked, hoping her wisps of memory were accurate.</p><p>The humor fled his face, leaving behind only tightness and something that might have been pain.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll enjoy Los Lobos. It\u2019s a great place for kids. Especially in the summer.\u201d Jill hadn\u2019t started to chafe at the restrictions of small-town life until she\u2019d entered college.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I haven\u2019t seen her in a while. After the divorce...\u201d He shrugged, which didn\u2019t explain much.</p><p>\u201cWas her mother difficult about things?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Carly was great. It was my fault. I wasn\u2019t around for a while. That hurt Emily. She\u2019s just a kid, I should have realized. I want joint custody, but I need to earn the privilege. That\u2019s what this summer is about.\u201d</p><p>His words left her with more questions than answers, but she decided not to push.</p><p>\u201cI hope things work out,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Em means the world to me.\u201d The smile re turned. \u201cYour aunt agreed to help me with day care. Should I be rethinking that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what I said about her not liking children?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Jill shook her head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like teaching very much, but she was always great when I was growing up.\u201d There was the whole psychic gift thing, but maybe it was better to let Mac find out about that on his own.</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter arrived earlier, right? Did everything go okay?\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the house. \u201cIt was fine. Carly drove her up from L.A. and stayed through bedtime. All I had to do was hang around in the background. The real test will be in the morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d Jill told him. \u201cThat counts for a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>She was about to expand on the point when she remembered she had absolutely zero experience in the kid department. Not that she hadn\u2019t wanted them. But the lying weasel rat bastard had thought they should wait and, for reasons not clear to her, they had. Of course now she was glad\u2014children would have complicated the divorce.</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you doing back in town?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cVacation? Last I heard you were practicing corporate law in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Jill felt her eyes widen. He knew about her life? Had he been asking? Had he thought about her? Was there\u2014</p><p>She quickly slammed a mental door on those thoughts. No doubt Mac had simply picked up small-town gossip. Nothing worth getting excited about.</p><p>\u201cI was, until recently,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked for a corporate law firm in San Francisco. I was about to make junior partner.\u201d She resumed combing her damp hair. \u201cPast tense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. My soon-to-be ex-husband managed to get me fired. He also got my promotion, my window office and our condo.\u201d She tugged through a knotted strand. \u201cNot that he\u2019ll get to keep the condo. It\u2019s community property. He cheated on me, too. I saw him, and let me tell you, there\u2019s a visual I want erased from my brain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot for one day. How\u2019d he get you fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still working on that one. I brought a lot of business into the firm. More than any other associate. But when they fired me, I wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to any of the senior partners to find out what was going on. I sent a couple of e-mails and letters, so we\u2019ll see. In the mean time, I\u2019m temporarily back in Los Lobos to take over the law practice of Dixon and Son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d She tried to tell herself at least she was still practicing law, but she didn\u2019t actually believe herself.</p><p>\u201cI take it Mr. Dixon didn\u2019t have a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not. Or he wasn\u2019t interested in taking over the family firm. So that\u2019s me.\u201d She set down the comb and forced herself to smile. \u201cI\u2019m a small-time litigator. In my free time I\u2019ll be planning revenge on Lyle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the revenge involves breaking the law, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I probably won\u2019t do anything illegal, though. I don\u2019t want to be disbarred.\u201d Which cut into the possibilities. Not a problem, though. She could rise to the occasion by being more creative.</p><p>\u201cHave the summer softball leagues started yet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mac nodded. \u201cSure. Games every weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think I\u2019ll park the car by the practice fields. There should be plenty of fly balls zipping around.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cIs that 545 Lyle\u2019s car?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTechnically it\u2019s community property. He bought it with joint assets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d make a note of that to tell the judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>Jill pulled her knees to her chest and sighed. This was nice\u2014fun. If she\u2019d been sixteen, talking to Mac in the dark would have been the answer to her prayers. At twenty-eight, it wasn\u2019t half-bad, either.</p><p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou could have gotten a job anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence. This gig is temporary. Actually it was my father\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>Mac stared at her. \u201cHe suggested it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. When I told him what had happened, he told me about the vacant practice here. You\u2019d think that moving clear to the other side of the country would make him less of a meddler in town affairs, but no. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s still around the corner instead of in Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does keep a hand in,\u201d Mac said. \u201cJudge Strathern told me about the vacancy in the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t know which surprised her more\u2014that her father kept in contact with Mac or that Mac referred to him so formally. They\u2019d known each other for years. Mac had practically grown up in her father\u2019s house. Of course Mac being the housekeeper\u2019s son probably put their relationship on a different level. Not that she\u2019d cared about things like that. When she\u2019d been a teenager all she\u2019d cared about was how gorgeous Mac had been and how her heart had beat like hummingbird wings every time he smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cSo my dad\u2019s to blame for both of us being here,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the town will grow on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a wart? No thanks.\u201d</p><p>She fingered her hair and realized it had started to dry. In a matter of minutes it would be a wild and wooly mess. She reached up and began to weave it into a loose braid.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember your hair being that curly,\u201d he said as he watched.</p><p>Jill thought about how she\u2019d looked earlier that day\u2014a stained, drunk, frizzy mess. \u201cIt has a mind of its own. I tame it with a combination of iron will and hair products. Blow dryer, flatiron and an assortment of bottles and jars. Give me electricity, my tools and an hour and you\u2019ll see sleek, perfect hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy go to all that trouble?\u201d</p><p>Spoken like a true man. \u201cTo keep it controlled and borderline normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurly hair is sexy.\u201d</p><p>Four simple words that made her stomach clench and her mouth go dry. She wanted to shake her head and flaunt her curls. She wanted to dance on the lawn and announce to the heavens that Mac thought she had sexy hair.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when it\u2019s long, like yours.\u201d</p><p>The world just got better and better.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Ooh, she sounded so cool and casual. Good thing he couldn\u2019t see the chorus line of hormones doing the happy dance.</p><p>Mac stood. \u201cThis has been nice, Jill, but I need to get back and check on Emily. I wouldn\u2019t want her to wake up and find the house empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>She held in the regretful sigh and managed not to say how she wished they could talk about her sexy hair a little bit longer. Maybe next time.</p><p>She waved as Mac walked toward his house, then turned toward her own back door. Just as her fingers touched the door handle, she froze.</p><p>Maybe next time? Had she really thought that? No, no, no, no, no. There was no this time or next time or anytime. Mac was here\u2014small-town sheriff makes good with kid. She was there\u2014big-city corporate law shark. That was her\u2014swimming for freedom. She did not want to get trapped here in Los Lobos. She wanted big bucks and bigger revenge on the rat fink lying weasel dog. Hunky guys next door were not part of her plan. And in case she was tempted, she needed to re member what had happened the last time she\u2019d thrown herself at the guy in question.</p><p>He\u2019d taken one look at her naked body and vomited. There was a lesson there\u2014one she would do well to re member.</p><p>EMILY KENDRICK SQUEEZED her eyes as tightly closed as she could. She squeezed until her whole face hurt and she thought she might squish her eyeballs. She clenched her teeth, raised her shoulders and held her breath until the burning went away. Then she relaxed.</p><p>Okay. Better. She wasn\u2019t going to cry. Not here. She wasn\u2019t sure why she thought she shouldn\u2019t give in to tears. It wasn\u2019t as if someone had told her not to cry. The message came from inside her\u2014that scary dark place that got bigger when she thought about the summer with her dad and her mom going away and how nothing had been right for a long, long time.</p><p>She could hear noises from downstairs. Something clanged onto the stove. Before, she would have giggled at the thought of her dad cooking. He\u2019d done it sometimes, on Sunday morning or when she\u2019d been sick and he\u2019d stayed home with her. Then he\u2019d made fun stuff, like grilled-cheese sandwiches cut up into the shape of a boat, or caramel corn they\u2019d baked in the oven. He\u2019d always let her help. He\u2019d\u2014</p><p>The burning came back. Emily sucked in a breath and willed it away. She wouldn\u2019t think about before. About when things had been good and her dad had tossed her in the air and told her he loved her and her mom had laughed all the time. She wouldn\u2019t think about that, or how one day she and her mom had gone away and her dad had never, ever found them.</p><p>She walked to the bed she\u2019d made so carefully and picked up Elvis. The worn rhino fit into her arms the way he always had and that made her feel better.</p><p>\u201cMommy left us,\u201d she murmured into the bare spot behind his ear\u2014the place she always whispered her secrets. \u201cShe left last night after she tucked me in bed and I\u2019m mad at her.\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t want to be mad at her mom, but mad was safe. She liked being mad right now because when she was mad she didn\u2019t care so much.</p><p>\u201cWe have to stay the whole summer and be with some lady because my dad has to work. He\u2019s the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what being the sheriff meant. He\u2019d been a policeman before. She\u2019d liked how he looked in his uniform\u2014big and brave and she\u2019d known he would always keep her safe. But then he\u2019d let her go away and daddies weren\u2019t supposed to do that. They were supposed to be with their little girls always.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be here, Emily thought as she stared at the door to her room. She\u2019d begged her mother to let her stay home. She\u2019d promised to be good and clean her room and not watch too much TV, but it hadn\u2019t mattered. Her mother had brought her here and had left her.</p><p>Emily\u2019s stomach growled. She was hungry because she hadn\u2019t eaten much dinner the night before.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, she opened the door and stepped into the hallway. The house was old, but nice. Big, with a second floor and lots of big trees. Her mom had told her that the ocean was real close and that her dad would take her to play on the beach. Emily had liked that but hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>The stairs creaked as she walked downstairs. She could still hear her dad in the kitchen. She smelled bacon and maybe pancakes and her mouth began to water. Her grip on Elvis tightened until she was afraid she would pop him like a balloon. Finally she hovered at the entrance to the kitchen.</p><p>The room was big, with lots of windows. Her dad stood by the stove. He looked so tall and strong and just like she remembered him. For a second she almost ran over to be picked up and hugged. She wanted to feel his arms around her, holding her close. She wanted him to tell her that she was his best girl always.</p><p>Her throat got all tight and her stomach felt squishy instead of empty. And when he looked up and smiled at her, it was as if her feet had somehow glued themselves to the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo, how\u2019d you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She waited for the hug, or a wink or something to tell her that he still thought she was his best girl. She leaned forward to hear him tell her that he loved her and he was glad they were together. That he\u2019d missed her and looked for her every day but he hadn\u2019t been able to find her.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. Instead he pulled out a chair at the table in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat. I made pancakes. You always liked them, right? Oh, and bacon.\u201d</p><p>Emily felt very cold on the inside, as if that dark, scary place inside of her had just frozen over. She didn\u2019t want pancakes, she wanted her dad.</p><p>He waited until she was seated, then pushed in the chair. Emily put Elvis on the table next to her place set ting and waited while he slid three pancakes onto her plate. Bacon was next. She looked from the food to the glass of orange juice just to her right.</p><p>Funny how she didn\u2019t feel hungry at all. She didn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s some strawberries,\u201d he said, putting a bowl of the cut-up fruit on her left.</p><p>Emily squared her shoulders and carefully pushed the plate away. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said in a voice that was so small she wondered if she were starting to disappear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to grab Elvis and hold him close, but then her dad might guess she was scared and sad. Instead, she squeezed her hands together so tight that her nails dug into her skin.</p><p>\u201cThe color\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said, trying to speak a little louder. \u201cI\u2019m wearing purple.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her T-shirt and shorts. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m wearing purple I can only eat purple.\u201d</p><p>His mouth got straight and his eyes narrowed. He didn\u2019t look happy anymore and she was afraid. But she didn\u2019t give in. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow long have you been color-coordinating your food with your wardrobe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>It was barely after eight in the morning and Mac al ready felt tired. Damn it all to hell\u2014he didn\u2019t want to let Emily win this battle. It would set a precedent, forcing him into a corner.</p><p>\u201cWait there,\u201d he told his daughter as he walked out of the kitchen and headed for the small den at the front of the house.</p><p>He\u2019d set up an office in the narrow space, sliding a desk between built-in bookcases. Now he grabbed the phone and punched in Carly\u2019s number. Couldn\u2019t she have warned him what was going on with Emily? They\u2019d had the whole evening. Was it too damn hard to say \u201cGee, Mac, the kid only eats the color she\u2019s wearing.\u201d?</p><p>Still caught up in his temper, he barely noticed when a man answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mac started to say he\u2019d dialed the wrong number when he realized that maybe he hadn\u2019t. \u201cIs Carly there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mac,\u201d he added, not sure why.</p><p>\u201cJust a second.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of the phone being set down, then a low rumble of voices too quiet for him to hear the words. Obviously Carly was seeing someone and the man in question had spent the night. Mac turned the idea over in his brain, then shook his head. He didn\u2019t care if she slept with the entire NFL as long as she didn\u2019t do it in front of his daughter.</p><p>\u201cMac? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me she won\u2019t eat a color she\u2019s not wearing?\u201d</p><p>From a couple hundred miles away, he heard his ex-wife sigh. \u201cIs she doing that? I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019d hoped she\u2019d let it go. We talked about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou and she talked about it. You didn\u2019t say squat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six weeks. I talked to the pediatrician. She thinks it\u2019s a way for Emily to have some control in her life, and maybe a way to get us to do what she wants. She didn\u2019t get a say in the divorce or having you gone. She\u2019s punishing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t she just throw a tantrum and be done with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the corner of the desk. \u201cSo how does this work? She ate last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She wore red. I brought spaghetti, a salad made of red-leaf lettuce and we had strawberry short-cake for dessert. What\u2019s she wearing this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurple. I made pancakes and bacon. So far she\u2019s ignoring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlueberries are good on purple days. Al though...when I saw the doctor last week, she pointed out that if we were willing to hold out against her and not give her what she wanted, eventually hunger would force her to eat.\u201d</p><p>Starve his daughter? He couldn\u2019t imagine it. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too chicken to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So I get to be the bad guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a suggestion. You have to do what you think is right.\u201d</p><p>His gut told him that the doctor was on to something\u2014Emily would eventually get hungry and eat what was served. But was that how he wanted to start their summer together? There was also the matter of the social worker. He could only imagine that interview as Emily complained that her bully of a father hadn\u2019t fed her in two days.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know what\u2019s right?\u201d he asked, more to himself than Carly.</p><p>\u201cYou were always a good father, Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Right up until I disappeared from her life. Some kind of hero, huh?\u201d</p><p>Carly was silent for a couple of seconds, then she said, \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m seeing anyone. Brian and I have been dating about two months, but I haven\u2019t introduced them. I want to be sure it\u2019s going to last.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t care about his ex-wife seeing a guy, but he hated the thought of his daughter having another father in her life.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I wish I could be more helpful on the food thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with it. I suppose in some courts, the judge would say I earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to give both of you some time,\u201d Carly told him. \u201cThat\u2019s what this summer is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll send you an e-mail in a couple of days and let you know how things are going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. Take care, Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>He hung up the phone and returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Emily sat where he\u2019d left her. The only change was the stuffed rhino in her arms.</p><p>\u201cElvis have any advice for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Wariness filled her wide blue eyes as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cJust like a rhino. I can\u2019t get him to shut up when I\u2019m driving. He\u2019s always telling me what lane to be in and where to turn. But now, when I need some instructions, he doesn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>Emily bit down on her lower lip. Mac hoped it was to keep from smiling.</p><p>He gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cPurple, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kiddo. Let\u2019s hit the grocery store and get you some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have Pop-Tarts?\u201d she asked as she slid off the chair. \u201cThey\u2019re purple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I can find some purple bacon, we may end up there.\u201d He made a mental note to get some kid vitamins. The multicolored kind. And wondered what on earth he was going to cook on the days she wore blue.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>JILL CAREFULLY LOCKED the BMW before leaving it parked by the foul line of the practice fields. A quick glance at the sign-up board told her that there would be several teams practicing over the next few days. With a little luck, they could all have a close encounter with the 545.</p><p>Maybe she should look into a rental car while she was in town, she thought, as she shifted her briefcase to her left hand and began the three-block walk to her new office. If she left Lyle\u2019s car all over the place, how would she get around? Not that there were all that many places to go in Los Lobos.</p><p>The morning had dawned cool and clear, which was good. Fog was death on her hair. She\u2019d blown it dry, used the flatiron and her forty-seven products to pro duce a sleek, smooth cascade of stick-straight hair be fore coiling the whole length into a neat knot at the base of her neck. In deference to working in the more casual setting of a small town, she\u2019d put on a pantsuit instead of a skirted suit, but the label still read Armani even though she knew the elegance would be lost on her clients. No matter, it was really all for her. When she dressed better, she felt better about herself. And today she would need all the help she could get.</p><p>The law offices of Dixon and Son were on Maple Street\u2014a road with plenty of trees but no maples. Trendy antique stores leaned up against old bookstores. There were coffeehouses, caf\u00e9s and the chamber of commerce on the corner. It was quiet, picturesque and pretty much as it had always been for the past fifty years.</p><p>Jill tried to convince herself that it wouldn\u2019t be so bad\u2014but she knew she was lying. She\u2019d only been in Mr. Dixon\u2019s office a couple of times, but the details of his building were firmly etched in her brain. She didn\u2019t mind that the place was old, musty and in serious need of paint. What she most objected to was the fish.</p><p>Mr. Dixon had been an avid fisherman. He\u2019d gone all over the world, fishing his heart out and bringing back trophies for his office. The fish he\u2019d caught were often stuffed, or whatever it was one did with dead fish one did not eat, and mounted onto plaques. These plaques hung in his office. Everywhere.</p><p>They stared down at clients, frightened small children and collected dust. They also smelled.</p><p>\u201cPlease God, let them be gone,\u201d Jill whispered to her self as she opened the glass door that led into the foyer and reception area and stepped inside.</p><p>God was either busy or chose not to oblige. Jill stopped on the scratched hardwood floor and felt dozens of eyes focus on her. Small, dark, beady fish eyes.</p><p>A huge swordfish hung up by the beamed ceiling. Midsize fish about ten or twelve inches long mounted on dark wood plaques circled the room just above the bookcases. There were fish by the light switches, fish along the wall leading upstairs, even a fish mounted on the front of the reception desk.</p><p>The smell was exactly as Jill remembered it\u2014an un pleasant combination of dust, pine cleaner and old fish. The lone piece of toast she\u2019d had for breakfast flipped over in her stomach.</p><p>A chair squeak jerked her attention from the large multicolored, large-toothed creature on the front of the desk to the woman sitting behind it.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Tina,\u201d Jill said with a warmth she didn\u2019t feel. \u201cHow nice to meet you at last.\u201d Tina\u2014her assistant/secretary/receptionist\u2014stood up with a reluctance that made Jill think she wasn\u2019t the only one not happy about the change in circumstances. Tina was in her midthirties, with short brown hair in a sensible cut. She looked efficient, if not particularly friendly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in early,\u201d Tina said with a tight smile. \u201cI thought you might be, so I had Dave get the kids off to school. I don\u2019t usually get here until nine-thirty.\u201d</p><p>Jill glanced at the old grandfather clock in the corner. It was 8:25 a.m.</p><p>\u201cThis is about when I start my day,\u201d Jill said. In San Francisco, it had often started closer to five-thirty, but she wasn\u2019t on the partner track anymore.</p><p>\u201cI have three kids,\u201d Tina said. \u201cThey might be out of school, but I still have to get them off to their activities. Little Jimmy\u2019s in the baseball camp down by the park and Natalie is...\u201d She pressed her lips together. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re that interested in my children, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they keep you very busy,\u201d Jill told her, trying not to stare as she noticed the other woman was wearing a polo shirt and Dockers. In a law office?</p><p>Tina caught her gaze and tugged at the front of her shirt. \u201cMr. Dixon didn\u2019t care if I dressed casually. You didn\u2019t want me to wear a dress, did you?\u201d</p><p>Her tone indicated that it didn\u2019t much matter what Jill wanted. \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d she said, reminding herself that it wasn\u2019t important. Who was there to impress?</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll just show you around. This is the reception area. You probably guessed that. Recently closed cases are in that cabinet back there.\u201d She motioned to a set of dark wood file drawers.</p><p>Not even locked, Jill thought in amazement.</p><p>\u201cThe older files are all stored upstairs. Your office is in here.\u201d Tina walked through the open door and Jill followed.</p><p>The fish motif was in full swing. Dozens and dozens of those from under the sea had been mounted on wooden plaques and hung on nearly every inch of avail able, paneled wall space. Fishing net draped across the front of the large wooden desk, where a couple of long-dead starfish hung on precariously.</p><p>Bookcases lined two walls, while two open doors led to what looked like a storage room and a bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very...\u201d Jill turned in a slow circle and searched for the right word. Or any word. \u201cClean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a service that comes in once a week,\u201d Tina told her. \u201cThe coffeemaker\u2019s in the storeroom. I guess I could make it if you want me to, but Mr. Dixon always made his own.\u201d Her dark brown eyes turned misty. \u201cHe was a wonderful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heart attack was very sudden.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Out fishing.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Jill thought, trying to avoid beady fish-eyed glares from the d\u00e9cor.</p><p>Tina took a step back toward the reception area. \u201cThe paralegal comes twice a week. She\u2019s home with twins, so sometimes she can\u2019t make it in, but she gets the work done. I\u2019ll let you know when I have to be gone. I try to bunch up things like games and doctors\u2019 visits, so I\u2019m not always running back and forth.\u201d</p><p>Jill had a feeling that Tina would go out of her way to make herself scarce.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are Mr. Dixon\u2019s open cases?\u201d</p><p>Tina pointed to the desk. \u201cThere are a couple of wills, that sort of thing. Oh, and you have some appointments. Mr. Harrison later today and Pam Whitefield on Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>The latter name startled Jill. \u201cIs this the same Pam who married Riley Whitefield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her. She said she had some trouble with a real estate transaction.\u201d Tina shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised she\u2019s back in town.\u201d Pam had been a couple of years ahead of Jill in school and had always made it clear she was destined for a great future that didn\u2019t involve Los Lobos.</p><p>\u201cShe never left.\u201d Tina inched toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be out front if you need me.\u201d</p> <p>Jill glanced around the office. It was like standing in the middle of an aquarium for deceased fish.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dixon caught all of these himself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tina nodded.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Mrs. Dixon would like them as a reminder of her late husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Tina shifted back a bit more. \u201cShe told me she liked knowing they were here in the office. Sort of like a tribute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>While Jill didn\u2019t want to get stuck with the aquatic menagerie, she couldn\u2019t blame the widow for not wanting them in her home.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tina. What time is Mr. Harrison coming?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout eleven-thirty. I have to leave about noon to take Jimmy to the orthodontist.\u201d</p><p>Why was Jill not surprised? \u201cOf course you do. Will you be back?\u201d</p><p>Tina\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cIf it\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p>Jill looked at the fish, the paneling, the net and the long-past-dead starfish. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine without you.\u201d</p><p>IT TOOK JILL less than two hours to bring herself up-to-date on Mr. Dixon\u2019s open cases. She contacted the clients, offered her services and was prepared to give referrals if they preferred.</p><p>No one did. Every single one of them made an appointment to come see her, which would have been gratifying if anyone had showed the slightest interest in his or her legal issues. Mrs. Paulson summed it up perfectly.</p><p>\u201cThat old will,\u201d the elderly lady had said with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t take it very seriously. I mean, I\u2019ll be dead. What do I care? But sure, honey, if it makes you happy, I\u2019ll keep my appointment.\u201d</p><p>Rather than tell the woman that very little about the situation made her happy, she put a check mark next to the time and date in the appointment book and told Mrs. Paulson she was looking forward to meeting her.</p><p>\u201cYour daddy was a fine man,\u201d the older woman said. \u201cA good judge. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do us all proud, just like he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jill said before she hung up. As her father had talked her into being here, he wasn\u2019t one of her top-ten favorites at the moment.</p><p>With all the appointments confirmed, Jill pulled a disk out of her briefcase and slid it into her computer. With a few keystrokes she was able to pull up her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and began to update the information.</p><p>Mr. Harrison arrived promptly at eleven-thirty. Tina didn\u2019t bother knocking\u2014she simply pushed open the door and showed him in.</p><p>Jill stood to greet him. There hadn\u2019t been any hint as to his problem in the appointment book, but she figured she could handle it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jill Strathern,\u201d she said, walking around the desk and holding out her hand. \u201cHow nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d the older man said.</p><p>Mr. Harrison was one of those thin elderly men who seemed to shrink with age. His hair was white and thick, as were his eyebrows. Wrinkles pulled at his features, but his blue eyes were clear and sharp and his handshake firm.</p><p>When he\u2019d taken the leather chair in front of her desk and just to the right of the fishing net, Jill returned to her seat and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find any notes in Mr. Dixon\u2019s file on your case. Had you been in to see him before?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Harrison dismissed the other man with a flick of his wrist. \u201cDixon was an idiot. All he cared about was fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jill murmured politely, as if she wasn\u2019t aware of dozens of beady eyes watching her. \u201cSo what seems to be the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose bastards stole some land from me. Their fence is about twenty or twenty-five feet on my side. I want it moved.\u201d</p><p>He spread out several large sheets of yellowed paper showing deeds and land tracts. Jill stood and leaned over the desk while Mr. Harrison traced the various property lines. She found her interest piqued.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d need an official survey to determine the boundaries, but from what I can see here, you\u2019re right. Your neighbors have put a fence on what is clearly your property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now they can take it down.\u201d</p><p>Jill grabbed a legal pad and sat. \u201cWhat kind of fence is it?\u201d she asked as she began to make notes.</p><p>\u201cStone. About six feet wide.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up as she stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a nice fence and all. It works, but it\u2019s in the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>A stone fence? She\u2019d been picturing chain link or cedar. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop them when they started to put up the fence? A project like that would have taken weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t around. Besides, it\u2019s not my responsibility to patrol my own borders. This isn\u2019t Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d But a stone fence. That had to cost a fortune. \u201cHave you talked to your neighbors about this?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cThey\u2019re young and they listen to rock music. Cotton wool for brains. No point in talking to them. They probably take drugs.\u201d</p><p>She sent up a quiet prayer of thanks that Mr. Harrison didn\u2019t live next door to her. \u201cWhen was the fence built?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear as I can tell, 1898.\u201d</p><p>The pen slid from her fingers and landed on the hard wood floor. Her mind simply wouldn\u2019t wrap itself around the information.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s over a hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cI can do math, little lady. Why does it matter when it was built? It\u2019s stealing, plain and simple. I want that fence moved.\u201d</p><p>Jill might not know a lot about real estate law, but some truths were universal\u2014one of them being that a fence in place for a hundred years was unlikely to be moved anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you dealing with this now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave a big mess after I\u2019m gone. And don\u2019t bother telling me no one will care. Dixon already tried that argument.\u201d He glared at the nearest fish.</p><p>Jill felt the first stirrings of a headache. \u201cLet me do some research, Mr. Harrison. There might be a legal precedent for what you want to do.\u201d Although she had her doubts. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Harrison rose and shook her hand, then headed for the reception area. As he didn\u2019t close the door be hind him, she heard him clearly when he spoke to Tina.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going on about?\u201d Mr. Harrison asked the receptionist. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem like she has a stick up her ass to me.\u201d</p><p>MAC CROSSED THE STREET from the courthouse to the sheriff\u2019s office and pushed through the double glass doors. He nodded at the deputy on duty and did his best not to make eye contact as he walked toward his office in the back corner, but Wilma caught up with him in less than two seconds.</p><p>\u201cYou have messages,\u201d the gray-haired dispatcher said as she thrust several pink pieces of paper into his hands. \u201cYou can ignore the ones on the bottom, but the top three are important. How\u2019d it go in court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d managed to keep one bad guy behind bars for a couple of years. That had to count. He glanced down at the notes as he kept walking.</p><p>\u201cThe mayor called?\u201d he asked, knowing that couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Wilma had to take two steps for every one of his. She barely came past his elbow and, according to legend, had been around since before the earth\u2019s crust cooled. She was a tough old bird and one of the first of his staff he\u2019d known was a keeper.</p><p>\u201cMayor\u2019s calling on behalf of the pier centennial committee. They want a temporary alcohol permit to serve beer at the car wash.\u201d</p><p>Mac stopped in the middle of the room and glared at her. \u201cWhat? Serve beer? High-school kids are going to be doing the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mayor said the beer was for the patrons.\u201d</p><p>He felt his blood pressure climbing. \u201cHe wants to serve beer to people who are going to get back in their cars and drive around town? Of all the stupid, ill-conceived, ridiculous, backward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d Wilma told him. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>Mac had already had a few encounters with the mayor and he hadn\u2019t enjoyed a single one. \u201cDoes he ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He swore. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call him back and tell him there\u2019s no way he\u2019s getting the permit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I like about you.\u201d She poked at the messages in his hand. \u201cYou also have a call from someone named Hollis Bass. The boy sounded like nothing but useless trouble. He\u2019s not a relative, is he?\u201d</p><p>Mac flipped through the notes until he found the one with Hollis\u2019s number. \u201cNo. Not a relative. A social worker.\u201d Just what he needed\u2014one more thing. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlick Sam is getting released on bond today and someone needs to go tell the judge\u2019s daughter not to get messed up with the likes of him.\u201d Wilma wrinkled her nose. \u201cSlick Sam is proof our criminal law system is in serious need of an overhaul. Want me to give her a call for you?\u201d</p><p>Mac glanced at the big clock on the wall. It was barely twelve. He\u2019d promised Emily he\u2019d be back for her by one. There was still time to drop by Jill\u2019s office and warn her about Slick Sam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it in person,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll call the mayor and the social worker from home. Everything else can wait.\u201d</p><p>Wilma\u2019s hazel eyes widened slightly. \u201cI figured you had to know Jill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father may have retired to Florida, but he still stays informed.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to warn her about a potentially difficult client, not seduce her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt always starts with conversation. You be careful.\u201d With Jill? He doubted it was necessary. She might be gorgeous, sexy as hell and recently single, but she was also the daughter of the one man who\u2019d practically been a father to him. No way he would betray that relation ship by getting involved with Jill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can stop worrying about me, Wilma. I have everything under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what those lemmings always say right before they jump off the cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI HEARD ABOUT what happened with Lyle,\u201d Rudy Casaccio said in his low, smooth voice. \u201cI can arrange to have him taken care of for you.\u201d</p> <p>Jill winced, then switched the phone to her other ear. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded and if you did, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve provided excellent service to our organization, Jill. We believe in rewarding that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou send a fruit basket at Christmas. That\u2019s more than enough. As for Lyle, I\u2019m going to handle him my self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t exactly worked that out yet, but I\u2019ll come up with a plan.\u201d She glanced at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s spitting out of her printer. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go with that old standard of living well as being the best revenge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you staying in Los Lobos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I land with another firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. In the meantime, we want you to continue to handle our business.\u201d</p><p>Real corporate law, she thought wistfully. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? \u201cYou need to stay where you are right now,\u201d she said regretfully. \u201cI don\u2019t have the resources to handle your concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was sweet of you to offer.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy chuckled. \u201cNot many people call me sweet.\u201d</p><p>She could imagine. Rudy was one tough businessman, but he\u2019d always been good to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about Lyle?\u201d he asked. \u201cI never liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think I shouldn\u2019t have, either. Thanks, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll call when I\u2019m with a new firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, Jill.\u201d</p><p>Rudy said goodbye and hung up. Jill did the same. She allowed herself exactly two minutes of pouting over what Lyle had cost her, then went over to check the printer.</p> <p>Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9s looked great, and the content was even more impressive. Rudy was a man of his word, so she knew she could bring him over to whatever law firm hired her. The senior partners would appreciate the extra three million a year in billings.</p><p>A knock on her closed door made her turn. It couldn\u2019t be Tina\u2014for one thing, the woman never knocked. For another, she\u2019d disappeared shortly before noon.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she called, then caught her breath when Mac strolled into her taxidermy aquarium.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>The single word was all she could manage. Man oh man did he clean up good, she thought as she took in the dark tan uniform that emphasized broad shoulders and narrow hips. She had the sudden urge to throw herself on her desk and pretend to be a music video slut.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said as he glanced around the office. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been in here before.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly the sort of place you\u2019d forget. Welcome to fish central. If you see one you like, let me know. I\u2019m thinking of having a yard sale.\u201d</p><p>Not that she would, really. The fish belonged to Mrs. Dixon and, until Jill talked the widow into reclaiming her property, she was stuck.</p><p>Mac turned in a slow circle, then slowly shook his head. \u201cGenerous offer, but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures. I bet I couldn\u2019t even give them away. Are you here officially? Should I ask you to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I only get to sit under certain circumstances?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOf course not.\u201d She circled around her desk and waved at the leather visitor chair. \u201cBe careful not to get caught in the net there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He sat and looked at her. Jill felt his gaze settle on her face with a connection so intense it was nearly physical. She wanted to ask him if he saw anything he liked. She wanted to lean closer so he could replace his gaze with his fingers. She wanted to know if he thought she was beautiful and sexy and irresistible. She settled on checking to make sure her hair was in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s straight,\u201d he said, motioning to her head.</p><p>\u201cThanks to the miracles of modern hair-care pro ducts, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks nice, but I like it curly better.\u201d</p><p>A piece of information she would file away for later. \u201cI\u2019m going to guess that\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m here to give a friendly warning. Slick Sam was arrested for passing bad checks. He got out earlier today and may come looking for representation. You probably want to tell him no.\u201d</p><p>Her back stiffened. \u201cWhy is that? Do you think I couldn\u2019t handle a criminal case? I assure you I\u2019m more than capable of defending my clients against any number of charges. Furthermore, I don\u2019t appreciate you judging me. You don\u2019t know one thing about my legal experience. For all you know I could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow rose as he leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGo on. You\u2019re doing all the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She pressed her lips together. Okay, maybe she\u2019d overreacted. She cleared her throat and straightened the papers on her desk.</p><p>\u201cSo why did you want to warn me about Slick Sam?\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask. The last lawyer he hired, also a woman and also very attractive, ended up letting him move in with her, where he made the moves on her teenage daughter, trashed her house, then took off with her cash, her credit cards and her car.\u201d</p><p>Mac thought she was attractive? How attractive? Could she ask?</p><p>Not in this life, she told herself, then laughed. \u201cI appreciate the advice and I\u2019ll be sure to be out when he calls. But I have to tell you, I\u2019m tempted by a client willing to steal my car.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>JILL ARRIVED home shortly after five. As she was used to working until at least eight or nine every night she wasn\u2019t cooking for Lyle, she wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to do with an entire evening. What did people who worked regular hours do with their lives? Was this why they had hobbies? Would she like a hobby?</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Bev asked as Jill walked through the front door. \u201cAny dents on Lyle\u2019s car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go by and check. I thought I\u2019d do that in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She set her briefcase by the coatrack and wondered why she\u2019d bothered to carry it home. There wasn\u2019t any work inside.</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed her aunt\u2019s cheek. \u201cI have high hopes, though. A nice high fly to the side door would make my heart beat with joy.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt smiled. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, dear. How was work?\u201d</p><p>Jill thought of Tina, the fish, and the hundred-year-old fence dispute. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, there\u2019s very little I can complain about, so I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner will be ready in half an hour. You have time to change.\u201d</p><p>Jill hugged the woman who had always been there for her. \u201cI love you taking care of me, but I didn\u2019t come here to invade your life. I\u2019m going to start looking for a place of my own tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Bev shook her head so hard, her long red hair flew back and forth like a flag in the breeze. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare. I know you\u2019re not moving back to Los Lobos permanently, but I want to be with you for the time you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m not crimping your social life?\u201d</p><p>Bev rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, please. You know I don\u2019t date. I have to worry about the gift.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes. The gift. Bev\u2019s psychic connection with the universe that allowed her to see the future. As her aunt had explained many times, the gift came with responsibilities\u2014one of which was to stay pure...sexually.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever get tired of being alone?\u201d Jill asked, because whether or not she believed in her aunt\u2019s gift, for the most part Bev lived as if she believed it. There had been very few men in her life and no long-term relationships.</p><p>Bev smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been rewarded for my sacrifice. Over the years I\u2019ve helped many people and that\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex can be a great feeling, too.\u201d She thought about her own pathetic sex life with Lyle. \u201cOr so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe make choices in our world. Staying pure for the gift was mine.\u201d</p><p>Jill raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou mean semi-pure,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWell, there were one or two occasions when things got a little out of hand, but as they weren\u2019t my fault, they didn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>Jill grinned. \u201cI like your rules. I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now go get changed before dinner. Oh, Gracie phoned about an hour ago. I gave her the number at the law office. Did she catch you before you left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jill said, disappointed to have missed the call. \u201cI\u2019ll try her right now.\u201d</p><p>She hurried up the stairs and into the airy guest bed room she\u2019d claimed as her own. After peeling off her suit and pulling on shorts and a T-shirt, she flopped onto the bed and grabbed the phone.</p><p>Thirty seconds later she heard Gracie\u2019s answering machine and left a message. When she hung up, she closed her eyes for a second, wishing her friend had been home and they could have talked. She needed to connect. So much had changed in such a short period of time, it seemed as if her world had started spinning out of control. Gracie had a way of keeping things in perspective.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Jill whispered to herself and headed downstairs.</p><p>She found her aunt in the kitchen, fixing a salad. \u201cLet me help,\u201d she said as she moved to the sink to wash her hands. \u201cI smell lasagna, which means you worked hard this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie not home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow. So what happened today with Emily? What\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sweet girl. A little unnerved by all the changes in her life.\u201d</p><p>Jill dried her hands on a dish towel, then crossed to the island and picked up a cucumber and a knife. \u201cMac\u2019s worried about them bonding.\u201d</p><p>Bev nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s been living with her mother for the past couple of months, so being with her father is strange.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pain inside of her. I can feel it. She dresses monochromatically. Today was all purple. Shirt, shorts, socks, everything. And she\u2019ll only eat the color she wears.\u201d</p><p>Jill stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a silly way to express her pain, but she\u2019s eight. How many choices does she have? Mac wasn\u2019t happy when he explained the problem to me, but I didn\u2019t mind. It made making lunch much more interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Bev\u2019s green eyes twinkled. \u201cI cheated. I had some beef stew in the freezer, which I defrosted for lunch. While she was setting the table, I mixed a little of the liquid with beet juice and put it in a white bowl. Of course it looked completely purple. Then I asked Emily if the color was all right. She said it was. I served lunch in colored bowls so she couldn\u2019t tell it wasn\u2019t purple. We agreed that bread was neutral, so that was good. Oh, and we made sugar cookies with purple icing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth move.\u201d Jill sliced the cucumber. \u201cAside from the color thing, what was she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendly. A little sad and confused, but good-hearted. Smart, too. We read some this afternoon and she\u2019s a couple of grades ahead.\u201d</p><p>Jill dumped the cucumber into the salad bowl. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do her cards or anything, did you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not. She\u2019s a child. Besides, I\u2019d ask Mac first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d She could only imagine what he would say if his baby-sitter wanted his permission to read his daughter\u2019s future in tarot cards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet Emily tonight. Mac\u2019s dropping her off in a few minutes. He has a meeting with the social worker.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI hope he can handle it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMac? Why wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pain there,\u201d Bev said as she shook the bottle of dressing. \u201cThat man needs to be loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d Jill smiled. \u201cOkay, so maybe I\u2019m a little interested, but not in something serious. Could we substitute sex for love? Be cause then I\u2019d sign right up.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang before Bev could answer. Her aunt glanced at Jill. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just do that to creep me out, don\u2019t you.\u201d She walked to the phone and picked it up. \u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJill? What the hell do you think you\u2019re playing at.\u201d</p><p>Lyle. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou never did see the value in common courtesy, did you, Lyle?\u201d she asked, more resigned than annoyed. \u201cThat was always a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me about mistakes. You had no right to take the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I had every right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Thanks for sharing. Do you want to talk about all the things I have a right to be angry about? Because that list is a whole lot longer than a car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a game, Jill, but you won\u2019t win. By the way, the new office is really great. I can see the bridge.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. He had her office and her junior partnership while all she had was a stupid car and a bunch of fish.</p><p>\u201cWas there a point to this call?\u201d she asked, holding on to her temper with both hands. \u201cI\u2019ve filed for divorce. You\u2019ll be served tomorrow. Except for the property settlement, this is long over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my car back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. You drove it for a year, now it\u2019s my turn. Community property, Lyle. You remember that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will get it back and when I do, there better not be a single scratch on it. If there is, I\u2019ll make you pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. I\u2019ve always been the better lawyer. If you want to discuss anything else with me, do it in e-mail. I don\u2019t want to talk to you again.\u201d She hung up without saying goodbye.</p><p>Her insides shook a little, but other than that, she felt okay. Not great, but not crushed, either. Still, she wished he hadn\u2019t called.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants his car back,\u201d she said as she turned back to face her aunt.</p><p>\u201cI gathered that.\u201d Bev turned off the oven and pulled out the bubbling lasagna. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to play fair on the divorce. Have you protected yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I did all that before I left town. I transferred half of our savings into my own account, canceled all the credit cards in both our names, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he really being served with papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. They\u2019re coming to his work. I almost wish I could be there to see the whole event.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt poured a glass of red wine and handed it to her.</p><p>Jill took it. \u201cAfter what happened with the brandy yesterday I was going to lay off liquor for a while, but maybe not.\u201d</p><p>MAC ARRIVED with Emily exactly at six. Bev let them in, which gave Jill a chance to brace herself for yet another close encounter with the guy next door. He didn\u2019t disappoint when he entered the kitchen. Gone was the sexy uniform from earlier. Now he was dressed in a sports shirt and slacks. He looked like a powerful man ready to close the five-billion-dollar deal over drinks at an exclusive club.</p><p>Which only went to show how active her imagination had become where Mac was concerned. He was going to be nothing but trouble, she thought as she turned her attention to the little girl behind him.</p><p>Emily was small and slight, with big blue eyes and short blond hair the color of champagne. A beauty, which made Jill instantly dislike the girl\u2019s mother. No doubt another stunner. But then, when had Mac ever dated a female who wasn\u2019t gorgeous?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jill said as she smiled at Emily. \u201cI\u2019m Jill, Beverly\u2019s niece. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>The girl smiled shyly back. \u201cHi. Bev told me you\u2019re a lawyer. That you make sure people are following the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my good days.\u201d</p><p>Mac touched Bev\u2019s arm. \u201cThanks for doing this for me. I\u2019ll keep the appointment as short as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry. Emily and I had a brilliant time together this afternoon. Tonight will only be more fun. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>The eight-year-old nodded.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Mac glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019m running late. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>Jill trailed after him as he walked to the door. \u201cAre you eating dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>Typical guy. \u201cGood luck with the social worker. If you decide you need any legal advice, let me know.\u201d</p><p>He paused on the threshold. \u201cYou\u2019re a corporate lawyer. This isn\u2019t your area of expertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but if I can\u2019t research it, I\u2019ll know someone with the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>MAC ENTERED the county services building at 6:28 p.m. and walked to the stairs.</p><p>The reception area on the second floor was typical government issue. Formica-covered countertop with a couple of desks behind. A shelving unit held dozens of different forms while posters reminded pregnant women they needed prenatal care and kids that it wasn\u2019t cool to smoke.</p><p>Most of the overhead lights were off, but he saw light spilling into the hallway and he stepped behind the counter to head that way. He stopped in front of a name plate reading \u201cHollis Bass\u201d and knocked on the partially open door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d a man called.</p><p>Mac pushed open the door and entered.</p><p>Hollis Bass\u2019s office was as neat and prissy as the man himself. Two large plants sat on top of gray file cabinets in the corner. The paperwork in the open shelves had been neatly stacked and perfectly centered in each cubbyhole. The folders on the desk lined up with military precision and the pens and pencils rested in a perfectly straight row.</p><p>Hollis looked as if he\u2019d never outgrown that adolescent awkwardness of too-long arms and legs. He was tall, thin and painfully tidy, wearing creased khakis and a long-sleeved button-down shirt fastened up to the collar. Small, round glasses made his brown eyes appear close-set.</p><p>Lord, he was a kid, Mac thought as he shook the man\u2019s hand. Maybe twenty-four, twenty-five. Great. Just what he needed. Some fresh-out-of-college, idealistic, save-the-world little prick determined to prove himself against a big, bad grown-up.</p><p>\u201cThank you for dropping by,\u201d Hollis said as he motioned to the folding chair in front of his desk. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re very busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the visit was optional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Hollis settled behind his desk and carefully folded his hands together on the blotter. \u201cMac...may I call you Mac? I prefer to be less formal on these visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your party,\u201d Mac told him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Mac, I want to give you a feel for how this process is going to go.\u201d</p><p>They had a process?</p><p>\u201cThe court mandates that you and I meet every other week for as long as you have Emily. I may also arrange more frequent meetings if I deem them necessary. While I will do my best to accommodate your schedule, these meetings are mandatory. If you skip even one, I will notify the judge, and your daughter will be returned to her mother within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re all clear. Now, you are welcome to re schedule. I would imagine in your line of work, your time isn\u2019t always your own.\u201d</p><p>Mac had been in law enforcement for over a decade and he\u2019d learned a lot about people. One thing that had been easy was spotting those who didn\u2019t approve of what he did for a living. Just his luck\u2014Hollis was one of them.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your flexibility,\u201d he said, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of my job.\u201d The corners of Hollis\u2019s thin mouth turned up, but not in a friendly way. \u201cIn addition to our meetings, I\u2019ll want to speak with Emily from time to time. I won\u2019t make appointments for that. I\u2019ll simply drop by.\u201d</p><p>Of course. All the better to see if Mac screwed up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll either be with me or her day-care provider. I\u2019ve already given your office that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it right here.\u201d Hollis opened a file. \u201cBeverly Cooper, a local resident. Fifty-three, single. A bit eccentric, but considered to be a good person. No criminal record.\u201d</p><p>Mac\u2019s temper flared. The little twit had investigated Bev? He wanted to say something. He wanted to do something. But he sat quietly and reminded himself that he\u2019d made the choices that had brought him to this place. He had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the terms of the custody agreement?\u201d Hollis asked. \u201cYou must maintain legal employment, meet regularly with me, maintain a suitable house for your daughter and see that she is provided for. In addition you\u2019re not to commit any criminal acts or even be charged with any criminal acts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that is a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re clear.\u201d Hollis closed the folder and leaned forward. \u201cMac, I\u2019ll be blunt with you. I don\u2019t think men in law enforcement make good fathers.\u201d</p><p>This was one of the few times Mac hated being right. \u201cWhat is that opinion based on?\u201d he asked, even as he had to grind his teeth to keep from reacting.</p><p>\u201cPersonal observation. Men on the edge have trouble relating to their families, especially their daughters. Too much tension, too much violence, has a way of changing a person. Look at your own situation. Based on what I read about the testimony, it was your time in the gang unit that caused your divorce and your separation from Emily.\u201d</p><p>Mac hated that the kid had a point.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things going with her?\u201d the social worker asked, his voice low and gentle.</p><p>Mac thought about Emily not speaking to him, about her monochromatic food issues and her emotional distance.</p><p>\u201cJust peachy,\u201d he said easily. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be better.\u201d</p><p>Hollis sighed. \u201cWhatever you may think of me personally, I do want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>MAC SAT ON THE EDGE of his daughter\u2019s bed. They\u2019d survived the first twenty-four hours. He wouldn\u2019t count that as a victory, but at least it hadn\u2019t been a total disaster. Em didn\u2019t talk that much when he was around, but at least she hadn\u2019t mentioned leaving. He didn\u2019t think he could stand that.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked, knowing he probably shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Elvis think of Beverly?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved up slightly. \u201cHe liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvis always had great taste in women. I think she\u2019s pretty fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Jill.\u201d</p><p>He thought of the slender beauty next door. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we played dress-up tonight before dinner, she let me be the princess and she was my lady-in-waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of her.\u201d He shifted so he could stroke his daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Em. I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, but she didn\u2019t speak. He waited, hoping she would say something. After a few seconds, he leaned forward and kissed her cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSleep well, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>He turned off the lamp and walked out of the room. A night-light glowed, illuminating his way. When he was in the hall, he stopped and rubbed the back of his neck. She still hadn\u2019t called him Dad or Daddy. She\u2019d avoided addressing him as anything. Was she punishing him, or had he simply lost the right to be called that?</p> <p>Not sure of the answer, he walked downstairs. The silence filled the space like a living creature. He stood in the center of the living room and wondered what happened next. How did he fix things with his daughter? How did he work his job, satisfy Hollis, heal the emotional breach and figure out what to do next?</p><p>Footsteps on the porch gave him a more immediate task. He crossed to the front door and pulled it open. Jill smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t eat. I tried not to care, but I couldn\u2019t stand it, so I brought lasagna.\u201d</p><p>She stood with the single bulb adding a warm caramel cast to her dark hair, a foil-covered plate thrust out like an offering.</p><p>\u201cI never could resist a woman with food,\u201d he said, pushing the door open wide. \u201cWant to keep me company?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Is Emily in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She gave him the plate and followed him to the kitchen. This house was similar to her aunt\u2019s, with a couple hundred more square feet and a bigger lot.</p><p>\u201cCan I offer you anything?\u201d he asked. \u201cBeer, wine, Pop-Tarts?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHow about wine? I\u2019ve only had one glass and that was about three hours ago, so I\u2019m probably safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot looking for a repeat of yesterday?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think not. I like to keep my passing out to a minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a good policy.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a bottle of cabernet from a small wine rack on the counter and opened it. When he\u2019d poured them each a glass, he sat across from her and removed the foil. The delicious smell made his stomach growl.</p><p>\u201cI knew you hadn\u2019t eaten,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cEm was full when I brought her home and it seemed like too much trouble to fix something just for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical male,\u201d she murmured, and sipped her wine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little judgmental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut true.\u201d</p> <p>He ignored that and took a bite of the lasagna. Even if he hadn\u2019t been starved it would have been delicious. \u201cYour aunt sure knows how to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I had two servings at dinner.\u201d She leaned back in her chair. \u201cAs did your daughter. Want to know how we got Emily to have some?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the tomato sauce covering the lasagna and remembered his daughter dressed entirely in purple. \u201cShe didn\u2019t put up a fuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe played dress-up. Funny how the princess dress just happened to be red. She didn\u2019t change back into her regular clothes until after the meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty slick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to thank my aunt, not me. She\u2019s the one who came up with the idea.\u201d</p><p>He put down his fork. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she\u2019s so difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily? She\u2019s not. She\u2019s a sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s dealing with some tough issues. The divorce. Being here for the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s all been strange for her, but if the worst of it is a little manipulation of the adults around her by being picky with food, I think you\u2019re going to be fine. It\u2019s a pretty safe way to act out.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.</p><p>Sometime in the past few hours, Jill had let down her hair...literally. It fell long and straight to the middle of her back. She had even, delicate features\u2014wide-set eyes, a straight nose and a stubborn pointed chin. She\u2019d been a cute kid, but she was a beautiful woman. He vaguely remembered her having a crush on him when she\u2019d been fifteen or sixteen. If she trailed after him with those puppy-dog eyes now, he\u2019d have a hell of a time resisting her.</p><p>\u201cHow was your meeting with the social worker?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tore a piece of garlic bread in half and handed it to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse. He\u2019s an uptight just-graduated idealist who doesn\u2019t think men in law enforcement make good fathers. I have to report to him every other week, take care of Emily and not have any run-ins with the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too difficult, unless you were planning to commit a felony or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this week.\u201d He sipped his wine. \u201cI know his job is to keep Em safe. I want that, too. I want her to be happy. What I don\u2019t like is dealing with Hollis.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can catch him speeding and give him a ticket. That would be fun.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll alert my deputies.\u201d</p><p>She nibbled on the garlic bread. \u201cDo you really like it here? Are you happy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think in terms of being happy or unhappy. He just was. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back. As you pointed out, this is a great place to grow up. I\u2019ve always liked the town. Even when I was a teenager and raising plenty of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is a permanent move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running for sheriff in November.\u201d</p><p>Jill looked surprised. \u201cAn actual election?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of one. So far no one else is interested in opposing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So you\u2019re serious about sticking around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as serious as you are about leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you craved adventure,\u201d she said, leaning forward and resting her forearms on the table. \u201cAren\u2019t you the guy who joined the military to see the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a way out. I knew I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere here, except maybe to get into more trouble. Your father showed me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does like to save people, in his own meddling way. When he found out I\u2019d left Lyle and been fired, he told me about the practice here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have told him no.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s true. In theory. But he\u2019s very persuasive. Plus, I didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. I\u2019ll manage until I land a job somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to being a big-city lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>He took the last bite of lasagna and pushed the plate away. \u201cLet\u2019s go get comfortable,\u201d he said, picking up his glass and the bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Jill followed him into the living room, where they settled on opposite ends of the worn sofa. Scattered rugs warmed up the hardwood floor. She liked the over size fireplace and the big windows. During the day, this room would get a lot of light.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did you come to be in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rental. I\u2019ll buy something after the election.\u201d</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t believe he was willing to settle down here on purpose, but apparently he was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re destined to live next door to each other,\u201d she teased. \u201cAt least for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it. Of course, it\u2019s much more interesting now.\u201d</p><p>She almost fainted from shock. Was he flirting with her? Whoa. No need to check her pulse to see if it had zipped into the aerobic range\u2014she could feel the rapid thumping in her chest.</p><p>His dark eyes brightened with humor. \u201cDo you disagree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to whimper with delight. She wanted to freeze-frame time and hang on to this moment forever. She wanted to yell to the heavens that Mac Kendrick thought she was interesting. Instead, she reminded herself that not only was her stay in town temporary, he had always been popular with the ladies. His flirting with her didn\u2019t mean much more than a knee-jerk reaction to being alone with a woman. Only a fool would take it personally. And a really smart woman might take advantage of the situation to soothe her recently shattered ego, as long as she kept things in perspective.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very different from the teenager I remember,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were cute then, but you\u2019re amazing now.\u201d</p><p>Amazing? That worked. She resisted the urge to say Tell me more, and instead focused on an unpleasant truth.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was cute. At least not naked.\u201d</p><p>He nearly choked on his wine. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was cute naked.\u201d</p><p>He set down the glass and stared at her as if she were crazy. \u201cI never saw you naked.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to be shocked. \u201cOf course you did. On my eighteenth birthday. You were home on leave and I hid out in your bedroom.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI wanted you to be my first time and you weren\u2019t interested. At least I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what the throwing up meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d He shifted toward her on the sofa. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Was it possible he didn\u2019t remember? No. He had to.</p><p>Refusing to be embarrassed about something that had happened a decade before, she met his questioning gaze.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember being on leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I partied every night with my friends. A couple of times things got completely out of hand and I blacked out. Talk about being a dumb kid. But I would have remembered you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>Partying? She turned the idea over in her mind. Had that been it? Of course. It made sense. But at the time, she\u2019d been crushed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should laugh or cry,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened and I\u2019ll help you decide?\u201d</p><p>He was sitting so close she could feel the warmth from his body. If she moved just a little, they would be touching. The thought made her stomach clench and her heart flutter.</p><p>She set her wineglass on the end table. \u201cAs I said, it was my eighteenth birthday. I went out to dinner with my dad, then when he went to bed, I crept over to your house. Your mom was already asleep, so I tiptoed inside and waited until you got home.\u201d</p><p>She thought back to that long-ago evening. How scared and excited she\u2019d been. How she\u2019d thought that night would change everything. It had, but not in the way she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u201cYou always teased me about being jailbait,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He reached up and fingered a strand of her hair. \u201cThat was to remind me as much as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His words made her want to beam. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re lying, it\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth. So there you were, waiting in my bedroom, which I still can\u2019t believe. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cThe one thing I never would have dreamed. You walked in, hit the lights and I dropped my dress to the floor. I wasn\u2019t wearing anything underneath. You took one look at me, ran into the bathroom and promptly threw up.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her incredulously. \u201cNo way in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d make up an embarrassing moment like that? You were the first guy to see me naked. I\u2019ve been emotionally scarred ever since.\u201d</p><p>She could tell he didn\u2019t want to believe her.</p><p>\u201cI would have remembered,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cApparently not. And all this time I\u2019ve wondered what you thought of me and that night. I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>He took her hands in his. He had big hands, with long, thick fingers. Wasn\u2019t that supposed to mean something?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said as he looked into her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry. And speaking for the twenty-two-year-old I was back then, I\u2019m damned disappointed to have missed the opportunity to take advantage of your gorgeous, naked self.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cI was determined we were going to make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said no. Except for how I would have felt about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe actually never wanted to do it with you.\u201d</p> <p>Mac grinned. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He was there for you and you wouldn\u2019t have wanted to repay him by deflowering his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. But I might have worked past the guilt.\u201d His humor faded. \u201cAre you okay? Are you really scarred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jill. It wasn\u2019t about you. Like I said, I was partying pretty hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She liked how her hands felt in his and the way he brushed his thumbs against her skin. She liked the regret in his expression and how the night was so quiet and they felt like the only two people in the world. She especially liked the heat in his eyes and the way he seemed to be moving closer. She swayed toward him.</p><p>\u201cWant to consider a rain check?\u201d he asked, his voice low and tempting, just before he kissed her.</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t have an answer, which was just as well, be cause the second his mouth brushed hers all brain power ceased. There was only the moment and the man and the magic of what he did to her.</p><p>He teased her with just the right amount of pressure. No wimpy almost-kiss, no plunging right for her tonsils. Instead he moved back and forth, discovering, teasing, withholding just enough to make her want more be fore he offered it.</p><p>He smelled delicious and radiated enough heat to make her want to throw herself into his arms. One strong hand cupped her face, the other got buried in her hair. She sent up a brief prayer of thanks that she\u2019d left it loose for the evening, then put her hands on his shoulders and gave into sensation.</p> <p>Their lips clung. Instinctively she tilted her head. He touched the tip of his tongue to her bottom lip and sent shivers rippling through her body. She parted for him, both aroused and amazed that this was really happening. Her kissing Mac? Was it all a dream?</p><p>It had to be, when reality was him slipping inside, stroking her lower lip before deepening the kiss. Desire quickened her blood and made her breasts ache. She squeezed his shoulders, feeling the thick muscles tense under her touch.</p><p>He pulled back slightly and rested his forehead against hers. She opened her eyes and found him watching her. He was so close, he was almost blurry, but she didn\u2019t want to pull back. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cYou kiss like you mean it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re the kind of woman my mom always warned me about. Sexy and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing that all her blood had rushed to her lower body to keep her grounded. Otherwise she would have floated away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty tempting, yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what would have happened all those years ago, if I\u2019d had the good sense not to get plowed at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. I was doing the offering. Would you have accepted?\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cIn a heartbeat. Even though your dad would have killed us both.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never gotten past the humiliation of the moment to think how her entire life might have been different if Mac had made love with her. Based on his gentle but erotic kiss, she had a feeling the experience would have changed her forever. She would never have gotten involved with Evan, and without him, she wouldn\u2019t have been interested in the rat bastard lying weasel dog who was Lyle.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know how that one night could have changed things,\u201d she said regretfully.</p><p>He kissed her again, then stood and held out his hand. She took it and allowed him to pull her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNow for the mature portion of the evening,\u201d he said, still holding on to her fingers. \u201cI have an eight-year-old daughter upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I\u2019m recovering from an ugly breakup, not to mention only passing through town.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cPlus there\u2019s that close personal relationship you have with my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell of a way to repay him. Even if you are all grown up, he wouldn\u2019t appreciate me making a move on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d So they were attracted to each other. So the kissing was spectacular. There were complications.</p><p>She wanted to say they were both adults who could work it out. Even more than that, she wanted to revel in the fact that she could actually believe Mac wanted her. Was that cool or what?</p><p>\u201cI guess I should get home,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing me dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>He walked her to the door where he cupped her face and kissed her so exquisitely her toes curled.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She floated home, carried along by the promise in his words.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>JILL FINISHED UP the filing Tina had left from the day be fore. She had a feeling that Tina might never find time for filing. Currently her assistant/secretary/receptionist had taken off to drive one of her children to a playdate. Then there were errands to run, but Tina had said she would return later in the morning. Jill wasn\u2019t holding her breath.</p><p>Had the situation been different, she would have replaced Tina and found someone interested in working at least some of the day. But what was the point in going through the trouble? Sixteen r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were currently zooming through the U.S. mail, on their way to various law firms around the state. She\u2019d made four calls that morning to network with fellow Stanford Law School grads and start putting out the word that she was looking. Interestingly enough, no one was shocked that Lyle had turned out to be a weasel bastard. Had she been the only one not to see the truth?</p><p>\u201cI see it now,\u201d she told herself as she closed the file cabinet in the reception area and returned to her office. As Tina was gone and might or might not return and Jill had a ten-o\u2019clock appointment, she was careful to keep her door open so she would hear her client.</p><p>Besides, nothing about Lyle could upset her good mood. Not after last night. She grinned as she remembered the kiss and Mac\u2019s attraction to her. After what she\u2019d been through, knowing he found her sexually appealing was more invigorating than sixteen hours at a day spa. She found herself humming \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d under her breath, which was both embarrassing and fun. To think that Mac had been interested in her all those years ago, despite her lack of breasts, put a whole new light on her world.</p><p>\u201cOkay, time to get serious,\u201d she told herself as she pulled out a blank legal pad. \u201cTime to think about work and not sex or Mac.</p><p>But honestly, weren\u2019t they one and the same? And wasn\u2019t it amazing that kissing Mac had been way more exciting than kissing any other guy she could remember?</p><p>She glanced at the clock and saw Pam Whitefield was due any second. Talk about a blast from the past. Pam Whitefield\u2014or Pam Baughman as she\u2019d been before her marriage and subsequent divorce\u2014was three years older than Jill and her best friend Gracie. Three years older and light-years ahead of them in experience; at least, she had been back in high school.</p><p>Pam had been one of those golden girls\u2014beautiful, built and popular. She\u2019d wanted to go places and do things, and she was interested in any guy who could take her there.</p><p>Her junior year of high school she\u2019d decided that guy was Riley Whitefield\u2014local bad boy with a rich uncle. Pam had seen the potential, if not in Riley him self, in his future inheritance. At least that had been Jill and Gracie\u2019s theory. Gracie had loved Riley even more than Jill had loved Mac.</p><p>Ah, those times had been bittersweet, Jill thought. Two fourteen-year-old girls in love with older guys who wouldn\u2019t give them the time of day.</p><p>The sound of a door opening snapped Jill\u2019s attention back to the present. She braced herself to see Pam again\u2014the woman never known for her gentle and loving spirit\u2014and stood.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d Jill called.</p><p>Pam Whitefield strolled through the reception area and entered Jill\u2019s office. Still the golden girl, Jill thought, taking in the perfectly coiffed gold-blond hair, the wide green eyes and the honey-colored tan. Pam wore a tailored suit that looked as expensive as the one Jill had on. Her perfect makeup emphasized her perfect features, which made Jill want to spit.</p><p>She reminded herself that people change\u2014maybe Pam wasn\u2019t a bitch anymore. She deserved a second chance...didn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cJill!\u201d Pam sounded delighted as she crossed the hardwood floor and shook hands. \u201cHow lovely to see you. And that suit. You look fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. So do you.\u201d</p><p>Pam did a quick hair flip as she settled into the leather chair next to the fishing net. \u201cI work to keep it all together. Some days it\u2019s a real trial.\u201d</p><p>Jill resumed her seat. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you for a second. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing great. I\u2019ve made some investments that have paid off well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>Jill glanced at the other woman\u2019s left hand, searching for a ring. Pam and Riley hadn\u2019t lasted a year, just as Gracie had predicted. He\u2019d left town, never to be heard from again, and Pam had stayed.</p><p>\u201cSo, what can I help you with?\u201d she asked, not wanting to do the second half of the \u201chow are things after all this time\u201d exchange. What was she supposed to say to that question?</p><p>Pam sighed. \u201cI\u2019m having some difficulty with property I recently purchased and I want to sue the owner and her real estate agent for misrepresentation.\u201d</p><p>Jill picked up a pen. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Pam\u2019s mouth thinned into a straight line. \u201cI bought the old Engel place. Do you remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Big house up on the bluff. Great views. It was a little run-down when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse now. I got a decent price, but I paid more than it\u2019s worth based on its reputation.\u201d</p><p>Jill blinked. Reputation? She\u2019d always thought the old house was butt ugly, but she didn\u2019t think that\u2019s what Pam meant.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cCan you explain?\u201d</p><p>Pam sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be an alien landing site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Sure. When we were kids we would dare each other to run up and knock on the door. Visitors from Mars or wherever were supposed to live inside and if they answered, they kidnapped you or something.\u201d She had the most amazing thought. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think the place had aliens, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it had something. Everybody talks about it all the time. The owner even mentioned it in the sales brochure.\u201d She took out a cigarette and lit it. \u201cThe thing is, alien landing sites are very popular with tourists. I was going to open a bed-and-breakfast, but if it\u2019s not visited by aliens, it\u2019s just one more junky old house that needs refurbishing.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great, Jill thought. Just what she needed. X-Files law. This conversation made the hundred-year-old stone fence complaint seem almost reasonable.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me you paid more than market value for an old house based on the fact that you thought it was inhabited by aliens?\u201d she asked, trying to sound calm instead of incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes, and now I\u2019ve found out there aren\u2019t any, and I want my money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not sure what sort of precedent there is for this kind of problem. I\u2019ll need to do some research. Also, do you still have the sales material? If the previous owner actually claimed the house had aliens, that will strengthen our case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you the information this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Jill outlined her hourly fee. \u201cI\u2019ll need a five-thousand-dollar retainer.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t usually ask for so much, but honestly, she was hoping to scare Pam off. It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>As she got her checkbook out of her purse, she flicked ash into a dish Jill wasn\u2019t sure was supposed to be an ashtray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis must be a real change for you,\u201d Pam said. She wrote out the check, then signed it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never dealt with the problem of lack of aliens before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean just that,\u201d Pam said, handing over the retainer. \u201cI meant being back here.\u201d She stood, then glanced around the room. \u201cWhat a nightmare. I never expected to see you back in Los Lobos. Everyone thought you were going to make something of yourself. I guess we were wrong.\u201d</p> <p>She walked toward the door and waved. \u201cI\u2019ll wait to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>Jill was too stunned by the insult to speak. So much for Pam having changed. The thought of the woman stuck with a ratty old house she couldn\u2019t use or sell eased some of the sting of Pam\u2019s parting shot. Of course, Jill was a good enough attorney that the odds of her having to keep the house were slim. Oh, well. She would take whatever bits of happiness she could find.</p><p>She ignored Pam\u2019s brief conversation with a recently returned Tina, not wanting to hear any other comments about her having a stick up her butt, and was surprised when Tina came in as soon as Pam left.</p><p>\u201cYou had a delivery,\u201d she said eagerly. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, and Annie from What\u2019s in Bloom said it was from Gracie Landon. Is it really? Our own Gracie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Jill said as she rose, not sure who \u201cour Gracie\u201d was. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends.\u201d</p> <p>Tina, dressed in khakis and a tucked-in T-shirt, pressed both hands to her chest.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m a few years older than you two girls, but I just love that Gracie. She\u2019s a legend. People still talk about her and what she did to get her man.\u201d</p><p>Jill winced. Gracie would not be pleased to know her teenaged exploits in the name of claiming the love of Riley Whitefield lived on.</p><p>\u201cShe was pretty young,\u201d Jill said as she walked into the reception area and saw a beautiful tree with flowering things tucked in around it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miniature ficus,\u201d Tina said. \u201cThe flowers in front are cut. They\u2019ll die soon, but the tree could last for years. There\u2019s a card.\u201d</p><p>She handed over the envelope, then waited expectantly. Jill felt obligated to read the note wishing her luck aloud.</p> <p>\u201cImagine. Gracie Landon.\u201d Tina touched the leaves and smiled. \u201cRemember the time Riley and Pam went parking up on the bluff and Gracie followed them on her bike and dumped a bag of crickets into the car?\u201d</p><p>Jill remembered the incident all too well. While she\u2019d had a massive crush on Mac, she\u2019d been content to love him from afar. Not so Gracie. At fourteen she\u2019d been stubborn about Riley being hers, and bitter about him dating Pam Baughman. She\u2019d come up with scheme after scheme to separate the two, most of which Jill had quietly participated in.</p><p>There had been the crickets in the car, the potato in his tailpipe to keep him from being able to pick up Pam. Once Gracie had nailed all of Pam\u2019s doors and windows shut, trapping the teenager in her house so she couldn\u2019t make a date. Gracie had put itching powder in Riley\u2019s shorts the night of spring formal and had even thrown herself in front of his car and begged him to just kill her if he was going to keep dating Pam.</p><p>Gracie had declared to all who would listen that Pam didn\u2019t care about Riley at all\u2014that she was just dating him because one day he would inherit old man White field\u2019s fortune. No one had paid attention. Jill supposed that their divorce less than five months after the wed ding had been a form of vindication, but for Gracie, the news had come too late. Heartbroken by what she\u2019d seen as Riley\u2019s ultimate betrayal, she\u2019d moved in with some relatives and had never returned to Los Lobos.</p><p>\u201cGracie\u2019s amazing,\u201d Tina said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t loved until you\u2019ve loved like Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn many quarters what she did would be considered stalking.\u201d</p><p>Tina looked shocked. \u201cNo. She was just a kid in love with a boy who didn\u2019t notice her. But she had a big heart and she loved with every inch of it. I admire that. So do most folks in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to mention it,\u201d Jill said wryly. \u201cShe\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to call her right now?\u201d Tina asked excitedly. \u201cOh, tell her hi from me. I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t re member me, but I sure remember her. Gracie Landon. She sure knew how to love a man.\u201d</p><p>Jill picked up her miniature ficus tree and carried it into her office. The fish watched suspiciously as she set it on a small table by the window, then crossed to her desk and grabbed the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to say thanks,\u201d she said when her friend answered.</p><p>\u201cI know you have the black thumb of death,\u201d Gracie said with a chuckle, \u201cbut even you should be able to keep a ficus alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. It was sweet of you to think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Gracie asked. \u201cYou\u2019re back in Los Lobos. You have my deep sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about instead of sympathy you come visit me? I could cry on your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre things that bad?\u201d</p><p>Jill glanced at the fish, then at the files on her desk. \u201cIt could be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I could be there with you. Which is never going to happen. I have vowed not to return there ever. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo had I, and look what happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Gracie sighed. \u201cSeriously, how are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. There have been some interesting law cases. Guess who came in this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>Gracie laughed. \u201cMy first instinct is to say \u2018that bitch,\u2019 which tells me I may have some unresolved issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my vote. She\u2019s still snarky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut single, right? My heart beats faster knowing no one wants to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Jill laughed. \u201cYes. Still single. There\u2019s something else. It seems your reputation hasn\u2019t died the death you would have liked.\u201d</p><p>Gracie groaned. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell me that. It\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve stayed away and convinced my entire family that it\u2019s really fun to come visit me in L.A. for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, Tina, my assistant, just did five minutes on the Gracie legend. About how you haven\u2019t loved until...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease be kidding.\u201d</p><p>Jill shook her head. \u201cSorry. I think this is bigger than both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. When I think about what I did to that poor guy. Riley must get hives every time he re members me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s recovered.\u201d</p><p>Jill picked up a pen and turned it over. Should she tell Gracie what had happened with Mac? They didn\u2019t have many secrets from each other, but she wasn\u2019t sure about spilling something so intimate with Tina in the next room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call in a couple of days,\u201d she said in stead.</p><p>\u201cPlease do. I\u2019m knee-deep in wedding season. There are cakes everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Gracie had become a specialty baker whose wedding cakes were in high demand by the rich and famous of Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cSend me pictures,\u201d Jill said. \u201cYou know I love to keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. You hang in there. Call if you need to scream or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Jill hung up and leaned back in her chair. Just thinking about Gracie always made her smile. Those had been some wild, fun times. Even though Gracie had moved away the summer they turned fifteen, they\u2019d stayed close friends.</p><p>She glanced at her watch, then at the closed door between her office and Tina\u2019s. She might as well ask now, while her assistant/secretary/receptionist was in a good mood. She wanted a ride to her car so she could move it from the baseball practice fields to the grocery store parking lot. She had a plan to park it by the cart return.</p><p>MAC SAT on the corner of the desk at the front of the conference room and took stock of his employees. The Los Lobos sheriff\u2019s office wasn\u2019t anything like the LAPD. While there wasn\u2019t the same level of crime in the two communities, there also weren\u2019t the resources for his department. He had ten full-time deputies, three part-timers, one detective, five clerical workers, and four dispatchers, including Wilma, who pretty much ran things.</p><p>Most everyone did a good job, some better than others. The only problem he\u2019d found in the three weeks he\u2019d been sheriff was a new deputy named D.J. Webb. D.J. had plenty of attitude but no experience to back it up. Not a combination that made Mac comfortable.</p><p>\u201cThe tourist season is a little busier than we expected,\u201d Mac said, \u201cbut we\u2019re handling it. With the Fourth of July next week, we need to pay attention. The beaches will be crowded as will downtown. This is a time for families. So we\u2019ll pick up all the D&amp;Ds and give them some time to sober up. Wilma, we have the extra space reserved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>The drunk and disorderlies weren\u2019t his only problem. With the crowds came petty criminals, short-tempered drivers searching for parking and the occasional motel robbery.</p><p>\u201cWe need to remember to be friendly,\u201d Mac said. \u201cDon\u2019t go looking for trouble\u2014it will find you soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there\u2019s a terrorist attack?\u201d D.J. asked.</p><p>Wilma snickered and the detective grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d D.J. said earnestly. \u201cWe\u2019re not pre pared if a group comes in here with heavy firepower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re more likely to be held hostage by a band of rogue sharks,\u201d one of the deputies said. \u201cIt\u2019s Los Lobos, D.J. Lighten up.\u201d</p><p>Mac felt the beginnings of a headache\u2014one that would last the entire summer. \u201cWe\u2019re not a big terrorist target,\u201d he told D.J.</p><p>\u201cNot so far as you know. We need to get into those federal databases and figure out what we should be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for sharing.\u201d Mac glanced around the room. \u201cIf that\u2019s it, check the board in the morning. I\u2019ll be posting a new schedule to get us through the holiday week end.\u201d</p><p>People stood and left the conference room. Wilma waited until they were alone, then patted his arm. \u201cD.J.\u2019s gung ho, but he\u2019ll grow out of it as he matures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can wait that long.\u201d</p><p>The older woman grinned. \u201cI know for a fact you were once young and foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019ll admit to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny stories you want to share?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSure. When I was seventeen I stole Judge Strathern\u2019s Cadillac on a bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard about that. Did you get caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I was young and stupid, right? When the judge came to the jail the next morning I thought he was going to tan my hide. Worse, I was afraid my mother would lose her job\u2014she was his housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>Wilma\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe piled me into the front seat of that car and drove me to Lompoc prison where I spent the day in a cell with a very scary felon. By three-thirty that afternoon, I\u2019d more than seen the error of my ways. On the way back to Los Lobos, the good judge talked to me about staying on the right side of the law and joining the military when I graduated from high school. He pretty much saved my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d Wilma said. \u201cAs are you. Patience with D.J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all any of us can do.\u201d She walked toward the door, then paused and glanced at him. \u201cJill seems a lot like her father in temperament, if not in looks.\u201d</p><p>Mac instantly thought of the very hot kiss they\u2019d shared and how the aftereffect had kept him up half the night. Yeah, she and her dad didn\u2019t look anything alike. \u201cThey have a few things in common, but she\u2019s her own person.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019re not a good liar, Mac. Don\u2019t try to make your living playing poker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>JILL RETURNED HOME at the end of day two in a slightly better mood than at the end of day one. Tina had not only continued to be pleasant, but she\u2019d actually stayed and worked until nearly four. The only black cloud in her otherwise bright blue sky\u2014except for the lying rat weasel dog and her lack of acceptable employment\u2014was the BMW.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been a scratch on it. Not a dent, not a hint of any contact at all. It still gleamed like a showroom special. She hoped that a couple of days in the local grocery store parking lot would take care of that.</p><p>She entered her aunt\u2019s home a little after five. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she called.</p><p>Bev came out of the kitchen to greet her. \u201cBetter?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot half-bad. Except for being insulted by Pam Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes her, so her opinion doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Oh, I talked to Gracie. She sent me a ficus tree. She said even I shouldn\u2019t be able to kill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Bev waited until she\u2019d shrugged out of her jacket be fore leading the way back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Jill asked.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Emily and I had a terrific time. We spent the afternoon at the beach. Oh, speaking of which, you know it\u2019s nearly the Fourth of July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard a rumor, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac has to work so Emily will be joining us on our picnic.\u201d</p><p>Jill grabbed a diet soda from the refrigerator and popped the top. \u201cAre we having a picnic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s what the holiday is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, and here I thought it was about celebrating our country\u2019s independence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too, but how could we celebrate without a picnic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m sure it will be fun.\u201d Los Lobos was at its best during holidays of any kind.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Now read this.\u201d She held out a piece of paper.</p><p>Jill grabbed it and read the note twice. \u201cOh, man. Do I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mayor has graciously invited you to join the pier centennial committee meeting tonight. Don\u2019t you think you should go?\u201d</p><p>No. Not even for money. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be here that long. I don\u2019t want to get involved in a project and then have to drop it halfway through.\u201d</p><p>Bev opened the refrigerator and pulled out a plastic pouch of marinating chicken. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you keep repeating that, eventually it will sound like the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the pier and the mayor isn\u2019t my favorite person. He\u2019s smarmy and I think he looks up women\u2019s skirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he seems like the type.\u201d Jill stomped her foot and felt like a two-year-old. \u201cJeez, I hate this.\u201d She looked back at the message her aunt had taken. \u201cI\u2019ll go but only if I get two desserts. One before and one after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll even read your cards for you if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Jill took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to know my future, but thanks for asking.\u201d She glanced down at her slacks. \u201cI need to go change. I hate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear, but it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you used to say about going to the dentist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I wrong?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>MOST SIGNIFICANT EVENTS in Los Lobos took place in the community center and the committee for the pier centennial celebration was no exception. Jill experienced a slight case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as she pushed open one of the heavy double-glass doors.</p><p>She\u2019d attended Girl Scout meetings in this building, had decorated the largest room for various school dances. She\u2019d had her first kiss out on the basketball courts on a rainy afternoon when she\u2019d been seventeen. The boy in question\u2014Kevin Denny\u2014had quickly turned his attentions elsewhere, but to her that first kiss had been a huge deal.</p><p>Tonight she was less enthused about stepping into a piece of her past. For one thing, she didn\u2019t want to get assigned actual work involving the celebration. For an other, she dreaded answering questions about why she was back, how she was doing and what she thought would happen in the future. There was also the twenty-eight-and-soon-to-be-divorced syndrome to deal with. Ah, to be home with a good DVD and a bowl of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s.</p><p>Knowing that her aunt would give her \u201cthe look\u201d if she returned early, she stepped into the building and followed the sound of voices to the second meeting doorway on the right. As she walked into the large room and glanced around at too many familiar faces, she felt a slight tickling on the back of her neck. She turned. Mac stood by the coffee urn. His dark gaze settled on her face and he gave her a slow, sexy smile that reminded her that just about twenty-two hours ago, they\u2019d been kissing and she\u2019d been thinking about giving in to a whole lot more.</p><p>In the sensible light of almost-twilight, she didn\u2019t know if she should go for a sophisticated I-do-this-sort-of-thing-all-the-time or if running for cover was the better option. Figuring there wasn\u2019t anywhere to go, she walked toward him and accepted the cup of coffee he held out.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get roped into this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe mayor\u2019s office called and when I tried to whine my way out of it, Aunt Bev looked stern. I\u2019m easily guilted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the sheriff. I have to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe joys of small-town life.\u201d She glanced around the room. \u201cQuite a turnout. All the small-business owners, the city council and many concerned citizens. With luck there will be more hands than work.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cWishful thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but a girl has to have dreams. Is our esteemed mayor here yet?\u201d</p><p>Mac put his free hand on her shoulder and pointed with the one holding his coffee cup. She liked how they were sticking together and how he touched her. She liked a lot of things. If Mac was the door prize for at tending the meeting, she would consider this an evening well spent.</p><p>She looked where he pointed and saw Los Lobos mayor Franklin Yardley speaking with a young woman she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Yardley had been mayor for as long as Jill could remember. Probably fifteen years. He was handsome, as tanned as George Hamilton and too well dressed for a town this small. He wore his gray hair short, in a modified military buzz. His eyes crinkled when he talked, giving the impression of good humor and affability. He had the practiced smile and easy manner of a successful used-car salesman. He\u2019d always made Jill uncomfortable, especially at honors events during high school. Becoming a National Merit Scholar or winning a prize meant getting your picture taken with the mayor. In her opinion, he\u2019d always held the girls a little too tight and she distinctly remembered him patting her butt after she received a scholarship to Stanford.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting old man,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that old,\u201d Mac said. \u201cFifty-two, fifty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever his age, he gives me the creeps. Can we sit in the back?\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cSure thing. Are we going to pass notes, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignoring the implication I\u2019m acting as if I\u2019m in high school. Sitting up front is the same as volunteering and my goal for tonight is to slip out unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill, honey, is that you?\u201d a loud, female voice called from the doorway.</p><p>Jill winced as she turned and saw Pam striding to ward her. \u201cOh, great. Here\u2019s another opportunity for her to insult me.\u201d</p><p>Mac leaned close. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came by to see me about a legal thing today and nailed me good.\u201d She plastered a smile on her face and tried to act pleased. \u201cPam. Hi. So you\u2019re here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The centennial celebration of our be loved pier is going to be an event to remember. The Fourth of July is just a warm-up. We\u2019ve already started a national advertising campaign. We only have six weeks to get things finalized.\u201d Her smile widened. \u201cI\u2019m sure we have something you can help with. Maybe stuffing information folders for the chamber of commerce. I know they need help with that.\u201d</p><p>Determined to have a witty comeback this time, she searched her brain as she opened her mouth. Just then Franklin Yardley called the meeting to order.</p><p>Pam waggled her fingers and sauntered off.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Jill said as Mac led her to the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cTry to play nice with the other children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard what she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I also know that you\u2019re younger, more successful and a hell of a lot sexier. Did it ever occur to you she\u2019s acting this way because she\u2019s bitter?\u201d</p><p>Jill felt her bad mood drain away. \u201cNo, but I like it.\u201d</p><p>EMILY HELD the deck of cards in her hand. Bev demonstrated how to shuffle and Emily did her best to follow directions.</p><p>\u201cJust slide a few in front,\u201d the older woman said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>The cards felt big and awkward, but Emily did as instructed. The cards slid into place.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Bev told her. \u201cLet\u2019s try it again.\u201d She winked. \u201cWe need a well-shuffled deck so I can beat you this time.\u201d</p><p>They were playing Go Fish, which was a little kids\u2019 game, but still fun. Emily shuffled two more times, then dealt out the cards. When one slipped and fell on the floor, Bev didn\u2019t say anything. She was nice that way, Emily thought as she put the card back in place. She never yelled or got mad. She never made Emily feel scared.</p><p>\u201cYou have other cards,\u201d Emily said as she sorted her cards by numbers. She already had two threes and two fives. That was good. \u201cCards with pictures and stuff on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I do. My tarot cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they for? Different games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. The cards can be fun. People use them at parties. Some people think they\u2019re special\u2014that they can tell what\u2019s going to happen in the future or what happened in the past.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the future sounded scary, Emily thought. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone already know the past? Weren\u2019t they there when it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. But they aren\u2019t always clear on the events. A lot of people think tarot is silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Bev put down her cards and leaned forward. Her long red braid hung over her shoulder and nearly brushed against the table.</p><p>\u201cI believe I have a gift. I can see things other people can\u2019t. Like you\u2019re a good reader. You read better than most kids you know. That\u2019s a gift, right?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow you being able to read is something people can see. They don\u2019t have to take it on faith. But my gift is different. You can\u2019t see it or touch it. So while I believe, others don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Emily thought she understood. \u201cDoes Jill believe?\u201d</p><p>Bev laughed. \u201cAn interesting question. My niece is one of my doubters.\u201d</p><p>Emily was shocked. \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lying, just pretending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Emily tried to understand. \u201cSo the cards tell you what\u2019s gonna happen tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot specifically. They give me ideas. Good fortune, bad fortune, that sort of thing. People come to me with questions and I try to help them find answers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d That sounded pretty exciting. If Emily could know the future...she closed her mind to the question. There were too many dark places she didn\u2019t want go.</p><p>\u201cThere are responsibilities that come with my gift. Do you know what responsibilities are?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cYou have to do the right thing and you have to think it up even if no one tells you. Like having a pet. I\u2019d have to feed it and stuff, even if Mom didn\u2019t remind me. Or doing my homework without being re minded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. I have to be careful what I tell people. Some may make decisions based on our conversation and I don\u2019t want them making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Emily could see how that would be bad. \u201cDo you get scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very often, but it\u2019s happened. Also, I have to stay pure for my gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure?\u201d</p><p>Bev grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s like staying clean, but for grown-ups.\u201d She leaned close. \u201cEmily, if you could know one thing about your future, what would it be?\u201d</p> <p>Emily shrank back in her chair. \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t want to know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded so hard her hair slapped her cheeks. She didn\u2019t want to know. What if her mom left the way her dad did? What if her dad didn\u2019t love her anymore? What if she was left all alone with nowhere to go?</p><p>Her stomach got all tight and hard and she thought she might throw up.</p><p>Bev straightened and picked up her cards. \u201cOne thing I don\u2019t need tarot to tell me is how special you are. I\u2019m really enjoying having you with me. I\u2019m afraid the summer is going to go by really fast and then you\u2019ll be gone and I\u2019ll miss you. I guess if I\u2019m going to miss you a lot and I\u2019ve just met you, then your mom must be having a hard time right now. She\u2019s known you all her life.\u201d</p><p>Emily had wondered about that. \u201cShe said she would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re a part of her day. She\u2019s missing you just like your dad missed you while he was apart from you.\u201d</p><p>Emily was less sure about that. \u201cHe never called or anything.\u201d</p><p>Bev nodded. \u201cSometimes that happens. And when they mess up, grown-ups feel very guilty, and then they don\u2019t know what to do to make it right. Especially with kids. How much should we say? How much will you understand? But now that you\u2019re with your dad, I know you can see the love in his eyes. I do.\u201d</p><p>Emily stared at her. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Every time he walks into this house, his whole face lights up. He\u2019s so bright, he could be a lamp.\u201d</p><p>Emily giggled at the thought of her dad with a lamp shade on his head. \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Bev held out her arms. \u201cI need a hug. Is that all right?\u201d</p><p>Emily grinned. \u201cSure.\u201d She stood and walked around the table, but as she got closer to Bev, something funny happened inside. Her chest got all sore and her face got hot and suddenly she wanted to cry.</p> <p>Bev pulled her close and set her on her lap. \u201cA nice big hug,\u201d she said, wrapping her arms around Emily. \u201cI think I need one at least once a day.\u201d</p><p>Emily tried to talk, but she couldn\u2019t. She flung her arms around Bev\u2019s neck and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Bev said, her voice low and gentle. \u201cYou have yourself a good cry. Some days we need that as much as a hug.\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t know what was wrong. Why was she crying? Why did everything hurt so bad inside?</p><p>Bev continued to hold her, rubbing her back and kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cMy brave little girl,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThis has been hard for you. But you\u2019re safe now. You\u2019re safe with me and you\u2019re safe with your dad.\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Because he\u2019s mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sniffed, then rubbed her cheek against the softness of Bev\u2019s flowered dress. \u201cBecause he never came and found me. He was supposed to. He was supposed to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he was. All dads are supposed to find their little girls. He broke the rules.\u201d</p><p>Emily raised her head and stared into Bev\u2019s face. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t you hate it when that happens?\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019d expected Bev to tell her she was wrong. That she shouldn\u2019t expect her dad to come find her.</p><p>\u201cI was mad,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI would be, too. You\u2019re still mad, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Emily opened her mouth, then closed it. Was she mad? Was that it? She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnd even when your dad says he loves you, you don\u2019t know if you can believe him.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded again. Bev knew.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re mad at your dad it makes you scared, which makes you think about your mom. And you start to wonder if she\u2019s even missing you at all.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as she nodded, then she collapsed against Bev. \u201cWhat if they both forget about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, that\u2019s not going to happen. How could any one forget about you? It\u2019s only been a couple of days and I know I never could. But I understand what you feel. I understand.\u201d</p><p>They were the most precious words Emily had ever heard. She stayed in Bev\u2019s arms for a long time. When she started to feel better, she raised her head again.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell my dad what I said?\u201d</p><p>Bev straightened and raised her eyebrows. \u201cMe? Be tray a secret? Never! I\u2019m shocked you\u2019d even ask. Shocked and insulted.\u201d</p><p>Emily smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too. Shocked, insulted and funny.\u201d She smoothed Emily\u2019s bangs. \u201cI won\u2019t tell him what you said, but I will tell him he needs to keep working on making you feel safe. Just like I\u2019m going to tell you that you need to open your heart enough to think about for giving him. If your dad wasn\u2019t trying, then I\u2019d agree with you about staying mad. But he is trying and he loves you so much. Wouldn\u2019t it be sad to miss that be cause you keep turning your back on him?\u201d</p><p>Emily wasn\u2019t sure exactly what Bev meant, but she got enough to know Bev was telling her not to be mean. \u201cI\u2019m scared. What if he goes away again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t? Are you going to spend every day waiting for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to think about it. And you can always talk to me. Or Jill.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOr even your dad. I\u2019m not so sure about Elvis. I don\u2019t think he gives very good ad vice.\u201d</p><p>Emily giggled. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he has opinions about everything.\u201d Bev squeezed her. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded, then hopped down. She felt good. The tightness was gone and she found herself looking forward to seeing her dad when he got home. She wanted to see if he really lit up like a lamp when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cNEED A RIDE?\u201d Mac asked when the meeting ended.</p><p>Jill picked up the large box containing plastic bags printed with \u201cLos Lobos means fun\u201d and several hundred sunscreen samples, along with the other freebies she was supposed to stuff inside, and sighed.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I don\u2019t think I could walk home with all this.\u201d Her expression was an intriguing combination of amusement and frustration.</p><p>He grabbed the second box of supplies and led the way outside. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you refuse when Pam volunteered you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was caught off guard. Everyone else was doing something for the celebration and I felt guilty because I don\u2019t even want to be here. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as they stepped out into the night. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to keep getting suckered into jobs like this, I\u2019m going to have to do something about getting transportation. Either give up on trying to get Lyle\u2019s car dented or get a car of my own. But I really liked the idea of revenge. It\u2019s a big part of my new five-year plan.\u201d</p><p>He unlocked his truck and opened the back hatch. After loading in his box, he took hers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about your revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a stick-in-the-mud. I won\u2019t do anything illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it starts. Then things get out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d She slid into the passenger seat. \u201cI would like to take this moment to point out that of the two of us, you\u2019re the only one who has been arrested for stealing a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d Another lifetime ago. He\u2019d been young and stupid and out for the thrill. In some ways, getting arrested had been the best thing that had happened to him\u2014it had turned his life around.</p><p>He started the engine and pulled away from the curb. Jill leaned back in her seat.</p><p>\u201cAunt Bev is going to be so happy that I volunteered,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I can get her to stuff the bags for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Jill glanced at him and grinned. Her long dark hair swayed as she moved. \u201cYou\u2019re right, but I will take the boxes into work tomorrow and see if I can talk Tina into it. She doesn\u2019t do much work, anyway. This would be a change for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for a good cause.\u201d</p><p>He navigated the quiet streets. He liked seeing the warm glow of lights behind drapes and the bikes left scattered on lawns. This was his town, his responsibility. He wanted to do right by the people. Jill, on the other hand, counted the days until her escape. If she hadn\u2019t had a run-in with Lyle, she wouldn\u2019t be here at all.</p><p>\u201cSo if your soon-to-be ex is so horrible, why did you marry him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jill shook her head. \u201cGood question. I plead youth and ignorance. Maybe bad timing. We met in law school. Lyle was funny and nice and good-looking enough to catch my attention but not so good-looking that I had to worry he\u2019d have a busload of women following him everywhere. Boy, was I wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he cheat on you before this last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know about. I\u2019m willing to forgive some things, but not that. It\u2019s just too much of a betrayal. No, at first things were good. We were in a study group. He wasn\u2019t the smartest one there, but he did okay.\u201d</p><p>Mac turned onto their street. \u201cLet me guess. You were the smartest one there.\u201d</p><p>She batted her eyes at him. \u201cA lady never studies and tells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures. So you got him through law school and then what?\u201d</p><p>Jill frowned. \u201cYou know, I was about to say I didn\u2019t get him through law school, but I think you might be right. I helped him with his homework and papers and we studied together for tests. My God, I never got that before.\u201d</p><p>He pulled in front of her house. \u201cIt\u2019s okay that you helped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. What was I thinking?\u201d She unfastened her seat belt and angled toward him. \u201cI got him his job, too. When I graduated first in our class, I had a ton of offers. There were a couple of law firms that really caught my attention, including the one I went with in San Francisco. Lyle wasn\u2019t getting many offers and he used to talk about how sad it was going to be for us to be apart. By then we were dating.\u201d</p><p>Sleeping together, Mac thought, but he kept that to himself. Lyle had probably been bright enough not to be so drunk the first time he saw Jill naked that he threw up. Mac nearly groaned when he remembered what she\u2019d told him. Talk about bad timing.</p><p>\u201cHe went on about us getting married,\u201d she continued. \u201cAbout how great it would be. On my last interview, I told the senior partners I wanted them to hire Lyle, as well.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cA pretty ballsy move, but I was young, I thought I was in love. They agreed, and he got the job. Then he got me fired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mac unfastened his seat belt and turned toward her. \u201cAny more information on how that happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I sent e-mails to a couple of people. My former assistant is doing some investigating. I brought in more money than any other associate. More than a couple of the partners. I did a good job, my clients were happy and well represented....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Lyle did something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Or said something. Lying weasel rat bastard.\u201d</p><p>Her energy made the air crackle, and her intensity only added to her appeal. She was a hell of a woman and not one he should be thinking about. Not only did they want different things, but once again he was forced to remind himself that sleeping with the man\u2019s daughter was a piss-poor way to thank Judge Strathern for all his help. Plus he needed to spend his free time focusing on reconnecting with Emily.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t resist reaching out and gently wrapping a strand of her hair around his finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you find out Lyle did something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go break his kneecaps.\u201d She leaned toward Mac. \u201cWant to help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt violates the terms of my custody agreement. Plus I\u2019d have to arrest myself afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want that. I guess I\u2019ll have to come up with a different kind of punishment.\u201d</p><p>Mac wanted to tell her that Lyle had already suffered the greatest loss\u2014he\u2019d lost Jill. Obviously the lying weasel rat bastard hadn\u2019t known a good thing when he\u2019d seen it. But Mac knew.</p><p>He wanted her. Funny how long it had been since he\u2019d wanted a woman. Not just in bed, either, although he wouldn\u2019t turn that down. He wanted to hear her laughing at his jokes, sharing her opinion on every thing. He wanted to talk about politics and the possibility of an afterlife. He wanted to know if she opened presents on Christmas morning or Christmas Eve. He contented himself with staring into her dark eyes and wanting her mouth on his.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot even for money,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any fun.\u201d</p><p>She pouted. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you a list of reasons, but here are the two most pressing. I\u2019m going to guess your aunt and my daughter are looking out the window right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily\u2019s only eight and will get bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your aunt?\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer. \u201cLet her get her own guy.\u201d</p><p>A ready-and-willing Jill was more than he could resist. He tangled his hand in her hair and shifted so he could kiss her.</p> <p>She responded instantly, her warm, soft lips moving against his. Her fingers curled into his upper arms. Their breath mingled and he figured he wouldn\u2019t mind doing this for the rest of the night.</p><p>As he moved his tongue across the seam, she made a noise low in her throat, then parted for him. He welcomed the invitation and swept inside.</p><p>She tasted of mint and coffee. Heat swirled around them. He shifted so he could kiss her jaw, then he licked the soft skin under her ear. She shivered and breathed his name. From there it was a short journey down the velvety smoothness of her neck to her collarbone. The V of her T-shirt offered possibilities, but none he could take advantage of at the moment. With the console jut ting out between them, he couldn\u2019t get close enough, and he growled with frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked as she raised her head. Her eyes were nearly black in the faint glow of the streetlight.</p><p>\u201cI want you closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She pushed against the seat and promptly banged her head against the roof of the truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m horrible at this,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cJeez. Are we too old or what?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he kissed her again. A soft but demanding kiss that had her melting in his arms.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she breathed. \u201cThis is good.\u201d</p><p>He was hard and ready. It had been a long time since his last close encounter. Too long. But his need for Jill was about more than just being without. Still, his daughter was waiting, her aunt might be watching and this wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>He cupped her face. \u201cI need to ask for another rain check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re piling them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may collect all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked, reaching for his door handle.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>NEARLY A WEEK LATER, sometime close to midnight, two long, black limousines drove into Los Lobos. Mr. Harrison saw them as he put out his cat for the night. Mrs. Zimmerman heard them drive by as she muted the Tonight Show during a commercial break. And the night clerk at the Surf Rider motel nearly had a heart attack when they pulled into his parking lot.</p><p>Six men in dark suits stepped out of the vehicles and made their way to the reception desk.</p><p>The clerk, Jim, a college student majoring in chemical engineering, felt his knees begin to shake. He was going to die. Right there. And no one would know for hours.</p><p>\u201cM-may I help you?\u201d he asked as the men pulled open the glass door and stepped into the reception area.</p><p>\u201cWe have a reservation,\u201d one of the men said. They were all big men, with dark hair and distant eyes. \u201cUnder Casaccio. Six rooms for tonight, all close together, then two rooms for the next week.\u201d</p><p>Jim pushed the registration card toward the man and handed him a pen. \u201cIf you\u2019ll just sign the register?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019m Mr. Casaccio. You can call me Rudy.\u201d He passed over a fifty-dollar bill. \u201cI appreciate your understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Sure. Great.\u201d</p><p>Jim shoved the reservation card back into the file and quickly programmed six keys. It was only when he\u2019d given the men directions and they\u2019d left that he dared to pick up the fifty and tuck it into his jeans. As soon as he got off work, he was going to take that money and get seriously drunk. It wasn\u2019t every day that a kid like him faced men like that and lived to tell the tale.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>JILL STARTED her second week in Los Lobos by wearing her hair\u2014straight, of course\u2014in a braid instead of up. Yes, it was more casual, but it was also easier and didn\u2019t give her a headache by the end of the day. Deter mined to maintain the facade that she was indeed practicing actual law, she still wore a suit, although she was briefly tempted by summer silk slacks and a loose shirt.</p><p>She arrived at her office promptly at eight-thirty and started coffee. After going through the mail dropped through the slot in the door on Saturday, she went over her open cases and made notes for the coming week.</p><p>There was still the question of what to do about Mr. Harrison\u2019s fence problem. Moving it seemed out of the question. After over a hundred years of tacit agreement on placement, no court would side with the old man. But she hated the thought of sending him away unhappy.</p><p>Jill was less concerned about Pam\u2019s mood, but her natural inclination to give a hundred percent had her searching case law for something on aliens.</p><p>Not that she wanted to help Pam, she thought, as she leaned back in her chair and stared at the fish on the far wall. They stared back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about her,\u201d she told herself. \u201cThink about something pleasant.\u201d</p><p>Mac instantly came to mind. She hadn\u2019t seen him in a few days and they hadn\u2019t had a repeat of that hot kiss in the car in over a week, but just the memory was enough to make her toes tingle. He was a perfect distraction\u2014and a temptation. At least she had the com fort of knowing she\u2019d had great taste in men back in high school. Of course, things had taken a bad turn with the rat fink lying weasel dog.</p><p>Tina arrived about nine-fifteen and walked into Jill\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s almost the Fourth of July,\u201d she said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cYes. In a couple of days. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have family coming in. The kids don\u2019t have any activities this week. Dave\u2019s real busy over at the tire store. A lot of people get new tires before taking a driving vacation.\u201d</p><p>Tina\u2019s annoyance and impatience were clear. Jill couldn\u2019t figure out the cause. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want to work this week?\u201d</p><p>The other woman practically rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked in a sharp tone.</p><p>\u201cThen go home.\u201d</p><p>Tina didn\u2019t look any more pleased at the instruction. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to pay me, are you?\u201d</p><p>Jill raised her eyebrows. \u201cFor not working? No.\u201d</p><p>Tina huffed, then turned on her heel and left.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Jill murmured. She desperately wanted to replace the woman but kept telling herself it wasn\u2019t worth the effort. Not when she, Jill, would be leaving so soon. Patience, she thought. She could survive this with a little patience.</p><p>After flipping through more files and doing some research on the Internet, Jill got up for a quick potty break. Liquid in, liquid out, she thought with a grin as she made her way to the bathroom. Once inside the small room, she did her business and turned to wash her hands.</p><p>As always, a bright blue-silver fish caught her eye. It stared right at her as she went, then watched while she washed her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really getting on my nerves,\u201d she told the long-dead creature, took the hand towel and hung it over its pointed little face. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>As she walked back into her office, she sensed movement. Several men in dark suits stood by her desk. They turned as she approached. The taller of the men walked toward her.</p><p>\u201cYour secretary wasn\u2019t at her desk. We let ourselves in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M LATE,\u201d MAC SAID as he walked toward the front of the sheriff\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI know, but this is too good to wait.\u201d Wilma trailed after him waving pink slips of paper. \u201cWe got a couple of calls from the usual crackpots, but Mr. Harrison never phones anything in. He\u2019s a sensible man and not too bad-looking if you like \u2019em old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilma, if there\u2019s a point, you have until I get to my car to give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She thrust the papers into his hand. \u201cTwo long, black limos were seen driving into town late last night. Six men checked into the Surf Rider motel. The night clerk there is the grandson of a friend of mine, so I heard the whole thing from him.\u201d She glanced around and lowered her voice. \u201cThey were wearing dark suits and pinkie rings.\u201d</p><p>Mac didn\u2019t need this. The Fourth of July was in two days. D.J., his youngest deputy, still wanted to talk about more firepower to ward off terrorist attacks. A broken water pipe had flooded one of the big beach parking lots and city maintenance wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d have it fixed in time for holiday parking and he was late for his appointment with Hollis Bass.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d he asked as he reached his truck.</p><p>\u201cThe Mafia!\u201d Wilma sounded more excited than horrified. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cNot every man who wears a pinkie ring is involved in organized crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these guys are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll deal with it when I\u2019m done with Hollis. I\u2019ll call from the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll make a few calls myself and see if I can find out where they are.\u201d She grinned. \u201cDo you think they\u2019re in town to rub somebody out?\u201d</p><p>MAC SPENT the short drive to Hollis\u2019s office thinking about all he had to do that afternoon and wondering how Emily was. Ever since Bev had told him that his daughter still didn\u2019t feel safe with him, he\u2019d been working on different ways to let her know how much he loved her. He thought things were getting a little better. She smiled more and responded to his teasing. They were talking more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how was he supposed to convince an eight-year-old that he wouldn\u2019t abandon her again? Not sure he was ever going to find that answer, he pulled into the parking lot and cut the engine.</p><p>After taking the stairs two at a time, he walked into Hollis\u2019s office and took a seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said flatly.</p> <p>Hollis smiled. \u201cHow are things going with Emily?\u201d</p><p>As if he would tell this guy anything. \u201cGreat. She\u2019s adjusting well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny behavior issues?\u201d</p><p>He thought of the monochromatic food/clothing problem. Emily still required her meals to match her clothing. He and Bev were working together to find creative solutions to the potential difficulties. Thank God, it was summer and there were plenty of fresh fruits around. Berries had saved his butt more than once.</p><p>He studied Hollis\u2014the man\u2019s small, round glasses, his prissy shirt, the air of \u201cI know everything and you don\u2019t know shit\u201d about him.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing just fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>Hollis nodded and made a few notes on his pad. \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear that. She\u2019s sleeping well and eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Hollis scribbled some more. \u201cI have some thing I want you to read.\u201d He bent down for something.</p><p>Mac expected an article of some kind, but the social worker handed him a book on anger management.</p><p>Instead of taking it, Mac leaned back in his chair and tried not to punch the little prick for presuming. \u201cWhat makes you think I need this?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a by-product of what you do. Your high-stress job requires a lot of aggression without letting you act on it. Tension builds up and eventually explodes.\u201d He set the book on his desk and pushed it toward Mac. \u201cI would like you to read the first three chapters by our next meeting.\u201d</p><p>Mac could feel an explosion coming on right this second. \u201cWant to explain why you have such a thing against cops? Was your dad one?\u201d</p><p>Hollis gave him a superior smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to try to analyze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis had to come from somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? The statistics speak for themselves. I\u2019m trying to help you be a good father, a good citizen and a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken on quite a job, then, Hollis,\u201d Mac said as he picked up the book. How dare this kid try to tell him what problems he had. The kid didn\u2019t know him from a rock.</p><p>But Mac was well and truly trapped. Hollis was his key to keeping Emily for the summer. If the social worker called the court and said he wasn\u2019t cooperating, his daughter would be taken away within hours.</p><p>He picked up the book and flipped through it. \u201cI thought our meetings were going to be every other week,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw you last week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m allowed to change the schedule as I see fit. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll go another ten days or so. And I will be checking on Emily in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. With Hollis likely to turn up any second, Mac had no choice but to give in on the food issues. Hollis would accuse him of starving his daughter and it would be all over.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s everything. Have a good holiday,\u201d Hollis said.</p><p>Mac stared at him. He had about ten thousand tourists showing up in a town with a normal population of less than twenty-five hundred. There would be heat, surf and too much liquor. Yeah, it was going to be a peachy time.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said as he stood. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>He left the room and walked to his truck, where he tossed the book on the passenger seat. What he really wanted to do was drive over the pages until they were dust. Instead he pulled out his cell phone and called Wilma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with my meeting and heading back to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting calls for the past half hour. The Mafia guys are at Jill Strathern\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>SURE ENOUGH when Mac pulled up in front of the small building with the Dixon and Son sign out front, he found a black limo parked in front. A little unusual for Los Lobos, he thought as he got out and walked toward the door, but hardly reason to assume that organized crime had come to town.</p><p>Too many people with too much time on their hands, he thought was he walked inside. When he heard voices, he called out a greeting.</p><p>\u201cIn my office,\u201d Jill said. \u201cCome on back.\u201d</p><p>Mac walked through the fish-filled reception area and into Jill\u2019s fish-filled office only to come to a stop when he saw her drinking coffee with two men who looked like extras from the Godfather movies. Holy shit.</p><p>They were both dark, Italian looking, wearing expensive, well-cut suits and pinkie rings, and an air of menace.</p><p>The men stood. Jill pointed to the taller of the two, a man in his mid-fifties. \u201cThis is Rudy Casaccio and his associate, Mr. Smith. Rudy, this is Mac Kendrick, our sheriff and a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d Rudy said with a smile as he shook hands. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Smith also shook his hand but didn\u2019t speak. He was much bigger than Rudy and several years younger, with massive shoulders and hands as big as hubcaps.</p><p>Mac didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d figured the reports had all been exaggerated and brought on by too many late-night movies. Obviously he\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>The Mafia? Here? With Jill?</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou can stay for a bit, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, sure.\u201d</p><p>Rudy pulled up a chair. \u201cInteresting office,\u201d he said as he motioned for Mac to take a seat. \u201cI like the fish, but Jill isn\u2019t so sure. She says they smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d she called from the storeroom. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of bringing in a few candles, but I\u2019m not sure if stuffed-fish fumes are flammable. I\u2019d hate to see the whole place go up in flames.\u201d</p><p>Mac accepted the mug she offered. She seemed perfectly at ease as she settled back behind her desk and picked up her own cup.</p><p>\u201cAre you in town long?\u201d he asked Rudy.</p><p>The other man smiled. \u201cA few days. I wanted to come see Jill. When we spoke on the phone, she said she was fine, but I didn\u2019t believe her.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Mac could only stare. \u201cYou\u2019re that close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill is our attorney. She\u2019s the best. We had hoped she would make partner this year, but after what Lyle did...\u201d His low voice trailed off.</p><p>Jill held up a hand. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he actually did anything. Innocent until proven guilty and all that? Re member?\u201d</p><p>Rudy shrugged, then put down his mug. \u201cWe should be going. Nice to meet you, Sheriff.\u201d He rose and turned to Jill. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Have fun.\u201d</p><p>He left with the silent Mr. Smith. Mac turned to Jill.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on? My office has been getting calls all morning with hysterical people telling us the Mafia has arrived. I thought it was joke.\u201d</p><p>Jill could see that Mac wasn\u2019t handling this well. \u201cThey\u2019re not the Mafia.\u201d</p><p>He put his mug on her desk. \u201cWhat would you call them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusinessmen who like to talk about having connections. The key word is talk. Rudy has far too many legitimate business interests to have the time or energy for anything else, but he likes to act menacing and it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>Mac didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cSo you\u2019re not involved in organized crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll admit Rudy is a colorful character, but he\u2019s not in the Mafia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So how connected is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweetie. He\u2019s al ways been perfectly normal. He brings me a lot of nice legal business and he pays his bills on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he offer to take care of Lyle for you?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together.</p><p>He swore again. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t accept his offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Besides, he wasn\u2019t really saying he\u2019d do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to test that theory by accepting?\u201d</p><p>Actually, she wasn\u2019t, but Mac didn\u2019t have to know that. \u201cHe feels badly for me. He knows how hard I worked and how much I enjoyed the different challenges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you working for him now?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously be worried about him being in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it and you didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I don\u2019t have to, but for the sake of peace between friends, no, I\u2019m not currently doing any work for him. I don\u2019t have the resources here to do a good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>She hated seeing him worried for no reason. \u201cMac, relax. Rudy\u2019s going to stick around for a few days, take in the local sights, then head back to Vegas. I promise, he won\u2019t make any trouble. Why would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that for a fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it in my gut. Would it do any good to tell you not to see him again?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBesides, talking about actual corporate law is way more thrilling than worrying about wills and fences.\u201d</p><p>He stood and paced the length of her office. She liked watching him move, although she felt a little guilty about the tension tightening his body.</p><p>\u201cI saw Hollis today,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe little twit gave me a book on anger management. He said it was be cause all cops have anger issues. It made me want to beat the crap out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich might have proven his point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her. \u201cI don\u2019t need these guys hanging around, Jill. You may think they\u2019re here to vacation, but I don\u2019t agree. Men like Rudy Casaccio can\u2019t help making trouble\u2014it\u2019s in their blood. You may be passing through, but I\u2019m making a home here for myself and Emily. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to protect this town. No one is going to get in the way of that. Not Rudy and not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIS MAC STILL ANGRY with you?\u201d Bev asked a few mornings later as they loaded the picnic basket for the Fourth-of-July celebration.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jill admitted. She hadn\u2019t seen him since he\u2019d stalked about of her office. \u201cI think he\u2019s wildly overreacting to the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a lot to deal with right now. His new job, Emily, the social worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She remembered Mac\u2019s complaint that Hollis had given him an anger-management book and wondered if he\u2019d had any time to read it. Maybe when he got to the chapter on jumping to conclusions, he would be less crabby with her.</p><p>Technically, she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, but she still hated that he\u2019d left in a temper.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThey can be a trial,\u201d Bev agreed. Her long sundress swayed as she worked. As always, she\u2019d pulled her wavy red hair back in a braid. \u201cThat\u2019s another reason I stay clear of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to follow your example,\u201d Jill said with de termination. \u201cLyle was a complete disaster. Mac is con fusing. I don\u2019t need this pain in my life. I\u2019m happy and successful on my own.\u201d Well, maybe not successful considering her current circumstances, but she had been before and she would be again.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the car?\u201d Bev asked as she tucked sandwiches into the insulated picnic basket.</p><p>Jill carefully stacked frosted cookies into a plastic container. \u201cThe beach parking lot. You know, I\u2019m be ginning to think Lyle arranged for some kind of Gypsy protection on that damn car. It\u2019s been nearly two weeks and there\u2019s not a scratch on the thing. I left it by the shopping-cart return for three days. That should have done something. With the black paint, every little mark shows up. But is there even one? No. I really hate that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking the beach will be the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. You know how the main parking lot curves and there\u2019s that one spot that juts out a little?\u201d</p><p>Her aunt nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I parked the car. I\u2019m hoping a few people nick it. Does that make me a bad person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Lyle earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She put the cookies beside the sandwiches, then reached for the bags of chips. \u201cI haven\u2019t done much on my revenge plan. I can\u2019t ever think of anything good. I\u2019d rather focus on my own life and getting that in order than trampling over Lyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re getting over him.\u201d</p><p>Jill nodded. \u201cI am. I\u2019ve also been thinking that there might not have been much to get over. I\u2019m angry and humiliated, but I\u2019m not emotionally devastated. Wouldn\u2019t I be if I\u2019d loved him?\u201d</p> <p>Her aunt patted her arm. \u201cBe happy that you\u2019re doing so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I am. I had that phone interview yesterday. That was good. I think they\u2019re going to invite me in for a face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like that?\u201d</p><p>Jill considered the question. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re the right firm for me, but I\u2019m happy to be getting responses to my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It\u2019s nice to be wanted.\u201d Especially after what had happened with her being fired and all. If only she could figure out what had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cWill your Mafia friends be at the beach today?\u201d Bev asked.</p><p>Jill laughed. \u201cFirst of all, they\u2019re not my Mafia friends. They\u2019re more like business associates. And second, Rudy doesn\u2019t strike me as a beach kind of guy. I can\u2019t imagine him in anything but a suit. But if he shows up, I\u2019ll be sure to introduce you.\u201d</p> <p>Bev giggled. \u201cIt will be just like the Sopranos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. Mac would be furious if someone started shooting on his beach.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Jill\u2019s heart gave an odd little flip. She wiped her hands on a dishcloth, then walked over and pulled open the door.</p><p>Emily stood on the front porch. She held a blanket in one hand and a canvas tote in the other.</p><p>\u201cSunscreen,\u201d she said glumly. \u201cDaddy says I have to.\u201d</p><p>Jill looked past her to where Mac stood. As always, the sight of him in uniform made her want to kick up her heels and suggest something naughty. Unfortunately, he was wearing sunglasses, so she couldn\u2019t see his eyes and figure out if he was still upset with her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smart,\u201d she told Emily. \u201cSunburns hurt like crazy. Come on in. We\u2019re packing the picnic basket.\u201d She eyed the girl\u2019s outfit...red from head to toe...and thought of the red-iced cookies. Either Bev had guessed right or she and Emily had discussed clothing in advance.</p><p>\u201cThe sandwiches will be a problem,\u201d she murmured as Emily skipped past her.</p> <p>\u201cHer bathing suit is white,\u201d Mac said. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. We used white bread.\u201d</p><p>He stayed where he was, on the bottom step of the porch, his gaze shielded by his damn mirrored lenses. She closed the door behind her so they were both outside.</p><p>\u201cTake those things off so I can know if you\u2019re mad at me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He whipped off the sunglasses and grinned.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she said. \u201cLook. You have no right to be mad at me. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Rudy came here on his own, not by my invitation. So I know the man\u2014that\u2019s not a crime. To the best of my knowledge, he\u2019s never committed a crime. If you\u2019re going to be a butthead about it all, I can\u2019t stop you, but I think it\u2019s really stupid.\u201d</p><p>He moved up one step and raised his eyebrows. \u201cDid you just call me a butthead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem angry at all. Intense, maybe, what with how he moved up another step and got a whole lot closer. Raw energy radiated from him. Sexual energy. She liked it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re mouthy and completely naive about what Rudy may or may not do in this town. But I like you.\u201d</p><p>Her toes curled into the smooth wood of the porch and her stomach clenched. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Even if you are a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Then his arms were around her and his mouth was on hers. The short, hot, intense kiss stole her breath, along with her ability to reason. He straightened and she pressed a hand to her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He grinned and touched the tip of her nose. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the good-looking one.\u201d</p><p>That she already knew.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>PERFECT BEACH WEATHER kept the crowd happy, Mac thought as he walked along the boardwalk fronting the main beach in Los Lobos. It was a little after eleven and already the parking lots were filling up and the lines for the vendors were five or six people deep. Minimal surf meant less work for the lifeguards. Even D.J. seemed to be having a good day, Mac noted as he saw his youngest deputy patrolling in the official dune buggy, stopping every now and then to chat with the sweet young things who instantly surrounded him. Maybe a bevy of beautiful women would take his mind off his need for more firepower.</p><p>Mac\u2019s teams had already patrolled the parks, and the smaller beaches. Fireworks would start promptly at nine-thirty, go for a half hour, then his men would be standing by to direct traffic so everyone got home quickly and safely. Two guys had drawn short straws, which meant they were stuck cruising the beach well into the night to take care of any problems that might arise from the folks who chose not to leave.</p><p>Mac paused at a vendor to buy a bottle of water. He twisted off the top and took a long sip.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sheriff,\u201d an older woman said as she walked by with her two children.</p><p>\u201cMorning. Having fun?\u201d</p><p>The youngest, a boy, maybe twelve, grinned. \u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He continued to greet the locals and visitors alike, knowing he was responsible for them. A few months ago, he would have cringed at the thought of taking responsibility for one more life, but now it felt right.</p><p>He eyed the crowd on the beach and wondered if Emily was having a good time. Jill had mentioned introducing her to her assistant\u2019s kids so she could play with someone her own age. He was in favor of the idea. Em could use a break from the grown-ups. He appreciated Jill being willing to\u2014</p><p>A familiar silhouette captured his attention. Mac watched as two men strolled toward him. They were both big, dark-haired and dangerous looking. Dammit all to hell, he thought grimly. He wouldn\u2019t have thought Rudy Casaccio the beach celebration type, but here he was. In shorts, no less, although Mr. Smith was dressed in a suit.</p><p>His good mood drained away as they moved toward him. Too bad getting on his nerves wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to run them in.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Kendrick,\u201d Rudy said pleasantly as he offered his hand. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>Mac grimaced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought this was your kind of party.\u201d</p><p>Rudy shook his head. \u201cNor would I, but I find everything about your little town completely charming. We had breakfast on the boardwalk earlier and the food was delicious. You have a big crowd, yet everyone is so orderly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it to stay that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Rudy smiled. \u201cMr. Smith and myself have no intention of making trouble. We\u2019re here for some much needed R and R. Besides, the day is too beautiful for anyone to think about making trouble.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and started walking. Mr. Smith trailed after him. Mac stalked off, his pleasure in the holiday ruined.</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE GONNA need a little flexibility here, kid,\u201d Jill said with mock severity. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Emily stared at her with big blue eyes as if considering the question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a holiday,\u201d Jill added, not sure if she was about to make the situation worse or better. With the bright blue sky overhead and the scent and the sound of surf, it was difficult to imagine anything bad happening today. But if Emily didn\u2019t want to cooperate, things could go downhill pretty fast.</p><p>Bev leaned close to the girl and kissed her forehead. \u201cWhen in doubt, go with your stomach.\u201d</p><p>The tension around Emily\u2019s mouth eased and her shoulders relaxed. \u201cOkay, but you won\u2019t tell anyone, right?\u201d</p><p>Jill knew what she was asking. For them not to tell her dad. She considered the question, then glanced at her aunt, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Jill said, hoping this didn\u2019t come back to bite her in the butt later. \u201cCan we just say we agree to keep the secret, or do we have to stick our selves with pins and spit?\u201d</p><p>Emily giggled. \u201cYou can just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing that boring,\u201d Bev announced.</p><p>She held out her pinkie to Jill. When the fingers were linked, Jill closed her eyes and intoned, \u201cBy the light of the sun I pledge my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the light of the moon, I am vowed,\u201d Bev said in a low, serious voice.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d they repeated together as they bounced their hands three times, then clapped their palms together.</p><p>Emily looked impressed. \u201cCan you teach me that?\u201d she asked Bev.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nothing to it. But let\u2019s eat up, first.\u201d</p><p>Jill handed over the plate she\u2019d prepared. The one that could have given Emily fits, what with the sandwich\u2014white bread\u2014the barbecue chips\u2014orange\u2014the helping of fruit salad\u2014multicolored\u2014and a couple of spoonfuls of coleslaw\u2014green and purple. The red-iced cookies had yet to put in an appearance.</p><p>Emily sat in her red shorts set and speared a grape, then chewed. Jill felt like doing the happy dance right there on the blanket. Of course, she\u2019d just made a solemn vow not to tell Mac that his daughter would eat more than one color, which made her feel kind of crappy inside.</p><p>An emotion to be dealt with later, she thought.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, ladies.\u201d</p><p>Jill turned toward the speaker and had to shield her eyes against the sun. When she was able to focus, she didn\u2019t know if she should laugh or try to bury herself under a couple of tons of sand.</p><p>Rudy Casaccio stood beside their blanket, looking very fit and dressed for fun in shorts and a polo shirt. The same couldn\u2019t be said for Mr. Smith, who hovered a few feet away and looked both uncomfortable and out of place in a dark suit.</p><p>\u201cRudy,\u201d Jill said as she scrambled to her feet. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I wouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d like this sort of thing.\u201d She motioned to the crowded beach as she spoke.</p><p>Rudy grinned. \u201cJust checking out the local color.\u201d His gaze strayed to Bev. \u201cSo far I like what I see.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s mouth dropped open. Was that her client coming on to her aunt? Was that her aunt blushing?</p><p>She was so stunned she wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Bev had always been beautiful with her gorgeous long red hair, her perfect skin and her petite but curvy figure. And Rudy wasn\u2019t half-bad. He was in his early fifties and Bev only a few years younger than that, so nothing about the situation should have grossed her out. But still...wow.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWe were just eating. Would you like to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind the company. We had a late break fast, so we\u2019re not hungry, but everything looks delicious.\u201d He settled next to Bev and smiled.</p><p>Jill stole a peek at Mr. Smith, but the large man simply hovered a few feet away from the blanket. She sank onto her knees.</p><p>\u201cShould I find Mr. Smith a chair?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Rudy chuckled. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Rudy\u2019s dark eyes brightened with humor. \u201cGood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Jill didn\u2019t want to understand Rudy\u2019s relationship with his associate, she didn\u2019t pursue the matter. Instead she offered a diet soda, then picked up her plate. Emily shifted closer.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that man?\u201d she asked in a mock whisper.</p><p>Rudy smiled at the girl. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of Jill\u2019s. My name\u2019s Rudy. Who are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmily Kendrick.\u201d</p><p>Rudy\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly as he put the relationship together. \u201cNice to meet you, Emily. Are you enjoying your holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She took a bite of her sandwich.</p><p>Bev cleared her throat. \u201cHow long have you been in town, Rudy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of days. Until her unfortunate change in circumstances, Jill was my attorney. When I learned she\u2019d moved here, I wanted to come over and see how she was doing.\u201d</p> <p>Bev\u2019s lashes fluttered. \u201cThat was so thoughtful of you. Where do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn exciting city,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but Los Lobos has certain charms.\u201d Rudy looked at Jill. \u201cSo who is this Gracie Landon I\u2019ve been hearing about?\u201d</p><p>Jill nearly choked on a bite of fruit salad. When she\u2019d swallowed, she cleared her throat. \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve heard of Gracie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There was that nice lady at the bakery, and the waitress this morning. We were talking about the history of the town and her name came up. Did Gracie really grind up a sleeping pill and put it in Riley\u2019s drink so he couldn\u2019t go on his date?\u201d</p> <p>Jill dropped her chin to her chest. \u201cGracie isn\u2019t going to like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That she\u2019s a legend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no one seems to be forgetting what she did all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>Bev laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re all admiring her guts to go after what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some circles, what she did could have landed her in jail,\u201d Jill pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cIt was true love. How old was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Bev. \u201cThe young know how to love with their whole hearts. I admire that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Bev said breathily.</p><p>\u201cShe made Riley\u2019s life miserable,\u201d Jill said. \u201cNot to mention his girlfriend\u2019s.\u201d Although she had much less compassion for Pam. The woman hadn\u2019t been very nice back in high school and time seemed to have left her much the same. Or, once a bitch, always a bitch, she thought with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI hope I get to meet her,\u201d Rudy said.</p><p>It took Jill a second to realize he meant Gracie and not Pam.</p><p>\u201cSorry, she doesn\u2019t come back to Los Lobos, ever. In fact, she\u2019s convinced her entire family that it\u2019s much more exciting to visit her in Los Angeles during the holidays. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s stepped foot in town in about fourteen years.\u201d</p><p>Rudy looked disappointed. Jill took a bite of her sandwich. How weird was it having him here? She\u2019d only ever seen Rudy in her office where he\u2019d been dressed for success and surrounded by \u201cassociates.\u201d Here, on the beach, he was almost human. Although Mr. Smith hovering in the background wasn\u2019t the most com forting of sights.</p><p>She glanced at Emily, who had been listening with interest. \u201cSo I talked to your dad,\u201d she told the girl. \u201cI have a secretary where I work and she has children. One of them is a daughter your age. I thought it might be fun to go hang with them for a while. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Jill patted her shoulder. \u201cPoor kid, stuck with all us adults. We\u2019re pretty boring, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. What a compliment. I\u2019m honored. And touched. Really.\u201d</p><p>Emily giggled and popped another strawberry into her mouth.</p><p>Jill finished up her lunch, then slathered on another coating of sunscreen. Too many years in law school and then behind a desk had robbed her of her tan. Despite her dark hair and incredibly boring brown eyes, she had fair skin that punished her by burning if she wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>Bev was still in conversation with Rudy, which freaked Jill out a little. She had the thought that it wasn\u2019t safe to leave her aunt alone with the man, which was crazy. Bev was a grown-up and this was a very public place. There were families spread out on the sand everywhere. Deputies patrolled everywhere\u2014besides, she didn\u2019t think Rudy was really a bad guy, did she?</p><p>Jill realized she didn\u2019t have an answer. Her contacts with the man had all been professional as she worked with several very legal businesses. He\u2019d always been honest and open and paid his bills on time. When Emily asked Bev for another chocolate milk, Jill leaned toward the man sitting next to her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my aunt,\u201d she said, her voice low, her gaze steady as she stared into his eyes. Although what she was searching for remained a mystery. Did she think some banner would wave through his irises saying I\u2019m really a good guy and I won\u2019t whack your aunt if she gets on my nerves?</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Rudy told her, and patted the back of her hand. \u201cI understand about family. She\u2019ll be safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about her being safe from you,\u201d she muttered, then had to change the subject when Bev finished with Emily.</p><p>Complications, she thought ten minutes later when Rudy invited Bev to go with him to get ice cream and she agreed. He stood, then held out his hand. He helped Bev to her feet as if she were a delicate flower. Worse, Bev giggled and smiled at him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the older people connecting that made her uneasy. That was kind of weird, but she thought she might be able to deal with it. But this was her aunt. And Rudy. She would never have imagined him hooking up. Bev was into serious psychic energy and staying pure\u2014sort of\u2014for her gift. Rudy was into... Jill frowned as she realized she couldn\u2019t answer that question.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Gracie?\u201d Emily asked as she polished off the last of her sandwich. \u201cThe legend one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. We were friends. We still are. She lives in Los Angeles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really liked a boy?\u201d</p><p>Like didn\u2019t begin to describe it. \u201cShe did, but he didn\u2019t like her back and that made her sad.\u201d</p><p>Emily wrinkled her nose. \u201cBoys aren\u2019t very nice. They play mean sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will change,\u201d Jill promised. At least she hoped it would for Emily. In her world, Lyle had played mean enough for two men. Why couldn\u2019t he have loved her as much as Gracie had loved Riley?</p><p>Jill reconsidered that. She didn\u2019t actually want stalker love\u2014just someone to pay attention. And kiss like Mac, she thought with a smile. Even on the run, his kisses were plenty hot. But Lyle had been nothing but a mistake. If her life had been just a little different, she wouldn\u2019t have ever married him. It was the naked thing.</p><p>\u201cReady to go meet Tina\u2019s kids?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Emily put her paper plate into the trash bag, then scrambled to her feet.</p><p>Jill made sure the blanket was anchored and asked their neighbors to keep an eye on things. Then she took Emily\u2019s hand and started off in the direction of lifeguard station number three, where Tina said her family would be encamped.</p><p>Why was life complicated by getting naked? she wondered. The first time had been with Mac and he\u2019d promptly thrown up. Now she understood why, but at the time, she\u2019d been crushed. Then there\u2019d been Evan. He\u2019d been Mac\u2019s opposite. Slight, bookish, not nearly as handsome, but gentle. He\u2019d made Jill laugh, had been tender and romantic. Practically the perfect boyfriend. They\u2019d dated for nearly eight months before deciding to take things \u201cto the next level.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d slipped off her clothes, he\u2019d taken one look at her body and had announced he was gay.</p><p>Events like that had a way of changing a woman\u2019s perspective on the world. Then three years later Lyle had come along. He\u2019d been interested in her sexually and hadn\u2019t had either an involuntary negative physical response or an epiphany leading to a major lifestyle change upon viewing her without clothes. She\u2019d been so grateful, she\u2019d decided she was in love with him.</p><p>Looking back the sequence of events was so clear, but at the time, she\u2019d thought she really loved him. Worse, she\u2019d worked hard at a marriage destined for failure. And she\u2019d cooked for him. That still made her bitter. At least she didn\u2019t have to worry about being in love with him anymore. She didn\u2019t think her heart had ever been fully engaged. Which meant picking up the pieces wasn\u2019t too difficult at all.</p><p>EMILY RUBBED her hands against her shorts. \u201cDo you think...?\u201d she asked, then stopped, not sure what to say.</p><p>Jill tugged on a strand of her hair. \u201cDo I think what? That you\u2019ll have fun? Absolutely? That they\u2019ll like you? They\u2019ll adore you. That Tina will start to think I\u2019m actually a person? That is less likely.\u201d</p><p>Emily laughed. Being around Jill always made her feel good.</p><p>\u201cYou two. In the shorts. Stop right there and put your hands up.\u201d</p><p>Emily spun toward the sound of her dad\u2019s voice and saw him jogging up toward them. For a second she felt happy and good and wanted to run to meet him. Then she remembered that she was mad and her insides got all scrunchy.</p><p>\u201cMac.\u201d Jill put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have any time to be arrested today. It\u2019s going to have to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. I have handcuffs right here.\u201d</p><p>Jill grinned. \u201cInteresting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>Her dad held out his hand. Emily saw a tiny little rhino sitting on his palm.</p><p>\u201cIt was in one of those grab machines. It cost me three bucks, but I got it. I figured Elvis could use a friend.\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t know what to do. She wanted to take the toy and thank her dad, but something inside of her was afraid. She looked from him to the rhino and back, then watched as his smile began to fade. Her tummy tightened and her face got all hot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Jill said, taking the tiny stuffed animal from him. She held it up and started to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s too sweet for words.\u201d She pulled Emily close and hugged her. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love it?\u201d</p><p>Emily felt the scary tightness start to fade. She smiled a little, then giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than cute. Charming beyond words.\u201d Jill handed the rhino to her. \u201cYour dad is pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>Emily glanced at her dad. He looked pleased. She tucked the baby rhino into her pocket and reached for her dad\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>WEARY BUT SATISFIED, Mac made his way to his patrol car a little past midnight. The day had gone well. At last count there\u2019d been nearly a dozen arrests, which was right in line for the holiday. Considering the crowds, he figured they\u2019d gotten off lucky. There hadn\u2019t been any fights and the only injuries had been minor. That was the good news. The bad news was summer had just started. There would be a lot more busy days, especially for the pier centennial celebration. But for now, he was pleased.</p><p>Even Emily had had a good time. Bev had taken her home shortly after the fireworks and had promised to put her to bed, then stick around to baby-sit. Mac knew whatever he paid the woman wasn\u2019t close to enough.</p><p>The night was cool and clear. By the ocean, the temperature dropped with the sun, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about too many stragglers on the beach. D.J. had volunteered to make the last run of the evening, leaving Mac free to head home.</p><p>As he approached his patrol car, he saw someone sit ting on the hood. He could only think of one person likely to do that and his blood quickened at the thought of Jill.</p><p>She smiled as he approached. \u201cI thought maybe I could convince you to give me a ride home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the 545?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left it in the beach parking lot. I\u2019m still hoping for a dent or a scratch or something, but that stupid car must be protected by fairies or Gypsies. There\u2019s nothing. Not a even a hint of body damage. I have to tell you, that\u2019s really pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>She shifted as she spoke and her long hair swayed with the movement. Too much heat and humidity had vanquished her attempts to straighten it and the loose curls jutted out in all directions. She wasn\u2019t wearing makeup, her shirt had a stain on it and she\u2019d dropped her sandals on the asphalt by his tire. She looked sexy as hell.</p> <p>He stepped close, sliding between her bare thighs, and settled his hands on her hips. His crotch pressed against hers and it didn\u2019t take more than a second or two for him to react to the contact. Her brown eyes crinkled with amusement.</p><p>\u201cNo one can ever accuse you of being subtle, Mac, can they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my style,\u201d he murmured, before slipping one hand under her mass of hair to cup her neck while he dropped his mouth to hers.</p><p>She put her arms around his neck as she kissed him back. They didn\u2019t bother with gentle introductions, instead they eased right into deep, soul-stirring kisses that made every part of him hard.</p><p>She smelled of sun and sand and suntan lotion; she tasted of chocolate and wine. Their tongues circled and stroked and brushed and aroused. She raised her legs and wrapped them around his hips, holding him in place.</p> <p>He pulled back and rubbed his thumb against her swollen mouth. \u201cLiquor is illegal on the beach and at the park. I may have to run you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can taste the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. All right. We smuggled a bottle in. So charge me.\u201d She grinned, then bit his thumb. \u201cWill there be handcuffs involved? You mentioned them before and now I have a very particular image I can\u2019t seem to shake.\u201d</p><p>She was teasing, but now he pictured it as well. Her at his mercy. Naked. Him doing everything in his power to make her moan, writhe and scream...while coming, of course.</p><p>\u201cMy house is about ten minutes from here,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>She rubbed her hands up and down his chest. \u201cI actually know that, and while you\u2019re tempting me, this is where I get to be the sensible one and point out you have an eight-year-old daughter at your place or mine. I\u2019m not sure where Bev took her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a minor problem.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced I could get naked with my aunt in the house.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure, either.</p><p>Just then a car turned the corner. Jill dropped her legs and he stepped back just in time for Wilma to pull up alongside of him. She rolled down the passenger window. \u201cWe did good today. The judge would be proud.\u201d</p><p>Mac mentally winced at the comment. Judge Strathern, Jill\u2019s father, was pretty much the last person he wanted to think about right now. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p> <p>He watched her drive down the street. When she\u2019d turned again, he looked at Jill. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHard to get wild in this town,\u201d she said as she jumped to the ground, then collected her sandals. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready for my ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He unlocked the car.</p><p>Jill studied him. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about my father, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>She muttered something that sounded very much like \u201cI\u2019m never going to have sex again, I just know it\u201d as she walked around to the passenger side and slumped into the seat.</p><p>\u201cI owe him,\u201d Mac reminded her. He got into the car and put on his seat belt. \u201cHe saved my ass more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. When you were a kid, and just recently. It\u2019s who he is and what he does. Do you really think he\u2019s worried that you\u2019re going to sleep with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my father. Trust me, he doesn\u2019t want to think about me being with anyone. It\u2019s not about your penis\u2014he pretty much hates them all.\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cThat puts it in perspective.\u201d He decided, for the sake of peace between them, to change the subject. \u201cEmily had a good time today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, and I\u2019m glad. Tina\u2019s kids were great. Her daughter, Ashley, introduced her to several girls her own age and they all had a blast together. Tina, my assistant who hates me, even thawed a little. I think it was seeing me in the company of a child who obviously likes me. If Emily thinks I\u2019m okay, I can\u2019t be all bad. At least that\u2019s my theory.\u201d</p><p>He navigated the quiet streets of the town. \u201cI\u2019m sure Tina doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. She\u2019s bubbling over with love.\u201d Jill rested her head against the window and sighed. \u201cRelationships are so complicated. Even the ones that aren\u2019t all that personal. So are you missing your ex-wife much?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and did his best not to smile. \u201cThat was subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s late, I was out in the sun all day and I had wine. I can\u2019t do subtle. So, do you miss her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s over between us. She\u2019s seeing some guy and I really don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jill straightened. \u201cThanks for sharing. Not that I was interested or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving in a few weeks, so what\u2019s the point of getting involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, we\u2019re both dealing with bad marriages.\u201d She stared out the windshield. \u201cWhy would we want to jump into something else? I know I\u2019m not eager to trust a man again after what Lyle did. Why did your marriage break up? I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>He was fairly sure he hadn\u2019t told her but didn\u2019t mind giving her the information. \u201cI disconnected. Carly and I got married because she got pregnant. We weren\u2019t ever really in love, but we tried to make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jill said, as if she\u2019d known it all along. \u201cBut you love Emily a lot. That\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my best girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not that you\u2019re incapable of loving someone.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up in front of his house and put the car in Park, then turned to look at her. \u201cWhat exactly do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a bright smile. \u201cNothing at all. I\u2019m making idle chitchat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cRight. That\u2019s why I\u2019m hard, you\u2019re wet and we both wish we could be alone for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re friends who want to have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>JILL ARRIVED at her law office bright and early on the morning after the Fourth. She was only a little sunburned, which was great considering how long she\u2019d been at the beach. The one truly perfect sunscreen she\u2019d ever found was staying indoors and, as she hadn\u2019t had a cabana to carry with her the previous day, she figured a slight burn was a victory.</p><p>She stuck her key into the lock and was stunned to find the door was open. Had she forgotten to lock it when she\u2019d left? Had she...</p><p>The door swung open and she saw Tina sitting at her desk, making notations in files.</p><p>Jill glanced from her watch, which read 8:26 a.m., to the woman in question.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said as she entered, not sure how to ask what Tina was doing here. Tina rarely arrived before nine-thirty.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Tina smiled at her. \u201cThanks for bringing Emily by yesterday. She\u2019s a great little kid. Ashley had so much fun with her that she keeps asking when we can get together again.\u201d</p><p>Jill wanted to turn around and see who was standing behind her because that had to be the reason Tina was being nice to her.</p><p>\u201cEmily had a good time, too,\u201d she said instead. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>The two women stared at each other while Jill expected to hear scary movie music start at any second.</p><p>Okay, Jill thought as she smiled brightly. Too weird for me. She walked into her office. Tina followed her.</p><p>\u201cThere was a message from Mr. Harrison wanting an update on his fence case.\u201d</p><p>Jill nodded, but only because she was too shocked to speak. Tina was wearing a dress. Sure, it was a sleeve less summer sundress and she had on sandals and no stockings, but it was a real, live, honest-to-God dress.</p><p>Jill took the paper Tina offered. \u201cI hate to have to call him back. He\u2019s not going to like what I have to say. Any thing else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A message was left just before I got in, from a Ms. Sullivan. She mentioned a law firm in Los Angeles and how they\u2019d like to see you on Thursday.\u201d Tina frowned. \u201cAre you doing some work for them?\u201d</p><p>Jill grabbed the message and stared at it, then grinned. \u201cNo. This is about a job interview. Wow. That was fast. My r\u00e9sum\u00e9 hasn\u2019t been out that long. Of course I\u2019m pretty much what they want, which is great.\u201d L.A., huh? She could do the drive in about three hours. \u201cDid she give a time?\u201d</p><p>Tina\u2019s warm, friendly expression fell like a punctured balloon. Her eyes narrowed, her arms folded across her chest and she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for a job?\u201d she asked, sounding both insulted and incredulous. \u201cYou work here.\u201d</p><p>Jill wanted to hold up her hands in a T to call a timeout. \u201cThis was always meant to be temporary. I thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudge Strathern said you were moving back to town when he phoned me. I thought it was permanent.\u201d</p><p>Tina turned on her heel and stomped out of the office. Their common door slammed behind her.</p><p>Jill sank onto her seat. \u201cWhat was up with that?\u201d she asked aloud.</p><p>Could Tina actually be angry because she wasn\u2019t staying in Los Lobos? But Tina didn\u2019t like her. Okay, maybe having Emily around had made her assistant/secretary/receptionist feel slightly more friendly, but that wasn\u2019t an actual relationship. What did Tina care if she moved on?</p><p>Was it about keeping her job? Jill tried to decide if she should offer to write the woman a recommendation, al though to be honest, she wasn\u2019t sure what she would say.</p><p>Tina has a lively personality. Although she hates to follow orders and rarely works more than two or three hours in a row, she would be a delightful addition to any office situation.</p><p>Hmm, maybe not.</p><p>Determined not to let the other woman\u2019s reaction spoil the glory of the moment, Jill called Ms. Sullivan and made an appointment for Thursday at eleven in the morning. She would take the 545 and see if the locals could ding up the car.</p><p>Next, she called Mr. Harrison.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jill Strathern,\u201d she said when the old man picked up the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve researched the matter in question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fence, girly.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cYes, I know. If the construction had been more recent, we might have had a chance, but with the fence having been there over a hundred years, there\u2019s very little we can do about getting it torn down. My suggestion is that I contact your neighbors and work out a fair market price for the land on their side of the fence. You had said your major concern was not leaving the problem to be dealt with after you were gone and this would solve that.\u201d</p><p>She paused, waiting for Mr. Harrison to respond. There was only silence, followed by a click and then dial tone.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said into the empty room as she hung up the phone.</p><p>While her day was slowly sliding into the toilet, she might as well go ahead and flush the damn thing. She stood and walked to the door Tina had slammed.</p><p>When she opened it, she waited until Tina looked up and scowled at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the other woman demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be gone on Thursday. Would you please make sure I don\u2019t have any appointments and if I do, reschedule them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever. I have to go in a few minutes. Something with one of my kids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. If you would please take care of my calendar first, I would appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Jill had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t see the woman again for the rest of the day.</p><p>She returned to her office, where she felt the fish eyes following her every move. When she reached her desk, she spun in a circle and glared right back.</p><p>\u201cI never said I was staying, so don\u2019t try to say I did. I\u2019m leaving Los Lobos. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>MAC WOULD RATHER have been almost anywhere than the Business Leaders of Los Lobos Committee for the Preservation of the Pier meeting\u2014except maybe another one-on-one with Hollis. Jill had an appointment she couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014reschedule so he didn\u2019t have any kind of distraction.</p> <p>He sat in the back of the community center conference room and scribbled notes from time to time while Mayor Franklin Yardley turned what should have been a ten-minute update into nearly an hour of rambling.</p><p>\u201cNow that the Fourth of July is over,\u201d the mayor in toned, \u201cwe can all concentrate on this historic and wonderful event.\u201d</p><p>He outlined the activities for the day, which culminated in a big fireworks show over the pier itself. Mac briefly wondered what wayward sparks would do to a hundred-year-old pier, then told himself not to sweat the details. His joy was to keep the good citizens and various visitors safe from any and all evils.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re expecting crowds at least fifty-percent bigger than we had here over the weekend,\u201d Franklin said from his place at the podium. His silver hair gleamed in the overhead light and there was a fresh coat of tan on his leathery skin.</p><p>\u201cNo one in this town has experience with an event of that magnitude.\u201d</p><p>Mac stifled a yawn. If they were using the beach as the main venue and the mayor\u2019s numbers were right, parking was going to be a bigger problem than crowd control. They could use the old drive-in on the edge of town, he thought, as he scribbled a few more notes. Then get folks to the beach using school buses. He\u2019d have to get a cost estimate. The big expense wasn\u2019t the buses themselves. Rather, it was the insurance they would need. Still it would solve a lot of problems with congestion and\u2014</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve invited in an expert,\u201d Franklin said, sounding way too pleased for Mac\u2019s peace of mind.</p><p>He glanced up just as the side door opened and a familiar if unwelcome man walked into the conference room.</p><p>Mac sat up in his chair and glared at both the newcomer and the mayor. What the hell was going on?</p><p>Franklin Yardley beamed at the committee members. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to introduce Mr. Rudy Casaccio. He\u2019s handled events much larger than ours and has graciously offered to act as a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Sure he had, Mac thought as he swore under his breath. The mayor had accepted, right after getting a nice fat, juicy contribution for his reelection campaign.</p><p>Rudy stood beside the mayor and smiled at the small crowd. He looked slick, Mac admitted. Great suit, easy stance. He was a man used to being in charge. Mac\u2019s gaze drifted to the ever-present Mr. Smith, who hovered just inside the room. A snap to be big man on campus when you\u2019re always protected by the big guns.</p><p>The meeting continued. Rudy gave a few words of advice, then offered to meet with the business leaders individually to discuss their needs.</p><p>By the time everyone got up to leave, Mac had about ground his teeth to stubs. He pushed through the crowd around Rudy and made his way to Franklin.</p> <p>After grabbing the other man by the arm and dragging him into the corner, Mac got close enough to get his attention, then leaned in for good measure.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re getting into?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Yardley\u2019s brown eyes narrowed. \u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m doing, Sheriff, and I\u2019d advise you to listen and learn. Rudy Casaccio can do things for this town that the residents have never dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Gambling at the lodge, drugs in the high school. It\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Casaccio is a reputable businessman. He wants to help our town.\u201d</p><p>Which Mac read as helping Franklin himself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t quite get it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would someone like Rudy Casaccio want to help our little town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man of vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. How much did he contribute to your reelection campaign?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>The mayor bristled. \u201cMaybe you should worry less about me retaining office. You have an election of your own coming up in a few months. If you don\u2019t have my endorsement, you don\u2019t have a prayer.\u201d</p><p>Mac knew he was right, but he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cI suppose he gave money to the pier restoration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Twenty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cGet with the program,\u201d Franklin told him. \u201cWe\u2019re all making Mr. Casaccio feel welcome. You\u2019ve only been here a short time, but everyone thinks you\u2019re doing a fine job. It would be a shame to lose that support be cause you have something personal and unfounded against one of our leading citizens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, he\u2019s not a resident.\u201d</p><p>The mayor shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping that will change. And if you make trouble, there may only be room for one of you.\u201d</p><p>JILL SMILED at the young woman sitting across from her. She looked to be in her early twenties and more than a couple of months\u2019 pregnant. Kim Murphy met her gaze, offered a shy smile in return, then ducked her head.</p><p>\u201cI was kind of surprised to get your call,\u201d the young woman said in a soft voice. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my grandmother in years. I didn\u2019t think she still remembered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently she did.\u201d</p><p>Kim bit her lower lip and gave Jill a wary glance. \u201cI wanted to see her more, of course. But I...I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jill wondered why. \u201cHad she been ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s just things are...complicated.\u201d She managed another one of those almost-smiles and re turned her attention to her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s been six years since I\u2019ve seen her. Not since the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Jill studied the young woman. Her long platinum-blond hair hung limply to her shoulders. Her arms were pale and painfully thin. The too-large maternity dress surrounded her like a very unattractive tent. Oh, well, what did she know about pregnancy fashions? Maybe this was the latest thing.</p><p>She pulled papers out of a folder and raised her eye brows when she saw Kim\u2019s birth date. \u201cYou\u2019ve been married for six years. Gee, you must have gotten hitched the day after you turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Kim raised her face a few inches and nodded. \u201cThree days, actually. Andy and I started dating when I was just fourteen. He was older, of course, but he waited for me.\u201d</p><p>She said that as if it were a good thing. Jill tried not to wrinkle her nose or say anything sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d she managed instead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wonderful.\u201d This time Kim\u2019s smile reached her shadowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cNice to know there are still some good guys out there.\u201d Unlike Lyle, the lying weasel rat bastard dog. \u201cOkay, this is all going to be very simple. Your grandmother left you eight thousand dollars. You get the en tire amount. My fee is being paid out of the rest of the estate. It will take a couple of weeks to process every thing. I\u2019ll have some paperwork for you to sign, then I\u2019ll hand over the money. In the meantime you\u2019ll want to think about what you want to do with the inheritance.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s delicate blond eyebrows drew together. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suggesting a separate account for your inheritance. A money market, savings.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou could start a college fund.\u201d</p><p>Kim pressed a hand to her stomach. \u201cOh. No, thank you. Andy wants to buy a new truck.\u201d</p><p>So like a man, Jill thought irritably. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t Andy\u2019s money,\u201d she said gently. \u201cCalifornia is a community-property state, which means what the couple earns together is owned by both of them. However, an inheritance\u2014money, property, whatever, only belongs to the person mentioned in the will. In this case, you. If you keep the money in a separate account and don\u2019t commingle it with say Andy\u2019s paycheck, it\u2019s all yours. Even the interest.\u201d</p><p>Kim\u2019s expression tightened until she looked like a rabbit facing the big bad wolf. She leaned back in her chair and shook her head back and forth.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t want to do that. No. It\u2019s not right. Andy wants a truck.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t like the tremor in Kim\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Kim swallowed. \u201cAre we nearly done, because I have to go. I have an appointment.\u201d She looked ready to bolt.</p><p>\u201cSure. Just give me a second.\u201d</p><p>Jill handed her several papers to sign. As Kim leaned over the desk, her dress slipped off one shoulder. Jill stared at a dark, ugly bruise. It looked to be in the shape of a large hand.</p><p>She swore silently. Please God, don\u2019t let this poor woman be battered, she thought grimly. Not here. Los Lobos might not be her idea of a good time, but she hated to think of really horrible things happening here.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Kim asked as she straightened and her dress slipped back into place.</p><p>Jill had a couple dozen questions that she knew she wasn\u2019t going to ask. Not yet. She knew nothing about what was really happening. Maybe she was imagining Kim\u2019s fear and the bruise had nothing to do with her husband. Maybe not. But she would find out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it for now.\u201d Jill rose. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I receive the check. Once we finalize the paperwork, you\u2019re free to take it over to your bank.\u201d</p><p>Kim still looked wary. She said goodbye and hurried from the room.</p><p>Jill followed slowly, waiting until she was gone before heading for Tina\u2019s desk. It was Wednesday and her assistant/secretary/receptionist still hadn\u2019t recovered from her snit, but Jill wasn\u2019t willing to be put off by that.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Kim Murphy?\u201d she asked from the doorway.</p><p>Tina didn\u2019t look up. \u201cA little. She and Dave are second cousins, I think. We don\u2019t hang with them much.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if I should get involved in something or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother when you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>Jill sighed. As always, Tina made her feel special. \u201cWhat do you know about their marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer and Andy? They keep to themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2019s like?\u201d</p><p>Tina frowned. \u201cBig guy. Quiet unless you piss him off. He works construction.\u201d</p><p>Great. A large, physically strong man with access to power tools and a possible temper.</p><p>\u201cWhy all the questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious. I have to go out for a while. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Tina sank back into her seat. \u201cI won\u2019t be here then.\u201d</p><p>Why was she not surprised?</p><p>JILL WALKED to the sheriff\u2019s office, which was about six blocks away. As she crossed the street, she made a mental note to pick up the car that afternoon so she could have it for her drive to Los Angeles in the morning.</p><p>Now that there was the possibility of leaving town, she found herself taken by the picturesque qualities of the restored downtown and the way everyone smiled in greeting.</p><p>She pushed open one of the two double doors of the sheriff\u2019s office and crossed to the counter.</p><p>The main reception area was big, with vinyl flooring, a bulletin board with Wanted posters and ads for garage sales. A long waist-high counter separated the visitors from those in charge, while a mini swinging door the same height offered entrance to the inner sanctum. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A tiny gray-haired woman manned the counter. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked, then narrowed her eyes. \u201cWait. I know you. Jill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you here on legal business?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his office,\u201d the woman said with a jerk of her head. \u201cGo on back. He\u2019s on the phone, but he won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Jill pushed through the swinging half-door and walked toward the glass offices in the rear. As she walked around several desks, she saw Mac hanging up the phone. He didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d she asked as she walked through the open door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? No. Nothing about work. That was Bev on the phone. Hollis Bass stopped by for the surprise visit he promised. The little sneak.\u201d</p><p>Jill thought about pointing out that Hollis was only doing his job. At the same time she wanted to ask why Mac was under such close supervision with his daughter. She\u2019d wondered, of course, but hadn\u2019t wanted to pry. Based on Mac\u2019s annoyance, this wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>\u201cAre you going over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He picked up a pen, then put it down. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d He glanced at the clock. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be more than a half hour, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Sorry.\u201d He looked at her, then waved at a chair. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere on official business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a client come in today. Kim Murphy. Her husband\u2019s name is Andy. She\u2019s twenty-four, seriously pregnant. You know anything about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he might be beating her.\u201d</p><p>Mac swore. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw a bruise on her shoulder. It looked like a hand. I don\u2019t know. She was scared and nervous. Maybe I\u2019m crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d He pulled a pad toward him just as the phone rang. \u201cKendrick.\u201d</p><p>He listened for a couple of seconds. \u201cThat is not happening!\u201d Pause. \u201cI know. You\u2019re right. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>His grip on the phone tightened. \u201cThanks. Yeah. Okay. You, too.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and stared at her. \u201cThat was Bev again. Hollis just invited himself to lunch. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d He crossed to the glass door and banged his fist against it. \u201cWhat if Em is in one of her moods? What if she gets picky about her food? Hollis could decide I\u2019m not doing a good enough job.\u201d</p><p>Jill wanted to tell him it would be fine, but she didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He glanced at the pad of paper. \u201cYeah, I do. Let\u2019s pick this up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He stalked out of the office. Jill followed more slowly. When she reached the counter, she stopped.</p><p>\u201cWilma, you\u2019ve lived here a long time, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure have,\u201d the petite woman said. \u201cSince the earth\u2019s crust cooled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Andy Murphy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know of him.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy has a short fuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he take that temper out on his wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever seen anything, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>Jill nodded. \u201cI understand you can\u2019t accuse him of anything. Have there been any domestic violence complaints at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if you ask me, there should have been.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>MAC DROVE through town until he reached Bev\u2019s house. An unfamiliar eight-year-old Corolla had parked in the driveway.</p><p>Hollis, he thought grimly, and wished he could have stalked inside and thrown the kid out. Maybe tell him to never dare talk to Emily again. Except Mac knew that, however misguided, Hollis had Emily\u2019s best interests at heart. He parked in front of his own house and walked inside. After throwing a frozen entr\u00e9e into the micro wave, he paced back and forth in the kitchen until the timer beeped. He used a dish towel for a hot pad and ate standing up, all the while watching out the side window until Hollis finally left. Then he headed over to Bev\u2019s house and banged on the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s open,\u201d she called.</p><p>Mac walked inside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the family room,\u201d Bev yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou should lock the front door,\u201d he said as he moved down the hallway. \u201cIt could have been anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I knew it was you,\u201d she said as he entered the warm but messy family room.</p><p>Stacks of books sat on several of the tabletops, along with magazines and coloring books. DVDs and videos filled a small bookcase. A large Oriental carpet covered most of the hardwood floor. There were plants, sun-catchers and cut-open rocks filled with purple crystals scattered around.</p><p>In the center of it all sat Bev and Emily playing Disney Monopoly. They both looked up and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Bev said. \u201cWant to join us? We just started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be Baboo,\u201d Emily said as she held out the small pewter piece. \u201cI\u2019m Snow White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Mac said as he shoved his hands into his slacks\u2019 front pockets and felt more than a little foolish. \u201cI just wanted to drop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Bev\u2019s green eyes were knowing. She patted Em\u2019s arm, then stood. \u201cLet me give your father a couple of messages,\u201d she told his daughter. \u201cGive me two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lamb\u2019s tail?\u201d Emily burst out laughing. She rolled onto her side and continued giggling. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lamb\u2019s tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could surprise you yet,\u201d Bev said as she walked to Mac, then led him into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d she said as soon as the door closed be hind them.</p><p>\u201cHe stayed for lunch.\u201d Mac tried to keep the accusation out of his voice but wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>Bev shook her long red hair, then pulled a scrunchy from her pocket and fastened her hair into a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cIt was noon, we were hungry. Should I have thrown him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her steady gaze never left his face. He sighed and leaned against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. Better to keep your enemies close,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOr not make them enemies at all. I know Hollis is a threat to you, but you don\u2019t have to be adversaries in this. I think he\u2019s willing to meet you more than halfway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just as soon as I get a different job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHollis believes that cops make bad fathers.\u201d</p><p>Bev pressed her lips together. \u201cThat\u2019s completely stupid. I like him a lot less now. Still, the visit is over and it went well. He talked to Emily. Asked her about school and her friends and life here. You barely came up at all.\u201d She squeezed his arm. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to set you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as he\u2019s in a position to take my daughter from me, that\u2019s exactly who he is.\u201d</p><p>Bev nodded. \u201cI see your point. What happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. I guess he files a report and I go back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, my sense of things is this will all work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this you getting a message from the beyond? Be cause if they\u2019re giving out information, you want to go ahead and ask about some lotto numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy gift doesn\u2019t work like that and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cToo bad. At least then it would be practical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plenty practical now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d He bent over and kissed her cheek. \u201cThanks, Bev. For everything.\u201d</p><p>She waved him off. \u201cGo say goodbye to your daughter.\u201d</p><p>He did as she suggested, then returned to his car and drove into town. He had one more stop to make before returning to the office.</p><p>The front door of Dixon and Son was unlocked. Mac stepped inside the fish emporium but Tina wasn\u2019t at her desk.</p><p>\u201cYou back there?\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cYes. Mac? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh.\u201d He walked through the reception area into Jill\u2019s office. She sat behind her desk, a large law book open in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI came to apologize for running out on you,\u201d he said as he pulled out the chair by the netting and sat down. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get Hollis out of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d She closed the book. \u201cReally, you don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cut me any slack,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cYou were trying to tell me about a guy beating up his wife. That should have had my full attention.\u201d</p><p>Jill raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou sound serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. This town is important to me. I\u2019m still figuring out how to care about it and Em, and keep everybody happy.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cEverybody except maybe the pier committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have they done to annoy you?\u201d</p><p>He thought about Rudy Casaccio in the meeting and felt his temper flare. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on that. Just tell me what\u2019s going on with your client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cKim came in to see me about a will. Obviously I can\u2019t go into details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Attorney-client privilege. What can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she was young and scared and acting as if her husband beat the crap out of her on a regular basis.\u201d Jill shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m jumping to conclusions. She was skittish.\u201d She hesitated, as if she wanted to share something of her conversation with Kim but couldn\u2019t. \u201cMy impression was that if she had anything of her own\u2014anything he couldn\u2019t touch\u2014that there would be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned bruises.\u201d He pulled a pad out of his shirt pocket and started taking notes.</p><p>\u201cOn her shoulder. It was big and in the shape of a man\u2019s hand. Maybe I\u2019m overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. \u201cBe careful. If he\u2019s beating her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m the cop here, right? I know how to do this.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re right. I worry because I\u2019m good at it. Everyone needs a skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a cruiser and have someone talk to the neighbors. Maybe I\u2019ll send Wilma to talk to her. Everyone seems to open up to Wilma. But if Kim won\u2019t file a complaint then there\u2019s nothing we can do unless we catch him in the act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cThat\u2019s why I never went into family law. Too many ambiguities and way too much pain. Give me a cold, faceless corporation any day.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she meant, but he also knew she was whistling in the dark. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape people,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cWant to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t. Want a fish instead? I\u2019m thinking of giving away a select few. You could have your pick.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around at the array covering the walls. \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m not into fish or antlers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either, but look where I ended up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN you have dinner plans?\u201d Jill asked as she watched Bev try on her third dress in as many minutes.</p><p>Her aunt stood in front of the full-length mirror and turned to look at her back. \u201cDoes this make my butt look big?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jill glanced down, then shook her head. \u201cYou look great, but you\u2019re not answering my question.\u201d</p><p>Bev stared at her in the mirror. \u201cI would think you\u2019re bright enough to grasp it all at once. Rudy invited me to dinner, I said yes and now we\u2019re going out.\u201d</p><p>Jill heard the words, but she couldn\u2019t believe them. \u201cThis is like a date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTry not to sound so incredulous. I\u2019m still on the front side of fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re a beautiful, vital woman, but a date?\u201d With Rudy? \u201cWhat do you really know about him?\u201d she asked, mindful of a very interested Emily sitting cross-legged on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s a charming man who knows how to make a woman feel like a goddess.\u201d</p><p>A goddess? Jill couldn\u2019t remember ever feeling like that. She ignored the spurt of envy that cut through her.</p><p>\u201cAside from that,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t date. Because of your gift.\u201d</p> <p>As a relative nonbeliever, she knew it was low for her to throw that in her aunt\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t have many other options.</p><p>\u201cDating is allowed,\u201d Bev said primly. \u201cYes, this is the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one\u201d turned out to be a black sleeveless dress that fell to Bev\u2019s ankles. Huge red-orange roses swirled up the side of the dress and draped across her shoulders. With her flame-colored hair pinned loosely on her head, red-and-black dangling earrings nearly brushing her shoulders and her skin practically glowing with excitement, she looked sensual, beautiful and very much like a goddess.</p><p>\u201cI hope I have a lot of your gene pool,\u201d Jill said by way of surrender.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Bev said with a smile. She twirled one more time, then paused in front of Emily. \u201cDo you approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You look as pretty as my mommy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you. High praise, indeed. All right. I\u2019m off.\u201d Bev grabbed a small black handbag and headed for the stairs.</p><p>Jill trailed after her. \u201cHe\u2019s not picking you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would be able to get you at the office and ask you to come home early. I thought I might have to drop off Emily, and I didn\u2019t think either you or Mac would want her in the car with Rudy. Ta-ta.\u201d</p><p>Jill heard her footsteps on the hardwood floor, then the sound of the back door closing.</p><p>\u201cI thought life would be simpler here,\u201d she said, and headed back for Bev\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>\u201cShe abandoned us,\u201d she told Emily, who giggled. \u201cSo what are our plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to eat dinner,\u201d Emily informed her.</p><p>\u201cWant to go out?\u201d</p> <p>Emily nodded vigorously. \u201cMaybe to a diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. The one I\u2019m thinking of has yummy milk shakes. We can take the car and park it downtown, then walk home.\u201d Because a few days in the beach parking lot had done absolutely nothing to get Lyle\u2019s car dented and she was really starting to get annoyed by the whole thing.</p><p>Jill changed out of her suit into shorts and a T-shirt. Then she and Emily left for a really greasy and fattening dinner.</p><p>\u201cI heard Mr. Bass stopped by today,\u201d she said as she drove to the center of town.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. He\u2019s a social worker and he said he takes care of kids. I told him I didn\u2019t need anyone to take care of me. I have my mom and dad and you and Bev.\u201d</p><p>Jill liked being included in the list. \u201cI\u2019m glad you have a lot of people to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Jill was about to say something else when she spotted a familiar address. She recognized it from the paperwork she\u2019d been filling out that afternoon, what with Mr. Harrison insisting on continuing the lawsuit.</p><p>\u201cI need to stop here for a second,\u201d she said as she pulled to the side of the road and parked.</p><p>Two nearly identical houses stood about sixty feet apart. Both were old Victorians with decorative trim and gables and fussy railings. Not Jill\u2019s thing, but she knew they were popular. Big trees shaded large yards and, between the two houses, stood a massive stone fence. As the fence was perfectly centered between the buildings, she could see why it had been built there. Too bad no one checked the deeds first.</p><p>She saw a man moving a sprinkler to another part of the lawn of the house on the right. Impulsively she climbed out of the car and waited for Emily to join her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that man?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cJuan Reyes,\u201d Jill said.</p><p>\u201cIs he a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Jill knew she was flirting with danger by speaking with Mr. Reyes, but she had to know about the people she might be suing on Mr. Harrison\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d she called.</p><p>Juan waved. \u201cEvening.\u201d He was of medium height and handsome, maybe thirty.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful house,\u201d Jill said. \u201cOne of a pair.\u201d</p><p>Juan laughed. \u201cThanks. My wife and I fell in love with it about five years ago. We could never have afforded it on our own. We bought it with my mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? She lives with you?\u201d</p><p>Juan grinned. \u201cYeah, I know what you\u2019re thinking, but she\u2019s a really great lady. I like having her around.\u201d</p><p>Jill was impressed. She loved her father, but if they had to share a house, she would slowly go crazy. Or maybe not so slowly.</p><p>\u201cI know your neighbor,\u201d she said, pointing to Mr. Harrison\u2019s house.</p><p>Juan\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cHe\u2019s not happy having us living next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. He says the fence is too far on to his land. But it\u2019s a stone fence that has been there for years. We can\u2019t afford to move it. I offered to take out a second mort gage on our house and buy the land from him, but he refuses.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and a pretty dark-haired woman called out. \u201cJuan, invite the company inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re not company,\u201d Jill said quickly.</p><p>As she spoke, she inhaled the most delicious scent in the world. Emily tugged on her hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat here,\u201d she said in a mock whisper.</p><p>\u201cMy mother-in-law is an amazing cook,\u201d Juan said. \u201cWould you like to come inside and have a sample?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We have dinner plans already.\u201d She looked at the other house. It was dark and closed, except for a single light at the back.</p><p>\u201cDoes he live here all alone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. He has no family. I think it\u2019s sad that he only has energy to be angry about the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you asked him to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Juan stared at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your mother-in-law\u2019s cooking is as good as you say and Mr. Harrison is alone and lonely, a family meal might go a long way to helping with negotiations.\u201d</p><p>She could see Juan weighing her suggestion. She was sure his neighbor had made his life hell and that Juan didn\u2019t want the crotchety old man in his house, but if it helped...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to my wife,\u201d Juan said. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Jill winced. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take this personally, but I\u2019m Jill Strathern, Mr. Harrison\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>Juan took a step back as his expression hardened. \u201cAre you trying to trick me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I just hate to see the two of you at odds over the fence. If you could be friends instead of enemies, neither of you would need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very nice,\u201d Emily said loyally.</p><p>Juan smiled at her. \u201cThank you for telling me. Then it must be true.\u201d He looked at Jill. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my wife,\u201d he repeated, then hesitated. \u201cIf there\u2019s no lawsuit, then there\u2019s no money for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, I would be delighted to be fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?\u201d Jill asked as Emily continued to roll curlers into her hair.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I saw it on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I already have curly hair. I\u2019m not sure curlers...\u201d</p><p>Emily walked around in front of the chair and raised her eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m in charge,\u201d she said with a certainty that, under other circumstances, would have made Jill laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Emily returned to her task, first brushing out a strand of hair, then rolling it in the curler. Jill was grateful that the humidity was low and her hair had stayed straight. If it frizzed, she might have to cut the curlers out.</p><p>\u201cI like your hair,\u201d Emily said, her small hands tickling as she brushed against Jill\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty and long. My mommy\u2019s hair is short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike yours?\u201d Jill asked.</p><p>\u201cSort of. Hers is darker.\u201d</p><p>The curse of getting older, or so Gracie complained. Natural blond hair got darker. Jill\u2019s had stayed pretty much the same brown color, which was probably the curse of being boring.</p><p>Emily tugged as she rolled up another strand and Jill tried not to wince. \u201cWe have pie to eat,\u201d she said by way of a bribe.</p><p>\u201cCan we eat it during the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jill said in defeat, as they\u2019d already arranged to watch the movie after playing beauty salon. She figured she might as well resign herself to a serious trim later in the week and relax.</p><p>\u201cDinner was good,\u201d Emily said. \u201cI liked my hamburger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, those folks down at Treats \u2019n Eats know how to make a good burger.\u201d She wondered about stating the obvious, then decided to go for it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to mind that your food didn\u2019t match your clothes. Does that mean you\u2019re not doing that anymore?\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s hands stilled. A curler fell to the floor.</p><p>Jill turned and saw the little girl staring at her with big eyes. \u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I still want my food to match.\u201d</p><p>Not hard to figure out when. \u201cWith your dad?\u201d Emily nodded.</p><p>Jill sensed they were treading in dangerous territory. Should she let it go? But something inside of her told her it might help Emily to talk.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with your dad?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Emily sucked in a breath and tucked her hands behind her back. Then she slowly nodded.</p><p>Jill shifted in the chair so she could draw the child close and put her arms around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be mad,\u201d she said, hoping it was. But if adults couldn\u2019t control their feelings, was it reasonable to expect an eight-year-old to? \u201cIs this about something he\u2019s doing now or before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore.\u201d</p><p>Jill drew Emily onto her lap and brushed her hair off her forehead. \u201cWant to talk about what happened or not?\u201d</p><p>Emily shrugged. \u201cDaddy was a cop before. He kept good people safe from bad people. But after a while he was quiet. He would sit in the living room and he wouldn\u2019t talk or play. Sometimes I\u2019d go look at him be cause I was scared he\u2019d disappear. You know, like a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see how that would scare you,\u201d Jill said. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t become a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But Mommy got mad and she would yell and he would yell back and Elvis and I hid in the closet, but it was dark and we didn\u2019t like that, either.\u201d</p><p>Jill ached for the little girl with nowhere to go. \u201cTheir fighting wasn\u2019t about you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t make them mad at each other.\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cOne day Mommy and me went away. I waited and waited for Daddy to come that night, but he didn\u2019t. Mommy said he couldn\u2019t for a while. I didn\u2019t know if he was lost. I used to pray every night. And I wrote him letters.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her blue eyes. Her lower lip quivered. \u201cAfter a long time Mommy said he was coming to see me. That I got to spend the whole weekend with him and it would really be fun. But he didn\u2019t come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tears spilled onto her cheeks. Jill pulled her close and rocked back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, knowing that while Mac might have gone through a tough time, there was nothing, save death or serious injury, that excused disappointing his daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come the next time, either, and I stopped asking when he would see me. And then Mommy said I had to spend the summer here.\u201d</p> <p>Jill felt more out of her depth than she\u2019d ever been in her life.</p><p>\u201cDid you and your dad ever talk about this?\u201d she asked, wanting to help, but not sure how.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Emily sniffed. \u201cHe said he was sorry and that he\u2019d never do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe him.\u201d</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>Jill wondered if there could be anything worse than wanting to trust a parent and not being able to.</p><p>What could have happened to keep Mac from Emily? She\u2019d seen them together and knew how much he loved his daughter. Nothing about this made sense.</p><p>\u201cAre you having a good time here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWith you and Bev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your dad?\u201d</p><p>Emily shrugged.</p> <p>Jill wished she had a psychology expert on call to help with this.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re mad at your dad, do you feel funny in side?\u201d she asked. \u201cSort of bad?\u201d</p><p>Emily looked at her and nodded several times.</p><p>Guilt, Jill thought. It strikes at any age. \u201cDo you think your dad loves you?\u201d</p><p>Mac stood just inside the kitchen and held his breath. He hadn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop, but neither Emily nor Jill had heard him knock. Now he stood frozen in place, un able to move and desperate to hear his daughter say yes.</p><p>But there was only silence.</p><p>Inside he ached with the pain of what he\u2019d lost. What he could only blame himself for and how much it had cost Emily. There was no excuse. There couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>If he could go back, he would change everything. Not an option, he reminded himself as he continued to wait.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d came the whispered response.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, huh?\u201d Jill said. \u201cI happen to know he loves you a lot. He told me and you know it\u2019s wrong to lie to lawyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So he had to be telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>Something hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cI think that was one of my curlers,\u201d Jill said.</p><p>\u201cWe need to finish.\u201d</p><p>He heard a thump, as if Emily had jumped to the floor. Mac backed out of the kitchen and went home to wait a few minutes before claiming Emily. He needed to figure out how to handle what he\u2019d heard.</p><p>How did he explain to an eight-year-old child that he\u2019d been in such hell, it had hurt to keep breathing? That nothing had mattered, except her, only he hadn\u2019t known how to show that? How did he explain screwing up and hurting her? How did he make it right?</p><p>He had loved Emily from the moment he\u2019d found out Carly was pregnant. Most men wanted a son, but he\u2019d been delighted by his perfect daughter. He\u2019d shared responsibilities, changing his shift to be home while Carly worked. Emily had been everything.</p><p>He\u2019d lost her because he hadn\u2019t been able to face what he\u2019d become. And in losing her, he\u2019d destroyed the love they shared.</p><p>He would get it back, he vowed. He would prove himself to her. If only he knew how.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>JILL FOLLOWED the human resources director down the carpeted hallway and did her best not to do a little happy dance right there between the kitchen and the supply room. The Century City law offices weren\u2019t just beautiful, they were blissfully familiar. Even the smell was just right\u2014a combination of leather, wood and musty paper with a hint of carpet freshener thrown in for good measure.</p><p>She liked everything about the location\u2014the floor-to-ceiling windows, the graduated sizes of offices which clearly spelled out authority, the amazing law library, even the little man who\u2019d gruffly directed her to visitor parking in the cavernous underground lot beneath the building. She liked how everyone wore suits and was busy doing things and that there wasn\u2019t a fish in sight. She didn\u2019t even mind that just like in San Francisco, she was sitting in the middle of active earthquake faults and that, should a decent-size tremor occur, the building was going to sway like a theme-park ride.</p><p>Jill shifted her Tumi briefcase, the one she\u2019d bought herself on her last promotion, to her left hand and squared her shoulders as her escort paused in front of a large, carved double door.</p><p>\u201cFirst names,\u201d the woman told her with a smile, \u201cbut Donald, never Don or Donnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The HR director shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s grateful. You have an incredible r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and you pre sent yourself so well. We would be delighted to have you join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She put her hand on the door and pushed it open, then stepped into the privileged office of the senior partner.</p><p>The open office had been paneled in rich wood. The Oriental carpet underfoot had probably been handmade nearly a century before. Jill knew all about the dangers of navigating old rugs in high heels, so she kept much of her weight on her toes.</p><p>She crossed to the massive desk where Donald Ericsson rose and offered his hand.</p><p>He was a few inches taller than her, late fifties, with graying hair and thin features. He looked pleasant enough but there was plenty of steel in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came down on such short notice, Jill,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has been very impressed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed meeting the team,\u201d she told him sincerely. Back-to-back interviews with eight employees had only exhilarated her. She could see herself working here, fitting in, climbing the law ladder. She had this fantasy\u2014okay, it was completely crazy, but one day\u2014maybe\u2014she would like to be a judge. L.A. had about four billion or so, so there was definitely room for one more.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get comfortable,\u201d Donald said, motioning to a grouping of leather furniture in the corner of his office. \u201cWould you like coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she said as she walked across the rug. \u201cI\u2019m on cup twelve or so. If I had any more caffeine in my system, you could use me as an energy source.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and waited until she was seated before lowering himself into a club chair. \u201cWhat do you think of our law firm?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so impressed, especially with the level of commitment you have from your associates and partners, especially in terms of satisfying your multinational clients. I worked with several Japanese companies when I was in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read that, and to be honest, Jill, that\u2019s what attracted us to you. We need more expertise in that area.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, she nodded to show she was listening, but as her head bobbed, she caught sight of something shiny out of the corner of her eye. What on earth?</p><p>Carefully, slowly, she shifted in her seat and glanced to her right.</p><p>Oh...my...God.</p><p>No way. She returned her attention to Donald, but it was impossible to focus. This was not happening.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou noticed her. Isn\u2019t she a beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. I harpooned her myself off the coast of Mexico about fifteen years ago. Bet you haven\u2019t seen any thing like her before.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t know what to say. The stuffed swordfish hung in a place of honor, right above the door. As for not seeing one like that before, she would be willing to swear that the one in her office was the twin or at least a sibling.</p><p>\u201cDo you fish a lot?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a passion with me. Some partners prefer to conduct business on a golf course. Give me a powerful boat, a couple of tanks of diesel and I say, let\u2019s take on the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds exciting,\u201d she said, trying not to giggle. Imagine coming so far only to find herself in a very up scale version of Dixon and Son.</p><p>EMILY CURLED UP in the kitchen chair, her knees pulled to her chest, Elvis on the table by her shoulder. Her dad chopped tomatoes for the salad and dumped them into the bowl.</p><p>Watching him was different than watching her mom, she thought. Mom made cooking look easy and fun. She talked and laughed a lot, letting Emily help. But her dad always scowled and seemed to work really hard at making everything come out. Everyone always talked about how great boys were and a lot of people said they were better and smarter than girls, but Emily didn\u2019t think so. There was a lot of stuff boys couldn\u2019t do at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not working on Saturday,\u201d he said, when he\u2019d finished with the last tomato and reached for a red pep per. \u201cI thought we could go sailing together.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been about to point out that her shirt was more orange than red, but the thought flew right out of her head. They\u2019d seen boats today, when she and Bev had been at the beach. Boats with big, white sails racing across the water.</p><p>\u201cOn the ocean?\u201d she asked, too excited to pretend it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He glanced at her over his shoulder and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we could get a whole sailboat in a pool, so we\u2019re pretty much left with the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve captained a boat or two in my time. A lady named Wilma at my work owns a sailboat and she said we could borrow it. Sound like fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She glanced at her pet rhino. \u201cI guess Elvis shouldn\u2019t come. He could fall overboard and get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Even the small life vest would be too big for him.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed in her seat, thinking about how much fun sailing would be. \u201cCan I make the boat go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He finished with the pepper, then carried the salad to the table.</p><p>Emily had already set it, carefully putting out plates and napkins and forks. She and her dad each had a glass for milk.</p><p>He crossed to the refrigerator and pulled out the chicken dish Bev had given him earlier. It was wrapped in plastic and ready for the microwave. Emily noticed the red sauce that had been poured over the whole thing.</p><p>Looking at the sauce made her feel kind of bad. At Bev\u2019s or when they went out, she ate whatever she wanted, but when she was with her dad, she still made sure her food matched her clothes. She didn\u2019t think Bev had told him, but she wasn\u2019t sure. Would he be mad if he found out? Would he tell her mom?</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t like thinking about that. She didn\u2019t like feeling funny inside. Maybe she should say something to him. Maybe...</p><p>\u201cI like being in Los Lobos,\u201d he said unexpectedly. \u201cI like my new job. It\u2019s different from what I did before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because you were a cop and now you\u2019re a sheriff?\u201d</p><p>He punched numbers into the microwave and pushed the start button, then turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some of it. Where I worked before was different. There were more bad people. I didn\u2019t like dealing with them. Do you remember how I worked a lot of hours?\u201d</p><p>She remembered him being gone. She remembered him and her mom fighting about all the times he wasn\u2019t home. She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou were tired a lot. Mommy used to say we had to be quiet so you could rest.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the counter. \u201cSomething bad happened at my work, Em. A man I worked with died.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. No one had told her. She thought about his friends\u2014the ones he\u2019d brought home. The one she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. \u201cUncle Mark?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019d met Uncle Mark a few times and he\u2019d always been nice to her. He was dead now, but she didn\u2019t really know what dead meant. Gone. Not coming back. Was there more than that?</p><p>\u201cWere you sad?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor a long time. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what happened\u2014how he\u2019d died. I\u2019d been there.\u201d</p><p>Emily shivered. She didn\u2019t want to see anyone die. It sounded too scary.</p><p>He folded his arms across his chest. \u201cDeep inside, a part of me got real quiet. Like being asleep. I knew that if I woke that part up, I would think about Mark being gone and I\u2019d get sad and I didn\u2019t want to. So I let it stay sleeping. But by letting that one piece be asleep, I couldn\u2019t really see what was happening around me. That\u2019s when you and Mom left.\u201d</p> <p>Emily leaned back in the chair. She didn\u2019t want to talk about this. She didn\u2019t like the way she felt icky in side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m sorry, Em. When I realized what had happened, that you were gone, I wanted to bring you back. But that sleeping part of me made it hard.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes burned and she bit hard on her lower lip. She didn\u2019t want him to say he was sorry. She wanted him to tell her how much he loved her. How he wanted to be with her every day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all awake now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re together. I want things to be different.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, not sure how to tell him they couldn\u2019t ever be different. Not if he hadn\u2019t missed her more than anything. Not if he didn\u2019t tell her how much he loved her.</p><p>She hurt inside, like a big hole had opened up in her chest. She felt scared and small.</p><p>\u201cI want things like they were,\u201d she said before she could stop herself. She stood and glared at him. \u201cI wish I could be with Mommy instead of you.\u201d Mommy, who told her how important she was all the time.</p><p>Her dad didn\u2019t say anything. She watched his face change and knew she\u2019d hurt him real bad. So bad she got even more scared, and the hole inside of her threatened to swallow her up. She started to cry and, rather than let him know, she ran out of the room.</p><p>Her heart ached so much, because whatever she might have said, she knew that while she did want to be with her mom, she liked being with her dad, too. But he didn\u2019t know that anymore. And maybe now he was going to send her away.</p><p>JILL ARRIVED BACK in Los Lobos around ten. After her interview, she\u2019d treated herself to an afternoon of shop ping and then a nice dinner before driving north. While the BMW might not have been her idea of how to spend sixty-five thousand dollars, she had to admit it was a pretty fabulous road car. Cruise control was the only thing that kept her from zipping along at ninety.</p> <p>Despite her bad parking in the Century City parking garage, the enchanted vehicle was still scratch-, ding-and dent-free.</p><p>\u201cTalk about a miracle,\u201d she said as she turned onto her street and pulled up in front of the house.</p><p>As she parked, she noticed a shadow on the front porch. The shadow stirred and rose, becoming a man she instantly recognized. Talk about an adrenaline rush, she thought, as she stepped out into the night and headed for Mac. He was just the thing she needed as a pick-me-up after the long drive.</p><p>She\u2019d pulled off her panty hose and kicked off her high heels before leaving Los Angeles. The grass was cool on her feet as she approached the porch.</p><p>\u201cAre you lost?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou live next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wanted to hear how things went. You look good.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her suit, then dropped her panty hose and pumps on the stairs. \u201cClothes make the woman and all that.\u201d She tugged the pins from her hair and shook the strands free. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked as she sat on the top step and patted the space next to her.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He sank onto the painted wood. \u201cHow was L.A.?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like the law firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe senior partner had a giant stuffed fish in his office. Am I being punished or what?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. It stared at me through the whole interview. I have no idea what I said.\u201d She tugged down her hem. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were sitting out here waiting for me to hear the particulars about my trip. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Everything. I\u2019m trying not to get drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking as someone who was recently in that condition, it sounds more fun than it is.\u201d She angled toward him. \u201cWant to tell me what happened to make that seem like an option?\u201d</p><p>He raised his hands to chest level, then let them fall. \u201cEmily.\u201d</p><p>Jill sighed. She knew his daughter wasn\u2019t making things easy. Not that she knew enough about what had happened to judge.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to say. She told me she\u2019s sorry she\u2019s here and that she wishes she were with her mother.\u201d</p><p>Jill winced. \u201cShe loves you, Mac, but she\u2019s a little girl. Her world doesn\u2019t always make sense to her. I\u2019m sure, as much as she\u2019s enjoying her time here, she\u2019s also bound to miss her mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe everything you\u2019re saying. I know it\u2019s logical. I\u2019ve even been thinking I should call Carly and ask her if she wants to see Em some Saturday. But I\u2019m scared, too. What if Emily doesn\u2019t want to come back to me? What if she convinces her mother to never let me see her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mac.\u201d</p><p>Jill took his hand and squeezed it. She couldn\u2019t think of any words to help him right now. He knew what he was saying was crazy, but that didn\u2019t lessen the impact of the words.</p><p>\u201cI love her so much,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cShe\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He was a good man, she thought. Nothing like Lyle, who refused to take responsibility for anything. Mac cared about Emily and the town and he believed in doing the right thing. Plus he was totally hot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat I had good taste even when I was eighteen and tried to get you to sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI would question your taste for wanting to be with a guy who was too drunk to notice you were naked. I can\u2019t tell you how much I regret that.\u201d</p><p>Her, too. \u201cIt was a never-to-be-repeated opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Or was it? Jill had a sudden flash of inspiration and she knew she had to act on it before she lost her nerve. She stood, pulled up her skirt to mid-thigh, then turned toward Mac and straddled his lap.</p><p>He looked more than a little startled, but he didn\u2019t pull back. \u201cWant to explain yourself?\u201d he asked, even as he rested his hands on her hips and settled her more firmly on his groin.</p><p>They were close enough to kiss. Her legs pressed against his. Heat filled her, making her want and need and melt.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t seriously be confused about my intentions,\u201d she murmured as she put her hands on his shoulders. \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one saying something about a rain check?\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she felt him get hard. It took all of three seconds. She rubbed against him, making them both breathe a little faster.</p><p>\u201cWe talked about this not being a good idea,\u201d he said, his voice low and strained.</p><p>She nipped at his jaw. \u201cDid we? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cYou need to let your thing about my father go. Trust me, you\u2019re not his type. He\u2019s deeply into younger women, if you\u2019ll excuse the pun.\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d He cupped her face and stared into her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t have a hell of a lot to offer anyone right now.\u201d</p><p>She rotated her center over his erection. \u201cAll evidence to the contrary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She brushed her fingertips against his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything long-term, Mac, and neither are you. I know you\u2019re worried about your daughter finding out so I promise to be quiet and leave long before dawn. Maybe it\u2019s the night. Maybe it\u2019s all those unfulfilled desires from when I was younger. Maybe it\u2019s how you make me feel when we\u2019re together. Regardless of the reason, I want this. I think you do, too. Wouldn\u2019t a smart man simply shut up and kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell of a good idea,\u201d he said, and did just that.</p><p>The openmouthed kiss was hungry, hot and tempting. Jill let herself be swept away by the feel of his tongue brushing against her lower lip, then slipping inside. He moved his hands up and down her back before returning them to her hips, where he took control of the rhythm of her pulsing movements.</p><p>With his fingers rubbing against the fabric of her suit, he slowed her way down, but exaggerated the movements so she slid forward and back against his hardness. As she drew back, he pushed up, bringing him in direct contact with about two million of her favorite nerve cells.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, then clamped her lips around his tongue. In response, he surged against her.</p><p>Between her panties she felt herself go from damp and intrigued to wet and ready. Her breasts swelled, her nipples got hard and the need to be naked and making love right that second nearly overwhelmed her.</p><p>He broke the kiss and slid down her jaw to her throat. Soft, damp kisses made her skin pucker, her body tense and her head loll back. She moved closer to give him plenty of access, at the same time she shrugged out of her jacket and thrust her breasts forward as suggestively as she could.</p><p>She loved that the man got it in one. His hands moved from her hips to her waist to her rib cage. Higher and higher until he\u2014</p><p>In the distance a car door slammed, then an engine started. Jill resurfaced long enough to realize they were on her front porch, under the light, in full view of anyone who wanted to watch.</p><p>Mac dropped his hands to her legs and squeezed. \u201cMay I suggest a change of location? My room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betcha.\u201d</p><p>She scooted off him and stood. After putting her jacket, stockings, shoes and purse inside the house, she took his hand and followed him across the two lawns and up the front porch into his house.</p><p>There were only a few lights on in the living room and hall. Mac ignored them and headed directly for the stairs. She tiptoed after him, trying not to make any noise or think too much about what they were about to do. She didn\u2019t want to risk getting herself out of the mood.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, he pulled her close and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cI need to check on Em,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMeet me in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said when he pointed to a half-open door at the end of the hall.</p><p>Jill made her way inside and clicked on a light. The room was fairly basic. Bed, nightstand, dresser, TV. She debated what to do next. Start getting naked? Make her self comfortable on the bed? Pull off just her panties so they could do it like animals?</p><p>Mac returned before she could decide.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d he said in a low voice as he closed and locked the door behind him. A slow smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. \u201cAnd here I had this fantasy about you letting me redeem myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He crossed to her and pulled her hard against him. \u201cIf you\u2019d been naked, I would have proven how much I wanted to make up for what happened last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about taking my clothes off, but it seemed a little forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he breathed, and kissed her.</p><p>Next time? She let the delightful promise sink into her consciousness as she gave in to the seduction of his kiss. As he teased and delighted her mouth and tongue, she felt his fingers unfasten the button at the top of the zipper. The metal teeth gave way, then the skirt slipped to the floor. He tugged at the lace elastic of her panties, soon freeing her of them, as well. Which left her standing in her blouse and bra.</p><p>Gently he pushed against her until she took a step back, then another until they were up against the mattress. He turned so, when they sat, she was in front of him and he behind, her bare bottom nestled against his crotch. Unfortunately, he was still wearing jeans, but the proximity was nice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmured as he reached around her for the buttons on her blouse. \u201cDelicate, feminine. Sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last one is my favorite,\u201d she admitted as he pulled open the silk blouse but didn\u2019t remove it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a huge turn-on. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>Not even on a good day, but she was willing to be convinced.</p><p>He reached between her breasts for the catch on her bra. She\u2019d never had a man do this from behind her, pressed against her back, both of them watching. She felt his chin on her shoulder, his breath on her cheek. The bra hook released and the cups slipped back to re veal her modest curves.</p><p>She was about to apologize for them when he groaned low in his throat and covered her breasts with his hands.</p><p>There was something in the way he touched her\u2014sensually, almost reverently. As if her breasts had somehow made his day. Which she would have thought was crazy if she hadn\u2019t heard his intake of breath and felt his erection surge against her.</p><p>He rubbed his palms against her nipples, which was so delicious that she forgot to think, then he dropped one hand between her legs.</p> <p>There was too much, she thought hazily as he slipped between her curls into the slick, hungry heat. Too many sensations, too many things to watch. He moved his left hand from breast to breast while the fingers of his right explored her, slipping inside, pulling out, then centering on that place right above her opening.</p><p>Her chest tightened as all her muscles tensed. He quickly moved her long hair aside and began to nibble on her neck. Thumb and forefinger teased her tight, sensitive nipples. Between her legs he circled around and around. Sensations met, grew, exploded until every part of her body was aroused and on fire and she could only breathe her way through the pleasure. Faster and faster and more and more until her eyes drifted closed and she gave herself up to the\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, Mac,\u201d she gasped as her body convulsed into orgasm. She clung to him, her hands reaching behind her to grab his hips as she spread her legs more and pushed against his touch, wanting more, wanting it harder and harder and...</p><p>The contractions claimed her again. She shuddered and breathed and lost herself in all that he did to her body. When the last waves had faded, she surfaced to find him still gently kissing her neck and rubbing between her legs.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI like wow.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke he stretched out on the bed, drawing her down with him. She turned so she lay on top of him. Her hair spilled down around them both. He was still hard and despite what had just happened, she found herself rubbing against him.</p><p>His blue eyes darkened with passion. \u201cI\u2019d like to do that inside of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, sounds good.\u201d</p><p>She straddled his hips, then pushed up so she could shrug out of her blouse and bra. He fumbled with his belt.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could get naked,\u201d he said as he unfastened his jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to move.\u201d</p><p>She liked looking down at him and feeling his hands bump the inside of her thighs as he pushed at the denim.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I can\u2019t be inside.\u201d</p><p>As if to demonstrate the plus side of actual entry, he slid one finger inside of her and rotated it.</p><p>She sank down, pushing him deeper. Her muscles quivered.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, sliding off him. \u201cGood point. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>He kicked off his shoes, then pushed down jeans, briefs and socks in one quick movement. \u201cTop drawer,\u201d he said. \u201cCondoms.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. Protection. She was still on the Pill, but this wasn\u2019t safe married sex.</p><p>Thank God, she thought as she pulled out the unopened box and broke the seal before pulling out a condom. Married sex hadn\u2019t been nearly this exciting and, what with Lyle and his chickie collection, not all that safe.</p><p>She turned back to find a very naked Mac lunging for her. He grabbed her around the waist and gently tossed her onto her back. She landed with a bounce and a giggle. She handed over the condom. He bent over and kissed her, not even watching while he slid on the protection, which she thought was a neat trick. Then he was between her legs and things went from funny to fabulous with the first thrust.</p><p>He filled her until she thought she might have to scream from how good it was. The feel of his body, the fierce possessiveness of his kiss, the slick friction as he slid in and out in a rhythm designed to make her faint.</p><p>It was good. It was better than good, she thought, as she grabbed his hips and drew him all the way in. Then she lost it in a release so unexpected and powerful that she was afraid she was going to pass out. Still, she hung on enough to keep climaxing until he stiffened and shuddered, then broke the kiss long enough to whisper her name.</p><p>MAC PUT HIS ARM around Jill as she stretched out next to him, her head on his chest. He felt good being next to her. Really good.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me fall asleep,\u201d she said as she stroked up and down the center of his chest. \u201cThat would require too much to explain to both Emily and Bev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Bev would mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. If anything, she\u2019d want details.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know if you tell her.\u201d</p><p>She shifted so she could rest her chin on his chest and grin at him. \u201cShy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared, as any rational male would be. Guys don\u2019t want to know how much women tell each other. We think it\u2019s weird and a little threatening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid we\u2019ll compare?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and her expression softened. \u201cOh, honey, you don\u2019t have to worry on that account. You would definitely come in first on my list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He fingered a strand of her hair. \u201cHow long\u2019s the list?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, then slammed shut. \u201cLet\u2019s not go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Come on, Jill. You can\u2019t have played around that much. I happen to know I\u2019m rebound guy after Lyle, but what about before?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. \u201cAll right, but first why don\u2019t we talk about how my father would feel if he knew what we\u2019d done?\u201d</p><p>He feigned being punched, then rubbed his chin with his free hand. \u201cThat one hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d She kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cFine. We won\u2019t talk about your past,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can. There\u2019s not much to say. You threw up the first time you saw me naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d quit bringing that up. I feel like a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Eventually we\u2019ll be even.\u201d</p><p>He touched her shoulder. \u201cSeriously, Jill. I\u2019m sorry. If I\u2019d been sober enough to take advantage of you...\u201d What? Would their lives have been different? He thought maybe they might have been.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut Evan really cemented things for me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cWho\u2019s Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first boyfriend at college. He was sweet and sensitive and a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d Mac grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, at least not for that. The first time he saw me naked, he announced that he was gay. Apparently my body provided the revelation he needed to figure it all out.\u201d</p><p>Mac stared at her. She looked just hurt and embarrassed enough for him to know she was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he said, because he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPretty amazing, huh? The first guy who sees me naked throws up. The second turns gay. Is it any wonder I thought I was in love with the only guy who didn\u2019t react badly to the idea of having sex with me?\u201d</p><p>He rolled her onto her back and stared into her eyes. She couldn\u2019t be saying...it wasn\u2019t possible that...</p><p>\u201cLyle is the only other guy you\u2019ve slept with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounting you? Yes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cBut you\u2019re incredible. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the odds of it are impressive, but there we are. My life.\u201d She picked at the edge of the sheet. \u201cI think it\u2019s a breast thing. As in I don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have beautiful breasts.\u201d He loved them. Their perfect shape, the way her nipples got so tight. The soft skin, the color. Just thinking about them got him hard.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too small,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLarge breasts are overrated.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad liar. I like that.\u201d</p><p>He moved close and rubbed himself against her. \u201cDoes that feel like a lie?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cActually it does not. All that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your perfect breasts.\u201d He tugged at the sheet. \u201cNow what does a guy have to do around here to get another shot at proving his point?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him close. \u201cAnything he wants.\u201d</p><p>JILL ARRIVED at her office shortly before nine. Despite her lack of sleep and sneaking home shortly after four in the morning, she felt alive, alert and perfectly fulfilled.</p><p>Last night had been spectacular. Mac was even more amazing in bed than she\u2019d possibly hoped. He\u2019d made her feel things that probably weren\u2019t legal, not that she was going to complain. As she unlocked the front door and stepped into the reception area, she found she didn\u2019t even mind the fish.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said to the nearest one and patted its scaly back. \u201cEverybody sleep well?\u201d</p><p>Still smiling and happy, she made her way to the blinking answering machine and pushed the button. While the machine informed her she had two messages, she made a mental note to make sure she was available around eleven. Bev was coming by so they could take the 545 to the parking lot by the dump. Surely all the gravel there would do something to the paint job.</p><p>Thirty seconds later she didn\u2019t know if she should laugh, dance, or simply give up. What was it with her life?</p><p>Donald, the fisherman/attorney/senior partner, had called to offer her a job, and another firm from L.A. wanted to talk to her about an interview.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>THE MORNING WAS PERFECT, and driving through town seemed like a great way to spend a piece of his day. Mac left the beaches and turned toward the center of town. It was almost eleven and already the temperature was near eighty. Hot weather meant plenty of customers at the vending carts by the boardwalk and lots of tourists too enchanted to head back to the big city.</p><p>The jails were empty, the court schedule light and there were very few clouds on the horizon. For the most part\u2014life was good.</p><p>Except for Emily, Mac thought. In the past week he\u2019d thought a lot about what he\u2019d overheard when Jill had taken his daughter for the evening, and he was still at a loss as to how to win his daughter\u2019s trust. He loved her with every fiber of his being, but that wasn\u2019t enough. He vowed to keep trying to convince her he would al ways be there for her.</p><p>\u201cKeep showing up,\u201d he told himself. She was eight\u2014didn\u2019t actions speak louder than words?</p><p>Their day of sailing had been great. They\u2019d laughed and she\u2019d done a hell of a job steering the boat. But back at the house, she\u2019d still insisted her food match her clothes. He was running out of ideas.</p><p>As he turned left, he passed the offices of Dixon and Son. Tina stepped out as he drove by. She waved. He wondered what errands Jill\u2019s secretary had at that time of day and if she would bother returning.</p><p>Jill. Now that was one part of his life that worked. Good times, great conversation, lots of laughs, all in the package of an extraordinarily beautiful woman with plenty of smarts. Their night together had been one for the record books and he sure wouldn\u2019t mind a repeat performance. It would have to be soon, he reminded himself. Jill seemed to be getting job offers and interview requests three times a day. The odds were she would accept one and be gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that, so he turned on the street by the high school and pulled up by the football practice field. It was too early in the summer for the team to be working out, but he knew what they\u2019d look like. Awkward and out of shape those first couple of weeks, he thought with a grin, remembering his own days playing football. He and Riley had thought they were God\u2019s gift to the sport, not to mention every female within a fifty-mile radius.</p><p>Life had been easier then. School didn\u2019t matter\u2014it was just a place to be a star and pick up girls. He and Riley had kept count, both being young enough to be more into volume than quality. Then Mac had stolen the judge\u2019s Caddy and gone for the joyride that had changed his life. Riley hadn\u2019t appreciated the differences. The friendship had ended in harsh words and a couple of well-placed blows.</p><p>Mac rubbed his jaw and wondered where Riley was now. His name still stood in the center of town\u2014Whitefield Bank and Trust, established in 1948. Riley\u2019s uncle still ran things there. If Mac was to guess, he would put money on the feud between Riley and his uncle being alive and well. Riley had never been one to forgive and forget.</p> <p>Mac shrugged off the past and put the car in gear. As he drove past the front of the high school, he saw a crew of teenagers painting the fence of a house across the street. A sign stuck in the ground read Los Lobos Town Beautification Project. Call And See If Your Home Qualifies.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he muttered as he stopped the car. Beautification project? That was news to him.</p><p>He climbed out and greeted the teenagers, then walked to the front door of the house and knocked.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mackenzie Kendrick, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said when an elderly woman cracked her door. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff.\u201d She beamed at him and waved him inside. \u201cIf this is my day to be courted by the city, then I have to tell you, I like it. First those young folks show up and ask if they can paint my fence. As if I\u2019m going to say no. They swear it\u2019s all part of some plan and that they wouldn\u2019t even accept a tip.\u201d Her smiled faded. \u201cYou haven\u2019t come to tell me they were lying, have you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Of course not. I\u2019m asking about the project though. I hadn\u2019t heard of it.\u201d</p><p>Furniture filled the entryway, forcing Mac up against the half-open door.</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d the woman said. \u201cWait. They gave me a flyer. Let me get it.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared into an equally crowded living room and returned with a neon-pink piece of paper. He scanned the text as a fluffy gray cat wove around his legs, depositing large clumps of hair on his slacks.</p><p>He reread the offer to paint fence, trim lawns and shrubs, all for free for those unable to afford it on their own, all in the name of making Los Lobos \u201cthe paradise we all know it to be.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a bunch of crap, Mac thought, not sure who could be behind it.</p> <p>\u201cMind if I take this with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d The woman smiled again. \u201cNow you be sure to let me know when you city folks want to work on my roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said as he stepped over the cat and made a quick escape.</p><p>After brushing off most of the cat hair, he started his car. Was the mayor behind this? Did Franklin think he could buy votes by doing work for folks? Mac wouldn\u2019t be surprised, but he happened to know Franklin wasn\u2019t exactly rolling in money. Oh, sure, there was a trust fund, but it belonged to his wife, and Mrs. Yardley kept her husband on a short leash. She had a reputation for being both difficult and cheap. Not exactly a combination to make a man\u2019s life easier.</p><p>The thought of Franklin Yardley getting hell from his wife brightened Mac\u2019s day. He drove toward the office, stopping only to make a quick stop at the coffeehouse on the corner.</p><p>Once inside, his good mood faded as he saw Rudy Casaccio and Mr. Smith already in line by the counter. As Mac watched, Rudy paid for two coffees with a twenty, then put the change into the tip jar.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Casaccio,\u201d Jen Brockway said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Rudy asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t charge enough here. You have the best coffee I\u2019ve ever tasted and if Mr. Smith and I keep eating your Danish every day, we\u2019re not going to fit in our car.\u201d</p> <p>Jen Brockway, nearly sixty and with a reputation for being surly and difficult, actually batted her eyes at Rudy. Right then Mac swore off Danish.</p><p>\u201cCoffee. Black,\u201d he said as Rudy stepped aside.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sheriff,\u201d the other man said.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d What he wanted to say instead was Get out of town, but what was the point? Rudy wasn\u2019t breaking the law. Not yet.</p><p>Jen poured him his coffee and handed it over. He started to pass her a dollar, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sheriff. Mr. Casaccio has started an account here. He\u2019s asked me to put all purchases by you and your employees on it.\u201d She smiled again.</p><p>All this happiness made Mac uneasy.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that incredibly generous?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mac wanted to growl his protest. Instead, he did his best to look pleasant and appreciative. \u201cIt\u2019s mighty neighborly of Mr. Casaccio,\u201d he said in his best Nick-at-Nite Andy-Griffith voice. \u201cBut to keep things all aboveboard, I think it\u2019s best if we continue to pay for our coffee.\u201d He looked at Rudy. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want people getting the wrong idea about things, would we?\u201d</p><p>Rudy had set down his coffee. Now he raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cJust trying to do the right thing,\u201d he said easily. \u201cI want to be a good citizen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Mac took his coffee and left. As he returned to his car, he thought about the beautification project. No way the mayor could get his hands on that kind of money...unless someone other than his wife funded him.</p><p>He swore and headed directly for the office.</p><p>\u201cWilma,\u201d he called as he walked through the front door.</p><p>The older woman looked up from her desk. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head toward his office. When she\u2019d followed him inside, he closed the glass door and handed her the flyer.</p><p>She read it, then let it fall to his desk. \u201cI\u2019d heard about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Rudy Casaccio behind it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, he\u2019s been dropping a lot of money in town.\u201d She shifted, then shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, boss. I know you don\u2019t trust the guy. The thing is he\u2019s made a lot of people very happy. Doing this kind of stuff and more. Some foster kid\u2019s dog got hit by a car. The family couldn\u2019t afford the surgery so they were going to put it to sleep. Rudy found out and paid for every thing.\u201d</p><p>Great. Just what he needed. A do-gooder from the Mafia. \u201cHe has a plan,\u201d Mac said through clenched teeth. \u201cI can feel it. Men like him don\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>Wilma cleared her throat. \u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d she said, \u201cand you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been dating Bev. You know\u2014the lady you have taking care of Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHE HASN\u2019T DONE anything wrong,\u201d Bev said in what Mac figured was a reasonable voice.</p><p>The thing was, he didn\u2019t want to be reasonable. Not where his daughter was concerned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a criminal, Bev,\u201d Mac told her as he paced the length of her front porch. \u201cI don\u2019t want Emily around him.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s aunt leaned against the porch rail. \u201cI hardly take her with me on dates, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. We\u2019ve had lunch a couple of times and I\u2019ve left Emily with Jill. I see him in the evening, when you have Emily.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cWhy am I telling you this? My personal life isn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when you date men like Rudy Casaccio.\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t anyone get it? Why was he the only one to see the trouble coming?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Mac? Are you asking me to choose? I love your daughter and I\u2019m enjoying my time with her, but I won\u2019t let you dictate how I live my life outside of my time with Emily.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d let him dictate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d probably pretend to listen more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Was he being unreasonable?</p><p>\u201cWhat about that damn social worker?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a shit-fit if he finds out my child\u2019s baby-sitter is dating someone known to be involved with organized crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying Rudy has a criminal record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mac had checked. \u201cHe\u2019s too smart for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a record at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cSo you could be wrong about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could be.\u201d</p><p>He had a feeling in his gut and that feeling had never let him down. Sometimes he wondered if it was the reason Mark had died instead of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Bev asked. \u201cFind someone else to take care of Emily?\u201d</p><p>The question made Mac want to squirm. He liked Bev. Even more important, she liked his daughter and was good for her. He knew Em had a good time with her.</p><p>Bev\u2019s green eyes darkened. \u201cI would never do anything to endanger your daughter. She means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t Bev simply stop seeing Rudy? But he knew better than to ask. \u201cWill you keep him away from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I promise.\u201d</p><p>There was something in the way she said the word, as if it were a vow she would keep with her life. The tight knot in his gut relaxed a little. Now if only he could get Rudy out of town.</p><p>\u201cSO I\u2019VE BEEN THINKING this through,\u201d Mr. Harrison said as he leaned back in his chair and kicked at the fishing net in front of her desk. \u201cYou\u2019re right about the fence. It\u2019s been there a long time and it makes sense that the courts wouldn\u2019t make anyone take it down.\u201d</p><p>Jill blinked, then glanced around the room wondering if there was a hidden camera somewhere and she was about to be on a reality show.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d let my new neighbors buy that bit of land from me. You know, for a real fair price. Maybe they could make payments over a few years.\u201d</p><p>Delighted by the turn of events, Jill couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ve spoken with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times. Juan and his wife are good people. Whoee, can his mother-in-law put together a peach cobbler.\u201d</p><p>Under the privacy of her desk, Jill kicked off her high heels and wiggled her toes. \u201cYou\u2019re being very fair and decent about this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re young folks, just starting out. I don\u2019t want to make things hard for them.\u201d He stood. \u201cSo you\u2019ll draw up the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. By Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now don\u2019t go charging them a lot of inter est. Let\u2019s tie the loan to the prime rate. That should stay plenty low. And spread out the payments so they\u2019re not strapped for cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She slipped on her shoes and stood. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He shook her hand and left.</p><p>Jill waited until she was alone\u2014because Tina was gone again\u2014and did a little dance around the room. Yeah and double yeah for good food and neighbors willing to take a chance on an old man. She had to give Mr. Harrison credit, too, for not being too stubborn about the whole thing. Now if only her other cases would wrap up this easily, along with a couple of wills and Pam Whitefield\u2019s suit over the nonalien landing house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to think about that,\u201d she told herself.</p><p>The phone rang, interrupting her celebration. She skittered over to the desk and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cJill Strathern.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Gracie. How are things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jill sank into the chair Mr. Harrison had vacated. \u201cI solved one of most difficult cases this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongrats. Any news on the job front?\u201d</p><p>Jill told her about the fish offer from Los Angeles. \u201cAnd you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in your world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be in People magazine.\u201d</p> <p>Jill sprang to her feet and shrieked. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding? That\u2019s so great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a whole issue about weddings and there\u2019s going to be a page featuring my wedding cakes. Do you know what this means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFame, fortune and more orders than you can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Gracie started laughing. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the best? The phone is already ringing. I\u2019ve had to redo my baking schedule and everything.\u201d</p><p>Jill knew how hard her friend had worked at her business. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. There\u2019s just this one thing....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVivian\u2019s engaged.\u201d</p><p>Gracie spoke as if her baby sister had just caught the plague.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that a problem?\u201d Jill sank down onto the chair and groaned. \u201cOh, God. She\u2019s not marrying Riley, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. The groom is this guy she met in college. But here\u2019s the thing, Jill. Vivian has always wanted a hometown wedding. You know\u2014the country club, white chairs on the lawn, the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds nice. So what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she gets married there, I\u2019ll have to come home.\u201d</p><p>Jill tried not to laugh, but she couldn\u2019t help it.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound very sympathetic,\u201d Gracie accused.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I know this is terrible and all...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t get the problem. It\u2019s been years, Gracie. Almost no one remembers what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You said I was a legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said that fourteen-year-old girl was a legend. You\u2019re a different person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but I don\u2019t like the idea of spending two weeks being tortured about my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be. Besides, it\u2019s not as if Riley ever came back. If he lived here, I could completely understand your reluctance, but no one\u2019s heard from him in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding isn\u2019t until next spring. You\u2019ll be long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d Jill said. \u201cBut I can come visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll need someone to protect me from my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a few more minutes, then hung up. Jill moved around to her side of the desk and pulled out an envelope of papers that had arrived that morning. She scanned the property settlement Lyle had proposed and took great satisfaction in drawing a line through every page and writing \u201cno\u201d across them. Then she turned to her computer and started her own settlement schedule...starting with the car.</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS ALL your fault,\u201d Mac said as he leaned against the porch railing.</p><p>Jill thought he had to be kidding, but one look at his stern, accusing expression told her he meant it.</p><p>She pushed against the porch with her bare foot and relaxed into the swing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He glanced past her to the screen leading into the living room. Emily was in the family room at the back of the house, watching a Disney movie, but still he lowered his voice.</p><p>\u201cThey came here because of you,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you send them away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything wrong. Mac, has it occurred to you that you\u2019re overreacting about Rudy and Mr. Smith? They just want to be a part of the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about Los Lobos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I have specific reasons. Why would two guys from Las Vegas find this hick of a town charming? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Rudy says he likes that it\u2019s quiet. I know he likes Bev, she likes him. That should be allowed.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and ignored how sexy Mac looked in jeans and a T-shirt. Like her, he was barefoot. If only he could be naked all over.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are they doing that\u2019s so bad?\u201d she asked. \u201cTell me one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRudy gave money to Yardley\u2019s reelection campaign.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cOkay, a case could be made to question his judgment, but it\u2019s not against the law or any thing. So Rudy is helping old ladies with fence painting and he\u2019s given a ton of money to the pier restoration? Isn\u2019t that good?\u201d</p><p>Mac\u2019s dark gaze pinned her in place. \u201cPeople don\u2019t change. Rudy is what he has always ever been and eventually it\u2019s going to come out. Someone will get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Jill wanted to have him sit next to her, hold her hand and tell her how amazing their night together had been. She wanted him to whisper the time and place of a rendezvous so they could be together again. She wanted to talk about the stars or kissing or even politics. Just not this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cLook at how you\u2019re worried about Emily and making things right with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved my daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cI have my priorities back on track, but I\u2019m not any different than I was.\u201d He walked forward and crouched in front of her. \u201cWhat about you, Jill? Have you changed? Are you thinking that you want to settle in Los Lobos permanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even on a bet,\u201d she said, then realized his point. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Rudy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t talked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know for sure his motives are altruistic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She pressed her lips together. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He stood and returned to the railing. Silence stretched between them. Why on earth were they fighting about Rudy? She searched for a more bonding topic.</p><p>\u201cHow was your meeting with Hollis?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat little prick. I\u2019m reading this book he gave me on anger management. That\u2019s bad enough, but every time he asks about it, I want to squash him like a bug.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cOh, right. So he doesn\u2019t have a point about your temper.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the swing and sat down next to her. \u201cDo I have a temper?\u201d</p><p>Interesting question, she thought, as she recalled their time together. \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen you angry. You were annoyed a few minutes ago about Rudy, but not really mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHollis hasn\u2019t seen it, either. He assumes, because I\u2019m a cop, that I have a lousy temper. Bastard.\u201d</p><p>She slid closer and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s just for the summer,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cThink about why you\u2019re doing all this. You can stand him for a few more weeks.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his and laced their fingers together. \u201cA lot of things are just for the summer. You doing okay?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been so caught up in the feel of him touching her that she almost missed the question. \u201cOkay about what?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a slow, sexy smile that made her tummy clench and her thighs burn.</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. It\u2019s just there was only Lyle, then me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want Lyle to be the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cI had some bad luck along the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me and the gay guy. You\u2019re so smart about everything else, Jill, but I have to tell you, except for me, you have lousy taste in guys.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I should probably give you some pointers. Only I don\u2019t want to share.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close and brushed his mouth against hers. Need swept through her like a tornado, leaving her shaky and aroused.</p><p>She wrapped one arm around him, pulling him against her, and put her heart and soul into the kiss. In a matter of seconds they were both breathing hard.</p><p>Mac drew back first. Fire flared in his dark eyes. Need tightened his jaw. He looked like a man in some serious pain.</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d she said into the silence.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if she was at a friend\u2019s house...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>TWO DAYS LATER Mac went looking for Rudy and found him dining with Mr. Smith at Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill. The timing probably sucked because he\u2019d just come off another frustrating meeting with Hollis, but he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201cHow are the fajitas?\u201d Mac asked as he pulled out a chair and settled into it.</p><p>Mr. Smith glanced at Rudy, who shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cThe sheriff is always welcome. What can I do for you, Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>Rudy waved over the waitress. \u201cMandy, would get the good sheriff here something to drink. Beer? Margarita?\u201d He pointed to his own frosty, salt-rimmed glass. \u201cThey do make a great margarita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Mac told the waitress and she left.</p><p>Rudy shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you don\u2019t want to be friends, Mac, and I don\u2019t understand why. I\u2019m a successful businessman looking for a getaway place. Los Lobos is very appealing. You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer you settled somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>Rudy sipped his drink. While Mr. Smith wore a suit, Rudy had traded in custom tailoring for upscale resort wear.</p><p>\u201cI could be good for this town,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cBring in a little money, spruce things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. We don\u2019t need your kind of help, or the strings that go with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill was right,\u201d Rudy said regretfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t think a man could change.\u201d</p><p>Mac felt as if he\u2019d been sucker punched. The blood rushed from his head and the room seemed to tilt.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was telling me this morning that you didn\u2019t believe a man such as myself could change.\u201d Rudy shook his head. \u201cI have to tell you, Mac, I\u2019m wounded to my soul. I thought we could be friends.\u201d</p><p>Mac swore silently. Was that the way it was with Jill? She might be his friend and lover, but she was Rudy\u2019s lawyer, and being a lawyer came first with her? Why else would she have shared their private conversation with a scumbag?</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself,\u201d he told Rudy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to step out of line in my town.\u201d</p><p>Rudy took a bite of rice and chewed. When he\u2019d swallowed, he said, \u201cIs it your town, Mac? I\u2019m not so sure. The mayor and I are real tight, and the residents seem to like what I\u2019m doing. It seems to me that you\u2019re the one out of step. Don\u2019t you have an election coming up in a couple of months? And don\u2019t you need this job to keep custody of your daughter? It seems to me you should be worrying more about making nice than trying to throw around your weight.\u201d</p><p>Rage poured through Mac. How the hell did Rudy know so much about his life? Had Jill told him? What kind of information would she consider part of her responsibility as Rudy\u2019s attorney? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn them both.</p><p>\u201cIf you so much as forget to come to a full stop, I\u2019ll haul your ass into jail,\u201d Mac said in a low voice. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Rudy looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a man who gives up, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. And I\u2019m not letting you win this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you have a choice, Mac.

I\u2019ll win because I was meant to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my town.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>JILL IGNORED THE cast on Kim\u2019s arm for as long as she could, but when the young woman was barely able to sign the papers releasing the money, she found herself unable to stay quiet.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, nodding at Kim\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kim stared at the plaster that ran from the base of her fingers up to her elbow as if she\u2019d never seen it before. \u201cOh. I, um, fell and slammed my wrist against a stair.\u201d As she spoke she nervously tucked blond hair behind her ear, then fumbled with the papers. \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Jill pointed to the spot.</p><p>Kim positioned the pen against the loop of the cast by her thumb and scrawled her name.</p><p>\u201cIs the baby all right?\u201d Jill asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you fell. Is the baby all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kim placed her left hand on her stomach. \u201cYes. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re having a girl?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since walking into her office, Kim didn\u2019t look afraid. Her whole expression relaxed as she smiled. \u201cYes, they told me when I had the ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your husband excited?\u201d Jill glanced at her notes. \u201cMost men want a boy. Does Andy?\u201d</p><p>The fear returned, striking Kim like a bolt of lightning. She shrank back in her seat and swallowed hard. \u201cHe, um, he doesn\u2019t know. He said he wanted it to be a surprise. I wasn\u2019t supposed to ask. You\u2019re not going to tell him, are you?\u201d</p><p>Jill felt her insides turn over in an uncomfortable combination of pity and anger. She stood and walked around her desk, then crouched in front of Kim.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cKim, he has no right to hurt you or make you afraid. He\u2019s your husband and he\u2019s supposed to love you, not terrorize you.\u201d</p> <p>Jill fingered the paperwork on the desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put this money in your joint checking account. You can take the cashier\u2019s check and walk out of here right to a woman\u2019s shelter. It\u2019s enough to give you and the baby a fresh start. I could drive you there right now. No one would have to know where you are.\u201d</p><p>Kim pulled back as far as the chair would let her. She shook her head and held up her free hand in a sad gesture of protection.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Andy is a wonderful husband. He loves me.\u201d</p><p>Jill stood. \u201cHe loves you so much he breaks your bones. There\u2019s affection to stand by. What happens when the baby is born? He doesn\u2019t want a girl, does he? Is he going to blame you? Wonderful husbands don\u2019t beat their wives, Kim. They don\u2019t make them afraid.\u201d</p><p>Kim looked away. A single tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Andy needs me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, because where else could he act like a bully? Jill thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your needs?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about spending the rest of your life afraid?\u201d</p><p>Kim looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>But the fear was there\u2014a tangible beast between them. Jill knew all the psychological theories as to why women stayed, but she\u2019d never been able to wrap her mind around understanding the dynamics. To her it was just plain sad.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Kim,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIf not for you, then for the baby. What if he starts beating her?\u201d</p><p>Kim turned away, one hand cupping her belly. \u201cHe loves the baby as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Will he love the baby the same as he loves you? With his fists?\u201d</p><p>Kim stood. \u201cI have to go now. Are we done? When can I get the money?\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t know what else to say. Short of kidnapping the woman, she\u2019d run out of options. \u201cIt will be transferred the first part of next week. I\u2019ll call and let you know when.\u201d</p><p>Kim picked up her purse. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have to come back here again?\u201d</p><p>Jill hesitated, wanting to make up an excuse to see Kim again, but she knew there wasn\u2019t any point. Until Kim was ready to leave, no one could help her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my card,\u201d she said, pulling out a business card from Dixon and Son. She wrote her aunt\u2019s home number on the back. \u201cIf you change your mind about anything, call me. It doesn\u2019t matter what time. I\u2019ll come get you, no questions asked.\u201d</p><p>She held out the card, but Kim wouldn\u2019t take it. Finally Jill tucked it into the other woman\u2019s purse. Kim stared at her for a long time.</p><p>\u201cHe loves me,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI\u2019m his world. Why can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his punching bag, Kim. Why can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>Kim turned and ran from the room. Jill watched her go and knew she\u2019d blown it big time. Dammit all to hell, she thought and picked up the closest law book and hurled it across the room.</p><p>She reached for another one, then sank into the chair Kim had vacated.</p><p>Tina stepped into the room. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t bother looking at her. \u201cKim was here with a freshly broken wrist. She\u2019s what, eight months\u2019 pregnant and the bastard is still using her as a punching bag. I don\u2019t get it. I seriously don\u2019t get it. I can understand the fear, but I told her I\u2019d take her away. Sure, he could find her in Los Lobos, but not if she were in L.A. or San Francisco or even Dallas. She doesn\u2019t have to be with him. The inheritance gave her money, so why did she stay?\u201d</p><p>Tina didn\u2019t say anything. Jill stood and walked around to her side of the desk. She was about to sit down when Tina spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou care.\u201d</p><p>It was the last straw. She glared at her secretary.</p><p>\u201cOf course I care. What did you think?\u201d</p><p>With that, she grabbed her purse and left.</p><p>Once on the sidewalk, she wished the car were there. At this point she didn\u2019t care about scratches\u2014she would happily deface it herself. Maybe that would help her feel better. How could Kim live like that? How could any one? She found herself uncomfortably torn between compassion and anger.</p><p>Once on the sidewalk, she didn\u2019t know where to go. Home? A bar? A quick glance at her watch told her it was barely after ten in the morning. Okay. Maybe not a bar.</p><p>Mac, she thought, and started walking toward the sheriff\u2019s station. Maybe he could do something about all this. Surely one of the neighbors had seen something or heard something.</p><p>In the distance between her office and his, she made and discarded several plans. Everything from kidnapping Kim until the woman came to her senses to having Andy spend some quality time with the anal-probing aliens.</p><p>She pushed open the glass door at the sheriff\u2019s office and saw Wilma at the counter. \u201cHi. Is he in?\u201d</p><p>The gray-haired woman shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s in, but I wouldn\u2019t want to see him if I were you. He\u2019s not in a very good mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works for me,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty pissed off myself.\u201d</p><p>She walked to Mac\u2019s glassed-in office, knocked on the open door, then stepped in. He was on the phone, his back to her.</p><p>\u201cAbout ten-thirty,\u201d he said as he turned slowly. When he saw her, he frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s there. Uh-huh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>When he hung up, he surprised her by not getting up or acting the least bit pleased to see her. They\u2019d seen each other the day before last and things had gone well. Very well.</p><p>\u201cMac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting in a couple of minutes. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>He sounded all business and slightly hostile. She grabbed the door and swung it shut, then moved closer to his desk. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a problem. I want to report a man for beating his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I saw the results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat most victims in spousal abuse say. \u2018He loves me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re alleging he beat her.\u201d</p><p>Her temper flared to life. \u201cDammit, Mac. Don\u2019t play that game with me. We both know what\u2019s happening. Why won\u2019t you do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it to Wilma. She\u2019ll give it to one of the deputies.\u201d He reached for a folder on his desk.</p><p>She slapped her hand down on top of it and leaned toward him. \u201cI\u2019m taking it to you. What\u2019s going on? Are you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? No. Of course not. I\u2019m annoyed at myself, but that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, because I don\u2019t have time for a conversation.\u201d He stood. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. What has happened in the past couple of days to make you act like this?\u201d She mentally raced through the possibilities. \u201cDid you have a run-in with Hollis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He moved around the desk and loomed over her. She told herself he was simply trying to physically intimidate her and while it was working, she wasn\u2019t about to let him know.</p><p>\u201cBut I did have an interesting conversation with your client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes darkened with temper. \u201cRudy Casaccio. You know. The one you\u2019re always claiming is misunderstood. I hadn\u2019t realized the two of you were so close.\u201d</p><p>He sounded furious and she didn\u2019t have a clue as to why. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me talking to Rudy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Talk away. I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, look. I\u2019m completely confused. Why are you so angry?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cBecause I thought I was having a private conversation with my lover and I found out instead I\u2019d been speaking to the defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRudy. You told him I didn\u2019t think people could change. What else do you tell him, Jill? What other little secrets do you share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...we never...\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say. Fury bubbled up inside of her until she wanted to bodily throw Mac through the glass door.</p><p>\u201cWe spoke,\u201d she said, her teeth grinding together. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I mentioned you were concerned about the town in the context of trying to find out how long he was staying and what he was going to do while he was here. He reassured me, and that\u2019s when I mentioned you would be difficult to convince because you don\u2019t believe people change. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Great. It\u2019s all clear now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, raising her voice. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me. I would never betray a personal confidence. Your feelings about what the world will and won\u2019t do didn\u2019t feel like a secret. If I was wrong, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I get it now. Rudy is your ticket out. How many millions in billing does he bring into a law firm? Two? Three? When you land somewhere, you bring him with you. That\u2019s got to be pretty hard for any law firm to resist. In the face of that, how can anyone else matter? My mistake for not seeing that. No wonder you\u2019re spending all your time kissing his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so unfair.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cI refuse to apologize for wanting to return to my real law career and handle something serious and important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImportant, huh? What? Finding a legal loophole so a corporation doesn\u2019t have to pay taxes? There\u2019s a profession to be proud of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re insulting what I do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust clearing the air, babe.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into her palms. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me babe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, why not? We\u2019re tight. Aren\u2019t I your local source of entertainment? Be sure to stop by before you head out to your next big career move. We can do each other before you go. Because hey, the sex was great.\u201d</p><p>All the color drained from Jill\u2019s face. She opened her mouth, closed it, then turned on her heel and left.</p><p>Mac watched her go. The second the glass door closed behind her, his anger and energy spilled away, leaving him feeling slimy and spent.</p><p>What the hell had he been thinking? Why had he wanted to hurt Jill? A voice inside whispered, because he\u2019d been hurt, but that didn\u2019t make any sense. He\u2019d known the rules when he\u2019d gotten involved with her. That this was temporary\u2014fun between friends. Nothing about that had changed. So why did he feel like shit inside?</p><p>He walked into the main office, then to the front desk.</p> <p>\u201cJill say anything about a wife beater?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Wilma handed him a piece of paper with two names. \u201cWant to tell me what happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY MINUTES LATER Mac parked in front of a small bungalow-style house. The place couldn\u2019t be more than eight hundred square feet, with a narrow, cracked cement walk leading from the sidewalk to the front door.</p><p>The paint had long since faded to a pale gray and the screens were torn, but every inch looked unnaturally clean. Even the splintering flower boxes by the front window were pristine, if empty.</p><p>He walked to the door and knocked. After a minute or two, a young woman answered. He introduced himself and asked if he could come in for a few minutes.</p><p>Kim Murphy might be twenty-four, but she looked sixteen and incredibly pregnant. She\u2019d been pretty at one time; now she just looked scared. The kind of scared that came from a lifetime of living in fear of her life. Her eyes were wary, and her mouth quivered at the corner.</p> <p>\u201cAndy\u2019s not here,\u201d she said, her eyes darting between him and the patrol car parked in front, as if expecting to see her husband bolt out of the back and hurtle to ward her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me letting anyone in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk right here,\u201d Mac said quietly, going for a calm and safe tone.</p><p>She bit her lower lip, then held open the door. Apparently her fear of Andy knowing someone had come inside was less than her fear of a neighbor seeing Mac lurking at her front door.</p><p>The tiny living room was as spotless as the front of the house. The throw rug had been vacuumed down to the backing. The sofa was covered in plastic, as was the only chair. He figured they could do emergency surgery on the dining table he saw to the left.</p><p>\u201cYou keep a very tidy house,\u201d he said as he settled on the plastic-covered sofa. \u201cYour husband must be very proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndy likes things clean,\u201d Kim said as she brushed at the plastic on the chair, before perching on the edge. \u201cI like to make him happy.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was so earnest, so eager to please. Mac wanted to grab her and forcibly take her with him. Did she know what was going to happen when her neat-freak husband found out how messy a baby could be? Had she considered the hell she was getting into?</p><p>He studied her face, searching for clues. They were there\u2014a tiny scar by her right temple, a barely noticeable drooping at the corner of her left eye. The cast, of course. He would bet there were others\u2014that her body would be both a road map and a testament to her husband\u2019s temper.</p> <p>On the way over, Mac had tried to think of the best way to talk to Kim. Now, in face of her youth, her pain and her pregnancy, he went for the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, careful to keep his voice low and as nonthreatening as he could make it. \u201cAt first he just slapped you around some. But now it\u2019s worse. Your eye, the scars on your legs, the bro ken arm.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you love him,\u201d he said as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cOf course you do. He\u2019s your husband. And he\u2019s always sorry and you know in your heart that if you could just stop making mistakes, everything would be great between you. Because he used to be so sweet. Right? Back when you first started going out, wasn\u2019t he the best?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved up and she nodded. \u201cHe was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not anymore. And here\u2019s the thing, Kim. He\u2019s not going to be happy with the baby. Babies don\u2019t stay quiet. They don\u2019t keep to schedules and they don\u2019t clean up after themselves. Andy is going to be very, very angry. And when he puts you in the hospital, who is going to take care of your child?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know he is. This situation is escalating. After he puts you in the hospital a few times, he\u2019s going to turn on your child. Then he\u2019ll be beating the two of you and eventually someone is going to wind up dead.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, willing her to believe him. \u201cWe can stop this right now. I can arrest him and hold him in jail long enough for you to get away. There are places you can go where he\u2019ll never find you. Never. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>A single tear leaked out of her eye and rolled down her cheek. \u201cYou have to go,\u201d she said, not looking at him. \u201cYou have to go, because sometimes Andy comes home for lunch and if he found you here...\u201d</p><p>There would be hell to pay, Mac thought. More than hell.</p><p>\u201cKim, please.\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked to the door. \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>Mac did as she requested. Feeling useless and angry and as if he\u2019d only made things worse, he walked to his car and watched her carefully close the door.</p><p>JILL RETURNED to her office and was surprised to find Tina working at her desk. She resisted the urge to snap and instead nodded as she stalked past.</p><p>\u201cYou have a one o\u2019clock,\u201d Tina called. \u201cHe should be here any second.\u201d</p><p>Perfect, Jill thought, wondering how she was going to keep her temper in check. She still didn\u2019t understand what had happened with Mac. Okay, she could see how he might have misunderstood her conversation with Rudy, but why wouldn\u2019t he let her explain? And how dare he insult what she did for a living? That was hitting below the belt.</p><p>She still wanted to slap something. Or throw something. The fish offered a tempting target but, before she could figure out who would fly across the room best, she heard the front door open and a man speaking to Tina.</p><p>Later, she promised herself as she sat behind her desk and drew in several calming breaths. She had a second to glance down at the note by the appointment\u2014\u201cwants to sue neighbor for theft\u201d\u2014then Tina showed the man in.</p><p>He was tall, beefy, late forties, with the permanent tan of someone who makes his living outdoors.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wolcott,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is Jill Strathern.\u201d</p><p>Jill rose and held out her hand. \u201cMr. Wolcott. A plea sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Bob,\u201d he told her, and smiled. When he\u2019d taken his seat, he glanced around. \u201cGreat office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, do you fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Not like this though. What a beaut.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to a particularly large, ugly fish of indeterminate origin. As Jill didn\u2019t want to hear about the wonders of catching so many prize specimens, she pulled out a pad of legal paper and picked up a pen.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re having a problem with a neigh bor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah. That bitch. She lives down the street from me and has always wanted my dog. You know,\u201d he raised his voice to a falsetto. \u201cIf Bucky ever has puppies I really want one.\u201d Mr. Wolcott grimaced. \u201cThe dog\u2019s name is Buck. Who the hell calls a dog Bucky?\u201d</p><p>Jill told herself to remain calm. This wasn\u2019t as it seemed. Bob was having trouble coming to the point. There was no way he\u2019d come to see her about his dog.</p><p>\u201cYour neighbor down the street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSissy Dawson. What the hell kind of name is Sissy? Probably why she can\u2019t keep my dog\u2019s name straight. She\u2019s a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you mentioned.\u201d</p><p>He placed both of his massive hands on the desk. \u201cShe kidnapped Buck.\u201d</p><p>Now they were getting somewhere...or not. \u201cYour dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes. Damn bitch held him for three days. When he came home, he was real whipped if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>Jill did not. Was there a drift? Could she please be on it and out of this town?</p><p>\u201cBob, I\u2019m not following you. Your concern is that your neighbor kidnapped your dog for three days, then returned him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you want to sue her for? Kidnapping?\u201d</p><p>He brightened. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. Sure. Kidnapping, but mostly theft.\u201d</p><p>Jill had a bad feeling she didn\u2019t want to know, but she had to ask. \u201cTheft of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck\u2019s sperm. She was always after me to have him mate with her damn dog and I refused. So when her dog went into heat, she kidnapped him and locked those two together for three damn days. She could have killed him.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later Jill showed Bob to the door after promising to research the problem. On her way back to her desk, she glanced up at the giant swordfish and wondered if there was any way to throw herself on the pointy part.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. Not any of it. Life hadn\u2019t gotten that unfair, had it? She had horrible law cases, was unable to help the one battered, pregnant person who really needed her, had a crummy ex-husband and furious ex-lover and assistant/secretary/receptionist who still hated her. If she didn\u2019t know she would regret it later, she would pick up the phone and call Rudy to ask him to take care of the lying rat fink weasel dog that was Lyle.</p><p>Just then the phone rang. Tina, of course, had left for the day. Jill grabbed the call herself.</p><p>\u201cJill Strathern,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Jill. I\u2019m Marsha Rawlings,\u201d the woman said, then rattled off the name of her San Diego law firm. \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t believe your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Please, please tell me you haven\u2019t already accepted another position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. We would love to talk to you as soon as possible. I see there\u2019s a private airfield just outside of Los Lobos. How about if we send the company plane to get you first thing in the morning? Would that work for you?\u201d</p><p>Jill looked at the fish, the empty reception area and her notes on the dog-sperm theft case.</p><p>\u201cIt would work perfectly. What time?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>JILL LEFT HER OFFICE a little after three. Tina had barely put in any time and Jill wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with more clients. While she figured the odds of someone coming by with a case more amazing than dog-sperm theft were slim, she didn\u2019t want to tempt fate more than necessary.</p><p>As she rounded the corner to her street, she saw Mac\u2019s truck parked in front of his house. The sight of the familiar pickup made her uncomfortable. She still didn\u2019t know what had happened between them. He couldn\u2019t possibility believe that she\u2019d told secrets to Rudy. Or that she would ever betray Mac.</p><p>But telling herself that his temper wasn\u2019t her problem didn\u2019t seem to be working. She wanted to talk to him and make things right, and even reminding herself she was excited about her interview in the morning didn\u2019t make her feel any better.</p><p>She walked up the front steps and entered her aunt\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d she called, knowing that if Mac were home then Emily would be with him.</p><p>\u201cJill? You\u2019re early,\u201d Bev yelled from upstairs. \u201cI was lying down. I\u2019ll be there in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jill kicked off her shoes and set down her purse. After wandering into the kitchen, she poked around a plate of cookies and picked up a frosted one. Clamping it between her teeth, she got a glass and poured milk, then sat at the kitchen table.</p><p>She hated feeling this out of sorts. Nothing was horribly wrong, but nothing was right, either.</p><p>\u201cI blame my father,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Bev asked as she bustled into the kitchen. \u201cOh, good. You found the cookies.\u201d</p><p>Jill took another bite. \u201cThey\u2019re great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily and I made them this morning. That girl is a whiz in the kitchen. I wonder if I should let Gracie know she\u2019s going to have some competition.\u201d</p><p>Jill smiled. \u201cInteresting thought.\u201d</p><p>Bev smoothed the front of her sundress and patted her braided hair. Jill watched her bring the plate to the table, then pull out a chair.</p> <p>\u201cYou look especially nice this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Bev looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything special. I\u2019m barely wearing any makeup.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, Jill thought, studying her more closely, but there was a definite glow in her cheeks and a gleam in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d Bev asked. \u201cHow is any thing his fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, he\u2019s the one who convinced me to temporarily fill in at the law firm here. If I\u2019d stayed in San Francisco...\u201d What would she be doing, exactly? Fighting Lyle for the condo? Living in a hotel and licking her wounds? Plotting revenge?</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to have a plan,\u201d she said, then drank some milk. \u201cI was supposed to be figuring out ways to make Lyle\u2019s life a living hell. What happened to that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got busy and found more important things to do with your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But what does it say about my marriage that a month or so after the fact, I barely think about the guy?\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t feel you have to answer the question.\u201d She reached for another cookie. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have married Lyle. I never loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was what you needed at the time.\u201d</p><p>Jill wrinkled her nose. \u201cLet\u2019s not think about what that says about me. Yuck. I have another interview tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt squeezed her arm. \u201cI know that\u2019s what you want, even though the thought of you leaving makes me sad. I\u2019ve liked having you around.\u201d</p><p>Jill stood and bent over her aunt, then hugged her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been wonderful. I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate you taking me this summer. I\u2019ve had the best time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d</p><p>Jill sank back in her seat and sighed. \u201cNothing turns out like we thought, huh? Maybe I should let you read my cards and give me a hint or two about the future.\u201d</p> <p>Bev stood and crossed to the sink, where she began rinsing dishes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s such a good idea. At least not today. I\u2019m not feeling all that in tune with the cards.\u201d</p><p>Before Jill could ask why, she heard footsteps upstairs.</p><p>\u201cIs Emily here?\u201d she asked. \u201cI saw Mac\u2019s truck next door and thought he was with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He came home a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who...\u201d She pressed her lips together, suddenly not sure she wanted to hear an answer. After all, there weren\u2019t that many choices and she didn\u2019t like any of them.</p><p>Her string of not-so-great luck continued less than a minute later when Rudy came downstairs and walked into the kitchen. To Jill\u2019s amazement, he moved over to Bev, took her in his arms and kissed her. Seriously kissed her. Jill thought she might have seen a bit of tongue before she gathered herself together enough to look away.</p><p>Rudy? Here? Now? Upstairs?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping together?\u201d she blurted before she could stop herself.</p><p>Rudy straightened and grinned. \u201cYou aunt is a very sensual woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want to know that,\u201d Jill said as she put down the cookie and tried not to get anything close to a visual of what they\u2019d been doing.</p><p>She risked a glance at Bev, who looked both flustered and pleased. \u201cSo what about staying pure for the gift?\u201d</p><p>Bev sighed. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but my feelings for Rudy are more powerful than my need to stay pure for my calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>Rudy winked. \u201cHey, I\u2019m Italian. You know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she didn\u2019t and was happy to keep it that way. \u201cTell me you at least waited until Mac took Emily home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Bev sounded shocked. \u201cShe\u2019s just a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Wish we could all say the same about me.\u201d She stood. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll go and get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Rudy said, slipping an arm around Bev\u2019s waist and pulling her close. \u201cI\u2019m taking her back to my place. We\u2019ll grab some dinner or something.\u201d</p><p>It was the \u201csomething\u201d that gave Jill the willies. \u201cOkay, then. I guess I\u2019ll see you...tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Bev leaned against Rudy and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in time to take care of Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You two have fun.\u201d</p><p>Jill ducked out of the room and headed for the stairs. When she reached her room, she carefully closed the door, threw herself on the bed and covered her face with a pillow. Only then did she allow herself to scream.</p><p>Rudy and Bev having sex? Why oh why did she have to know that? It wasn\u2019t that she begrudged them any happiness. Bev had always chosen to be alone and that seemed to make her happy. If now she wanted to be with a man, Jill thought it was fabulous. She wasn\u2019t sure she would have chosen Rudy as the guy, but it also wasn\u2019t her decision.</p><p>No, her discomfort didn\u2019t come from their relationship\u2014it was much more primal than that. Bev was the closest thing to a mother Jill had known since she was Emily\u2019s age, and thinking about the woman who\u2019d raised her doing it with anyone was a serious violation of the ick factor.</p><p>She tossed the pillow away and sat up. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d come upstairs without calling out?\u201d she asked herself. \u201cI might have seen something.\u201d</p><p>The thought made her shudder. She supposed children never really wanted to hear about their parents being sexual creatures. No doubt there was a biological reason for that and she should just let it go.</p><p>She could hear them moving around, probably packing for the big sleepover. Jill moved to her closet and quickly changed into shorts and a T-shirt. She pulled the pins from her hair and brushed it out, then slicked on sunscreen. A walk on the beach would help clear her head.</p><p>When she was ready, she plopped down on the bed to give Bev and Rudy plenty of time to make their escape. She touched the phone, wondering if she should check in with Gracie, then pulled her hand away. As much as she loved her friend, the person she most wanted to speak to was Mac, and he\u2019d made it clear he had no interest in talking to her.</p><p>MAC PUT DOWN the latest issue of Car and Driver and watched as Emily turned the page in her book. She read silently, completely engrossed in the story. A couple of strands of hair fell into her eyes and she brushed them away without looking up from her book.</p><p>She was so precious, he thought, his heart aching with love for her. Despite the problems he had with her, the past few weeks had been damned amazing.</p><p>He studied the shape of her cheek, her slender shoulders, then grimaced at the purple T-shirt she wore. Purple and blue days were always a bitch. Em might be eating regular food with everyone else, but she still insisted on matching colors with him. He supposed it was a form of punishment\u2014one that he\u2019d earned.</p><p>He leaned back on the sofa and rubbed the bridge of his nose. She was so young, he thought sadly. Too young to have experienced all she had. To think he\u2019d been the one to hurt her.</p><p>He\u2019d never wanted that to happen, mostly because he knew how horrible it was. He\u2019d only been a few years older than Emily when his father had disappeared from his life. His mother had complained his father was a bastard and no one should be surprised that he\u2019d finally run off. But Mac had been. Didn\u2019t every kid want his or her dad to be perfect?</p><p>He swore silently and looked at Em. Isn\u2019t that what she\u2019d wanted for him? Damn it all to hell if he hadn\u2019t let her down. He\u2019d made so many excuses for his own father, had waited and waited for him to come back. Had Emily done the same?</p><p>She put down her book. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou have a funny look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m just thinking about some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He crossed to her chair and crouched in front of her. Such small hands, he thought. She was so young and defenseless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Em,\u201d he said, and squeezed her fingers. \u201cMore sorry than I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201c\u2019Bout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore. When I went away.\u201d</p><p>She closed her book. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go away. Mommy and me did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You went away and I didn\u2019t come after you. I\u2019m sorry about that. I should have. I love you so much. You\u2019re my best-ever girl and I didn\u2019t come find you.\u201d</p><p>She shifted in her seat and drew her knees to her chest. \u201cI know,\u201d she said in a very small voice. \u201cI wanted you to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lost when I should have been looking for you and it took me a long time to find my way. And all that time you were waiting and wondering where I was. You probably wondered if I even loved you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said into the silence. \u201cI love you, Emily. You\u2019re the best part of my life. I\u2019ve loved you since be fore you were born and no matter what happens, I will always love you.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes seemed to see down to his soul. Was she looking for proof? He wished he could offer some thing other than his word. Time, he told himself through the ache. Time would help her see he could be trusted.</p><p>A single tear rolled down her cheek. He brushed it away with his finger.</p><p>\u201cIf I could go back to those days, I swear I\u2019d come look for you. You matter so much to me. I think you\u2019re special and wonderful and the most amazing daughter any dad could ever be blessed with. I\u2019m so proud of you all the time.\u201d</p><p>She made a noise in the back of her throat, then flung herself at him. He caught her against him and pulled her close. Thin arms wrapped around his throat, nearly strangling him, but he didn\u2019t mind. Em had been keeping her distance all summer. He planned to enjoy this hug for as long as it lasted.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispered into her ear. \u201cThank you for spending this time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>His chest tightened. Daddy. How long had it been since he\u2019d heard that?</p><p>He held her and rocked her. After a few minutes, he moved so he sat on the chair and she curled up on his lap. Still she clung to him. He stroked her back and kissed the top of her head. Finally she raised her tear-stained face and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The last band around his chest eased and he drew in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cAre you going to get lost again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve found my way. When you go home to be with your mom, we\u2019re going to work out a schedule so you and I can see each other a lot. We\u2019ll talk on the phone and send cards and do e-mail. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that a lot.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against his shoulder. He rocked her back and forth and thought about how empty the house would be when she was gone. She would leave a big hole in his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou must miss Mom a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her in a long time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She straightened and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Em had never been much of a liar and this wasn\u2019t any exception. He tucked her hair behind her ears and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I think maybe it would be okay for you to see your mom for a weekend this summer. I know she\u2019d like that a lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor real?\u201d his daughter asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. As long as you promise to come back.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cDaddy, you\u2019re the one who got lost, not me. I can find my way back just fine.\u201d</p><p>Words to live by, he thought.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll trust you completely,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you getting hungry? Ready for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She slid off his knee and stood. \u201cWhat are we having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny you should ask. I have a couple of surprises for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having ice cream?\u201d</p><p>He ruffled her hair. \u201cDid I say they were good surprises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeat loaf.\u201d He took her hand and led her toward the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make that,\u201d Emily said. \u201cBev and I made the meat loaf this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but she gave me a special gravy. It\u2019s purple.\u201d</p><p>His daughter looked doubtful. \u201cDoes it taste funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let me know. I\u2019m not eating it.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurple gravy. Yuck. What\u2019s next? Orange bacon?\u201d</p><p>She giggled some more.</p><p>He led her to the refrigerator. \u201cI want to show you this.\u201d He opened the door and pulled out a bowl of Jell-O.</p> <p>She stood on tiptoe and stared at the bowl for a long time. Finally she looked at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jell-O. Purple Jell-O. I made it this morning when I saw what you were wearing.\u201d</p><p>Her expression remained doubtful. \u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><p>He leaned close and whispered, \u201cBroccoli.\u201d</p><p>Emily jumped as if he\u2019d bitten her. Her eyes widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t put vegetables in Jell-O.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. I just did it. See.\u201d He shook the bowl and the contents wiggled. He had to admit the combination of grape Jell-O and broccoli turned his stomach, but he wasn\u2019t the one with the color rule.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s yummy,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWe can put the gravy on it.\u201d</p><p>She put out her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No purple broccoli? No purple gravy?\u201d He put the bowl on the counter and began to tickle her.</p><p>Em laughed and began to squirm, but he noticed she pushed to get closer, not to get away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d he demanded loudly? \u201cYou won\u2019t eat purple food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said with a shriek and grabbed his hands. \u201cNo purple food.\u201d She grinned. \u201cJust regular food, okay?\u201d</p><p>He touched the tip of her nose and knew they were going to be fine. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>JILL WALKED UP from the beach nearly three hours after she\u2019d left the house. She felt windblown and was sure her hair looked like a perm experiment gone bad. That was just on the outside. On the inside...she wasn\u2019t sure what she felt. Confused mostly. About her life, her career, Mac. Especially Mac.</p><p>Telling herself he shouldn\u2019t matter was one thing, but believing it? Not gonna happen. She\u2019d had a crush on him forever and, in the past month or so, they\u2019d become friends. More than friends. They\u2019d slept together. She didn\u2019t do that with just anyone.</p><p>Jill was pretty confident she wasn\u2019t in love with Mac, but she felt something. And when he\u2019d turned on her like a rabid dog for no good reason...</p><p>She still didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>A quick glance at her watch told her there was still plenty of time for a chick movie fest and a Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s marathon. As she\u2019d skipped dinner, only half the calories would count. If she remembered correctly there was Cookie Dough and Cherry Garcia in the freezer and what could be better than that?</p><p>As she crossed the street toward Bev\u2019s place, she didn\u2019t even look toward Mac\u2019s house. Whatever he was up to, she didn\u2019t care. If he wanted to\u2014</p><p>\u201cJill?\u201d</p><p>She froze in the middle of the street, torn between walking toward him and running away. Unfortunately, her long walk had left her legs sore, so running wasn\u2019t really an option\u2014not unless she wanted to risk permanent injury.</p><p>She sauntered toward the sidewalk, trying to look both unconcerned and uninterested.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, then shoved her hands into her back pockets.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked as he stepped off the porch.</p><p>She started to answer, then realized she couldn\u2019t speak. Not rationally, at least. The man was barefoot. Was that fair? Mac was sexy at the best of times, but with a worn T-shirt and shorts and barefoot, he was practically illegally attractive.</p><p>She stared down at the grass. \u201cI took a walk on the beach,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDealing with some things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I on the list?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and glared at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He moved toward her. \u201cI was a complete jerk and totally out of line.\u201d</p><p>She made a show of looking behind her before tapping her chest. \u201cWas that directed at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He stopped a few feet in front of her. Not within touching distance, but close enough to get her hormones singing a happy jingle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the pressure,\u201d he said, his blue eyes locked intently on her face. \u201cDealing with Emily, my job, the town. Then Rudy shows up and everything goes to hell.\u201d He held up a hand before she could speak. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s done anything. Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe he\u2019s not here to make trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to apologize. Maybe you could wait until I\u2019m done to argue with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good point. Okay, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty much it. I\u2019m sorry. When I heard you\u2019d talked to him, I overreacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d She tilted her head and shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t confide in Rudy. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d betrayed a confidence. And just for the record, he\u2019s not currently my client. At the rate things are going, he may never be again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a lot of interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, including one tomorrow. But I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019m cursed or something. The senior partner at that L.A. firm had a giant fish on the wall. Who knows what I\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cAntlers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but I do know I want us to stay friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He held out his arms. \u201cAm I forgiven?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stepped into his embrace. He was warm and strong and everything about touching him felt right. Jill gave herself over to the feeling of safety and home. Her eyes slid closed and she\u2014</p><p>Home? Where had that thought come from?</p><p>She quickly stepped back and tried to smile. \u201cSo, how are things otherwise?\u201d she asked, aware she was talking too quickly. \u201cNot to get you mad at me again, but the whole world is weird at my place.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cBev and Rudy are having a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>Mac winced. \u201cI could have gone all night without knowing about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only had to hear about it. I practically walked in on them. Bev is like my mother. I mean, ick.\u201d She held up both hands. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She\u2019s already promised to make sure Emily and Rudy aren\u2019t in the house together. You don\u2019t have to panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it where that guy\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. You think you can wait until he screws up before you get mad at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cWant to come in and have some wine or something?\u201d</p><p>To be honest, the \u201cor something\u201d was pretty tempting.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jill.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and saw Emily standing at the screen door.</p><p>\u201cHey, girlfriend,\u201d Jill called. \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I like your hair.\u201d</p><p>Jill fingered the curly frizz. \u201cI walked on the beach for a while. This always happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Emily looked at her father. \u201cCan we go get ice cream, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, kiddo. Put your shoes on.\u201d</p><p>Jill grinned as Emily raced away. \u201cSo you two are getting along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. We talked about some things today. She ate broccoli.\u201d</p><p>Jill was pleased. \u201cSo the food-matching thing seems to be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. I was running out of ideas.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cWant to come with us for ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Be with Mac and his daughter or spend the evening alone? Not much of a choice. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I have an idea that will make you very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She scooted a little closer. \u201cWhat might that be?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not that.\u201d He gave her a swift kiss on the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know being close to you kills me, right?\u201d</p><p>She felt the heat and the need ricocheting between them. \u201cI have a fair idea.\u201d</p><p>Emily burst out of the house before she could say anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your idea?\u201d Jill asked.</p><p>\u201cThat we take your car over to the high school parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that exciting?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThey start a new class of driver\u2019s training tomorrow. You could park right in the way.\u201d</p><p>Jill bent over and hugged Emily. \u201cYour daddy is a very smart man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the little girl said, and took her hand. \u201cWhat kind of ice cream do you want?\u201d</p><p>Emily grabbed ahold of her father with her other hand and started walking. Jill kept step with her and did her best not to look at Mac. This was all too weird, she told herself. They weren\u2019t a family.</p><p>Did she want them to be?</p><p>\u201cJill,\u201d Emily said as she tugged on her fingers. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one of everything.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE DOING WELL,\u201d Carly said quietly as Emily raced out of the room to grab Elvis.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and down,\u201d Mac admitted. \u201cIn the past few days it seems we\u2019ve come to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than that. She\u2019s wearing multiple colors. If you knew how many times I tried to get her to eat normally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe held out for a long time,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Carly sat on a kitchen chair. Her perfectly neat, perfectly straight hair suited her attractive features. In her tailored shorts and polo shirt, she looked like what she was\u2014a successful executive on vacation. She was, in theory, everything he could possibly want. So why couldn\u2019t he stop thinking about a curly-haired, impulsive, mouthy attorney who could make a man want to sell his soul for just one kiss?</p><p>\u201cEm can be stubborn,\u201d Carly said with a smile. \u201cI know she gets that from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou can get your back up about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe sometimes.\u201d She leaned toward him and grabbed his hand. \u201cHow\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy, can I bring a book?\u201d Emily called from upstairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.

We don\u2019t have any firm plans. Maybe hang out on the beach, catch a movie. That kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll enjoy it. She\u2019s missed you.\u201d</p><p>Carly nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve missed her, too. The house is quiet without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>His ex-wife squeezed his fingers. \u201cHow are things going with the social worker?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHollis?\u201d Mac felt his jaw clench. \u201cHe\u2019s a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re playing nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try. He thinks all cops make lousy fathers.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m sorry, Mac. I didn\u2019t want to make this more difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I\u2019m the one who screwed up, not you. You gave me plenty of chances. Now I have to prove myself. I\u2019m more than up to the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, but if this Hollis guy gets unreasonable, let me know. I\u2019ll set him straight.\u201d</p> <p>He released her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to fight my battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did. You were always so self-sufficient.\u201d She folded her arms on the table. \u201cThat guy I\u2019m seeing? It\u2019s getting serious.\u201d</p><p>Mac nodded, then braced himself for a physical reaction to the news. There wasn\u2019t any, except for some jealousy that if Carly married the guy, he would get to see Em on a daily basis.</p><p>\u201cIs he one of the good guys?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s terrific. I\u2019m going to tell Em about him. Just casually. But I wanted you to know\u2014in case she\u2019s upset.\u201d She glanced at him, then down at the table. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting married or anything. It\u2019s too soon to talk about that, but I wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the heads-up.\u201d He touched her chin so she had to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would be. It\u2019s not as if we were a great love affair.\u201d</p><p>Mac knew she was right. What had started out as a casual relationship had turned serious when Carly had gotten pregnant. Mac had done the right thing and pro posed. Together they\u2019d done their best to form a family, but neither of them had ever been in love with the other.</p> <p>\u201cI cared about you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. You were willing to be a husband and a father. I thanked you for that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A lot. You didn\u2019t have to. I wanted to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter why?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m glad I have her and I\u2019m glad we were together. I hope you\u2019ll find someone to make you happy. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to settle down\u2014fall in love, get married again.\u201d</p><p>He held up both hands. \u201cNot this week. I have a full schedule already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re still punishing yourself, aren\u2019t you? Jeez, Mac, you need to let it go.\u201d</p><p>He thought maybe she was right, but this wasn\u2019t the time to have that conversation.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to have to come back in a couple of months and give you a stern talking-to?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen have at it.\u201d</p><p>JILL WALKED into her office shortly after ten in the morning. As it was Saturday, she hadn\u2019t planned to come in at all, but she\u2019d felt too restless to stay home and watch time crawl by. Her glow from her fabulous interview in San Diego had faded. There was plenty to keep her busy. It wasn\u2019t as if Tina did anything like filing or even organizing paperwork.</p><p>So she would take the morning to catch up, while waiting for Mac\u2019s \u201call clear\u201d phone call, at which point she would dash over to his house and indulge in a couple of hours of very exciting, very hot lovemaking.</p><p>While the logical part of her brain was happy that he felt comfortable enough with Emily to let her spend the day with her mother, her hormones and pretty much every part of her covered with skin was delighted to have another chance at a close encounter with a man who could take her clear to another dimension.</p><p>Anticipation added a little spring to her step and made her hum as she sorted through files. At this point, she doubted she would much mind doing research on the dog-sperm case.</p><p>She paused, file folder in hand. \u201cScratch that,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI do mind about the dog sperm. It\u2019s just too weird.\u201d</p><p>She could understand if the woman wanted Bob to pay support for the puppies, but she didn\u2019t. Who cared if Buck had donated sperm? He wasn\u2019t a prizewinner. Besides, it sounded to her as if Buck had enjoyed his time with the in-heat dog. Was he complaining?</p><p>\u201cNot my decision to make,\u201d she reminded herself. \u201cIf the client wants to sue, then I need to take the case seriously.\u201d</p><p>She winced as she pictured herself in court, arguing the case, and had a momentary wish that she hadn\u2019t been fair and levelheaded when it came to the property settlement with Lyle.</p><p>She\u2019d nearly finished with the filing when the phone rang. Thinking it might be Mac telling her it was time, she reached over Tina\u2019s desk and grabbed it after one ring.</p><p>\u201cLaw offices,\u201d she said in what she hoped was a sexy voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Someone\u2019s there. Hi. I\u2019m looking for Mr. Dixon.\u201d</p><p>The official-sounding woman on the other end of the phone didn\u2019t sound the least bit like Mac. Darn and double darn, Jill thought.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to speak to him regarding a legal matter or is this personal?\u201d Jill asked.</p><p>\u201cLegal. I\u2019m calling on behalf of one of his clients.\u201d</p><p>Good. Not a long-lost family member looking for a favorite uncle or godfather. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. Dixon passed away about three months ago. I\u2019m Jill Strathern. I\u2019m handling his practice.\u201d For now...on a very temporary basis. \u201cIf you would like I can help you or I can collect the information and send it on to another attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman sounded flummoxed. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine needing another attorney. I assume you can handle a will and any probate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019m phoning to inform you that Donovan Whitefield has died. Just this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jill walked around the desk and sank onto Tina\u2019s chair. Old man Whitefield? Riley Whitefield\u2019s rich uncle?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you a member of the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI\u2019m Mr. Whitefield\u2019s housekeeper. The family will have to be notified.\u201d She sighed. \u201cActually there\u2019s only Mr. Whitefield\u2019s nephew. Everyone else is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get in touch with him right away. Have arrangements been made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in the will. I need you to tell me what they are so I can take care of things. There\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p><p>No one but paid staff? Jill grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on it and get back to you. Give me a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jill took the woman\u2019s name and number, then hung up. Old man Whitefield dead. It didn\u2019t seem possible. He was as much an institution in this town as the bank he owned. And Riley was his only living relative.</p><p>Not good, she thought as she rose and headed upstairs for the files in storage. From what she remembered, Riley and the old man had never been close. They\u2019d become estranged years ago and she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been back since. Had Donovan left everything to his nephew, or some charity?</p><p>Jill searched for a few minutes before she found the right files, then she carried everything downstairs. She carefully read the letters, Dixon\u2019s notes and then the will itself. When she\u2019d finished, she leaned back in her chair and stared at the fish on the far side of the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot of money and a whole lot of strings. A man could strangle on them all.\u201d</p><p>She thought about what she remembered about Riley. Gracie had loved him for years. He\u2019d been good friends with Mac until they\u2019d had a falling-out. Together they\u2019d ruled high school\u2014two young gods, one dark, one light, both bad to the bone.</p><p>Mac had changed, she reminded herself. Maybe Riley had, too. Maybe he wasn\u2019t the brooding, dark-haired loner who could cause a woman to go up in flames with a single glance. Maybe he\u2019d become respectable\u2014even boring. Maybe he was married with three kids, a dog and an SUV.</p><p>She looked at the phone number handwritten on the inside of the file and shook her head. Looked like she was about to find out.</p><p>MAC DROVE toward Jill\u2019s office. He\u2019d received her note that she would be at her office until he was ready. Well, Em had left with her mother, Mac had cleared up a few problems at his desk at work and now he was ready. More than ready, he thought with a grin. Parts of him were damn impatient.</p><p>He checked his watch. Carly had promised to have Em home by seven-thirty, which meant even leaving an hour as a buffer, he and Jill had eight hours together. While it didn\u2019t sound like nearly enough time to do all he had planned, it was a start. With a little luck, by this time tomorrow they would both be grinning like fools and walking funny.</p><p>He stopped at the corner and checked before cruising into the intersection. A car turned left in front of him into the barbershop parking lot. Mac kept going straight about twenty feet, then he pulled to the side of the road.</p><p>The sixth sense that kept cops alive had just twitched to life. The barbershop parking lot had been full. It was Saturday. Artie, the barber, never worked on weekends. Instead he stayed open late two nights a week.</p><p>Mac swore under his breath, then checked the mirrors before hanging a U-turn and heading back the way he\u2019d come. He pulled into the crowded parking lot behind the building and watched as two men took the back stairs up to the second floor.</p><p>Mac knew what was there\u2014a big empty room where a couple of the smaller lodges met. The place could also be rented for parties and civic functions.</p><p>He told himself it was probably nothing. Just a meeting he hadn\u2019t been told about. Jill was waiting\u2014his dick was hard. This wasn\u2019t the time to go investigate. Still, he found himself parking, then climbing out of his truck and heading up the stairs. Telling himself it was nothing didn\u2019t make that damn twitching go away.</p><p>He pushed open the door and felt his temper explode. Tables had been set up at the far end of the room. An equal number of men and women sat playing cards. A makeshift bar did a steady business in the back. The current racing odds covered a dry-erase board up front, there was an honest-to-God roulette wheel spinning away in the center of the room and a craps table next to it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want this to be happening. Dammit all to hell, he hated being right.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said loudly into the crowd. A few folks glanced up. Several swore. In three seconds, he had the whole room\u2019s attention.</p><p>He strolled toward the bar and nodded at the man behind it. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can show me a liquor license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t have it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around and didn\u2019t see Rudy. Had he called in a few employees to handle things here? A small-time gambling operation wouldn\u2019t be much fun for a man of Rudy\u2019s talents.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in charge?\u201d Mac asked as several of his citizens began to quietly collect their winnings and stand.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d A small man in a dark suit approached. \u201cHello, Sheriff. Good to see you. Can I get you something?\u201d</p><p>Mac reached for his radio. \u201cWilma, we\u2019ve got ourselves a situation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The little man in the suit blanched. \u201cSheriff, that\u2019s not necessary, is it? These are good people, just having a little fun.\u201d</p><p>Mac knew he could arrest them all, but what was the point? They hadn\u2019t started the trouble. That honor lay elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rudy?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Casaccio doesn\u2019t discuss his plans with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You and your staff are going to stay right here. The rest of you.\u201d He glanced at the crowd gathering by the door. \u201cTake it slow down the stairs. I don\u2019t want any pushing.\u201d</p><p>While they left, he called for backup. When D.J. arrived along with one of the other deputies, Mac arrested Rudy\u2019s employees and left D.J. in charge of taking them in.</p><p>Los Lobos wasn\u2019t that large, he told himself as he drove away. He would be able to find a long black limo, then have a little chat with the owner.</p><p>Two streets over he saw the vehicle in question in front of Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill. Mac pulled in behind, close enough that the limo couldn\u2019t get out, then walked toward the restaurant.</p> <p>It was still early for the lunch crowd, especially on a Saturday. He had no trouble spotting Rudy, although the gangster\u2019s companion didn\u2019t make him happy. Mayor Franklin Yardley sat across from Rudy.</p><p>As Mac approached, the two men glanced up. Rudy shifted toward the wall of their booth.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Kendrick, join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He kept his gaze on Rudy, watching for any kind of reaction. But Rudy was too smooth and practiced for that. He raised his eyebrows expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Mac?\u201d the mayor asked.</p> <p>\u201cAsk your friend.\u201d</p><p>Rudy swirled his glass of iced tea and looked pleasantly baffled. \u201cI have no idea why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room above the barbershop is being used for gambling. I thought I\u2019d find out what you know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d Rudy said smoothly.</p><p>Franklin frowned. \u201cSheriff, are you accusing Mr. Casaccio of something?\u201d</p><p>Mac glared at him. \u201cYou got that right. Your friend here is bringing his dirty business to our town. Don\u2019t you get that? He\u2019s out for a buck and he doesn\u2019t care who or what gets destroyed in the process.\u201d</p><p>Franklin frowned. \u201cThose are pretty serious accusations. Do you have any evidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis employees are running the place.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy sipped his tea, then picked up a tortilla chip. \u201cInteresting. Except for Mr. Smith\u2014\u201d he nodded at the small table next to the booth where the suit-clad body guard sat over a plate of enchiladas \u201c\u2014and the driver of my car, I have no employees in town. I\u2019m here strictly on holiday.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance grew into anger. Mac turned to the mayor. \u201cYou can\u2019t be blind to this. Your town is being overrun by organized crime. Sure, now it\u2019s just a friendly game of poker, but then what? Can\u2019t you see this is already escalating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff, you\u2019re accusing one of our leading citizens of some fairly serious charges. Do you have any evidence?\u201d</p><p>Mac stared at the two of them. Was Franklin so deeply in Rudy\u2019s pockets that he refused to see the truth? Or did the man seriously think Rudy wouldn\u2019t destroy Los Lobos?</p><p>As for evidence, Mac knew there wasn\u2019t any. The people they\u2019d arrested would claim to have never met Rudy Casaccio, much less worked for him. No doubt a very experienced, very expensive lawyer would show up to get them out on bail and when the time came for trial, the judge would dismiss all charges. He\u2019d seen it hap pen before, but he never thought it would happen here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to nail you for this,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Rudy sighed. \u201cAnd here I\u2019d wanted to make a sizable contribution to your campaign. Aren\u2019t you running in November?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need money from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t know what we need, Sheriff. Just remember, I\u2019m always willing to be a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Mac glanced at Franklin. \u201cYou\u2019re making a big mistake. He\u2019s taking you places you don\u2019t want to go, and if you can\u2019t see that, you\u2019re a bigger idiot than I thought.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned on his heel and stalked out of the restaurant. Temper fueled him until he wanted to punch something. Anything. Dammit all to hell, this could not be happening.</p><p>Too angry to drive, he left the car by the restaurant. Let Rudy have to call the station to get it moved so he could get his limo out.</p><p>Two blocks later, Mac wasn\u2019t any closer to calming down. Why was he the only one who saw the truth about Rudy? Everyone else thought he was God\u2019s gift to Los Lobos. Jill was his friend, the mayor was his slave and even Bev was dating the guy. It didn\u2019t make sense. Was he the only one who\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey, you. Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Mac turned toward the man on the corner. He stood across the street from the sheriff\u2019s office. Medium height, sandy-blond hair and mean-looking. Mac clenched his fists. He was more than in the mood for a fight.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d he asked, his voice thick with menace. Anyone with a brain would know to back away. This guy only moved closer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a problem. You\u2019re the problem.\u201d The man approached, stopping less than a foot in front of Mac. \u201cWhere do you get off bugging my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>Mac had heard all right, but it didn\u2019t mean anything. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to see my wife the other day. She didn\u2019t tell me because she thought I\u2019d be mad, and she was right about that.\u201d The man leaned in close. \u201cKeep your stinking hands off her.\u201d</p><p>Mac could only think of one woman he\u2019d visited in the past few days. \u201cYou\u2019re Kim Murphy\u2019s husband,\u201d he said. \u201cAndy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Mac turned his back and headed for the office. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to deal with you and your crap.\u201d</p><p>He heard Andy run up behind him. \u201cCome on, you coward pig,\u201d Andy yelled. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from me.\u201d</p><p>Mac couldn\u2019t believe it. He stopped and turned to face Andy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI sure do. Where the hell do you get off talking to my wife? She\u2019s mine, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your wife, not your possession, you disgusting piece of shit. You have no right to treat her the way you do. If you\u2019re looking for a fight, go beat up on someone your own size.\u201d</p><p>Andy\u2019s eyes brightened with temper. \u201cYou volunteering? Because I\u2019m happy to take you on.\u201d</p><p>Mac shook his head. \u201cYou and what army? You\u2019re a bully. You wouldn\u2019t dare hit someone who would fight back. You might get hurt. You\u2019re the kind of man who gets his kicks beating up on defenseless women. You\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Color darkened Andy\u2019s face. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife, which is the same as saying she\u2019s my dog. I\u2019ll do anything I want to her and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>Mac felt his control slip. He tried to grab it, then figured what the hell. He punched Andy square on the jaw. The man staggered a few steps and shot out his fist, but Mac avoided it easily. Two more well-placed blows and the whole thing was over. Andy knelt on the asphalt, holding his nose and groaning. Mac stood over him, un touched and knowing he\u2019d just made a really big mistake.</p><p>Seconds later the front doors of the sheriff\u2019s office banged open and everyone on duty poured into the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Wilma asked. \u201cYou got in a fight?\u201d</p><p>Mac glanced from his bleeding knuckles to Andy\u2019s battered face. His stomach balled into a knot.</p><p>Andy staggered to his feet. \u201cHe jumped me. He can\u2019t do that, even if he\u2019s the sheriff. He just beat the crap out of me and I want him arrested and thrown in jail.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>JILL HAD BARELY FINISHED her brief conversation with Riley Whitefield when the phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cLaw offices,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJill? It\u2019s Wilma. You need to get down here right away. Mac was just in a fistfight and the guy wants to press charges.\u201d</p><p>Still clutching the phone, Jill stood and grabbed her purse. \u201cWhat? Wilma, you\u2019re not making sense. Mac was in a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. He cracked the guy good. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t deserve it, but he sure doesn\u2019t need the trouble. Not now.\u201d</p><p>Jill wasn\u2019t sure which \u201che\u201d they were talking about, but she decided it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there. Don\u2019t let Mac leave until I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not going anywhere for a while. We have to figure out how to keep from arresting him.\u201d With that, the older woman hung up.</p><p>\u201cArresting him?\u201d Jill repeated as she raced to the front of the office and quickly locked the door. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Arrest Mac? Not only would that seriously impact his ability to do his job, what about the custody issues with Emily? There were some basic requirements put in place by the courts and one of them was to stay out of trouble. Getting arrested could fall into that category.</p><p>She had the BMW with her, so the trip across town took less than ten minutes. She parked and rushed inside to find the place in bedlam. Deputies were standing around talking about how Mac had done the right thing. Mac sat on the corner of a desk with a bag of ice wrapped around his knuckles. Wilma hovered over him, clucking like a mother hen, and in a back office, a man gestured wildly while blood trickled from his nose.</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d Jill muttered under her breath. She might specialize in corporate law, but she knew enough about how the world worked to suspect Mac was in a truck load of trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked as she pushed through the deputies and approached Mac. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and she was relieved to see he wasn\u2019t hurt. Well, except for his knuckles.</p><p>Mac\u2019s dark blue eyes seemed filled with pain, but not the physical kind. \u201cI\u2019m completely screwed,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. He punched you first, right?\u201d</p><p>Wilma shooed the deputies away, while Mac shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure he got a punch off.\u201d</p><p>The girly part of her was pleased her man was such a good fighter. The lawyer part winced.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened. Start from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Mac explained about Andy approaching him and how he\u2019d told him to stay away from Kim.</p><p>\u201cHe said she was his wife, which was the same as saying she was his dog and he could do anything he wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he threatened you,\u201d Jill said, trying to get it all straight.</p><p>\u201cNo, he threatened me before. I punched him after the dog comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did threaten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>Mac glanced back at the rear office where Andy held a cloth to his nose. \u201cSomeone get him out of here. Take him to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>D.J. moved closer. \u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea, boss? Should we just take him home and let him cool off?\u201d</p><p>Jill knew what the deputy was thinking. A trip to the hospital meant paperwork, which could later be used as evidence.</p><p>Mac narrowed his gaze. \u201cTake him to the hospital now. Then have someone drive him home. We\u2019ll get his car to him later. In the meantime, send someone to his house to get Kim out of there for a few hours. She can\u2019t be around when he\u2019s released from the hospital. He\u2019ll want to take his pain out on someone and I don\u2019t want that to be her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of Kim,\u201d Wilma said as she collected her purse from her desk drawer. \u201cI used to know her mother before she moved to L.A. I\u2019ll go over for a visit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee if you can convince her to spend the night some where else.\u201d Mac removed the ice and flexed his hand. \u201cOtherwise he\u2019s going to beat the crap out of her.\u201d</p><p>Jill was afraid he was right. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she said.</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cSure I did. There\u2019s always a choice. But I had a hell of a morning and then this guy showed up, looking for a fight. So I gave it to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s what the district attorney is going to say on Monday morning when Andy wants to press charges? I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jill wanted to stamp her foot in frustration. \u201cSo Andy gets to treat his pregnant wife like a punching bag, even break a few bones and that\u2019s fine, but when you teach him a lesson, you get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Mac stared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d She moved close and took his hand in hers. The knuckles were split and swollen. \u201cYou clocked him good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a lot of practice when I was a kid. I guess that\u2019s something a guy doesn\u2019t forget how to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said as she touched his shoulder. \u201cCan I do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me the name of a good lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s going to go that far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue. But I do know the second Hollis Bass finds out, there\u2019s going to be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s eyes widened. The social worker. She\u2019d forgotten about him. \u201cHe already thinks cops make lousy fathers and that you have an anger-control issue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for reminding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mac, this could be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He turned away and stared out the window. \u201cThe thing is, I have no one to blame but myself. I should have walked away. Now the joint-custody agreement is at risk. And for what?\u201d</p><p>She felt sick to her stomach. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but not in a humorous way. \u201cI think you\u2019ve done enough already.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that your out-of-town friend, the one who is only here looking for a good time, seems to have brought his old ways along.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. What had Rudy done? She braced herself. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI closed down a tidy gambling club this morning. It was very nice. Bar, craps table, the whole thing. Of course no one working there claims to know Rudy, but you and I have been around the block a few times. We know who\u2019s responsible.\u201d</p><p>He turned cold eyes on her. \u201cUnless you want to convince me that I have it all wrong and that Rudy has changed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak. This wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real bummer, too,\u201d Mac continued. \u201cBecause Rudy offered me a sizable contribution to my campaign. Not that I expect to be running. What with the mayor in Rudy\u2019s back pocket, I would say my chances of reelection are close to zero.\u201d He stood. \u201cGood to know that Rudy\u2019s a changed man, because I\u2019d hate to meet up with him when he was still breaking the law.\u201d</p><p>With that he walked toward his office. Jill watched him go. She felt cold inside. Cold and sad. She and Mac were to have spent the afternoon together. Hard to believe that everything could change for the worst in such a short period of time.</p><p>JILL ARRIVED at her office on Monday shortly after nine. She felt as if she\u2019d been run over by a big truck. Everything inside of her hurt and she couldn\u2019t say why.</p><p>Okay, lack of sleep had something to do with it. She\u2019d spent most of the previous night pacing. And maybe not eating contributed to her situation. She hadn\u2019t been able to choke down a bite since Saturday morning.</p><p>Adding to her being out of sorts was the fact that she hadn\u2019t seen Mac, either. While she\u2019d spent most of Sun day spying out her front window, she\u2019d never seen his truck or his sheriff\u2019s car parked in his driveway. Had he and Emily left town? Had Mac\u2019s ex-wife found out about the fight and taken the girl away and had Mac disappeared who knows where?</p><p>Rudy was also missing in action, which annoyed the hell out of her. When she\u2019d returned home Saturday, she\u2019d found a note from her aunt saying she and Rudy had taken off for San Francisco for the rest of the weekend, and that Jill wasn\u2019t to worry. Jill had paged Rudy, but he hadn\u2019t bothered getting in touch with her.</p><p>He\u2019d probably figured out that she was very unhappy with him. How dare he tell her he was just in town for some R and R, only to set up an illegal gambling operation. She might not want to spend the rest of her life in Los Lobos, but by God she wasn\u2019t going to stand by and watch Rudy destroy the town.</p><p>Plus, he\u2019d betrayed her. As much as she wanted to, she couldn\u2019t ignore that hard truth. She\u2019d known Rudy for nearly three years and, in all that time, he\u2019d been completely aboveboard with her. There hadn\u2019t been a hint of illegal activity. The businesses she dealt with were squeaky-clean enough to be models of what to do to stay on the right side of the law.</p><p>Had he been playing her for a fool? Okay, so she wasn\u2019t technically his lawyer anymore, but hadn\u2019t he told her he would bring his business to her when she got settled? She\u2019d been counting on that three million in billing to put a smile on her new employer\u2019s face. It looked as if that wasn\u2019t going to be happening. It had been one thing to represent Rudy when, to the best of her knowledge, he\u2019d been completely legit. Now that she knew firsthand about illegal activities, she didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with him.</p><p>She got out of her car and walked to the front door. Okay, technically she didn\u2019t know firsthand, but she knew Mac wouldn\u2019t lie, which meant\u2014</p><p>The door was open. Jill had a brief thought that some one had broken into the office before she realized she could smell coffee and hear someone humming. Had Tina decided to show up at a decent time?</p><p>Jill stepped inside. Sure enough her assistant/secretary/receptionist was already behind her desk and hard at work. Papers spit out of the computer printer, the copy machine zipped back and forth fast enough to make the entire stand shake and, surprise of surprises, the \u201cto be filed\u201d box was empty.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Tina said cheerfully as Jill carefully stepped into the office.</p><p>Had aliens descended and abducted Tina, only to put a perky look-alike in her place?</p><p>\u201cMorning. What time did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight. My husband\u2019s staying home with the kids this morning, so I thought I\u2019d get an early start.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t know what to say. As she crossed toward her own office, she noticed several packing boxes and\u2014her breath caught in her throat\u2014fish filling the boxes. Fish that were no longer on the walls. There was a serious absence of fish.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking them down?\u201d she asked, trying to sound casual and not at all as if she wanted to break out some rusty cheerleading routines and root for the home team.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I called Mrs. Dixon yesterday and she\u2019s ready to have us take them down and bring them to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d Jill said as she walked into her office and came to a complete stop.</p><p>Here there were almost no fish and the netting was gone, too. Aliens, she told herself. It had to be aliens. Or a cult.</p><p>She put down her purse and returned to the reception area. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m still leaving. I have a couple of inter views lined up and I\u2019ve already turned down two offers.\u201d</p><p>Tina smiled. \u201cI know. It\u2019s really a shame you have to go. You\u2019ve done so much for the town.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was sincere, her pupils weren\u2019t dilated and there weren\u2019t any scales or horns sticking out anywhere Jill could see. So what was up?</p><p>\u201cOh, you have a FedEx package on your desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jill walked back into her office, then returned to stand by Tina\u2019s desk. \u201cOkay. I can\u2019t stand it. You\u2019re being nice. What is it? Do you want a raise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. I wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d Tina smiled. Then her humor faded. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the reason. I heard what happened. You talked to Mac and he gave Andy a taste of his own medicine. Someone should have done that years ago.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s what this was about. Revenge on a bully. Jill thought about mentioning that Mac was in some serious trouble for what he\u2019d done. He could lose his job and his daughter.</p><p>\u201cThe whole town is talking about it,\u201d Tina continued. \u201cEveryone is really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad no one bothered to intervene before,\u201d Jill told her. \u201cAndy\u2019s been using his wife as a punching bag for a lot of years.\u201d</p><p>Tina sighed. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. No one wanted to get involved.\u201d</p><p>Mac had, she thought glumly. But in the wrong way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my office,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you have an appointment at nine-thirty. Riley Whitefield will be in to talk about his uncle\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>That was fast, Jill thought as she moved toward her desk. It had been a long time since she\u2019d last seen Los Lobos\u2019s favorite bad boy and the guy who had broken Gracie\u2019s heart. She wondered how time had treated him and what he would say when he found out about the terms of his uncle\u2019s will.</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T HAVE A CHOICE,\u201d John Goodwin said. It was only nine in the morning, but the Los Lobos district attorney had already discarded his suit jacket, loosened his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his long-sleeved white shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Mac slouched in the chair and reminded himself he\u2019d started the trouble with Andy Murphy and it looked as if he was going to have to see it through.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t agree with you,\u201d John told him. \u201cI do. I think Murphy\u2019s a bastard. But with his wife unwilling to press charges and no one else coming for ward as a witness to the beatings, my hands are tied. He wants to file charges and I can\u2019t ignore that. I\u2019ll go as slow as I can. We\u2019ll need to do a thorough investigation. But the best I can do is buy you time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>John, a big bear of a man, slapped a file on his already overflowing desk. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a lawyer. Get a good one. I can give you some recommendations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I know a few people.\u201d He was sure Jill would have opinions on who would do a good job. For a second he thought about contacting Judge Strathern, but he didn\u2019t want to disappoint the old man by telling him what had happened. The judge would hear in time\u2014he seemed to hear everything. But later was better than sooner.</p><p>\u201cI want you to fight this,\u201d the D.A. told him. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man and good for this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to Andy Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get a vote in this.\u201d</p><p>Mac glanced around the office and thought about what would happen when word got out. Hollis wasn\u2019t going to be happy.</p><p>\u201cSeems to me he\u2019s getting a vote all right. He\u2019s calling the shots.\u201d Mac rose. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t earn it. I hit him and now I have to deal with the consequences.\u201d He\u2019d given in to his temper and now he had to pay the price.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d John told him. \u201cBut I also have to do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I appreciate the support. Let me know when the hearing is.\u201d</p><p>RILEY WHITEFIELD APPEARED to be one of those men who got better with age. He\u2019d been a dark, dangerous teenaged boy who wore black T-shirts tucked into his jeans, motorcycle boots and a gold hoop earring. At seventeen he\u2019d been sexy enough to get any girl he wanted; at thirty-two he\u2019d moved on to women, but Jill was willing to bet they were just as available. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked into her office exactly on time. The jeans and T-shirt had been replaced with slacks and a long-sleeved shirt, the gold hoop with a small diamond. But there was still smoldering sensuality just under the surface and the promise of ten kinds of fabulous sin in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your uncle,\u201d Jill said as she stood and motioned to the chair in front of her desk.</p><p>Tina mouthed the words great butt, then fanned her self with one hand as she closed the door with the other.</p> <p>\u201cDonovan and I weren\u2019t exactly on speaking terms,\u201d Riley said as he took a seat. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the bastard in nearly ten years, so don\u2019t expect me to be sorry he\u2019s gone now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d filled out, she thought as she took in his broad shoulders and muscular chest. Time had been more than kind to Gracie\u2019s crush. What on earth would her friend say when Jill told her that Riley had been in her office?</p><p>The man in question frowned slightly. \u201cI know this is going to sound like a line, but do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a ghost from your past,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m the judge\u2019s daughter. Jill Strathern.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained blank.</p> <p>\u201cGracie\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention. Riley stiffened. \u201cGracie Landon? You knew her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I was her partner in crime.\u201d Jill held her hands palm up. \u201cLet me just say how sorry I am for everything we ever did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie was creative. I\u2019ll give her that. And persistent.\u201d He glanced around the room as if expecting her to jump out of a closet. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes amazingly beautiful wedding cakes. Some of them were just featured in People magazine, which was fabulous. She\u2019s been inundated by orders from the rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. Does she live in town?\u201d</p> <p>Jill had to admit she sort of liked seeing the sexy and brooding Riley Whitefield look nervous.</p><p>\u201cLos Angeles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never visits.\u201d</p><p>Riley visibly relaxed in his chair. \u201cSo, about the will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The will.\u201d Jill pulled out a folder and handed it to him. \u201cYour uncle left most of his sizable estate to you. I\u2019ve made a copy of the will for you to read at your leisure. It\u2019s fairly long, with lots of asides and opinions. There are a few donations to charities.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t bother opening the folder. \u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the old man had it in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the two of you were estranged, but your uncle did a lot for the town. He will be missed by many.\u201d</p> <p>Riley\u2019s dark eyes filled with loathing. \u201cAt the risk of sounding like a complete bastard, I don\u2019t give a shit. As far as I\u2019m concerned, my uncle was a miserly old prick who lived to torture those less well-off. He let his own sister die of cancer. By the time I learned she was sick, it was too late. After her death I found a letter she\u2019d writ ten to him asking for money for the operation that could have saved her life. He sent it back, along with a note telling her to get help from the government.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo am I. I was nineteen at the time. Fresh off my divorce. I\u2019d left town to make my way in the world and my mother knew I didn\u2019t have any money myself. Of course if she\u2019d told me what was going on, I would have gotten it out of her brother one way or another. But she didn\u2019t. The first I knew anything was wrong was when the county hospital called to tell me she was dying.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cSo I don\u2019t care about my uncle\u2019s donations to charity. I want to take whatever he\u2019s leaving me and spend it in a way that will make him turn over in his grave. I consider it a personal mission.\u201d</p><p>She could understand his need for revenge. Riley didn\u2019t strike her as the kind of man who would forgive and forget. There was also the fact that his uncle had committed an unforgivable act of neglect. To have turned away his own sister. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t try to get back at him while he was still alive,\u201d she said.</p><p>Riley relaxed back in his chair. \u201cWho\u2019s saying I didn\u2019t? As far as I could tell, the only thing he loved in his life was that damn bank. But times have been hard on financial institutions and he\u2019d been forced to take on a partner.\u201d</p><p>Jill had heard something about that. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Riley nodded. \u201cJust as soon as I find out who he\u2019s left his share to, I plan to buy them out and close the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, there are some complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there are.\u201d He crossed his legs, resting his right ankle on his left knee. \u201cTell me about them.\u201d</p><p>Jill knew he wasn\u2019t going to like what she had to say. \u201cWhile you are your uncle\u2019s sole heir, the inheritance isn\u2019t left to you outright. His share of the bank, along with the assets, will be given to you upon meeting his conditions.\u201d</p><p>He raised one dark eyebrow. \u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to become respectable. Apparently your uncle was concerned about what he called your wild ways. Therefore to inherit his portion of the bank and his assets, you have to run for mayor of Los Lobos and win. The election is next June. That gives you just over ten months to make this happen.\u201d</p><p>Riley stood and crossed to the far side of the room. Despite the heat of the moment, Jill couldn\u2019t help but notice the butt Tina had admired. It was pretty amazing.</p><p>\u201cHe was smart,\u201d Riley said contemptuously. \u201cI can just walk away, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If you want. The assets go to charity and the bank gets sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I can buy it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t. He makes it clear you\u2019re not allowed to bid on the bank if you don\u2019t meet the conditions of the will.\u201d There was one more thing. She wasn\u2019t sure if Riley would consider it good or bad.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle\u2019s assets were considerable. If you don\u2019t go through with running for mayor, you\u2019re not just walking away from the bank, you\u2019re turning your back on a lot of cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter taxes?\u201d She pushed a few buttons on her calculator. \u201cMy conservative estimate is ninety-seven million dollars.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>MAC ROUNDED the corner by Jill\u2019s office only to nearly run into someone coming the other way. He took a step back to apologize, then stared in disbelief at the man standing there.</p><p>Tall, dark with perfect features. He even recognized the scar by the right corner of the guy\u2019s mouth\u2014Mac had been the one to give it to him.</p><p>Mac shoved his hands into his slack pockets\u2014whether to keep from shaking hands or punching, he wasn\u2019t sure\u2014and allowed his surprise to show in his voice.</p><p>\u201cRiley Whitefield. I never expected to see you back here.\u201d</p><p>Riley frowned. \u201cMac? Holy hell.\u201d He looked him up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re the sheriff?\u201d</p><p>At least for the next couple of months, Mac thought grimly. Until he\u2019d taken his temper out on Andy Murphy, the last fight Mac had been in had been his senior year of high school, and his opponent had been Riley. Funny how both events had completely changed his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to town?\u201d Mac asked, ignoring Riley\u2019s question. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying long, are you?\u201d</p><p>Riley grinned. \u201cI see you\u2019re still determined to be one of the good guys. Guess that means you\u2019re still finishing last.\u201d</p><p>The comment cut a little too close to home for Mac\u2019s liking. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to run me in if I don\u2019t?\u201d Riley glanced around at the shops on either side of the street, at the overgrown trees and the kids playing in the park on the corner. \u201cIt looks the same. I can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s good or bad.\u201d</p><p>Mac shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because my uncle passed away. I had to stop by and see the lawyer handling the case.\u201d</p><p>Jill, Mac thought, and wondered what she\u2019d thought of his old friend.</p><p>\u201cGet your check?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated than that. But I\u2019ll be taking everything that old bastard had.\u201d</p><p>Mac remembered how Donovan Whitefield had made his nephew\u2019s life hell. He\u2019d heard that the cheap son of a bitch had let his own sister die of cancer rather than pay for her medical bills. While he might not want Riley around making trouble, he couldn\u2019t blame the man for hating his uncle.</p><p>\u201cGot a time frame?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cYou that eager to get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mac. I\u2019m going to have to become a temporary resident. But don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just until I satisfy the terms of my uncle\u2019s will. I don\u2019t want to be here any more than you want me here. See ya.\u201d</p><p>With that, Riley walked to the curb and climbed into his car. A rental, Mac thought, taking in the stickers on the back of the rearview mirror. So what had become of the man who had once been his best friend? Where did he live and what did he do?</p><p>Mac would put money on Riley being successful, regardless of his occupation.</p><p>He glanced toward Jill\u2019s office, then turned and headed back the other way. He didn\u2019t want to talk to her right now. Not while he had questions about Riley and the will and he knew she wouldn\u2019t give him answers.</p><p>Funny how he thought taking the job of sheriff in Los Lobos would mean long, slow, boring days. Right now he could use a little dull in his life, but it didn\u2019t look as if he was going to get it.</p><p>JILL CAME HOME to an empty house and an uncomfortable silence. She didn\u2019t need to check around to realize that her aunt was still out of town with Rudy, although she did push the flashing message light button.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jill, it\u2019s Bev. Rudy and I are still in San Francisco. It\u2019s so beautiful here, I can see why you love it. We\u2019re going to stay a few more days. I\u2019ve made arrangements for Emily to stay with my friend Chris during the day. Chris has that fabulous craft store by the supermarket. She teaches classes and Emily will simply love it. Anyway, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Her aunt sighed, then laughed. \u201cBetter than fine. Rudy\u2019s amazing.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll fill you in on the details when I get home. Love you.\u201d</p><p>There was a click, then the message ended.</p><p>Jill stared at the machine. \u201cHow much of this impromptu visit is about young love and how much of it is you avoiding me, Rudy?\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t know what to think about all that had happened. What other secrets had he been keeping from her?</p><p>She hated to have been played for a fool, but there was no other way around it. Rudy had acted all normal and righteous around her, but in truth he was a criminal.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise,\u201d she told herself. \u201cYou knew he was a snake when you let him in.\u201d</p><p>True, but she\u2019d thought he was a good snake.</p><p>In her bedroom she found a Post-it note on her mirror and a letter tucked into the frame. The Post-it reminded her of a pier committee meeting in a couple of days. The time for the celebration neared and there was plenty of work to be done.</p><p>\u201cI get to stuff goodie bags,\u201d Jill muttered. \u201cWhat a fabulous use of my talent.\u201d</p><p>The letter was an offer from the firm in San Diego. She fingered the expensive paper, but didn\u2019t pull it out and read it again.</p><p>The job offer was fabulous. Great salary and benefits. A clear plan for promotion. A chance to learn about different industries while continuing to advance in her specialties. As she\u2019d been careful to never mention her relationship with Rudy and the potential three million in billing, they wouldn\u2019t miss the money. It was perfect. So why hadn\u2019t she called? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jill didn\u2019t have an answer, although she knew she should. Was she waiting to hear back from the partners at her old firm in San Francisco? Did she think that they would suddenly discover Lyle was a rat fink lying weasel dog and beg her to return?</p><p>\u201cPathetic but true,\u201d she said as she began to change her clothes.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the phone on the nightstand. Should she call Gracie and tell her that Riley was back in town? Would her friend want to know? Jill had warned him there would be a lot of interest in his return and he\u2019d given her permission to say he was going to be around dealing with the contents of his uncle\u2019s will and that was it.</p> <p>Gracie would have a lot of questions that Jill wasn\u2019t prepared to answer. Nor did she think her friend wanted to hear that her one-time crush still looked like a walking, breathing poster for a female sexual fantasy.</p><p>She pulled a T-shirt over her head and walked to her window. From there she could see Mac\u2019s house. The truck was in the driveway. It was too early for lights to be on, but she could hear noises from next door. He was home.</p><p>She ached for him and not just for the afternoon of lovemaking that had been derailed. She missed talking to him\u2014both for what he had to say and for the sound of his voice. She missed laughing with him and seeing him smile. She missed Emily.</p><p>But after what had happened, she wasn\u2019t sure if they were still speaking. She could tell herself that none of it was her fault, but she still felt some measure of guilt. Rudy had come to Los Lobos because of her. She hadn\u2019t listened when Mac had warned her the man was trouble. Then Mac had lost his temper and taken it out on Andy Murphy. Not that the wife-beater didn\u2019t deserve it, but there were consequences for Mac. Huge ones.</p><p>Still, there was no point in wishing for the moon, she told herself as she turned away from the window and walked toward the stairs. If Mac wanted to get in touch with her, he knew exactly where to find her. She wasn\u2019t going to be the one to go crawling to him.</p> <p>SOMETIME AFTER TEN, Mac told himself he had to go up to bed. The way his days were going, he needed his sleep to stay sharp, or at least not to be stupid again.</p><p>He and Emily had spent a quiet evening together, playing games, then watching a video. He treasured the closeness as she snuggled against him, giving him the honor of holding Elvis. He liked the way she smiled at him during the funny parts of the movie and how she\u2019d flung herself at him when Ariel had gotten herself into some trouble and had whispered she knew Mac could save her.</p><p>He liked being both her father and her hero. So what the hell was going to happen to the love in her eyes when he was officially charged and lost custody of his daughter?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about it. He didn\u2019t want to deal with it, but there it was\u2014waiting for him. Lurking and giving him a knot in his stomach. He\u2019d been a fool and now he had to pay the price.</p><p>\u201cAnything but Emily,\u201d he said aloud. He would cut off his arm rather than lose her.</p><p>A knock on the door caused him to sit up and glance at his watch. Who would come calling now?</p> <p>He knew who he wanted it to be, but Jill wasn\u2019t likely to show up at his door. Not after all that had happened between them. Still, he hadn\u2019t heard a car pull up.</p><p>Expectation propelled him to his feet. He crossed to the door and pulled it open. Pleasure poured through him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Jill said as she pushed past him and walked into the living room. \u201cI am absolutely not crawling here. I\u2019m walking with strength and dignity. As your friend and as an attorney, I feel it\u2019s important to discuss certain things with you. As with all free advice, you can ignore it, but in this case, you\u2019d be a complete ass to do so. Am I making myself clear?\u201d</p><p>She stood there, spine stiff, shoulders back. Determination radiated from her and, even in her shorts and T-shirt, she looked damned impressive. He would have wanted her under any circumstances, but it was her long curly hair that did him in.</p><p>He grabbed her and pulled her against him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he said right before he kissed her.</p><p>Her mouth instantly yielded. Her arms wrapped around his neck and she molded her body to his. Her scent and her heat surrounded him, offering comfort and promise. Or maybe that\u2019s what he wanted to read into it all.</p><p>She was the one who drew back a few seconds later. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>Four words every man in the universe, except maybe Dr. Phil, would rather eat glass than hear. \u201cCan\u2019t we just go upstairs and make love instead?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand with the intent to lead the way, but instead he found himself curling his fingers around hers and tugging her toward the sofa. He could never admit this to another living soul, especially not another guy, but maybe they did need to talk.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked when she had settled next to him on the sofa, her body angled toward his, their knees touching.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I feel like shit. What was I thinking?\u201d He straightened and slid to the front of the sofa where he rested his elbows on his knees and dropped his head to his hands. \u201cI risked everything by punching out that bastard. He\u2019s a human cockroach and he\u2019s going to cost me Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to be formally charged. Hollis has already called to set up an appointment. I\u2019ll put him off as long as I can, but you and I both know it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>Jill rubbed her hand across his back. \u201cYou need a lawyer, Mac. Someone brilliant. I want to ask around and find the right person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. First of all, we have a personal relationship and that\u2019s a serious no-no. Second, I don\u2019t handle criminal cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lawyer isn\u2019t going to be able to change what I did. I lost my temper and now I have to pay the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Andy deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mac straightened. \u201cDoes anyone deserve to be beaten by someone in authority?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does it to his wife. He\u2019s breaking bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn eye for an eye?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to take the moral high ground, I\u2019m not having this conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then just have sex with me.\u201d He grabbed her hand and pulled it toward him. Knowing she was watching, he pressed an openmouthed kiss to her palm and had the satisfaction of feeling her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy, sweetheart, and I want you naked. There is no fair.\u201d</p><p>She cupped his jaw. \u201cI have to tell you something first.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cI\u2019m reasonably confident it\u2019s not that you were once a man.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her lips quivered, but she didn\u2019t smile. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Riley Whitefield is back in town and he might be staying for a while.\u201d</p><p>Mac already knew that firsthand, but he appreciated Jill wanting to tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know. We ran into each other earlier today.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. How was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d He flopped back on the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time and yet it felt like yesterday. Funny how Riley was the last guy I had a fight with and he shows up now. Maybe it\u2019s a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>She shifted close and rested her hand on his chest. \u201cDid you guys talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe spoke, but it wasn\u2019t friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to be best friends. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of things.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on top of hers and laced their fingers together. He and Riley had been best friends forever. They\u2019d been on the fringe of bad, getting into trouble, staying out late, drinking and, as they got older, racing their cars. But at the beginning of their senior year, something had happened to fundamentally change their relationship. Mac had stolen Judge Strathern\u2019s Caddy and had taken it for a joyride. And he\u2019d been caught.</p><p>\u201cWhen your dad came to talk to me after I stole his car, I thought I was totally screwed,\u201d Mac admitted, remembering the fear of that long-ago morning. A long night in the local jail had given him plenty of time to imagine the worst.</p><p>\u201cHe can be pretty intimidating,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen him dancing around the house in his underwear.\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I never have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did way too many times. When I was a kid I thought it was funny, but as I got older, it began to scar my psyche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that morning he terrified the hell out of me. You know he took me up to Lompoc. A few hours in a prison cell put me right on to the straight and narrow.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cRiley didn\u2019t like losing his partner in crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you fought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first he was just mad and kept expecting me to change. One day we had it out and I told him I wasn\u2019t interested in getting in trouble. I wanted to graduate from high school and join the Marines. He laughed and I punched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that anger-management book Hollis gave you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. So I have a temper. I\u2019m doing better. Or I was until Andy Murphy pissed me off.\u201d Mac didn\u2019t want to think about that. \u201cRiley and I both walked away bloodied and bruised. That was the end of our friend ship. We graduated. I left town and he married Pam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich lasted all of five months,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt turned out she wasn\u2019t as pregnant as she\u2019d claimed. Then Riley took off to parts unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue. I didn\u2019t ask and he didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is he back for?\u201d</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m thinking until next spring, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>He knew there was more she wasn\u2019t telling him. In formation about the will, but he wasn\u2019t going to ask. He didn\u2019t want Jill violating her ethical code for him. Not that she would if he asked. She had principles. He liked that.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cCan I have that in writing?\u201d</p><p>She nudged him with her knee. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Mac. I feel horrible about what happened with Rudy. You were right about everything and I didn\u2019t listen. I thought I knew him. I thought because of all the legitimate business dealings we\u2019d had that he wasn\u2019t a criminal. But he is and now he\u2019s brought gambling to Los Lobos. I never wanted that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He turned and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I. I\u2019m not mad. You made a mistake. It\u2019s nice to know I don\u2019t have a corner on that market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone. Bev\u2019s with him. I think they\u2019re in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that. Bev called to let me know she wouldn\u2019t be around to look after Em.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cI thought coming back here would be so simple. I thought I\u2019d hate everything and leave at the first chance I got. But it\u2019s not like that. I got another job offer. This one is in San Diego and it\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><p>A sharp pain cut through his chest. No way in hell did he want to try to figure out what that meant.</p><p>\u201cYou should take it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShould I? I\u2019m not sure. Something doesn\u2019t feel right and I don\u2019t know what. Everything is confusing. I hate this town. Really, really hate it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tucked her hair behind her ear and tried not to notice how great she smelled.</p><p>\u201cWho are you trying to convince?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. What would you like me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>MAC DIDN\u2019T WASTE any time, Jill thought happily, as he instantly stood and pulled her to her feet. Before she could think about where or how or even what, he had her in his arms.</p><p>His hands were everywhere. Her back, her hips, her arms, her hair. He roamed her body like a blind man paying tribute. At the same time, he pressed his mouth to hers and claimed her with an intimate kiss.</p> <p>She parted for him instantly, wanting to taste and feel him. When their tongues touched, she felt the heat pour through her. It was like standing under a waterfall of de sire. Every inch of her skin tightened in anticipation. Between her legs, her body softened, dampened and swelled in anticipation. Her breasts began to ache, while her muscles clenched.</p><p>He explored her mouth, then broke the kiss to nibble his way along her jaw. Her head dropped back and she felt her breathing quicken. She held on to him, her fingers curling into his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d he murmured against her neck, his breath teasing the places he\u2019d already dampened with his kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think, not when he made her feel so delicious. Tiny shivers rippled through her with each brush of lips, teeth and tongue.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs. My bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Of course. They couldn\u2019t make love here, not with Emily in the house. They had to go behind closed doors and be quiet and make sure Jill was gone well before dawn. And they would. In a second. As soon as he stopped licking the side of her neck and...</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said, straightening and pushing her toward the stairs.</p><p>Laughter filled his voice while passion darkened his eyes. The irresistible combination had her scampering toward the second floor. She headed for his bedroom and waited until he\u2019d shut and locked the door behind him before carefully peeling off her T-shirt and dropping it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI like a woman who takes charge,\u201d he said as he re moved his own shirt.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered with shoes when she\u2019d come over, so she only had to unfasten her shorts and let them fall to the floor. Then she stood before him in only her bra and panties.</p><p>He followed her actions, dropping his jeans. He, too, had been barefoot. Now he stood before her in briefs that did little to disguise his erection.</p> <p>\u201cAll that for me?\u201d she asked as she pressed her hand against his belly before moving lower to stroke him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d he said, nudging her toward the bed. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>He waited until she stopped next to the mattress be fore reaching behind her to unfasten her bra. After pushing away her hand while muttering \u201cLater, I promise,\u201d he drew her onto the bed and knelt beside her.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he said in a voice that was thick with need.</p><p>His words made her shiver, the intensity of his stare made her want. She shimmied out of her panties and tossed them onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cMy kind of girl,\u201d he said with a smile before lowering his head toward her breast.</p><p>The first brush of his lips on her tight nipple had her arching toward him. When his tongue teased the sensitive flesh, she actually whimpered.</p><p>\u201cIt feels so good,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her other breast and matched the movement of fingers to his tongue. Heat exploded low in her belly and radiated to the very tips of her fingers and toes. Her legs moved restlessly as she tossed her head from side to side.</p><p>He moved slowly, then faster. He nipped, he licked, he sucked, and he whispered how much he wanted her. The contact, the words, and when she opened her eyes, the visual of what he was doing sent her perilously close to the edge. So much so that when he left her breasts and began to kiss his way down her belly, she wasn\u2019t sure she was going to hold off long enough to actually let him get there.</p><p>But somehow she managed to keep control so that when he parted her legs and knelt between her knees, she could draw in a deep breath in anticipation of his soul-stirring kiss.</p><p>His fingers gently parted her slick flesh, then he un erringly found that one central point of pleasure and swirled his tongue around it.</p><p>Jill covered her mouth with her hand to hold in the scream of pure pleasure. It was better than she\u2019d imagined, better than she\u2019d ever felt. The heat, the speed, the movement, the something. Her toes curled, the soles of her feet burned, her back arched, her body shook.</p><p>He kissed and licked and teased and soothed until she couldn\u2019t stand it another second. She was already too close and when he took her to the edge, she hung on as long as she could before giving in to her explosive re lease. The orgasm ripped through her like a tidal wave of pleasure, tossing her back and forth, filling her with ecstasy before slowly seeping away and leaving her boneless.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Jill,\u201d Mac said as he settled in beside her.</p><p>She blinked, not exactly sure when she\u2019d closed her eyes in the whole thing. Not that it mattered. She stretched and turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good at that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. You could teach a class or something.\u201d She had a vision of an entire classroom of men eager to learn technique. \u201cHmm, you\u2019d need some volunteers for them to practice on. I bet I could find a few.\u201d</p><p>He tunneled his fingers in her hair. \u201cNot a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe class or the volunteers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed her. She moved against him and felt his erection pulse.</p><p>\u201cI think I like this,\u201d she murmured as she slid her leg between his. \u201cA lot. But one of us is still seriously over dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of that.\u201d</p><p>He rolled away and tugged off his briefs. She took advantage of the moment and collected a condom from the nightstand. Seconds later she was on her back, he was between her thighs and they were both starting to breathe fast.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked after he\u2019d pulled on the protection.</p><p>As he spoke he slipped a finger deep inside of her. Instantly she clamped her muscles around him and felt the first thrill ripple through her.</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d</p><p>He eased himself inside of her.</p><p>Jill reached for his hips and pulled him in deeper. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes dilated. \u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too wet and swollen for that. Just do it hard.\u201d</p><p>He groaned with the pleasure of a man just given a free pass. Then he braced his hands on the mattress and thrust in all the way. The sharp, erotic movement made her insides quiver with delight. She wrapped her legs around his hips and gave herself up to the feelings.</p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d she breathed when he did it again and again.</p><p>Harder. Faster. Slick. Hot. It was the perfect mating between a man and a woman. When she felt herself once again falling into paradise, she opened her eyes and found him staring at her. They climaxed together, watching each other. Bodies stiffened, muscles tightened and, at that moment, she understood exactly what all the fuss was about.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>LATER, WHEN SANITY RETURNED and Jill found she could breathe normally, she curled up next to Mac and pulled the covers over them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fall asleep,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want you to go yet.\u201d</p><p>His words warmed her from the inside out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go, either.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to stay right here, to be with him, around him, making love, touching, talking. Being.</p><p>He rubbed her bare back, then played with her hair. She sensed he was with her, but also miles, or maybe years, away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust looking over my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty serious topic. Listing highlights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could tell him he wouldn\u2019t, but she wasn\u2019t sure. She didn\u2019t know the details of his arrangement with the court, nor did she know what had happened in his past.</p><p>She pushed herself up on one elbow. \u201cTell me what happened, Mac. Why did Carly leave you?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a whole lot of plans for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long time. Not sure if she should prompt him or let it go, she said nothing. Eventually Mac began to speak.</p><p>\u201cI met her while I was still in the Marines. We had a couple of long weekends together. Good times, but nothing special. Then she turned up pregnant and I wanted to do the right thing, so I left the service and be came a cop. I thought it would be more stable, and the pay was a hell of a lot better.\u201d</p><p>Jill did her best not to react, while inside small explosions of fireworks shot up in celebration. He hadn\u2019t loved Carly. She didn\u2019t want to think why the information was important, but it was and she accepted that.</p><p>\u201cSo you moved to Los Angeles,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019d been an MP, so it was an easy transition. I liked my job, the people I worked with. Carly and I had to adjust, but then Em came along and I knew, what ever else happened, she\u2019d made everything worth it.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cI loved her from the second I held her. She\u2019s my best girl and the best I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s heart sighed at the words. \u201cI think she\u2019s pretty terrific, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. So there we were. One happy family. Carly and I had our problems, but we were good friends and that helped. Then I went to work in South Central L.A., in the gang division.\u201d He turned and looked at her. \u201cI was excited because I thought I could make a difference. I was wrong. Those kids live a life the rest of us can\u2019t begin to imagine. Violence is what they know and understand. I got weighed down and I started to drink to escape.\u201d</p><p>Jill hadn\u2019t expected that and she didn\u2019t know what to say. Mac didn\u2019t wait for her to comment.</p><p>\u201cI got more distant at home and Carly didn\u2019t like that. We started fighting. I knew I had a temper, but I was determined not to show it to her, so I buried it and drank more.\u201d He returned his attention to the ceiling. \u201cOne day my partner and I were on routine patrol. We saw some kids jump an old lady and take her purse. We headed out after them, rounded a corner to an alley and ran head first into an ambush.\u201d</p><p>Jill tensed even as she began running her hands up and down his torso. \u201cAre you okay? Were you shot?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cTwice.\u201d He patted his chest. \u201cRight here. I had on a vest. So did Mark. The difference is, they shot him in the head.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said he was dead before he hit the ground. I couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t do anything but react. I was past rage, to whatever the hell place that is. I came out shooting and got every one of them. There were four of them.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cNot one of them was older than sixteen.\u201d</p><p>She shifted so she could stare into his face, and shook him until he looked at her. \u201cThey tried to kill you, Mac, and they murdered your partner. What were you sup posed to do? Let them go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what everybody said. Even the department psychologist. But here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s a difference between killing someone because you\u2019re trying to save your own skin and putting a bullet in them because you\u2019re so furious you can\u2019t see straight. I acted out of anger, not fear. I wanted them dead. And I killed them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Did he really blame himself? \u201cAll strong emotions are closely linked. Passion, rage, fear. They slide into each other. Would it have been better to let them get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were murderers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to watch them die.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t. So what happened? Did you get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The kids all had serious records, all involving murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t accidentally shoot someone innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying they were decent, I\u2019m saying I didn\u2019t want to have been the one to pull the trigger, and sure as hell not because I was angry.\u201d He rubbed his temples. \u201cI started drinking more. Eventually I quit the force and locked myself in the bedroom. Carly left and took Emily. God, I missed my little girl so much, but I couldn\u2019t get myself to do anything. I knew if I stopped drinking, I\u2019d have to remember, and there was no way I could survive that.\u201d</p> <p>She settled back down on the mattress and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cSo you let her go because it was too painful to focus enough to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Nearly as unforgivable a sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t forgive yourself for what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be one of the good guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re biased.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways, but not about this. If you hadn\u2019t shot those kids, who\u2019s to say they wouldn\u2019t have turned around and put a bullet in your head?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a weary smile. \u201cPeople with a lot more training than you have tried to convince me I did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. It\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Men could be so stubborn. She understood he had a lot to work through, but if he didn\u2019t stop punishing him self, those kids might as well have killed him.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you get here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOne day someone pounded on my front door and no matter how I yelled he wouldn\u2019t go away.\u201d</p><p>Jill wrinkled her nose. \u201cMy father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. I don\u2019t know how he found out what had happened. He said something about keeping track of me. I was too drunk to remember much. He stuck me in a cold shower until I sobered up, then he ripped me a new one. Told me I didn\u2019t have the right to waste a life he\u2019d helped save. Then he offered me the job here and a chance to get Emily back.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cSleeping with his only daughter is a hell of a way to pay him back.\u201d</p><p>She leaned close so she could whisper in his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve been married. I don\u2019t think my dad believes I\u2019m still a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell hope not.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cTrust me. You\u2019re fine. Besides, he\u2019s clear on the other side of the country. He won\u2019t find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>She thought about all the people her father kept in touch with. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and held her tight. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose her.\u201d</p><p>Emily. She squeezed him. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I won\u2019t let it happen. I\u2019m going to find you the best lawyer I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother? I earned this.\u201d</p><p>She pushed into a sitting position and stared at him. \u201cDammit, Mac, you\u2019re not going to take this lying down. Do you hear me? Didn\u2019t you just do fifteen minutes on how much you love your daughter? How dare you not fight for her?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cJill, I broke the rules. I lost my temper and punched someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? There are extenuating circumstances. You made a mistake, but you can\u2019t just give up. You have to fight. She\u2019s worth it, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>There was something in the way he said the words. Something in his eyes, as if he\u2019d been haunted by a specific reality all his life. And then she got it\u2014Mac\u2019s universal truth. In his mind the person who wasn\u2019t worth it was him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed as she collapsed against him and held him. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how amazing you are? Everyone has flaws, but not everyone is capable of being honorable and owning up to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I? If you won\u2019t do it for yourself, then do it for her. Don\u2019t let Emily lose her father a second time.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak for several seconds, then he nodded slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t go away again and I have to make sure I keep that promise. Even if it means crawling to that prick Hollis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crawling is an entertaining visual, but personally I\u2019d go the lawyer route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave that to you. You\u2019re the resident expert.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him and smiled. \u201cYou got that right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI CAN\u2019T BELIEVE he\u2019s here,\u201d Jill said, sounding both surprised and furious as they entered the room for the last pier committee meeting before the celebration the following week. \u201cI want his head on a stick.\u201d</p><p>Mac looked where she pointed and saw Rudy talking to the mayor.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m the one with the temper,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the cool, collected lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today. I\u2019m still pretty steamed over him playing me for a fool all those years.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOkay, I suppose technically I knew what he was, but I never really believed it. Sort of like making friends with a guard dog and then being surprised to find out it has teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig teeth and deep pockets,\u201d Mac said, watching the mayor laugh at something Rudy said.</p><p>Jill clutched his hand. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>As there were a number of things on his plate right now\u2014the charges, an upcoming meeting with Hollis, a potential run-in with Rudy and the mayor, he wasn\u2019t sure what she meant. Not that it mattered. He\u2019d managed to confess his deepest, darkest secret and she hadn\u2019t turned away from him. Instead, she\u2019d offered support and had believed in him. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time that had happened...if ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo punching,\u201d she said, her expression earnest.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot even Hollis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s earned it, but you really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise, I won\u2019t.\u201d Hollis. He started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHollis and his ideas that all cops make lousy fathers. Ironic that he\u2019s wrong about everyone else, but right about me. I do have an anger-management issue and I haven\u2019t always been there for Em. I\u2019ve been so busy hating him, I never bothered to listen to what he had to say.\u201d His humor faded. \u201cToo bad I won\u2019t be able to tell him. I have a feeling that today\u2019s meeting isn\u2019t going to be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than willing to come with you.\u201d</p><p>He loved her for offering. \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think showing up with a lawyer is going to help my case.\u201d</p><p>He could offer explanations, but the truth was, he couldn\u2019t talk away what he\u2019d done. He was going to have to find a way to pay the price without losing Emily.</p><p>Franklin Yardley moved to the front of the room and called the meeting to order. Mac and Jill found seats in the back.</p><p>\u201cI have wonderful news,\u201d the mayor said excitedly. \u201cWe have received a large donation that will completely cover the refurbishment of the pier.\u201d</p><p>Everyone else in the room applauded. Beside him, Jill groaned. \u201cDidn\u2019t Rudy already write a big fat check? What is he buying this time? The right to bring in prostitution? I swear I want that man\u2019s head on a stick. A re ally big one.\u201d</p><p>Mac took her hand in his and squeezed. \u201cDeep cleansing breaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with the temper, but eventually you start to hyperventilate and then you have something else to think about.\u201d</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>The mayor waited until the room had quieted to continue. \u201cI propose that in addition to celebrating the pier centennial next week, we make Rudy Casaccio an honorary citizen of Los Lobos and give him the key to the city.\u201d</p><p>Several people yelled out their agreement. Jill sank down in her seat. \u201cGreat. Now we\u2019re going to be the Sopranos\u2014West.\u201d</p><p>THE MEETING SEEMED to go on for days, but it was only about thirty minutes until it ended. While Mac headed out for his meeting with Hollis, Jill worked her way through the crowd until she stood next to Rudy. She took hold of his arm and dragged him toward a side door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jill,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cWhere are you taking me? Not that I\u2019m not flattered, but Bev and I...\u201d</p><p>She turned to glare at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare make jokes with me.\u201d She saw Mr. Smith trailing after them. \u201cYou stay out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do,\u201d he said, and she realized they were the first words she\u2019d heard him speak.</p><p>She eyed the bulge under his jacket and knew it had nothing to do with him being happy to see her and everything to do with an illegal gun.</p><p>\u201cFine, then keep back because I want some room when I yell at your boss.\u201d</p><p>She hated that Mr. Smith glanced at Rudy for confirmation before easing back a few feet when they entered the dimly lit utility corridor behind the meeting rooms.</p><p>Rudy, well dressed as ever in chic resort wear, gave her a big smile. \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem, Jill? How can I help? Is it Lyle?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cHelp? You think I need a favor? You couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\u201d She really wanted to punch him or something, but several things held her back. First, the thought that Rudy might hit back and that could hurt. Second, it wasn\u2019t her style. Third, and most important, Mr. Smith and his ever-present weapon.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me,\u201d she said, sure she was practically spouting steam. \u201cYou said you were here on vacation. You said you liked the town.\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely baffled. \u201cI do. Very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou set up gambling,\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou brought organized crime to my town, and nobody does that and gets away with it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cJill, honey. Calm down. You don\u2019t even like being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? This may not be my idea of paradise, but you don\u2019t have the right to screw with people\u2019s lives. How could you do this?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cA couple of card games don\u2019t hurt any one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI...you...\u201d Okay, so speaking had just become impossible.</p><p>Rudy put his arm around her. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this way too hard, Jill. I was having a little fun with your boyfriend. I knew the gambling would piss him off. That\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>Her boyfriend?</p><p>\u201cYou leave Mac out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever you say. We\u2019re practically family. I don\u2019t want you to be upset. Hey, if you don\u2019t want to have gambling here, then it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Her mind swirled with too much information. There was only one way they could be \u201cpractically family\u201d and she didn\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just want the gambling gone, I want you gone.\u201d</p><p>His friendly expression hardened. \u201cThat\u2019s not a choice you get to make. I like it here and I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Damn him, she thought. She had no way to make him.</p><p>\u201cThen just stay away from my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBev\u2019s more than capable to make her own decisions.\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Jill? We\u2019ve always been friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had they? Had she really allowed herself to be friends with someone like him?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends and I don\u2019t work for you. In fact, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you ever again. So leave your business where it is. I\u2019m sure you and Lyle will be very happy together\u2014you\u2019re both exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>She pushed through the metal doors back into the now-empty meeting room and walked out. Why had it taken her so long to see the truth about Rudy? Worse, he was already in the town and in her aunt\u2019s life. However was she going to get him out?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019M SORRY TO BE RIGHT, but there we are,\u201d Hollis said as he laced his fingers together and rested his hands on his desk.</p><p>Mac had to gather every single ounce of self-control to stay calmly seated in his chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the sequence is,\u201d Hollis continued. \u201cDo violent men with short tempers get drawn to law enforcement, or does the profession change them once they\u2019re ensconced?\u201d He paused expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the last guy to have an opinion,\u201d Mac said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. You served in the military first, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me guess. You think they breed violence and abuse, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilitary institutions don\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Mac looked Hollis over. He took in the slight build, the glasses, the air of prissy nerdishness that practically screamed \u201ccome bully me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a hell of a time when you were a kid, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you couldn\u2019t go twenty-four hours without someone beating the crap out of you.\u201d</p><p>Hollis stiffened. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more wrong. I had a very supportive and loving childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably at home, but school was another story. You\u2019re the guy I spent my high school years beating up and that\u2019s what really pisses you off.\u201d</p> <p>Hollis pushed up his glasses. \u201cI find it interesting that your history of violence started so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d Mac leaned forward and put his hands flat on the other man\u2019s desk. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Hollis. I don\u2019t care what you think of me. I do care about my daughter and I will fight you to the ends of the earth to keep her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought of that before you assaulted Mr. Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI should have. And while we\u2019re assigning blame, where the hell were you?\u201d</p><p>Hollis blinked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I said. Where were you? Where was the social services department while Andy Murphy used his wife as a punching bag? Why aren\u2019t you out there lecturing to him on the pitfalls of violence? How dare you sit in your office while that man breaks bones in his pregnant wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t what?\u201d Mac asked, interrupting. \u201cGet involved? Care? When does it become your job? Because we both know what\u2019s going to happen. Andy shows a clear pattern of escalation, which means this is going to get worse until someone gets killed. What are the odds of it being him? I\u2019m going with less than ten percent. I think it\u2019s going to be his wife or his kid in the morgue. You\u2019re going to sit here with your rules and regulations and do nothing. How does that make you right?\u201d</p> <p>Hollis stared at him for several seconds, then pulled out a file. \u201cAfter your preliminary hearing, I\u2019ll be sending a letter to the judge in the custody case. Should you be charged, you will, of course, lose custody of Emily.\u201d</p><p>Mac stood. \u201cAs always, your understanding is what keeps me going.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the room.</p><p>Anger bubbled inside of him. There had to be a solution. There had to be a way out. Dammit all to hell. Yet even as he searched for an answer, he knew he\u2019d brought this on himself and he only had one person to blame. There had to be\u2014</p><p>Mac stepped out of the building only to find Rudy Casaccio standing next to the patrol car.</p><p>\u201cAfternoon, Mac,\u201d he said. \u201cHow did your meeting go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk to me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Rudy said easily. \u201cI do want to talk to you and I think you want to listen.\u201d</p><p>Mac started to unlock his car door, but Rudy stepped in the way.</p><p>\u201cHear me out. You have something I want and I have something you want.\u201d</p><p>For one horrifying second, Mac thought Rudy had taken Em. All the blood rushed from his head. Fury turned the world red.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making life difficult for me,\u201d Rudy said, as if he were unaware of Mac\u2019s reaction. \u201cI\u2019d like you to get off my back. In return, I can make Hollis Bass disappear.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNot literally, of course.\u201d</p><p>Rational thought returned. This wasn\u2019t about his daughter\u2014at least not directly. He realized he\u2019d automatically grabbed for his gun. Now he relaxed his hand and let it fall back to his side.</p><p>Mac tossed his keys into the air, then caught them. \u201cLet me get this straight. You want the freedom to bring organized crime to Los Lobos and in return you\u2019ll make sure the social worker gets off my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a little gambling, some number running, nothing big. No drugs. I don\u2019t approve of drugs.\u201d</p><p>Mac supposed that everyone needed standards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, Mac,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cHollis doesn\u2019t approve of you.\u201d</p><p>Mac didn\u2019t ask how he knew. Rudy\u2019s business was all about having the right information at the right time.</p><p>\u201cNo deal,\u201d he said as he unlocked his patrol car.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a tough place. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>Mac knew exactly where he was. He could lose Emily forever.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you even a little tempted?\u201d Rudy asked.</p><p>More than a little, Mac thought honestly. He would do just about anything to prevent that from happening, but he wouldn\u2019t sell his soul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in anything you have to offer,\u201d Mac said, and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cSO HOW ARE THINGS?\u201d</p><p>Jill clutched the phone tighter and wasn\u2019t sure if she should laugh or cry. \u201cTo be honest, Dad, I don\u2019t have a clue as to how to answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust start at the beginning and go slow. I\u2019m getting old and I\u2019m not as sharp as I used to be.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh. \u201cYeah, right. That\u2019s why you\u2019re running everyone\u2019s life from three thousand miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose life am I running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine. Mac\u2019s.\u201d She was sure there were more but she didn\u2019t know their names.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019ve offered a little input now and then.\u201d</p><p>Jill thought about how her dad had twice saved Mac. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, sweetie. Now what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cMy secretary, Tina, used to hate me but now she\u2019s taken down all the fish so that\u2019s cool, but some of my cases are hideous. I mean dog sperm? What\u2019s up with that? And I have Lyle\u2019s car and I\u2019m trying to get someone to dent it, but nothing is happening to it. I swear it\u2019s been protected by Gypsies or something. Then there\u2019s Bev, who is dating a guy. I really like that because the gift thing was never real, except the guy is a former client of mine and while I al ways knew he was sort of in organized crime, I never dealt with any of that and somehow I convinced myself he was one of the good guys only he\u2019s not. And now I have to tell her and I don\u2019t want to. Plus Mac\u2019s in trouble. He pounded this guy who totally deserved it\u2014Andy beats his wife and she\u2019s pregnant and it\u2019s horrible\u2014but now Mac\u2019s going to be charged and as soon as that happens he\u2019ll lose Emily. And I\u2019ve been going on job interviews and I have a great offer from a firm in San Diego and I should take it because that\u2019s what I want to do with my life, but I can\u2019t seem to pick up the phone and say yes and what\u2019s up with that. Oh, and the pier centennial is next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a good time for a visit,\u201d her father said calmly.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>JILL WAS SURPRISED to see the front door open when she pulled up at Bev\u2019s house. As she climbed the stairs, her aunt appeared in the doorway and pushed open the screen.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m back. We had the most amazing time. San Francisco is beautiful. I can certainly see why you\u2019ve enjoyed living there.\u201d</p><p>As Bev spoke, she stepped back to let Jill into the house. Jill followed, not sure how she was going to keep her mouth from falling open. Bev wore tailored white slacks and a trim lightweight sleeveless turquoise sweater. Delicate gold earrings hung from her ears. Gone were the gaudy dangling beads, gone was the ever-present floral-print dress, the multiple bangles and ankle bracelet. Most shocking of all, her long wild red hair had been cut short and styled in such a way as to emphasize her pretty features.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Jill said, not quite able to believe the transformation.</p><p>\u201cNot so bohemian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Bev smiled. \u201cI decided it was time to grow up.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s delight evaporated like water in the Sahara. \u201cThis is all because of Rudy,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Bev beamed. \u201cI know it\u2019s very fast and you probably think I\u2019m too old, but I have fallen for him completely. He\u2019s funny and charming and he makes me feel so incredibly special and feminine. We had the most wonderful time.\u201d</p><p>Jill felt as if she were about to kick a very cheerful puppy. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d seen her aunt this happy. To think she\u2019d finally found the right guy, only he wasn\u2019t right. He was a criminal, possibly a murderer, and there was no way Jill could let this hap pen.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d she said, taking her aunt by the hand and leading her to the sofa in the living room.</p><p>When they were seated next to each other, Jill drew in a deep breath. \u201cYou know that I love you. I barely remember my mother. You were always there for me, including a few weeks ago when I had nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>Bev smiled. \u201cJill, honey, this isn\u2019t necessary. Of course I know how you feel. You mean the world to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen please believe me when I tell you I\u2019m so sorry to have to be the one to tell you this. Rudy really is in the Mafia. It\u2019s not a game or an affectation. He\u2019s bringing organized crime to town and he has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Bev stared at her. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jill explained about the gambling.</p><p>Bev dismissed the information with the flick of hand. \u201cHe told me about that. It wasn\u2019t him at all. There are some other people responsible.\u201d</p><p>Jill sprang to her feet. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that. He\u2019s the one. He claims to like the town, but he\u2019s only interested in making trouble. I\u2019ve told him I won\u2019t have any thing to do with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>Bev stood as well. \u201cThen we have a serious problem, because I intend to marry him. If you can\u2019t accept the man I love, then you\u2019re not the person I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. \u201cYou have to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her aunt cut her off. \u201cI see a lot of things, including a young woman who is too stubborn for her own good. I\u2019m sorry your marriage didn\u2019t work out, but that\u2019s no reason to be bitter about my happiness. I thought you were a better person than that.\u201d</p><p>Jill winced at the accusation. \u201cI\u2019m not bitter. I want you to be happy, just not with Rudy.\u201d</p><p>Bev walked out of the room. In the hallway, she glanced over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for Rudy all my life. No one is going to stand in the way of that, not even you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOKAY, WHAT\u2019S UP?\u201d Mac asked three evenings later. They sat on his back porch in the quiet of the night.</p><p>Jill leaned against him and squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lousy liar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her and pressed a kiss to the top of her head. Emily and her friend Ashley were in the living room watching a movie together. The evening was cool and still with a thousand stars overhead. With Jill next to him and the promise of her in his bed later that night, he could almost forget all the hell in his life.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhen I came back, the only problem I had was getting a new job and taking revenge on Lyle. Now those things seem so unimportant. My aunt isn\u2019t speaking to me, you\u2019re facing a preliminary hearing in less than a week, my father arrives tomorrow and I don\u2019t know how much of all of this I should tell him.\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled. \u201cYour father has an information network that would make the CIA weep with envy. I\u2019m guessing he pretty much knows everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t ask questions. I told him some stuff, but not all of it. You know how he is. All that gentle understanding wrapped around some serious probing. I doubt we\u2019ll be out of the airport parking lot before I start spilling my guts to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and smiled at him. \u201cNot really. I guess I\u2019m more upset about Bev than him.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard about their fight. \u201cHave you tried to make things right with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. As soon as my dad heads back to Florida, I\u2019m going to move out. That will make things easier for everyone.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her back and wished he could offer to let her move in with him. Only two things stood in his way. Make that three. If he lost Emily, he wasn\u2019t going to be fit company for anyone. If he didn\u2019t lose Emily, he couldn\u2019t issue the invitation. Last, but equally important, Jill wasn\u2019t going to be around that much longer.</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t you be moving to San Diego soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t talking about that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe have to. It\u2019s a great job. You should take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to get rid of me so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Trying to say the right thing. It\u2019s everything you want. Isn\u2019t that what you told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enthusiasm,\u201d he said teasingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time getting any extra energy together right now,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhat about you? Will you be staying here if things don\u2019t go well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead.\u201d Nor did he want to. Life without Em? The only thing that could make the situation worse was life without Jill.</p><p>The unexpected realization made him stiffen and swear silently. Life without Jill? They\u2019d talked about her taking a job somewhere else, but he\u2019d never considered the consequences. That she would leave. That she wouldn\u2019t be next door, or his friend, or as of late, his lover.</p><p>He turned to her and cupped her face in his hands, then kissed her. She responded with an eager sweetness that made him ache.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good at that,\u201d she said when he pulled back.</p><p>He forced himself to smile. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t go.</p><p>He wanted to speak the words, bargain with her, ex plain why it was important for her to stay. He wanted to talk about building a life, of families and love and for ever.</p><p>Sometime, when he hadn\u2019t been paying attention, he\u2019d fallen for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you thinking?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou have the most peculiar expression on your face.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. What was there to say? What could he offer? Jill hated it here. She wanted the big city and corporate law. He wanted...aside from her and his daughter, he wanted to find a place to belong. He had thought that was here. With Rudy muscling in, he wasn\u2019t so sure. The mayor had\u2014</p><p>\u201cI have to fight them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRudy and the mayor. I\u2019m not going to let them take over Los Lobos. Somehow I\u2019m going to have to convince the town that they have to fight with me against Rudy and the mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be an uphill battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but after the hearing, I may have a lot of time on my hands.\u201d Time, because Emily would be gone.</p><p>\u201cI want to help,\u201d she said, taking his hands in hers. \u201cWe\u2019d make a good team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, then dropped her chin to her chest. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that.\u201d</p><p>They could avoid it, he thought, but that didn\u2019t change the truth.</p><p>\u201cNICE WHEELS,\u201d William Strathern said as he slid into the passenger seat of the 545. \u201cNew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyle\u2019s,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI was going to keep the car, but I don\u2019t love it and he does.\u201d</p><p>Her father clicked his seat belt in place. \u201cSince when do you care about what Lyle thinks? I thought he was a lying weasel rat fink dog, or some variation on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. Actually, he still is. But I don\u2019t want the car, and I\u2019ll get no satisfaction from driving it. I guess I could sell it, but that seems childish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the plan for revenge?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. I have no energy where Lyle is concerned. Marrying him was a huge mistake and now I\u2019m fixing the problem. That makes me feel good. As for Lyle, I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019m not interested in him or his life. He\u2019s buying me out of the condo, I\u2019m getting a cash settlement for the car and fifty percent of everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds mature.\u201d</p><p>She pulled onto the main highway that led to Los Lobos. \u201cIt is. Which is very exciting. But the big news is that I know I\u2019m going to be fine and I have a feeling Lyle never will be. Not because of me, but because he\u2019s a complete idiot. Screwing around at work? What\u2019s up with that? It\u2019s only a matter of time until he gets caught and then what? He\u2019s not my problem anymore and I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d</p><p>Her father patted her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. So what\u2019s new since we last spoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout four billion things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a long list.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOkay, maybe only a couple of dozen. I have that job offer from a great law firm in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like exactly what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d think. They\u2019re starting to get impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they are. You\u2019re a catch.\u201d</p><p>The constant, unconditional support was one of the things she loved most about her father.</p><p>\u201cI want to wait until after Mac\u2019s hearing to make a decision. They weren\u2019t happy, but they\u2019ve agreed to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is the hearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days after the pier celebration. You\u2019re just in time for all kinds of fun stuff.\u201d She tightened her fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cJust so you know, Bev and I aren\u2019t exactly seeing eye-to-eye these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Rudy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She thinks I\u2019m wrong, I think she\u2019s an idiot.\u201d Jill sighed. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s harsh, but it sums up the situation. Plus Rudy keeps leaving messages for me and there\u2019s no way I want to talk to him. He\u2019s either going to try to convince me that I overreacted about him or it\u2019s going to be something about Mac. I don\u2019t want to hear either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Mac, has he found a lawyer yet?\u201d</p><p>Jill glanced at him. She\u2019d hoped they would get around to that. Her father might be into his sixties, but he was still an impressive man and he knew the law better than anyone she knew.</p><p>\u201cNot one he\u2019s happy with. I sort of thought you might want to take that on.\u201d</p><p>Her father raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019d be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he would. I think you\u2019d enjoy the challenge. It would be a change from dating age-inappropriate women.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. That\u2019s why your current girlfriend is only five years older than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine and no, I don\u2019t want details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You don\u2019t talk about my love life and I won\u2019t talk about yours. Although I will say it took you long enough.\u201d</p><p>Jill was so stunned that she nearly drove off the road. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Mac. You\u2019ve been crazy about him for ages, although I\u2019m very grateful you kept your feelings to yourself instead of acting like a complete nutcase like your friend Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was enthusiastic about loving Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it. I was afraid I was going to have to issue a restraining order so that poor boy could finish high school in peace.\u201d</p><p>Jill wondered what Riley would think to know that someone in town had actually thought of him as \u201cthat poor boy.\u201d She doubted he would be amused.</p><p>Not wanting to pursue that topic, or the issue of how long she might have been interested in Mac, she re turned to the question of his legal defense.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take Mac on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her father glanced out the side window. \u201cI\u2019ll have to give it some serious thought.\u201d</p><p>THE MORNING of the pier celebration dawned bright and hot. Local motels had been booked for weeks in advance. Mac figured the beach parking lots would be full by ten. At least he had the off-site parking and bus service ready to go. Now if they could just get through the day without anything out of the ordinary happening, he would be relieved. Once this was done, he could concentrate on spending as much time with Em as possible before the preliminary hearing.</p><p>But until then, he had to deal with too many tourists, underage drinking, patrolling the beach, keeping the crowd on the pier to a manageable number so the old supports didn\u2019t give way. There was parking enforcement, the usual fights, arguments and minor medical emergencies.</p><p>\u201cHell of a way to make a living,\u201d he said as he stood, grabbed his clipboard and started to step out of his office.</p><p>D.J. stopped him with a quick, \u201cBoss, can we talk?\u201d</p><p>Mac winced. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good time to tell me that we\u2019re underfunded and undergunned to fight terrorists,\u201d he said with barely concealed impatience. \u201cLet\u2019s take it up next week.\u201d</p><p>D.J. swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>Mac was about to push past him, but there was something in the kid\u2019s eyes. Something that made him step back into the office and jerk his head toward one of the chairs in front of his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d he asked. D.J. hunched over, his hands twisting together. He scuffed his feet, then raised his head and announced, \u201cI\u2019ve met somebody.\u201d</p><p>Mac swore silently. Just his luck. His junior deputy had knocked up some summer bimbo. Did he want Mac\u2019s advice on getting married or keeping the kid? Mac figured he wasn\u2019t exactly the right person to ask.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to one of the women,\u201d he said knowing this didn\u2019t bode well for the day. \u201cThey\u2019re better at this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>D.J. nodded but didn\u2019t move. \u201cThe thing is we get along great. Not just, you know, in bed, but we can talk and laugh. We like the same things.\u201d He smiled shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><p>Young love, Mac thought, feeling about ninety years old. \u201cThat\u2019s great, D.J. I\u2019m really happy for you. You\u2019ll have to bring her around sometime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He couldn\u2019t bring her around? Because why? Mac got a bad feeling as he considered the possibility that D.J. was trying to carry on a relationship with a ghost, an extraterrestrial or God knows what.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d D.J. cleared his throat, glanced at the floor and then at Mac. \u201cHe\u2019s not a she. I mean...I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p> <p>Mac knew his first thought should be one of compassion or some such shit but all he could think was why the hell was this happening today?</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re disgusted,\u201d D.J. said in a small voice. He wasn\u2019t looking at Mac now. \u201cI am. If my dad knew, he\u2019d kill me. I mean, I played football. I\u2019m a jock. I\u2019m in law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>Mac carefully put down his clipboard and settled on the corner of his desk. Whatever crisis was happening with the pier celebration was going to have to wait.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not disgusted,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI\u2019m the last person to make judgments on anyone\u2019s choices. If this makes you happy, then I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d</p><p>Jeez, was he really saying this touchy-feely stuff? Not that he cared about who or what D.J. did in bed, but it was like channeling Oprah.</p> <p>The kid looked at him. Hope glimmered in his eyes. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. The department. I didn\u2019t know, because there\u2019s a don\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-tell policy in the military and I told and...\u201d</p><p>Mac put his hand on D.J.\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the Marines, kid. As long as your significant other is over eighteen and not wanted for a felony, have at it. But not today. Today I need you out on the beaches.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d D.J. stood and grinned. He looked as happy as a puppy with a new chew toy. \u201cI\u2019m glad I told you. I wanted to before, but I wasn\u2019t sure and I\u2019ve really felt guilty and bad. But this is great.\u201d</p><p>D.J. stepped forward as if he was going to hug Mac. Mac quickly held out his hand to shake.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Deputy. Stay safe.\u201d</p><p>Mac winced when D.J. actually saluted before heading out of his office.</p><p>Mac waited until the kid was gone, then he raised his eyes heavenward. \u201cCould this be as bad as it gets? I\u2019d be really grateful if you\u2019d take care of things.\u201d Then he grabbed his clipboard and his car keys and followed D.J. out of the building.</p><p>JILL SWUNG BY her office on her way to the pier celebration. She\u2019d promised Tina to help carry out the last of the fish.</p><p>Now that the little critters were down and the paneling stood there in all its old, stained glory, she couldn\u2019t help thinking how great the office would look with a nice coat of paint and maybe some wainscoting. New furniture, some varnish on the floor and...</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d she told herself as she walked to ward the front door. \u201cThis is not your rock to carry and not your office to redecorate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said to Tina as she walked into the reception area. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tina pointed at the boxes lined up against the far wall. \u201cMrs. Dixon wants to know if we would mind donating the rest of these to charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? She doesn\u2019t want them as a testament to the memory of her loving husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d</p><p>Jill laughed. \u201cWhy am I even surprised? Okay, we\u2019re not going to take them anywhere today. We\u2019ll just leave them and drag them to a charity place in the morning. Or maybe we should leave them tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tina grinned. \u201cRight. Under the cover of darkness so they can\u2019t refuse them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>The two women looked at each other. Jill felt an odd sense of having missed something with Tina. If they\u2019d gotten off to a better start or come to an understanding sooner, maybe they could have been friends.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a real help this summer,\u201d Jill said.</p><p>Tina shook her head. \u201cNot even for a second. I\u2019m sorry I was so difficult about coming in and stuff. I had a chip on my shoulder about a lot of things. You\u2019re just so perfect and smart and everything. I was determined to hate you.\u201d</p><p>Jill couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI\u2019m many things, but perfect isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. That\u2019s why you always look like a model and I\u2019m the example of the cautionary tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a family and a life. All I have is my career.\u201d</p><p>Tina shrugged. \u201cYou could have more if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jill started to tell her that it wasn\u2019t. Life was far more complicated than that. But was it really? Or had she been making it complicated all on her own?</p><p>The phone rang before she could decide. Tina frowned. \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s the pier centennial. Why would someone be calling?\u201d</p><p>Jill grinned. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not yet a national holiday. There is life outside of Los Lobos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I forgot.\u201d Tina reached for the phone.</p><p>Jill ducked into her office, where she glanced around at the fish-free decor. A lot had changed in a short period of time. If someone had told her when she\u2019d first arrived that she would feel kind of bad to be leaving Los Lobos, she probably would have driven Lyle\u2019s car over them.</p><p>Tina walked into her office. \u201cIt\u2019s for you. A Roger Manson.\u201d</p><p>Jill put down her briefcase. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Did you say Roger Manson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. He said you\u2019d know who he was.\u201d</p><p>Of course she did. He was the senior partner at her previous law firm. He was the man who had refused to take her calls after she\u2019d been fired and had given Lyle her office with a window. So he finally wanted to get in touch with her. Well, good. She could give him a piece of her mind.</p><p>She marched to the desk and grabbed the phone. \u201cThis is Jill Strathern,\u201d she said crisply.</p><p>\u201cAh, Jill, I\u2019m glad to have found you. Roger Man son here. How are you?\u201d</p><p>She picked up the FedEx envelope holding her offer from the San Diego firm. \u201cNever better, Rog, and your self?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m feeling pretty foolish right now.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected a lot of things, but not that. Did senior partners ever admit to feeling foolish?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling to let you know that Lyle has been let go.\u201d</p><p>That perked her right up. She might be over her revenge thing, but that didn\u2019t mean she wished Lyle well. \u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long list and I can\u2019t discuss all of it, but what I can tell you is that he put false reports in your permanent file and falsified client billings.\u201d</p><p>Jill sank into her chair. \u201cHe lied about me?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s the reason you were fired, Jill, and I want you to know we feel awful about it. When you were let go, several of us couldn\u2019t understand what had happened. You\u2019d done excellent work and the clients all adored you. In fact they miss you terribly. So we started an internal investigation.\u201d</p><p>He kept talking about what all had happened, but she wasn\u2019t listening. Not really. Instead she felt a bubble of happiness float its way up through her body until she thought she might levitate to the ceiling.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been her. She hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Vindication felt damn good.</p><p>\u201cWe want you back,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>That brought her down to earth with a thud.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you back,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand we want to show you how sorry we are with a very impressive raise. Of course you\u2019ll be promoted and given a nice office. Bigger than Lyle had. Please, Jill, won\u2019t you consider coming back?\u201d</p><p>She fingered the FedEx envelope. \u201cI\u2019m actually speaking with some other firms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that. Is there anything I can say or do to convince you that you belong here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get back to you on that,\u201d she said.</p><p>Later, when she\u2019d hung up, she walked to the window and stared out at the side street. Lyle was a washed-up has-been. If he\u2019d screwed with client billing, then he was at risk of being disbarred. Funny how without her doing anything at all, he\u2019d gotten what he deserved. So much for him buying her out of the condo. She had a feeling they would be putting the place on the market.</p><p>Now what, she wondered. Which offer did she accept? And why did the thought of leaving Los Lobos suddenly make her sad?</p><p>JILL DROVE BACK to Bev\u2019s house to pick up her aunt and Emily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Emily said as she danced around the living room. \u201cYour dad already left and he said we should hurry. There aren\u2019t going to be any good places left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurry,\u201d Jill promised as she raced upstairs to get changed. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m on the committee,\u201d she yelled from her room. \u201cWe get special parking.\u201d</p><p>It would almost make those hours spent stuffing goodie bags worthwhile.</p><p>She tugged off her clothes and pulled on a bathing suit. After fastening her hair back in a ponytail, she slathered sunscreen all over, then slipped a loose sundress over her head and grabbed her already-packed beach bag.</p><p>As she darted out of her room, she nearly ran into Bev, who had paused at the top of the stairs. They looked at each other.</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t know what to say to make things right between them. She knew that her aunt cared about Rudy. Jill didn\u2019t mind that so much as Bev\u2019s refusal to see the truth about the way he made his living. Jill\u2019s argument that Bev should understand what she was getting into had fallen on deaf ears.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Bev asked.</p><p>Jill nodded. \u201cAre we ever going to be friends again?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Bev\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. I\u2019m not angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought you\u2019d be happy for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you guys hurry?\u201d Emily yelled from the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Bev smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re being paged.\u201d</p><p>Jill didn\u2019t want to let the conversation drop, but with Emily staring up from the bottom of the stairs and the lack of privacy once they arrived at the pier celebration, she didn\u2019t see a choice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d she told Emily as she started down the stairs.</p><p>VIP parking turned out to be a very good thing, Jill realized as she locked the 545 and looked around at the mass of people heading toward the beach by the pier. She thought Los Lobos had pulled in a crowd for the Fourth of July, but that was nothing when compared with this. Lines stretched ten deep at the various concession stands. Dozens of body surfers vied for the perfect ride onto the beach.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d Emily said, pointing. \u201cSee. There\u2019s Ashley\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>Tina had offered to save them a spot, which made Jill grateful that she and her soon-to-be-former assistant were friends.</p><p>Jill raised the cooler as a toddler raced by, his mother in hot pursuit. Music poured from dozens of boom boxes. Shrieks and laughter and loud greetings added to the cacophony. The sand was warm, the sky blue and the smell of barbecue mingled with the scent of salt and suntan lotion.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d Jill said as they approached the spot Tina had marked out with towels.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be this many people,\u201d Tina said. \u201cI need to make another trip back to the car, but I wanted to wait until you got here. I practically had to fight off people wanting to move in on our territory. I heard someone say that the pier is already filling up, that they\u2019ll start limiting how many people can be on it at one time.\u201d Tina smiled at Emily. \u201cAshley is off with her dad. She should be back any second.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jill turned toward the pier and shielded her eyes. She could see people moving along the walkway and standing at the railing. Two officers in uniform walked toward the stairs leading to the beach. She recognized Mac and started to smile.</p><p>At that second, her heart gave a very distinctive ping, while her stomach flipped over and the rest of her insides got all warm and squishy.</p><p>She stood there, unable to move, unable to breathe as the truth crashed in on her. She loved Mac.</p> <p>Loved him? No. Wait. It wasn\u2019t possible. Sure, she\u2019d had a crush for years and the reality was far better than anything she\u2019d imagined, but that wasn\u2019t love. It wasn\u2019t anything but means and motive, right? It was great sex and fun conversation. It was him making her laugh and them sharing secrets and...</p><p>Oh...my...God.</p><p>It was love. She loved him. Maybe she always had, which was crazy. Maybe it was new.</p><p>Did it matter?</p><p>Several things occurred to her all at once. If he was charged with beating Andy Murphy and lost Emily, he would never forgive himself. Part of that self-punishment could very easily be refusing to be happy with her. Second, what if he didn\u2019t love her back? What if this had just been some good times with a little slap and tickle thrown in? Last but certainly not least, what was she supposed to do about her career now? If she\u2014</p> <p>\u201cJill?\u201d Emily tugged on her dress. \u201cCan you see my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Sure. He\u2019s right over there.\u201d She pointed to ward the pier.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna come have dinner with us later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Not good. How could she face Mac knowing that she loved him and that he might not love her back? What was she supposed to say to him? How and when would she tell him the truth and what if he rejected her? She\u2019d gotten over Lyle pretty easily because she\u2019d never really cared. But Mac was a whole different kind of man.</p><p>Think about that later, she told herself, not sure if she was happy or panicked when Emily started jumping up and down and waving her towel to get her dad\u2019s attention. It only took a couple of seconds for Mac to spot them and wave. When he started down the stairs, Jill had a bad feeling he was heading this way.</p><p>Act natural, she told herself. Pretend nothing has changed. This wasn\u2019t the time or place to deal with how anyone was feeling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to the car,\u201d Tina said.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Jill asked, eager to disappear for a while.</p><p>\u201cNo. You stay here and guard our stuff. I\u2019m telling you, people are ruthless.\u201d</p><p>With that, she walked off.</p><p>Jill busied herself spreading out towels while Bev marked the corners of their plot with the coolers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a fort,\u201d Emily said with a laugh. \u201cWe have to take turns standing guard.\u201d</p><p>Jill sat down and started to tug off her sandals. Just then Rudy walked up. Aware that Mac was quickly approaching and not wanting the two men to get into any thing, she stood quickly, prepared to tell him to get lost, but something in his expression stopped her.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d he said by way of greeting.</p> <p>Mr. Smith hovered closer than ever and Jill noticed he had one hand tucked under his coat as if he were going to grab his gun at any second.</p><p>Bev walked over and took Rudy\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn associate of mine is in town and he\u2019s angry about the recent death of his brother.\u201d</p><p>Fear gripped Jill. Another Mafia guy here looking for payback? In this crowd?</p><p>Her first thought was for Emily and she moved close to the girl. Where to go? Where could Emily hide and be safe?</p><p>\u201cRudy, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Bev said, sounding frightened. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jill wanted to scream out the truth, but she was aware of Emily listening. She scanned the crowd, looking for an angry stranger, for Mac, for Tina\u2019s husband.</p><p>Rudy pulled Bev to him. \u201cYou know those conversations you\u2019ve been having with Jill?\u201d</p><p>Bev nodded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong.\u201d</p><p>Bev sagged against him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have told you myself. I was afraid if I did you wouldn\u2019t love me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting Emily out of here,\u201d Jill said, taking the girl by the hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy is Bev crying?\u201d</p><p>Jill turned and ran smack into Mac.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, but before anyone could answer, a woman screamed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>MAC TURNED toward the scream and saw Andy Murphy holding a knife to his wife\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cGet back,\u201d Andy yelled. \u201cEveryone get back.\u201d</p><p>Mac swore and motioned for everyone to move away. Kim, pregnant and pale, her eyes wide with fear, didn\u2019t say anything. Her husband locked his left arm around her just above her belly, pinning her arms at her side. The tip of a hunting blade brushed against her skin and a bead of red appeared. She whimpered and someone in the crowd screamed.</p><p>Mac could feel the weight of his own gun against his side. If he pulled it out, Andy would cut his wife\u2019s throat. If he didn\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d Andy said, his voice thick with rage. \u201cYou set that dumb-ass social worker on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mac demanded. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Just then he saw Hollis inching forward. Dammit all to hell, what had the idiot done?</p><p>\u201cGet back,\u201d Mac yelled at Hollis.</p><p>Hollis, still prissy in Bermuda shorts and a button-down short-sleeved shirt, walked purposely forward. \u201cI\u2019m a professional and I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take another step toward me and I\u2019ll slice her head off,\u201d Andy growled.</p><p>Hollis came to a dead stop.</p><p>Mac ignored the social worker and focused on Andy. Information poured into his brain\u2014who was nearby, the sharpness of the knife, Andy\u2019s rapidly deteriorating mental state. He wondered if the guy was drunk or just pushed to the edge. Had that bully nature of his finally snapped, forcing him to believe he was trapped and this was the only way out? Mac had to convince him otherwise. If he couldn\u2019t do that, he needed time to get off a clean shot.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t kill her,\u201d Mac said quietly. \u201cIf you let her push you that far, you know she wins.\u201d</p><p>Andy stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to win? Don\u2019t you have to be the one to walk away while she begs you to forgive her?\u201d</p><p>Andy frowned. He glanced down at Kim and started to nod. Just then Hollis moved in.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked. \u201cAndy, put that knife down right now so no one gets hurt.\u201d</p><p>Mac physically shoved the social worker out of the way, but it was too late. Andy\u2019s anger returned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to slit her throat,\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019m going to ruin everybody\u2019s party. How\u2019s that for fun, huh?\u201d</p><p>Where was the rest of his team, Mac wondered, and what would they do when they arrived? He had to defuse Andy, but with Hollis around, not to mention the damn crowd, that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cAndy,\u201d he said, hoping Hollis wouldn\u2019t interrupt him. \u201cYou know she\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Andy dug the knife in a little more and Kim gave a strangled cry. Blood trickled down her throat. Mac judged the distance. If he went for his gun, would the other man have time to seriously injure Kim? A knife wasn\u2019t a gun, but it could still be lethal.</p><p>Mac could hear the worried conversations around him. He could feel Andy\u2019s control slipping. He had to move or\u2014</p><p>A dark-haired man in a light-colored suit came up be hind Andy. Before Mac could figure out who he was or what he was doing here, the man put a gun to Andy\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cLet the woman go,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>JILL TOLD HERSELF not to scream. Freaking out wouldn\u2019t help anyone, but she couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.</p><p>Andy jerked slightly, then clutched the knife tighter. \u201cIf you shoot me, she\u2019s dead for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d the stranger said calmly. \u201cNow put the knife down.\u201d</p><p>Andy lowered his arm, but kept hold of Kim. Jill wanted to grab the pregnant woman and pull her to safety, but the guy in the suit looked too dangerous to mess with.</p><p>Mac glanced at him as he pulled out his own gun. \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re here for Rudy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The man looked past Mac. Jill instinctively turned and nearly fainted when she saw another stranger holding a gun on Rudy. Mr. Smith lay unconscious on the ground.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to have a gunfight,\u201d the first man said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any innocent people hurt,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cSometimes they get in the way.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t real, she thought frantically. It couldn\u2019t be. They were at the beach. All around them people were laughing and surfing and eating hot dogs. This sort of thing didn\u2019t happen where there were hot dogs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to Rudy,\u201d Mac said evenly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to let you take care of business in my town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Casaccio hasn\u2019t given me and my associates much choice.\u201d</p><p>Mac glanced around and Jill had a feeling he was wondering where his deputies were. The man with the gun obviously had the same thought.</p><p>\u201cTwo of your men are tied up in their cars. Uninjured,\u201d he added. \u201cThe others are too far away to get here in time. I\u2019m sorry to interrupt your party, Sheriff. I don\u2019t usually like public displays like this, but I don\u2019t have an other option.\u201d</p><p>Jill turned toward Emily. She had to get the girl out of here. Relief poured through her when she saw Bev already had the girl and was inching back from the unbelievable tableau. Suddenly she heard the faint sound of sirens.</p><p>\u201cLooks like my guys are on the way,\u201d Mac said, sounding relieved. He pointed his gun at the man close to Andy. \u201cPut your weapon down now and we\u2019ll get this straightened out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Sheriff. Your men will get here too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, this is about me and my bitch of a wife,\u201d Andy yelled. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re annoying,\u201d the slick guy in the suit said, and kicked the back of Andy\u2019s knee.</p><p>Andy started to go down. Kim might be slight, but she was pregnant and awkward. She stumbled as her husband slipped. Andy pushed her away, regained his footing and ran toward the guy who had kicked him.</p><p>\u201cHollis, protect my daughter,\u201d Mac yelled as he charged Andy and the other guy.</p><p>Jill heard a grunt. When she turned, she saw Rudy punching the man who\u2019d held a gun on him. Hollis ran toward Emily, who broke free of Bev and started to run toward Jill. Jill grabbed her, pulled her against her body, then bent over, trying to cover as much of her as possible.</p><p>Mac plowed into Andy and his assaulter and the three of them went down. His only intent was to keep anyone from getting shot. He guessed the knife had gone flying. It would be a problem in a minute or two but right now he had to get the other gun.</p><p>A kick to the gut pushed all the air out of him. He fought the instinct to stop and breathe and continued to punch any flesh that wasn\u2019t his own. A glint of metal had him grabbing, then the muzzle turned toward him. He ducked. There was a flash and he waited for the hot impact.</p><p>His heart beat once, twice. Nothing. Not sure what had happened, he cracked his gun against the wrist holding the other weapon. There was a grunt of pain and the gun in question fell to the sand. Mac grabbed it and scrambled to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about moving,\u201d he told the stranger.</p><p>The man rolled over onto his back and Mac saw the gushing bullet wound in Andy\u2019s chest. Instinctively he glanced up toward Kim. The young woman saw her husband, screamed, clutched her belly and dropped to the sand. A couple of people in the crowd caught her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just then D.J. ran toward him. \u201cI heard gunshots,\u201d he yelled, looking more excited than scared. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Mac turned to check on Emily and Jill. He saw them huddled together and drew his first steady breath since the trouble had started.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Jill nodded.</p><p>He looked past her to where Rudy and a slightly wobbly Mr. Smith held the second stranger at gunpoint.</p><p>\u201cStart with them,\u201d he told D.J. \u201cArrest them all.\u201d</p><p>JILL WATCHED the hospital elevators, tensing every time they opened. Wilma had promised Mac would arrive as soon as he took Emily home and finished up his preliminary paperwork. Three hours after leaving the beach in the ambulance with Kim, she was starting to go crazy.</p><p>Just as she was about to call the sheriff\u2019s office again, the elevator doors opened and Mac stepped out. Even as she took in the bruise on his jaw and careful way he held his arm, she rushed toward him and threw herself at him.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she breathed, holding on as tightly as she could. \u201cIs Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both fine.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaky, but otherwise okay. What happened? Is Andy still down in emergency or did they take him to surgery? Did you really arrest Rudy?\u201d</p><p>He led her to a bench along the hallway wall and pulled her down next to him.</p><p>She touched the bruise on his face. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it ironic that I\u2019ve been in more fights in the past couple of weeks than in the past ten years. It\u2019s a pattern I\u2019d like to break.\u201d</p> <p>He tucked her hair behind her ears, then brushed his thumb across her mouth. \u201cHow\u2019s Kim?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn labor. She\u2019s about three weeks early, but the doctor said the baby looks fine. I talked to Kim\u2019s mother. She\u2019s driving up from Los Angeles and should be here within the hour. The poor woman had no idea what was going on with her daughter. She feels horrible and wants to take Kim home with her.\u201d She took one of Mac\u2019s hands in hers and squeezed. \u201cKim keeps asking about Andy and I can\u2019t get any information from the staff. How is he?\u201d</p><p>The bleakness in Mac\u2019s blue eyes told her the truth before he spoke the words. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make it. They pronounced him dead on arrival at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cHe was a horrible man, but to die like that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Mac pulled her close. \u201cRudy\u2019s friends have been arrested for murder and attempted murder. We\u2019ll be tacking on a few other charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rudy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to put him away, in this case, he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>There was too much to think about. Too much to consider.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Emily?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe has to be in shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Tina and her family right now. I spent about an hour with her first. Fortunately she didn\u2019t see that much, but the whole situation still scared the hell out of her. Hollis keeps paging me.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sure he thinks this is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. He can\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s the least of it. I\u2019ve got a call in to Carly. This whole thing is bound to piss her off big time.\u201d</p><p>Jill had a feeling he was right. \u201cDoes she know about the preliminary hearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will after we talk.\u201d</p><p>If Carly reacted badly\u2014a circumstance Jill could see happening\u2014then she could go directly to the judge in charge of the custody case and insist Mac give up Emily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fight,\u201d she said, staring at him. \u201cNo matter what, you\u2019re not going to be in this alone.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cYour father stopped by the police station to tell me he wanted to represent me. Is that your doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was interested already. I just told him there was an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He drew her close and kissed her. Jill let herself sink into his embrace and the feeling of his mouth on hers. This is what she wanted, she told herself. To be with Mac always. But when to tell him? Certainly not now. If the hearing went badly, would he even care about her feelings?</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to the station,\u201d he said. \u201cWilma volunteered to tell Kim about her husband, but we want to wait until after the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Her mom will be here then. That will help. Although she\u2019s going to be destroyed. In her own way, she really loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what she felt was love.\u201d He stood and pulled her to her feet. \u201cYou take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.</p><p>A LITTLE AFTER TEN the next morning, Mac lay stretched out on his sofa with his feet up on the coffee table. Emily was curled up next to him, still sleeping. She\u2019d begged him not to put her to bed the previous night and he hadn\u2019t had the heart to refuse her. So they\u2019d watched Disney movies until after midnight, then she\u2019d fallen asleep in his arms.</p><p>He wanted to believe everything would work out and that his life would return to normal, but he had his doubts. Andy might be dead, but that didn\u2019t take away what Mac had done. Andy being so close to going over the edge offered something of a defense, but was it enough?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about what might happen and he couldn\u2019t seem to think about anything else. Carly had already called twice to yell at him. She couldn\u2019t get away until the following morning, but she would be in town in time for the hearing. Hollis had left nearly fifteen messages\u2014thank God for caller ID\u2014and Mac had been fielding calls from the local press. He\u2019d taken the morning off to stay with Em, but at this rate, they weren\u2019t getting much time together.</p><p>He glanced down at her and stroked her beautiful blond hair. Funny how when she\u2019d been little he\u2019d assumed that the worst he would have to deal with was her rolling her eyes at him when she turned thirteen and beating the boys off with a stick. He\u2019d never thought he\u2019d screw up so badly that he might actually lose her.</p><p>He told himself not to anticipate the worst, but the instruction didn\u2019t stop the pain from ripping through his heart. He\u2019d already let her down too many times and it was about to happen again. If he lost custody of her, she wouldn\u2019t understand anything more than the fact that her father had once more disappeared. He doubted he would get a second chance to set things right.</p><p>He heard footsteps on the porch, then someone knocked. He thought about ignoring it, but when he heard Jill\u2019s voice, he straightened and shifted Emily from his lap to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Daddy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jill. You go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her eyes and yawned. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He stood and walked to the front of the house. When he pulled it open, he saw Jill was not alone and nearly slammed the door in her face.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>He looked past her to where Rudy stood. \u201cYou have nothing I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re upset,\u201d the other man said. \u201cI came to apologize and tell you I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Mac stared at him for a long time before stepping back. As Jill walked in, he nodded toward the living room.</p><p>\u201cEm\u2019s in there. Would you please take her upstairs? She\u2019s still upset about what happened yesterday and I don\u2019t want her to see Rudy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Jill hurried into the other room. He heard murmured voices, then saw the two of them going up the stairs. Only then did he nod at Rudy.</p><p>\u201cYou have five minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Rudy stepped into the house and glanced around. \u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>Mac folded his arms over his chest and waited.</p><p>Rudy shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re not happy with me. That makes sense. In your place, I\u2019d be plenty pissed off, too.\u201d He shoved his hands into his slacks\u2019 pockets. \u201cI first came to town to see if Jill was okay. You know, after what Lyle did. After a couple of days I realized I liked the area. I\u2019d thought about leaving Vegas and this little place seemed perfect. Then I met Bev.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing woman. I thought it was a sign\u2014the town, meeting her, wanting to ease toward retirement. You were difficult, but I had the mayor in my pocket and I knew there was an election coming up and I could make sure you didn\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>Mac did his best not to react to the information. None of it was news.</p><p>\u201cThe gambling was a mistake,\u201d Rudy said with a grimace. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did it. Knee-jerk reaction, I guess. I wanted to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is I felt kinda bad afterward. Then Bev and I went away and I realized I\u2019d been looking for her all my life. She\u2019s a really decent woman. Special. She didn\u2019t know what I did, and I knew if she found out, she\u2019d be furious. Especially about the gambling. But I didn\u2019t want to leave. It was a serious dilemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your friends showed up yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Rudy nodded. \u201cThat was bad. People could have got ten hurt. People like your daughter, or Jill or Bev. So I did some thinking and I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m not right for Los Lobos. I need to be back in Vegas where I understand how things work and there aren\u2019t any surprises like yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He drew one hand out of his pocket and handed Mac a card. \u201cI\u2019m leaving in a couple of hours. If you need to get in touch with me for anything, here\u2019s how to reach me.\u201d</p><p>Mac took the card but didn\u2019t look at it. \u201cThe gambling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll shut down. I feel kind of bad about the mayor\u2014the money I gave him. I\u2019d like to give you the same amount for your campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured you\u2019d say that.\u201d Rudy looked him over. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man. I don\u2019t meet very many in my line of work. If you ever need anything, just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Rudy nodded, then walked out of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Jill asked from the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Is he really leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. He\u2019s all packed up.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the ceiling. \u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell right to sleep.\u201d Jill walked down the stairs and over to him. \u201cBev\u2019s going with Rudy. We talked most of the night. While she now understands who and what he is, she still loves him and wants to be with him. She\u2019s moving to Las Vegas. At first I felt kind of strange about it, but the longer I thought about it, the more right it seems. How crazy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty wild.\u201d Looking at Jill made him ache inside. \u201cShe\u2019s selling the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. We didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Why would they? Jill wouldn\u2019t want it; her life was somewhere else that wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>He dropped Rudy\u2019s card on the entry tabletop, then cupped Jill\u2019s face in his hands. As he stared into her eyes, he told himself it was for the best. He had nothing to offer her\u2014certainly nothing of value.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your new life. Away from here. In time this will all seem like a bad dream. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow at the hearing. I know that whatever is decided, I\u2019m going to keep fighting for Emily. We both deserve that.\u201d</p><p>Jill smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to fight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his thumbs against her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re an incredible woman, Jill Strathern. I wish only the best for you.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cThat sounds amazingly like goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Thanks for the good times and goodbye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something. I appreciate that you\u2019re willing to fight for Emily, but why aren\u2019t you willing to fight for me? Don\u2019t I matter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his mouth against hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and glared at him. \u201cLet me see if I have this right. You\u2019re telling me you love me and not to let the door hit me in the ass on the way out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you fully expect me to leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s what you want.\u201d This wasn\u2019t going well, but he wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d she told him. Anger hardened her words until they felt like bits of glass. \u201cFor someone who thinks he knows so much, you\u2019re incredibly stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>She walked past him and out the front door. At the top of the steps she turned back. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>JILL GRUMBLED the entire way to the courthouse.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be in a temper,\u201d her father said calmly from the passenger seat.</p> <p>\u201cI am. Mac is really stupid. I want to slap him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a lot on his mind.\u201d</p><p>She stopped at the light and glared at her father. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about taking his side against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to defend him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor hitting Andy, not for what he did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would go better if you told me what he\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cDo you really want to have an intimate conversation about my personal life?\u201d</p><p>Her father held up both hands. \u201cExcellent point. You\u2019re right. Whatever he did, Mac was a jerk and I hope the two of you work it out.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed without answering. Men. Were they all idiots? How on earth could Mac say he loved her and then turn around and let her go? What was up with that? Had he thought it through? Did he think the words were enough? Didn\u2019t he know that she was willing to com promise and find a solution that worked for them both? But no. He made the grand gesture and the decision without once consulting her. It was just so typical and when she stopped being so mad that she wanted to spit, she was going to tell him.</p><p>She pulled into the courthouse parking lot and found a spot for the 545. Before she opened her door, she looked at her father.</p><p>\u201cYou have a plan, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAre you doubting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care, but this is Mac. I might want to beat the crap out of him right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to do it with him in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting point. I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>She opened the car door and stepped out into the morning. It was beautiful and clear, much as it had been a couple of days ago at the pier celebration. Not that she wanted that experience repeated again. If there\u2014</p><p>A sharp sound like a gunshot made her jump. Before her heart could leap out of her chest, she realized it was just another car door nearby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need therapy to get back to normal,\u201d she muttered right before someone grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>She shrieked and spun away only to find herself staring into the pale gray eyes of her ex-husband.</p><p>\u201cLyle? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, his face flushed and his veins throbbing. \u201cYou ruined me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI think you have me confused with, oh, say, yourself. I\u2019ve been here in Los Lobos for the past several weeks, trying to put my life together. You\u2019ve been in San Francisco. How exactly could I have ruined you?\u201d</p><p>He looked young and upset, as if he were about to cry. \u201cEverything is gone. My job, my career. There\u2019s talk of disbarring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, she found she meant the words.</p><p>\u201cI want my car,\u201d he said, sounding as petulant as a child.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d She handed him the keys. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cJust like that? Why are you being nice?\u201d</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t matter. Because he had nothing and even if Mac was an idiot, she still had a chance for perfect happiness.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to give you the car,\u201d she said. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>He brushed back his thinning hair and grabbed the keys, then turned to the BMW and ran his hands along the smooth roof.</p><p>\u201cAre there any dents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a one. Not even a scratch.\u201d</p><p>She thought about telling him her theory that the car was somehow protected by a higher force, but what was the point?</p><p>\u201cEnjoy,\u201d she said, and started walking toward the courthouse.</p><p>Her father fell into step with her. \u201cI never knew what you saw in him.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back as Lyle got into the car and started the engine. \u201cMe, either. I sold myself way short with him, and I can tell you that\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He put his arm around her. \u201cYou know there\u2019s a very good chance Lyle\u2019s going to be living out of that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the steps of the courthouse and started to climb them. From the street came the squeal of brakes followed by a huge crash. Jill turned to see that Lyle had driven the gleaming black 545 into the side of a delivery truck. He got out and started screaming. She stood there for a second, trying to care, then realized she didn\u2019t and walked inside.</p><p>MAC HAD THOUGHT a few folks from town would come to the hearing. Events like this were always of interest, but even he hadn\u2019t expected there to be standing room only.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be a popular figure around here,\u201d William Strathern said as he opened his briefcase and pulled out some papers.</p><p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019re offering support,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>He turned away from the crowd when he spotted Hollis waving at him. He\u2019d been avoiding the social worker for two days. No way did he want to hear the prissy pip-squeak gloating now.</p><p>\u201cYou might be surprised at what the people want,\u201d Strathern told him. \u201cHave you talked to Jill lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Not since he\u2019d told her he loved her and she\u2019d stalked out of his house as if he\u2019d insulted her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a temper,\u201d her father said. \u201cI wonder why.\u201d</p><p>Mac swallowed but didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cYou know about her job offer in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer old law firm wants her back, too.\u201d</p><p>Mac hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cGreat. She must be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly, she\u2019s not. Oh, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a nice sense of vindication, but apparently Jill wants to make other arrangements for her future.\u201d</p><p>Mac felt sure there was a message in the other man\u2019s words, but he wasn\u2019t sure what it was. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s father stared at him. \u201cDid it ever occur to you there was a reason you and Jill both returned to Los Lobos at exactly the same time?\u201d</p><p>Before Mac could absorb the question, let alone answer it, Carly came up. He hadn\u2019t seen her in nearly a month and she didn\u2019t look very happy.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Emily?\u201d she asked by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cWith her baby-sitter. I didn\u2019t want her to see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you got that right.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cDammit, Mac, how could you do this? How can you act like this and expect me to trust you with our child? What if you\u2019re charged? What if you go to prison? What will she think about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Kendrick?\u201d</p><p>Mac nearly growled when he saw Hollis approaching. \u201cGet out of here,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Hollis ignored him. \u201cMrs. Kendrick, I\u2019m the social worker in charge of your case. If I could have a moment of your time, please?\u201d</p><p>Mac wanted to grab the other man by the shirtfront and shake him. \u201cStay out of this, Hollis.\u201d</p><p>Hollis pushed up his glasses. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that, Mac. There are some things that Emily\u2019s mother needs to know about you.\u201d</p><p>Mac sank down in his chair and knew he was completely and totally screwed.</p><p>\u201cNot a fan?\u201d Strathern asked.</p><p>\u201cMore like someone who would like to see me do hard time.\u201d</p><p>The bailiff appeared, along with the judge, and court was called to session. Mac stared straight ahead, not wanting to see what was going on behind him or look at the district attorney.</p><p>The charges were read. William Strathern rose and introduced himself to the judge.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Bill,\u201d the man at the bench said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d moved to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. This is a special case.\u201d Strathern slipped on his glasses. \u201cI\u2019m sure the district attorney told you that Andrew Murphy is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, yes. The court sends condolences to the family, but his death doesn\u2019t change what happened.\u201d</p><p>Much as Mac had thought.</p><p>\u201cAre you also aware that my client has temporary custody of his minor-aged daughter and that there are certain limitations to that custody?\u201d Strathern asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Mr. Bass from our Social Services department has given me all of the particulars. If Mr. Kendrick is charged, I\u2019ll be informing the court in Los Angeles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Your Honor?\u201d</p><p>Mac turned and saw Hollis had risen.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Hollis Bass. About that report to the other court. It\u2019s not really necessary.\u201d</p><p>The judge frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that whatever happens here, whatever Mr. Kendrick did, he still loves his daughter very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rules, Mr. Bass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d Hollis adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. \u201cIn the past few days I\u2019ve come to see that Mac, ah, Mr. Kendrick is an extraordinary father. What he did to the deceased was wrong, but he did it for the best of reasons. He was trying to protect a young woman\u2019s life. A pregnant young woman. He stepped in when my department did nothing. For all we know, he saved Mrs. Murphy\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Mac felt as if he\u2019d stepped into an alternative universe. Hollis defending him? Was it possible?</p><p>Several people started whispering. The judge banged his gavel and called for order.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bass, are you arguing for Mr. Kendrick to keep his daughter or for the district attorney to drop the charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hollis looked surprised. \u201cBoth, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this would be by what authority?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ah, none, but I\u2019ve gotten to know Mr. Kendrick and when I saw how he handled the situation on the beach, it was amazing. So many people could have been killed. There were ample opportunities for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Bass. I\u2019m sure if either side wishes you to testify, they\u2019ll call on you. Please be seated.\u201d</p><p>Hollis nodded vigorously and sank back in his chair.</p><p>Mac shook his head. Was that why Hollis kept calling? Had he wanted to reassure Mac that he was now on his side?</p><p>\u201cYour Honor?\u201d</p><p>The judge looked up. \u201cYes? You are?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarly Kendrick. Mac\u2019s ex-wife and the mother of his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit, Mac thought.</p><p>\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d the judge asked, sounding weary.</p> <p>\u201cMac\u2019s. I was furious when I found out what had happened, but since arriving in town, I\u2019ve heard nothing but praise for how he handled a very difficult situation. Plus, if you consider that Andy Murphy tried to murder his wife, I would say he had a beating coming. Not that I want to speak ill of the dead.\u201d</p><p>Mac turned around and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d the judge said. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that Mac and Emily, our daughter, have a wonderful relationship and I would hate to see that taken away from either of them. She\u2019s only eight and she needs her father.\u201d</p><p>The judge narrowed his gaze. \u201cCan we all be clear here? Mr. Kendrick\u2019s custody arrangement isn\u2019t in question. We are here to discuss whether or not he\u2019s going to be charged with assault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d a man in the back yelled. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have done it. He was with me at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d the judge asked.</p><p>\u201cMarly Cobson. I run a couple of tour boats. Mac and me were having a beer at the time someone else beat the crap out of Murphy. He had it coming. Murphy, not Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with them, too,\u201d another man said.</p><p>Nothing made sense, Mac thought, even as the unexpected support warmed him.</p><p>\u201cDid you arrange this?\u201d he asked Strathern.</p> <p>Jill\u2019s father shook his head. \u201cI prepared a brilliant legal argument. Makes me think I wasted my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred and me here, we were with them, too,\u201d another man said.</p><p>\u201cI baked cookies for the whole lot of them,\u201d Tina said as she stood. \u201cThere was a real crowd.\u201d</p><p>The judge banged his gavel on the desk and glared at the spectators. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you again to be quiet. If you all listen, then I won\u2019t bother with a lecture on the dangers of perjury.\u201d</p><p>John Goodwin, the D.A., stood. \u201cYour Honor. In light of this new evidence, I\u2019m going to have to ask that the charges be dropped while my office does a more thorough investigation.\u201d</p><p>A cheer went up in the crowd. Mac looked at his lawyer and shook his head. \u201cWe both know it can\u2019t happen like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Strathern said, and rose. \u201cYour Honor, my client would like to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me this is a good time to stay silent,\u201d the judge grumbled. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Mac stood. \u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t want anyone to get in trouble for what they said here today. They\u2019re being kind and I appreciate that, but the truth of the matter is I lost my temper and I hit Andy Murphy. It was wrong. He beat his wife and in the end, he tried to kill her, but that doesn\u2019t give me the right to punch him. We have laws and as the sheriff of this town, it\u2019s my responsibility to set an example by following them. I don\u2019t want to go to prison and I don\u2019t want to lose my daughter, but I\u2019m not going to do the wrong thing for the right reason again.\u201d</p><p>The judge glanced at him, then the D.A. \u201cAny other surprises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>The judge returned his attention to Mac. \u201cYou planning to take the law into your own hands again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t change what I did.\u201d</p><p>The judge leaned forward. \u201cBill, you want to instruct your client to answer the question asked and nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Mac felt Jill\u2019s father nudge him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be taking the law into my own hands again,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t want to see you again in this courthouse. At least not on the wrong side of the law.\u201d The judge banged his gavel. \u201cCase dismissed. Everyone, get the hell out of my courthouse.\u201d</p><p>JILL WATCHED everyone surround Mac. It seemed the en tire town of Los Lobos wanted to congratulate him and take part in the victory celebration. Somehow she didn\u2019t feel comfortable in that crowd.</p><p>So she walked out of the courthouse only to realize she\u2019d given her ride home to Lyle. The BMW was gone, as was the delivery truck. It was about an eight-mile walk back to Bev\u2019s place, which meant she was going to have to call and ask to be picked up.</p><p>She punched the number on the cell phone. When Bev answered, she explained what had happened.</p><p>\u201cWe have cookies in the oven,\u201d Bev said when she\u2019d finished. \u201cGive us fifteen minutes and we\u2019ll be there. Tell Mac we\u2019re delighted for him.\u201d</p><p>Jill had no plans to talk to Mac so Bev was going to have to deliver that message in person before she packed up and left for Vegas.</p><p>Jill planted herself on a top step off to the side of the courthouse. It didn\u2019t take long for the people to make their way out and leave. She supposed she could have gotten a ride from nearly anyone, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk. Not when everything hurt.</p><p>Now what? If she didn\u2019t stay mad at Mac for being an idiot, she was going to have to feel horrible because he wasn\u2019t willing to fight for her. How could she love a man so very willing to let her go?</p><p>Her eyes burned. She blinked hard, because there was no way she was going to cry over him. He wasn\u2019t worth it. Except he was, and she loved him and why couldn\u2019t he see that?</p><p>She felt someone approach and turned her head so whoever it was wouldn\u2019t notice the tears. Then, before she realized what had happened, Mac had slipped a pair of handcuffs around her wrists. She stared from them to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she asked in out rage.</p><p>\u201cGetting your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you arresting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>She held out her hands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sat next to her and stared out at the horizon. \u201cI love it here, Jill. Los Lobos has always been my home. I want to run for election next November and I want to serve here for the next thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know you have your future mapped out. Now unlock these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. See, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out why you got so mad at me yesterday and I think I know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I\u2019ll have to put a star by this day on the calendar.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her. She sat there as stiffly as she could, refusing to kiss him back, even when he nibbled on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do. You love me a lot and you don\u2019t want to go anywhere, but you didn\u2019t want to come out and say that. You wanted me to ask.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cYou wanted me to prove you were more than a convenience and that I thought you were worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes started burning again and she knew she was seconds from crying but for very different reasons than before.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cSo if I hadn\u2019t asked, were you just going to go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice low. \u201cI already turned down both jobs. I was going to stay in Los Lobos and make you see sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut I have to tell you, I gave the BMW back to Lyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I prefer to buy American. Maybe we can get a minivan. You know, for all the kids we\u2019re going to have.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI love you, Jill. Please stay in Los Lobos and marry me. Although if it\u2019s really important, we can go somewhere else so you can practice your big-city law.\u201d</p><p>The first tears slipped down her cheek. She raised her handcuffed hands over his head and pulled him close.</p><p>\u201cI would rather stay right here,\u201d she said with a sniff. \u201cWith you. We can buy Bev\u2019s house and have babies, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for a minivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated Los Lobos.\u201d</p><p>She thought about the town and how everything had changed. \u201cActually, I think it\u2019s grown on me. Besides, you love it and I can live anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, and somewhere in the distance she heard the sound of applause.</p><p>\u201cWe have an audience,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably stop kissing me and let me out of the handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I will.\u201d He pressed his mouth to hers. \u201cIn a second.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back slightly and grinned. \u201cI think we should keep the handcuffs, though. For later.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cJill, I have to tell you. I\u2019ve always admired your style.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
