Men, it was universally acknowledged, were good for only one thing\u2014making babies.</p><p>Tolerated only for short periods of time as a necessary, though inconvenient, evil, men were banned from even living on the planet. It was imperative, then, that no one ever find out about Princess Kai, of the Royal Family of Scythia, second daughter of the High Queen Ashlan. Princess Kai hid a terrible secret from the moment of her birth. Princess Kai was a man.</p> <p>His mind distracted with these heavy thoughts, Kai walked resignedly into the dressing chamber to allow his body servants to assist him with the heavy ceremonial robes. The rich, purple robes the Scythian royal family wore to all state occasions were oppressive in the heat, but the wedding this day was that of the royal heiress to the throne, Princess Delanon, and would be a solemn and momentous occasion.</p><p>The heavy robes were good for one thing\u2014hiding Kai\u2019s shame. On Scythia, where males were considered defective and undesirable, the secret would surely mean imprisonmentor even death for Kai and his mother. While the queen was a powerful and respected monarch, the laws were quite clear on the subject. The only men or non-persons who were allowed to enter their world were traders or ambassadors from other planets, and then only temporarily.</p><p>The worst thing was that time was running out for Kai. His mother\u2019s council was already urging her to find Kai a husband, and Kai was very afraid that when that time came, he was doomed. His sister, Princess Delanon, was already making plans to take over the throne from the aging queen. In their war-like society, the queen was expected to lead the army, and Queen Ashlan was far too old to go into battle. She would be stepping aside soon for the royal succession, and once Delanon became queen, Kai knew she would insist a consort be found for him immediately to get him away from Scythia.</p><p>Delanon\u2019s wedding ceremony on this day was the first step in the process. Once a female child was born, Delanon and her consort would go their separate ways until such time, if any, as Delanon might want another child. The consort would return to his home planet in the meantime, and Delanon would be free to live her own life. The arrangement was mutually beneficial. The royal consort was well-compensated with a rich dowry, and it was common for male consorts to take love slaves when they got back home to satisfy their sexual needs outside the marriage. As for Delanon, she would have a girl child to rear who would one day, in her turn, become queen, and in the meantime she was free to take lovers of her own.</p><p>Kai was the queen\u2019s youngest child. His sister, Delanon had been born a healthy, beautiful girl, the heiress to the throne, so another child was not required, but his mother had done something almost unthinkable in their culture. The warrior queen had fallen in love at first sight with her royal consort. After the Princess Delanon was born, the queen managed to visit her consort again and again, telling her advisors she was trying for another child. When she became pregnant for the second time, she was ecstatic, but her happiness was short-lived. Her beloved consort, Willon, was killed in a battle on his home planet of Alger.</p> <p>The queen was almost inconsolable with grief, and when her child was born a male, she was paralyzed by fear and dread. The child looked so much like his father that it hurt her heart to gaze on him, but neither could she bear to part with him. The idea of giving the boy child to the priestesses was unthinkable. Instead, since the hour of Kai\u2019s birth, his mother concealed his gender by demanding that only she or the women of her chamber tend to Kai. It was almost unheard of not to hire a royal nursemaid, but she was the queen and her word was law. The women of her chamber were all fiercely loyal to their queen, and they agreed to keep her secret.</p><p>Her people whispered about her unnatural attachment to the child, but never to her face and never within her hearing. As Kai grew older, the queen warned him that it would be disastrous beyond measure for both of them should anyone discover Kai was a boy.</p><p>When it was time to show himself on the royal dais behind his sister, Kai remembered to make short steps like he\u2019d been carefully taught, and keep his eyes demurely down. As a royal princess, he was carefully guarded, and he stood between two of the large women who were his personal escorts. Kai had taken after his father\u2019s people, and he was even larger than the tall, heavily built Scythians. He was taller than both his mother and his sister, though his body was lean. His mother had long encouraged him to lift weights to develop pectoral muscles in his chest, to simulate the swelling of a woman\u2019s breasts. The weights also kept his waist trim, so his chest and abdominal muscles were large and well-defined.</p><p>His undesirable genitals were a constant trial to him, and as they grew, it was getting harder and harder to push things between his legs and cover up the leftover bulges in his leggings. He bitterly resented having to live the lie, but it was all he\u2019d ever known. He was also fiercely protective of his mother and would do anything she asked of him.</p><p>His sister, Delanon, came forward on the dais, wearing her diamond-studded crown. She cast a glance over at Kai and frowned. They\u2019d never gotten along as he\u2019d once longed to. She was jealous of the attention he was paid by his mother, not knowing the true reason behind it. Their mother had never trusted the envious child not to reveal the secret, and from the looks she gave Kai when she thought their mother wasn\u2019t looking, Kai was only too glad she didn\u2019t have that ammunition to use against him.</p><p>Her new husband, another prince of Alger like Kai\u2019s father had once been, stepped up beside her for the formal vows. Kai was fascinated by him. Not because he was particularly good looking\u2014the poor man\u2019s teeth were too big and stuck out in front, and he had a little bald spot on the back of his head. But because he was a man, and Kai had never seen many men outside of a few pictures. When he turned to take Delanon\u2019s hand for the final vows, Kai could see the large bulge in the front of his leggings, and he felt an odd little flutter down deep inside, one that shot straight to his own carefully strapped-down genitals, and made them ache a little. What in the world was that about?</p> <p>He\u2019d been around females all his life in various stages of undress and had never been aroused before. Now, with just one look at his new brother-in-law\u2019s large bulge, the long piece of flesh between his legs was trying to thicken. Thank the gods Kai was wearing his robes. Surreptitiously, he tried pinching his thigh really hard to keep his own flesh from swelling and hardening.</p><p>It had been happening more and more often since he was about twelve cycles, and recently it had been occurring almost every day\u2014sometimes several times a day. He had disturbing dreams and often he would awaken in the mornings to find a sticky mess on his stomach. He never told his mother, but he worried that something was wrong with him. He squirmed a little in embarrassment, just thinking about it. He\u2019d confided to Merrial, a servant who\u2019d been with him since he was a baby, but she hadn\u2019t been much help. She told him she had no idea what the substance might be, or why the flesh between his legs grew so rigid, but not to worry his mother with the problem. She had so much on her mind already.</p><p>Merrial had never had children of her own, and therefore she\u2019d never seen a man naked. The laws of Scythia were so strict and narrow that even pictures of males in any state of undress were strictly forbidden. Punishments for infractions were severe, and few Scythians ever tried to circumvent this law. Really, most women had very little interest in seeing the male form anyway. It was whispered that there were deviants, of course, who seemed to like the men they mated with, but these women were cast out and forced to leave with their mates.</p><p>Their priestesses were quite clear on the subject. The goddess of their religion had forbidden love and affection between the sexes. She had been quite clear on that subject. Anyone who loved a member of the opposite sex was a deviant, plain and simple, and would be cast from their society.</p><p>His mother, the noble Queen Ashlan, had warned him never to reveal his true sex, as it was far too dangerous. It was said on his planet when a woman had a male child, which was roughly half the time, she had delivered a baby that was a non-person. This child would then be immediately turned over to the priestesses, who followed the ancient law and custom of re-assimilation of all non-persons born to Scythian women. According to their ancient beliefs, males had birth defects between their legs and in their brains.</p><p>In Scythia\u2019s ancient past, most male children were simply cast off\u2014except, of course, those kept as breeders\u2014and sent to their biological father\u2019s planet to be raised. Centuries before, however, men who had been cast off while children mounted a bloody rebellion against the Scythian monarchy.It had been a terrible, costly war, even though the rebels had eventually been defeated, and all the leaders executed. After that, it was decided that if these brain-damaged creatures were born to Scythian women, they would be handed over to the priestesses to be re-assimilated back to the goddess. They said the children were then reborn as females. It was supposed to be a quick and merciful process. Scythian males were too volatile, too unpredictable to be allowed to grow up.</p><p>Kai\u2019s sister interrupted his daydreams by giving him an evil look that froze the marrow in his bones. He stopped fidgeting right away and cast his eyes back down, not wishing to get into yet another argument with her.</p><p>When the ceremony was finally over, he followed the crowd back into the banquet room for the wedding feast, wondering how quickly he could make an excuse to go back to his rooms. His mother caught his eye and motioned to him to come near. When he got close to her, she drew him aside, clearly excited about something, and Kai didn\u2019t think it was only his sister\u2019s wedding.</p> <p>\u201cThe matchmaker I hired has found you a match, darling. A husband!\u201d</p><p>Kai felt the blood drain from his face and he staggered back a step. \u201cB-but Mother, I-I can\u2019t! What will he do when he finds out? He\u2019ll send me back, or even get so angry he\u2019ll have me executed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t do that,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen carefully and had a wonderful stroke of luck. I\u2019ve been looking for a chance like this ever since you turned sixteen. Thanks to the gods we finally have the perfect man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut who? Who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful Lycan alpha. From the notorious\u2014I mean, the famous Balenescu family. His people are pressuring him to find a wife so that he might have an heir to his kingdom, and he\u2019s chosen you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? B-But I can\u2019t give him an heir!\u201dKai clutched at his mother\u2019s arm. \u201cMales are so violent. He\u2019ll kill me when he finds out. I know he will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCalm down, sweet one.He won\u2019t do that. First of all, the Balenescus are known for their generosity. Second of all,\u201d she lowered her voice but still managed to sound absolutely delighted, \u201che likes men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does? More than women? But how is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men like other men more than females, darling. It\u2019s just the way of the other worlds, and it\u2019s this alpha\u2019s preference. He\u2019s only taking a female consort to satisfy his people and get an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn heir? I can\u2019t give him an heir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear. By the time he finds out, you\u2019ll be a long way from here, and his pride will prevent him from letting the secret get out. I\u2019m sure of it. Anyway, he won\u2019t be able to harm you when you\u2019re so beautiful. I just know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what if you\u2019re wrong, Mother? What if he\u2019s angry because we tricked him?\u201d</p><p>The queen got a look of unease on her face, but quickly covered it up with a bright smile. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen, darling. After all, you\u2019re of royal blood, and I\u2019ve never seen a male more beautiful. No, I\u2019m sure of it. He won\u2019t be able to resist you. Now go over and find your table, and we won\u2019t discuss this until later. We don\u2019t want to steal your sister\u2019s thunderclaps. The matchmaker said he\u2019ll travel here in half a quarter-cycle\u2019s time to meet you. It\u2019s not much time, but we\u2019ll make it work. Don\u2019t worry about a thing, darling. Leave it all to me.\u201d</p><p>Trembling with reaction to the news, Kai went back to the wedding feast and found his table near the front of the hall. He tried to eat some of the delicious foods that were offered to him, but most tasted like ashes in his mouth. Only half a quarter-cycle\u2019s time until he went to meet what would surely be his doom. How could his mother be sure the powerful alpha wouldn\u2019t kill him when he learned of the deception? His mother said she would take care of everything. Kai shook his head and sighed. That\u2019s what got him into this mess in the first place.</p><p>Lycanus 3, 2257 CE</p><p>Lucas looked around his living room, which was currentlycrowded with five other big Lycan alphas\u2014his brother and his cousins\u2014the closest people to him in the galaxy, people he would give up his life for\u2014and they were pissing him off. They\u2019d arrived at his home over an hour ago, calling their visit an intervention. Bullshit\u2014it was more like a trap, an ambush by the very people he trusted most. Lucas supposed they thought they were doing what was best for him, but he felt as if they\u2019d put his back against the wall, and he was not happy.</p><p>\u201cJust talk to the woman, Lucas. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking you to do. She\u2019s supposed to be really good at this. The best matchmaker in all of Lycanus.\u201d His brother, Blayde, leaned toward him and put a hand on his shoulder. To his credit, Blayde only flinched a little when Lucas showed his teeth and growled at him. Then he grinned at him and slapped him on the back.</p> <p>Konnor spoke up from the other side of him. \u201cReally, Lucas, getting mated is great, and you know how much I resisted it. I couldn\u2019t do without Ethan now.\u201dHis cousin, Konnor had just been happily mated to a beautiful Lycan omega named Ethan. His mate was definitely sexy and desirable, and Lucas was happy for Konnor, happy for all three of his cousins who had recently found their mates. That didn\u2019t mean he was in any hurry to join them.</p><p>For the past three months, his family had been urging him to get a wife. He\u2019d had three challenges to his leadership in the last three months, and though he\u2019d easily defeated each of the challengers, the disruptions to his schedule had been inconvenient to say the least. It had all started when three of his family members had found their own mates within a short period of time. The members of his pack started looking at him and wondering when he might find a mate.</p><p>Then a member of the council, a distant relative and a troublemaker named Boris, had begun running his mouth about the fact that their alpha preferred males.</p><p>\u201cEven when he marries,\u201d Boris said to anyone who would listen, \u201cThe union won\u2019t produce any heirs. Our alpha needs to do the right thing and have children to carry on our ancient Balenesculine. If he refuses, then perhaps he just needs to step down, and let someone else in the family lead us.\u201d</p><p>At first, no one had paid Boris much attention. Other alphas in the past had used surrogate females, after all, and Boris was known to be a meddler. Lucas was popular, and had been an excellent alpha for the pack. But as time wore on, and Boris got even more vocal, people began thinking perhaps it might be a good idea for Lucas to find a wife and settle down. The murmuring had grown louder and now recent challengers had come forth. His family had finally stepped in and come to see him to convince him to see a matchmaker and give the people what they wanted.</p><p>The three mated members of his family were the most vocal. Nikolai, mated to a handsome Jayronian prince, had tried to reason with him, and he started his arguments up again now.</p><p>\u201cLook, Lucas, no one expects you to fall in love. But find a female and breed her. She\u2019ll have the status of being the alpha\u2019s mate, and of course, she\u2019ll have the children, and then you can go on with your life. Find a male concubine for your personal pleasure, like Grandfather did. Maybe you\u2019ll even find your true blood mate. Then you can have your cake and eat it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d Lucas said in a loud, firm voice. \u201cFirst of all, that\u2019s a disgusting idea. I would never hurt some poor woman that way. It\u2019s dishonest and I won\u2019t be a party to it. As for finding a male concubine, that\u2019s pretty much what got our grandfather into so much trouble and started this whole curse we have to live with.\u201d</p> <p>Nikolai\u2019s great-grandfather, Gunnar, had seen a beautiful human woman on a voyage to Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and had taken her by force. The inhabitants of the moons of Jupiter had long been rumored to practice witchcraft, but Gunnar was unafraid and defiant. He wasn\u2019t interested in the woman for himself\u2014his preference was for handsome males, but the female Lycan who was his mate liked other females. He kidnapped the woman to give to his mate as a present. At that stage in their history, both male and female Lycans frequently took pretty humans as companions, or to help them raise their children. Sometimes they took them as concubines. In fact, Gunnar even lay with the woman at the same time he impregnated his mate, so that both produced sons, even though it was forbidden to use humans as breeding stock. But then the wild, handsome Gunnar had always operated outside the law. The human female produced a son, red-haired and handsome, half Lycan and half human. And though she eventually grew to love her Lycan mistress, the human female never made a secret of her hatred forGunnar.</p><p>On Gunnar\u2019s second trip to Europa he kidnapped her handsome twin brother to be his own concubine. Not only was Gunnar intrigued by his beauty, but since his mate was now really more interested in her lovely human, he was free to indulge his own needs. He thought he would make an excellent concubine. When the authorities finally caught up with him, both human siblings had decided to stay with their Lycans.</p><p>The male, whose name was Ivan, was furious with Gunnar, but also fiercely attracted almost against his will. He was a warlock, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to hurt Gunnar. It was said, though, he led Gunnar a merry chase the rest of their lives. He\u2019d even cursed all of Gunnar\u2019s offspring. All of them would be males, he said, and all alphas. It was well known that alphas had great difficulty living together in harmony, so he had, in effect, ensured that all of Gunnar\u2019s offspring would be at each other\u2019s throats. In addition, and maybe because Gunnar left him alone so often to voyage around the galaxies, Ivan cursed them to fall madly, irrevocably in love while still very young, and never be able to be without their mates.</p><p>Lucas jumped to his feet and began pacing like a trapped animal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to meet any damned matchmaker and I\u2019m not getting married\u2014to anybody. And that\u2019s that.\u201dA small, soft voice by the door stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do hope that isn\u2019t your final word, Alpha. I did so wish to help you, but it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll just go back home and tell the bank that they\u2019ll have to go ahead and foreclose on my little home.\u201d</p><p>Lucas whirled around in confusion and found the tiniest and quite possibly the oldest Lycan female he\u2019d ever seen in his life standing just inside his front door. She had a black shawl wrapped around her shoulders and draped over her white hair, though how she could stand it in the ninety-degree heat outside the house was anybody\u2019s guess. She leaned heavily on an ornate black cane as she tottered into the room. Her skin was as dark and wrinkled as the prunes his grandmother\u2019s human concubine used to eat to aid in her digestion. Konnor scrambled to get up off the sofa and give her his seat. She gazed up at him as if he\u2019d just offered her rubies and pearls, and dropped onto the sofa, sitting back with a tired little sigh.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, dear. My poor old legs aren\u2019t what they used to be, I\u2019m afraid. And then, too, there\u2019s my back. The doctor said if I could afford the operation, it might help, but otherwise, I\u2019ll be completely crippled soon.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked down at his feet and shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI...uh...of course, we\u2019ll pay your fee, Mistress uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress Katya. And thank you, dear, but I\u2019m afraid I do have my pride\u2014it\u2019s all that\u2019s left to me now. No, I would gladly take the fee if you had allowed me to help you, but if you won\u2019t...\u201d Her voice broke off tragically with a little sob, and she gave a tremulous sigh. Five pairs of eyes belonging to his family glared at Lucas at the same time. Blayde leaned over again and whispered in his ear. \u201cGods, Lucas. How can you be so cruel? She really needs the money.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas whipped his head around and glared at his brother, fiercely whispering back. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring her here under false pretenses. You bunch did. You can just tell her now that you made a mistake. I won\u2019t be bullied into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear, I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to bully you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced back around at her with surprise. For a woman as ancient and wrinkled as the matchmaker appeared, there certainly wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her hearing. Before he could reply, she pulled a tiny scrap of lace from her bag and started dabbing at her eyes with a gnarled hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sniffled. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to get so upset. It\u2019s just that it was such a long way to come, and then to find out you didn\u2019t need me after all...that you don\u2019t even w-want me.\u201dHer little bosom heaved up and down as she covered her face with the handkerchief.</p> <p>\u201cThere, there, Mistress Katya, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d Nikolai, Lucas\u2019s cousin jumped to his feet and patted her awkwardly on the back. The difference between his huge form and the little woman\u2019s was so remarkable. He looked a bit like an organ grinder with his little monkey. Nikolai looked up at him pleadingly. \u201cJust hear her out, Lucas. It\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked from her to the accusing glares of his family and heaved a sigh. Throwing himself back down in his chair, he admitted defeat. \u201cAll right, I give up. Go ahead, Mistress Katya. Tell me what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>Springing to her feet like a woman half her age, she advanced quickly on him, pulling a small comp-pad out of her voluminous bag. She flipped it open and shoved it in his face. \u201cThe minute your brothers contacted me, I made inquiries on your behalf, and I\u2019ve already found the perfect match for you. This is the female I\u2019ve chosen for you. Isn\u2019t she lovely? A royal, too, dear. She\u2019s from the planet Scythia in the Andromeda system. All the warriors on this planet are female. In order to have children, they usually have relations with male warriors from a neighboring planet called Alger, but there are currently no Algeran princes available. This is a rare opportunity to mate with a Scythian. They\u2019re a very private people, and almost never interact with outsiders, unless they are trying to forge an alliance. When the children are born, they keep only the females, and raise them in agricultural pursuits, or to hunt and be strong warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the boys?\u201d Nikolai asked, peering over Lucas\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe boys are\u2014rejected. Anyway, this beautiful female is named Princess Kai. She\u2019s the second daughter of the Queen Ashlan, ruler of Scythia. Second daughters don\u2019t inherit the throne, of course, so they find husbands for them. As I said, such royal marriages are with powerful kings or leaders, like you, Alpha, who can make astrong ally for her planet. The Balenescu name is legendary, even in Andromeda, so the queen is most anxious to make this match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe is, is she?\u201d Lucas grumbled. \u201cWhat about her daughter? What does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess Kai will be only too happy to be the mate of a powerful alpha such as yourself. She is most willing to do her duty to her family.\u201d</p><p>Lucas gazed down at the picture and felt a tiny flutter of something in his stomach. It must have been something he ate that disagreed with him. No way was he interested in a female, no matter how beautiful she might be. The woman in the picture had long brown hair and beautiful golden brown eyes, fringed with long lashes. Her nose started out straight, but turned up ever so slightly just at the tip, making her look young and vulnerable. Her lips were almost sinfully full and luscious. All in all, she was a beautiful woman\u2014if Lucas had been into women.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mistress Katya. Does she and her mother know I prefer males? I could try to get an heir, but that\u2019s about it. I doubt I could satisfy her. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be able to do anything.\u201d</p><p>Nikolai leaned over his shoulder. \u201cShe looks like a big girl. Maybe she could be in charge. She could use a strap-on,\u201d he said helpfully. \u201cThen you could just close your eyes, lift your legs and think of Lycanus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lucas said, cuffing his ear.</p> <p>Mistress Katya folded the comp-pad and slipped it back in her pocket. \u201cLeave everything to me, Alpha Lucas. I\u2019ve already arranged the meeting\u2014just in case you did say yes,\u201d she said at his outraged look. \u201cThen if both of you are happy, we can arrange the immediate wedding and you can bring the princess back home to Lycanus 3.\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned, not overly thrilled with the prospect of bringing a female to his home. Unlike the rulers of other planets, Lucas lived modestly in a large, well-appointed home, but it wasn\u2019t a castle or even a mansion to be sure. He could ensure she had her own room, maybe even her own servant, but that was about it. He wondered what this unknown girl\u2019s life was like. Was she used to luxury? Did she wear silks and furs? What would she expect of him? He didn\u2019t know much about satisfying a woman.</p><p>Could he make her happy here on Lycanus 3? It was beautiful to him, but he wondered what it might look like to an outsider. Most of the habitable portion of the planet was desert, dotted with huge volcanic rocks. The Lycan settlement was like an oasis in the middle of the vast desert, and the Lycans mostly worked in the mines. One of two sister planets to the home planet of Lycanus, Lycanus 3 was the site of one of the largest bauxite mining operations in the galaxy. Bauxite was used in the making of aluminum, and in the manufacture of space ships and space ports. The mines on Lycanus 3 had become as valuable as the diamond mines on the home planet.</p><p>The Balanescu family had ruled the planet for many centuries. Since so much of the planet was uninhabitable, not that many people actually lived there, though it teemed with visitors. Most of the ones who did live on Lycanus 3, including Lucas, lived in Balenescu City, a thriving little metropolis filled with trading posts, restaurants, bars and of course, hotels, to house the many visitors who came to the planet to trade for bauxite.</p><p>Lucas was wealthy, and could provide this princess with riches, if that was what she wanted. What he couldn\u2019t do was love her, though he hoped they could come to like and respect each other. He would certainly try. He could buy her a male concubine, if that\u2019s what she wanted, to keep her happy and satisfied. He sighed. They would both do their duty. He only hoped it would be enough.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, his voice heavy with reluctance. \u201cSince you\u2019ve arranged the meeting, I\u2019ll go. But just be sure she knows exactly what she\u2019s getting herself into.\u201d</p><p>Scythia, 2257 CE</p><p>Kai paced up and down in his chambers, his palms sweaty and his heart racing out of control. The Lycan contingent had arrived. Merrial had come rushing in to tell him, and his mother had sent word that the delegation would be meeting with her to sign the necessary agreements in the reception room. Merrial had been sent to get him ready to meet the man who would become his new husband. She was rushing around behind him now, throwing silks wraps and robes on the bed, trying to find something suitable for him to wear.</p> <p>\u201cI think this blue silk would be lovely, don\u2019t you dear? Men seem to like blue, or so they tell me, and it would go well with your coloring. Hurry, Kai, stop daydreaming. We need to get you in the bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaydreaming? More like a waking nightmare, Merrial. \u201dHe stopped his pacing and gazed up at the ceiling. \u201cGods, why did I let my mother talk me into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you had no choice in the matter, dear. I know your mother. A wonderful queen, but she is an unstoppable force. She\u2019s taking a terrible risk in doing this, you know.\u201d</p><p>Kai gave her a sharp look. \u201cA risk? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lycans are known to be very important members of the Planetary Alliance. It\u2019s a powerful group that governs the galaxies. Surely your tutors taught you about the Alliance?\u201d</p><p>Kai shrugged. \u201cA little. I know that they made universal laws for all the planets that belong to it. We\u2019re in the Alliance, but very small and out of the way, so they don\u2019t pay us much attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and some of our ancient ways would be...let\u2019s just say frowned upon by the Alliance. If they knew about certain things, they would be most unhappy. They could even arrest your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Arrest the queen? How dare they?\u201d</p><p>Merrial patted his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry your pretty head about it, child. And don\u2019t tell your mother I even mentioned any of this to you. The royal children are always to be sheltered from the outside worlds. Come now, let\u2019s get you ready. Now that Delanon is wed and trying to have a child, it\u2019s even more urgent that you leave Scythia. If she ever discovered your mother\u2019s long-ago deception, she\u2019d be furious. She might take it as some kind of threat to her own succession. \u201d</p><p>Merrial was busily undressing Kai as she spoke and pushing him toward the bathing chamber. \u201cNo, dear, it\u2019s far better to leave this planet and get as far away as possible from Delanon. You\u2019ll just have to keep quiet about our ancient customs, and never, never let the Lycans know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Merrial lowered her voice. \u201cThe male children, Kai. The Alliance must never know what happens on Scythia to the male children. Such things are strictly forbidden by Alliance law. They would punish our planet severely.\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cThey would punish my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, darling.So you see why you must keep our secrets. Whatever the handsome alpha does to you for tricking him will be far better than what the Alliance would do to our planet or what Delanon would do to both you and your mother if she ever finds out.\u201d</p><p>Kai was quiet for a moment, thinking over what she\u2019d told him. He wished he had more education and hadn\u2019t been kept so totally in the dark by his tutors. On Scythia, the royal heiress was given a good education, but the second or third royal children were considered to be little better than bargaining chips. They existed only to forge important alliances with other worlds through marriage. They were kept as ignorant of worldly matters as possible, the council believing their child-like innocence increased their value. \u201cHandsome alpha? Have you\u2014have you seen him then?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kai climbed over into the tub and began to use the sweet scented soap Merrial handed him. He refused to be bathed like a child, but Merrial still insisted on standing by to hand him things and help dry him off. She firmly declared it to be her job, and he didn\u2019t want her to be fired, did he? She stood now holding a towel with a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cIs he handsome? Oh goddess, Kai, I\u2019ve never seen any male better looking. Not that I\u2019ve seen many outside of pictures, of course. He\u2019s so tall, even taller than you, with big muscles. He has dark hair and strange, glowing red eyes, but they\u2019re most compelling. A handsome face too, with high cheekbones and those lips. My old mother used to say to watch out for the ones with the plump bottom lip\u2014they\u2019re supposed to be very passionate. He\u2019s all male, that one. I never had a male, myself, but if I had to have one, he would be the one I\u2019d want.\u201d</p><p>Kai pressed his fist against his stomach where the butterflies were dancing madly. \u201cHe\u2019ll know the minute he sees me, Merrial. He\u2019ll know I\u2019m not a woman. Dear goddess, what if he says something in front of the council?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh stop your worrying. He won\u2019t know. How could he possibly know just by looking at you? All the Scythian women are tall with broad shoulders, after all, and you have a beautiful face. Just don\u2019t say much to him and keep your head down.\u201d</p><p>Since Kai was old enough to understand, they\u2019d been telling him much the same thing. Believing him to be slightly brain damaged, they tried to protect him as much as possible, and always keep him calm and non-aggressive. They taught him to pretend to be a female, to walk and talk and act like one. The women of his planet were warriors and hunters, fierce and muscular, so no one thought it all that strange that Kai was strong and athletic and grew to have a warrior\u2019s physique. Another saving grace was that Kai had long, beautiful eyelashes and full lips, and his hands and feet were small for a Scythian and almost delicate, so it wasn\u2019t difficult to pass him off as a real person. The women showed him when he reached puberty how to dress himself to conceal his birth defect. By wearing high collars and by strapping and arranging his genitals in such a way that there was no tell-tale bulge between his legs, he\u2019d managed to avoid detection. Most fortunate of all was the fact that his father\u2019s people had almost no hair on their bodies and even their beards were sparse. Kai took after his father in this way, and thus saved them all from discovery. When a few hairs came in his upper lip and his chin, they were plucked with alacrity and the secret was safe.</p><p>Kai sighed heavily as he finished rinsing off and stood up to step from the tub. Merrial handed him a towel and then bustled around finding his hair brushes and combs for him to make himself presentable. When he\u2019d finished, she brought him the straps to secure his genitals and a pale blue shift and robe for him to wear, along with matching slippers. When he was dressed, he turned to her and sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the counter. \u201cLip gloss.Eyeliner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Merrial, let him see me as I really am. I can\u2019t be a party to tricking him any more than we already have. I won\u2019t wear cosmetics, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p> <p>Merrial folded her arms and tapped her foot on the floor. \u201cAll right.Send your poor mother to prison. Maybe they won\u2019t execute a woman of her age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerrial,\u201d Kai groaned.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you\u2019re right. Let the dungo fall where it may. Of course the council will know she couldn\u2019t have kept this secret all alone, so your servants and most of hers will no doubt be arrested along with the two of you. You\u2019ll be all right. You\u2019ll simply be re-assimilated back to the goddess, but the rest of us! Our lives will be forfeit as well. But by all means, keep your conscience clear.\u201d</p><p>Since he was seventeen, Kai had his own servants, handpicked by his mother, and all of them were either her former women or closely related to them. Their loyalty was above question.</p><p>Kai glared at Merrial and snatched the lip gloss from the counter, smearing it angrily and haphazardly across his lips. Merrial gave a little cry of displeasure and found a tissue to wipe it back off, and then grasped his chin in her hand while she carefully reapplied the pink gloss. Kai held still, but blew out one impatient breath after another as she applied the eyeliner next. Finally, she had him ready to her satisfaction and patted his cheek fondly. \u201cYou\u2019re such a sweet child, despite your little fits of temper. Your alpha can\u2019t help but love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph!\u201d Kai grunted and strode away from the chamber on his way to the reception hall. Merrial ran along behind him, fretting.</p> <p>\u201cNot such big steps,\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cSlow down, Kai, remember you\u2019re a royal princess. They\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><p>Kai paid her little mind as he strode furiously down the hallway. Brushing past the guards who looked at him with surprise, he flung open the door and stopped dead still in the doorway. Standing beside his mother, head bent a little as he listened carefully to what she had to say, was the most magnificent man Kai had ever beheld. Admittedly, he hadn\u2019t beheld very many, but surely there were no more beautiful creatures to be found in all the galaxies. The man was, at least, a head taller than Kai\u2019s mother. His hair was thick and dark, but cut short on the backs and sides. A few curly strands fell over his broad forehead as he tilted his head down solicitously toward the queen. His shoulders were broad and muscular, and when he looked up as Kai entered, his eyes were the most remarkable shade of burgundy, like the skies in the north at night when the twin suns set.</p><p>The alpha was surrounded by several other large males, surely Lycans as well, almost as imposing as the man standing by his mother, yet Kai only had eyes for this one man. In his heart, Kai knew this must be his Lycan. Furiously, he tried to remember what they told him his name was, and at last he came up with it\u2014Lucas. Lucas Balenescu. What a noble-sounding, regal name.</p><p>Kai felt Merrial poke him with her elbow, and he started forward, remembering to take careful, small steps. He lowered his eyes as he got close to Lucas, because by now the Lycan had turned his gaze on Kai fully, and his close regard was taking Kai\u2019s breath away. He stepped forward, holding out one big hand as Kai got closer to him. Kai reached out to take it and that\u2019s when it happened.</p><p>The second Lucas\u2019s fingertips touched Kai\u2019s, a jolt of pure electricity seemed to jump from his body into Kai\u2019s. Both of them gasped and the alpha literally reeled away from him, falling back into one of his companions. Kai heard him cry out, and would have cried out himself from fear except for the fact that the lightning bolt that struck his fingers had traveled up to his head and then shot back down to the thing between his legs, which unaccountably made his knees so weak he sank to the floor. Merrial\u2019s arms went around his waist to support him, and he glanced up at his mother in horror. The queen rushed over to him and knelt beside him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she murmured to him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about this. If this is what I think it is, there\u2019s nothing to fear\u2014in fact, we can rejoice, because this means you are his true mate, his beloved, and there can never be any other mate for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it was, I felt it too. It was like an electrical charge.\u201d</p><p>His mother laughed delightedly. \u201cThat means the match is very strong. He won\u2019t be able to resist you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut-but I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh...\u201d his mother cautioned him. \u201cSay nothing. Let me handle everything.\u201d</p><p>The queen sprang to her feet, and turned her steely gaze on the Lycans grouped together around their alpha. He had already recovered and was pushing them all away, protesting that he was fine. He pulled away from the one standing closest to him and brushed past Queen Ashlan to where Merrial was helping Kai get to his feet.</p><p>He fixed Kai with a burning glare that swept over him from his head to his feet. \u201cWhat-what in all the worlds are you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>A stunned silence fell over the assembled council members. Queen Ashlan gasped, glancing over at the council as if to gauge their reaction to his softly murmured words. From the moment he\u2019d touched her, he\u2019d known she belonged to him. Against all odds, he had found his true mate\u2014in a female. But how could it be possible? He\u2019d never before been attracted to a female\u2014he found them pretty and even charming, but no female had ever stirred him sexually. His previous sexual partners had all been male, and indeed, even Ivan\u2019s curse had foretold that all the alpha descendants would prefer other men. His own father and his uncles had to use surrogate females for their offspring.</p><p>This beauty before him had almost made him lose all control, and he hated that feeling. It was a weakness that he couldn\u2019t allow in himself. The moment he touched Kai, such strong surges of possessiveness swept over him that he could barely stop himself from wrapping his arms around her. The word mine seared through his brain and he felt his incisors drop from his gums, and his claws tingled in his fingertips.</p><p>When he\u2019d fallen back into Blayde\u2019s arms, he heard Blayde whisper, \u201cOh gods.\u201d Blayde had been the first of the alphas to find his mate, and Lucas knew he well remembered what that looked and felt like. Blayde would have recognized the overpowering instinct to rut with a mate, and his fingers had tightened on Lucas\u2019s biceps. \u201cHold on,\u201d he\u2019d said, leaning down and putting his mouth against Lucas\u2019s ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt her if you approach her like this.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded, shaking his head in an attempt to clear it. \u201cI know,\u201d he growled. Finally forcing his incisors up, he took a deep breath and looked back over at the princess. He saw the beautiful, tempting Kai clutch her chest. He instantly regretted the harshness of his words if they brought such pain to those already sad brown eyes. \u201cI-I mean, I\u2019m sorry, Princess, if I startled you.\u201d He managed a very creditable bow. \u201cYour great beauty distracted me.\u201d</p><p>Kai inclined her head, dropping her eyelids over those incredible eyes, and her mother, the queen, seemed to heave a sigh of relief. Perhaps his strange reaction had made the queen think he was rejecting Kai. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now that he\u2019d seen Kai, touched her, he could never be parted from her, no matter what. He would fight any man or woman in this assembly who tried to take Kai from him. He no longer had any fears about being able to get it up for her, either\u2014he was hard and aching for her even now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The queen rushed over to him and took his arm, drawing him back toward the council table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down, Alpha Lucas, and have refreshment? Kai, darling, come and sit next to your future husband.\u201d</p><p>Kai came forward slowly, as Lucas carefully watched every step she took, clenching his fists to keep from going to her. When she reached them, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from taking her arm possessively. Another jolt ran through him when he touched her, not nearly so strong this time, but strong enough to make him hiss in a breath. He gave a little cough to try hiding it, and pulled her close by his side. Only when he had her close to him like this did his wolf subside a little, calming back down because its mate was close and under his control. They followed the queen back to the long table where the council members were seated, but instead of joining them at the far end of the table, he sat down among his family members, with Kai at his side. Only then did he begin to feel more comfortable.</p><p>For his mate\u2019s part, she was wide-eyed and looked a bit frightened\u2014not surprising, considering she was surrounded by the six huge Lycan alphas. She was tall herself, like all the Scythians, but she lacked the bulk of the Lycans. She was far more delicate, though from what he could see of it through the robes she wore, her body was beautiful. Lucas looked around at his brother and cousins and saw them giving Kai surreptitious looks of admiration and even lust. So they felt it too, though the expressions of wanting on the faces of his unmated cousins caused him to feel even more aggressive. He stretched an arm around the back of Kai\u2019s chair and gave each of them a menacing look. Konnor laughed and shoved an elbow into Kyle\u2019s side. Kyle had the good grace to look guilty and stare down at his plate.</p> <p>Servants brought out food that Lucas was unfamiliar with, but he sampled each of the dishes they held out to him. \u201cI do hope you enjoy the wild gallion, Alpha. Our hunters are quite skilled. Kai herself killed this one in preparation for this feast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so, Kai?\u201d he asked her quietly. \u201cDo you enjoy hunting then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai answered softly. Her voice had an odd pitch\u2014not unpleasing, but husky and soft.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t elaborate, he tried again. \u201cCrossbow? Or do you use other weapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe use bows, your majesty.\u201d</p> <p>Nikolai laughed shortly. \u201cWe don\u2019t use the fancy titles on Lycanus, Princess Kai. Just call him Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Kai flushed and nodded. Lucas found her icy cold hand under the table and squeezed her fingers. She looked up at him in surprise and gave him the first genuine smile he\u2019d seen from her. It was breathtaking. The smile twisted up her bow-shaped lips and lit up her golden brown eyes. The half-hard erection that remained from their first encounter became rigid again.</p><p>Lucas hardly knew what he was eating, but it all tasted delicious, and he wondered if Kai would like the Lycan food as much. Things would be so different for her on Lycanus 3. He spent a great deal of time at the mines, overseeing the operation, and he wondered what she might do to fill her days. Now that he knew she liked hunting, he could arrange an occasional excursion for her to the mountains, not far from Balenescu City. The forests there were teeming with game. He thought he might put up some targets on his property too, so she could practice with her bow. His mind was so filled with possibilities, Larssen had to say his name twice to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cLucas. Did you hear me? The queen said there\u2019ll be dancing after supper. What are you going to do?\u201d It had long been a running joke how badly Lucas danced. A large man, he still managed to move gracefully, except when it came to dancing. On the dance floor, he definitely had two left feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Larssen. I\u2019ll sit here and talk to my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss out on a chance to hold Kai in your arms?\u201d Larssen shook his head. \u201cLucas is getting old\u2014definitely getting old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you who\u2019s old, boy...\u201d Lucas said leaning over in front of Kai to snarl playfully at his cousin. When he did, Kai\u2019s strong scent assailed his nostrils. There was something\u2014not quite right about it. Underneath the oils and perfumes he could detect Kai\u2019s own delicious, clean odor, but it didn\u2019t strike him as female. He leaned back and gazed thoughtfully at Kai again. Her hands were small, even delicate compared to Lucas\u2019s own, but her jawline was firm and strong. Despite the beauty of her lips and eyes, she had an androgynous vibe that disturbed Lucas.</p><p>He wondered fleetingly if that could be the answer to this mystery of why he was so attracted to a female. Some planets he\u2019d been to in his travels had three sexes, male, female and intersex, who were some combination of male and female. He dismissed the idea almost at once, though. He\u2019d never heard of it on Scythia before, and their laws and customs were known to be conservative and very narrow-minded. Certainly word would have gotten back to the Alliance if one of the royal daughters had been intersex. The queen might have even asked for Alliance protection for her child. No, that couldn\u2019t be it, yet there was something different about his mate, and he was determined to find out what it was.</p><p>It would make absolutely no difference in the possessiveness he felt for Kai. He would be leaving here with her, no matter what. But Lucas hated a mystery, and vowed to get to the bottom of this one.</p><p>The queen stood up to announce the musicians and Lucas applauded politely along with everyone else. He was surprised to feel Kai\u2019s soft breath along his cheek. Leaning close to him, she whispered. \u201cI really don\u2019t mind about the dancing. I don\u2019t like it much either. \u201d Her delectable scent wafted over Lucas again, making him feel a little light-headed.</p><p>He turned his head and found those soft, bow-shaped lips just there, only inches away. All he had to do was lean slightly forward and...</p><p>\u201cAlpha Lucas?\u201d Queen Ashlan said. \u201cWould you and Kai lead out the first dance for us, please?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the muffled laughter coming from his end of the table, Lucas arose and held out a hand to Kai. He noticed right away that she was trembling, and he thought she must be shy. \u201cCome Kai, let\u2019s get it over with, and then we can find a quiet nook to talk and get to know one another.\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded and Lucas led her to the floor. The top of her head came just past his chin, and their bodies fit together perfectly. She slid her arms around his neck and he pulled her close to him. Kai\u2019s body felt wonderful against him, both leaner and harder than he would have thought. He knew she was active and athletic, as all the Scythians were, but he had no idea she\u2019d be so muscular, without the soft, feminine curves of most females. She felt perfect to him, yet when he lowered his head to her neck, he was overcome again by her unique scent. There was something else in the scent that he thought he might recognize, a slight smell of arousal that reminded him of something. Hells, it smelled like\u2014pre-cum. That was impossible\u2014or was it?</p> <p>Seized by suspicion, he decided he\u2019d get to the bottom of this mystery one way or the other. He pressed his body to hers, but felt no tell-tale bulging. When she felt him pressing against her, she tried to angle her body away. Was that because of modesty, or some elaborate subterfuge?</p><p>The two of them didn\u2019t do a lot of dancing\u2014mostly they stood in one place and swayed to the music, but it seemed to satisfy the onlookers, and soon other female couples of Scythia joined them on the dance floor.</p><p>As soon as he finished one dance, Lucas led Kai from the floor, whispering to her. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find somewhere quiet to talk.\u201d</p><p>Kai indicated a balcony on the side of the large reception room. \u201cWe could go there, if you like,\u201d she said in her soft, almost whispery voice.</p><p>Lucas took her hand firmly in his and moved through the dancers toward the door. He caught Blayde\u2019s eye. A nod and a silent message passed between them, and Blayde stood up to station himself by the door to make sure they weren\u2019t interrupted.</p><p>Lucas led Kai outside to the balcony railings. They were on a top floor of the castle, so a large courtyard sprawled out almost four stories below them. Above, Scythia\u2019s moon hung in the sky like a golden lantern, not as big as the moon of Lycanus 3, but still exerting its arousing influence on Lucas\u2019s wolf. He could feel its restlessness inside him. Lucas looked down at Kai, and then nervously away. He didn\u2019t quite know how to broach his suspicions with her. He had no wish to insult her, but something was very wrong, and he needed to understand what it was.</p><p>She was shifting nervously from foot to foot beside him, so he turned to her and took her hand in his. \u201cPrincess Kai, I don\u2019t wish to seem insulting, but something is\u2014not right. Please, Princess, tell me what it is. \u201dHe softly repeated his earlier question. \u201cWhat exactly are you, Kai?\u201d</p><p>A sudden intake of breath was the only indication that she\u2019d even heard him. A long moment passed and Lucas began to think she wasn\u2019t going to answer him. Her shoulders slumped and she turned slowly toward him. She looked deep into his eyes and there was an expression of bleak sadness in her own. Speaking in a deeper, much more masculine voice, she heaved a sigh and said, \u201cI think you must already know what I am.\u201d</p><p>Fury swept over Lucas so rapidly and overwhelmingly that his hand shook with it. This was a male in front of him. It was so obvious now that he was amazed\u2014and furious\u2014that he\u2019d been fooled for even a moment. Kai\u2019s eyes were pleading with him, but all Lucas could focus on was the deception. These people had taken the Lycans for fools, and tried to trick them. He was so completely angry, his hands shook, and his wolf leaped forward, uneasy and restless.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d he said, keeping his voice soft, but the look on his face must have been menacing. Kai took what looked like an involuntary step backward. Almost immediately, he seemed to gather himself. His entire fa\u00e7ade changed as if someone had flipped a switch inside him. His body tensed, becoming harder and more aggressive. His golden brown eyes turned dark and hard.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Lucas snarled, taking a step toward him, stalking him. \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean? You and your mother and your council set out to trap me\u2014to trick me and make a fool of me. How could that not harm me? They were going to foist you off as a female\u2014and you...\u201d Lucas paused, his voice trembling with rage, \u201cYou went along with it, pretending to be a woman.\u201d He let his gaze travel up and down him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since Kai was a child, he\u2019d had to maintain a great deal of willpower and self-control to keep up this mask he was made to wear. From the time he was aware enough to realize that he wasn\u2019t female, that he was different from everyone else around him and a non-person, he\u2019d had to struggle to hold onto the tatters of his self-esteem. He had to try not to loathe himself, and that was still something he still struggled with. His entire society thought of men as defective, as less than a female, and over the years, this attitude had taken its toll.</p><p>Feeling neither fully male nor female, he struggled with his identity, and now here was this powerful male, this man who fascinated and attracted him, one who was fairly dripping with testosterone, insulting and accusing him. Partly, at least, it seemed the alpha held him in contempt because of the clothing and makeup he\u2019d been forced to wear.</p><p>The unfairness of it all rushed through him in a torrent of rage. Kai\u2019s usually impressive control over his temper snapped, and he put a hand on the alpha\u2019s chest and pushed him violently away. Lucas staggered back a step or two and looked at Kai with surprise before moving toward him so quickly, Kai never even saw him coming\u2014just a blur of movement and then he was on him. He was just there, with his hand around Kai\u2019s throat, pushing him roughly back against the castle wall and leaning down into Kai\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t exactly hurting him, but exerting enough pressure to keep him still.</p> <p>His other hand moved down between Kai\u2019s legs and he parted his robes roughly, throwing them aside to put his hand at Kai\u2019s groin. Feeling the leather straps there, he cursed in some other language that Kai figured was Lycan, and took his other hand away from Kai\u2019s throat to rip open the pretty blue robe and undershift he wore from the neck down. He looked down his body to the strap that fastened around his waist and cursing again, he unbuckled it and threw it to the floor.</p><p>Released from their prison, Kai\u2019s genitals fell down between his legs and even Kai could smell the arousal. He looked down at the long piece of flesh between his legs and was horrified to see it thicken. A white drop appeared on the head and Kai bit his lip, moaning in embarrassment and shame.</p><p>Lucas glanced down at it and back up to his face. Then deliberately, he wrapped one big hand around it, his thumb softly stroking the mushroom-shaped head, smearing the drop over the top. No one had ever so much as touched him there that he could remember. His genitals had always been an object of shame, and an outward sign of his inferiority. He could only gasp for air like a landed fish as Lucas moved his hand over the silken flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you? Tell me how much you like it, Kai.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice was gruff and hoarse with some strong emotion, but Kai moaned and pushed at his chest again, throwing him off. Lucas growled and for a moment something peeked out of his eyes that frightened Kai. Lucas thrust Kai back against the wall again, shoving him hard and pressing his body back against Kai\u2019s.</p><p>Unprepared, Kai\u2019s head slammed back, almost stunning him for a moment. He quickly recovered and lifted a knee to jab it into Lucas\u2019s groin. The alpha\u2019s reflexes were quick, and though he twisted his body at the last moment, Kai still inflicted a little damage. Lucas gasped and winced, hunching his body over for a few seconds and breathing hard. His hand around Kai\u2019s throat, though, never loosened its grip.</p> <p>Kai drew up his knee again, but this time Lucas was ready for him. He shifted away, and Kai\u2019s knee landed on the side of his hip. Lucas bumped his head into the wall again, and this time, Kai saw stars dancing in front of his eyes.</p><p>He let his legs collapse under him, and Lucas, startled, pulled his hand away from Kai\u2019s throat to catch his biceps and hold him up. Kai straightened and caught Lucas on the chin with a quick left hook. Staggering backward, Lucas shook his head, making a little huffing sound. He lowered his head and plowed into Kai before he could dance out of his reach, shoving him back against the wall. He didn\u2019t really hurt Kai, but his shoulder caught Kai in his solar plexus and knocked the breath from his body. Kai hung from the wall, gasping, and Lucas took him by the shoulders, holding him in place and staring into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d he snarled breathlessly and Kai nodded shortly, struggling to take in a breath of his own.</p><p>Lucas stared down at him another few seconds before he loosened his grip. Kai knew he was only toying with him, and that his strength was much greater, but Kai was fighting for his life. Even though it was probably too late, he couldn\u2019t seem to make himself stop. He kept his head lowered, wanting the alpha to think he was finished and presented no further threat. His stomach and chest were aching, not to mention the pains in his head. He thought he felt blood trickling down the back of his neck from his scalp. Lucas was obviously much stronger than he was, but some sense of pride wouldn\u2019t let Kai quit. The man already had no respect for him, and Kai couldn\u2019t live with that. As soon as Lucas shifted his hands, Kai stomped down on the alpha\u2019s foot as hard as he could. He was wearing soft slippers, so he mostly managed only to hurt his own foot, but it must have surprised Lucas because he shifted backward, allowing Kai to make a break for the door.</p><p>Kai made it about three or four steps before his feet were knocked out from under him and he crashed to the floor of the balcony, on his back and looking up at the stars. He sensed more than saw Lucas\u2019s big booted foot coming toward him and rolled out of the way, catching only a part of it on his hip. He scrambled back to his feet and only barely managed to miss another kick at his ankles. He backed wildly away and felt the balcony railing at his back. Off balance, he tried to catch himself, but still felt his feet go out from under him. As he fell helplessly backward off the rail, a big hand hauled him back upright and set him on his feet. Lucas\u2019s face pushed down into his, and his body plastered itself to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking move, boy, or I\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d Kai huffed out a short, harsh laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve damn near killed me as it is. Go ahead. They\u2019ll finish the job anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lucas narrowed his eyes. \u201cWho? What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d His hand clutched the front of Kai\u2019s robe, and he used the grip to haul him only inches from his lips. He shook Kai slightly. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe council doesn\u2019t know. When they do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Lucas shook him again. \u201cTell me, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll arrest my mother and re-assimilate me.\u201d He glared up at the alpha. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want? Go ahead. Get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Lucas frowned and straightened slowly, pulling Kai with him. He put Kai back on his feet and glared at him for a long moment. \u201cHow could that be possible? What do you mean re-assimilate you? What the hells does that mean? The council surely knows about this trickery. You and your mother almost pulled it off too.\u201d</p><p>Kai stared at him silently. He would say no more, and he\u2019d probably already said too much. He raised his head hopelessly and stared into implacable dark eyes. He had to try to save his mother. He had failed her, and the poor women like Merrial who tried to help him all his life would be imprisoned along with her. He felt an almost crushing guilt. \u201cJust...just please don\u2019t blame my mother. It was all my fault. I did it. She just went along with it for me, but it was my idea. I-I know you don\u2019t owe meanything, after all this, but please. \u201dHe took a deep breath, wincing as his ribs protested the move. \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame anyone but me. I beg you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas continued to stare down at him, with no sign he\u2019d even heard his plea. He took a step back and blew out a long breath. \u201cStraighten yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Kai looked up at him in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, straighten yourself.\u201d He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. \u201cWipe the blood from your face and neck. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>Kai took the handkerchief from him and wiped it over his sweaty face, wiping away blood from his lips and nose that he hadn\u2019t even known was there. He pulled the handkerchief down and saw that most of his makeup had come off with the dirt and blood. He pressed it to the back of his head and winced as a fresh jolt of pain shot through him. Trying to calm his breathing, he pulled at his robe to straighten and close it. It was torn and dirty and all the fastenings were gone, but he did the best he could, holding it closed around himself. His body was still taut with adrenalin and tension coursing through him, but he was thankful that the Lycan had given him a moment to gather himself before he had to face the council.</p><p>When he\u2019d done the best he could, he handed the scrap of cloth back to Lucas, but Lucas looked down at it scornfully, then tossed it over his shoulder to the floor. Gripping Kai\u2019s arm, he hauled him toward the council room. Kai tried one more time. \u201cMy mother...please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lucas snarled and Kai shut his eyes, wincing against the sudden glare of lights from inside the room. Blayde, still stationed by the door of the balcony, goggled at them in shock as they emerged, and a hush fell over the crowd. Both of them were stained and dirty, and looked as if they\u2019d been rolling around on the floor\u2014which they had been, of course, only seconds before.</p><p>Queen Ashlan cried out in alarm when she saw Kai and rushed toward them, but before she could reach them, Lucas held up a hand to stop her. \u201cThere was a slight accident. The. . . princess is fine. Don\u2019t alarm yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kai blinked and looked up at him in surprise, but he was striding across to the council, pulling Kai with him, his grip strong and sure. He stopped in front of the council\u2019s table and Kai gazed at their shocked faces. Before they could say anything, Lucas\u2019s voice rang out firm and loud. \u201cThe wedding between us will take place immediately. I\u2019ve received word that I must get back to my ship right away. Have Kai\u2019s servants prepare her things. We\u2019ll go back to my ship directly after the wedding ceremony.\u201d</p><p>The council members stared at Lucas in shocked surprise, but he could feel his family gathering at his back. Lucas faced the Scythians confidently, fully prepared to fight his way out of this chamber and take his mate if he had to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The members looked to the queen, who stepped forward and held a hand out to Kai. Kai made a move toward her, but Lucas jerked him back by his grip on his elbow. The alpha growled menacingly at his mother, and Kai shook his head at her. Lucas thought he must be concerned for her safety and rightly so. His wolf was angry and restless inside him, urging him to let it free.</p><p>He glanced over at Kai and winced when he saw the blood still trickling down the back of his neck. He hadn\u2019t meant to hurt him enough to draw blood, but when his wolf sensed his mate trying to escape, it exerted its dominance in no uncertain terms, and he\u2019d no longer been fully in control. Lucas lifted his head to the queen.</p><p>\u201cDoes this meet with your approval, Queen Ashlan?\u201d</p> <p>She wrung her hands a little and glanced at Kai again. \u201cMay I speak with Kai first, Alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied shortly. \u201cKai is fine, and will remain that way. There\u2019s nothing more you need to know. \u201dHe knew he was being abrupt and rude, but hardly cared. This woman had tried to make a fool of him, no matter what Kai had said, and Lucas\u2019s fierce, unrelenting pride wouldn\u2019t allow him to unbend. He was angry and frustrated. The bond between him and Kai was so strong already, that it made him physically incapable of leaving Kai behind, as his logical mind very much wanted him to do. He felt betrayed by his own body and that stupid curse, and he felt like raging at all of them. It was taking everything in him to control himself at the moment, especially after what had happened between them on the balcony.</p><p>He had very nearly fucked Kai out there. Once he felt Kai\u2019s warm cock in his hand and smelled his sweat and arousal, he almost gave in to the strong urge to take him there against the wall, and he wasn\u2019t normally that kind of man. Kai would have to agree to mate with him\u2014he wouldn\u2019t force himself on the boy, no matter how angry he was. A strong wave of lust washed over him again, just thinking of mating with Kai, and he had to clench his fists. Kai cried out softly at the increased pressure on his arm, and he forced himself to back off so he wouldn\u2019t crush the bones under his hand.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cAre we to have a ceremony or should I just take Kai and leave?\u201d</p><p>He could hear the sounds of his family bristling behind him, ready to back his play, but the council members seemed to be in shock. Queen Ashlan stepped up to him, braving his wrath, her eyes flashing in her face.</p> <p>\u201cDo you guarantee Kai\u2019s safety? Tell me the truth, Lycan. I\u2019m aware of your strength, and I know you can take Kai with you easily. But promise me Kai will be safe, or there will be bloodshed in this chamber tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lucas narrowed his eyes and almost told her exactly what he thought of her and her son, but managed to bite his tongue. He grudgingly admired her fighting spirit. \u201cI guarantee it. My word of honor as a Balenescu.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once, seemingly satisfied. \u201cVery well.\u201dTurning back to the council she addressed the leader. \u201cMinister Olan, will you do the honors, please?\u201d</p><p>The minister rose shakily to her feet and began mumbling out the ceremony that would tie Lucas to his mate for life. For Lucas it was a mere formality\u2014he couldn\u2019t care less about the proprieties of this little backwater planet, but he knew it would be important to Kai. Even though he was furious at him, he would allow this one thing.</p><p>After his earlier aggression, Kai seemed subdued and shocked. The minister got to the portion of the ceremony where both of them had to agree to be wed. Lucas said yes, quickly and without any hesitation, just wanting this charade to be over. Kai glanced over at him when it was his turn and took a shaky breath before answering in the affirmative.</p><p>As soon as the minister stopped talking, Lucas shoved Kai back into Blayde. Kai stumbled into his arms and Blayde was surprised, but took hold of Kai, much more gently than Lucas had done. He whispered something in his ear. Kai looked up at him gratefully before dropping his gaze to the floor again.</p> <p>Lucas glared at the queen. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind about Kai\u2019s things. If he has anything you want to send him, by all means do so, but I\u2019ll provide everything else. \u201dHe glanced back at Kai, an unforgiving look still creasing his brow. \u201cSay your goodbyes to the princess, Ashlan. I\u2019ll give you only a moment.\u201d</p><p>The queen sighed, looking as if her heart were breaking and again, Lucas felt the strong tug of remorse. He hardened his heart to it though as she hurried toward her child and took his face in her hands. Blayde still held one of his arms, but Kai embraced her with the other arm, and said something softly to her. The boy touched her face, and then Lucas took Kai\u2019s arm away from Blayde and pulled him away.</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave. Kai will contact you after we arrive back at Lycanus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, suddenly looking her age, her shoulders drooping. Lucas turned without another word and the Lycans strode from the room, surrounding Kai, and holding their hands on their weapons.</p><p>The first glimpse Kai got of the Lycan spaceship was alien and frightening. The place they\u2019d brought him to was a large open area, with two seats in the middle of the room behind complicated-looking controls. What looked like comp screens ringed the entire command center, and a large screen showing their orbit around Scythia was suspended from the ceiling in front of the chairs. Kai glanced sadly at the screen picturing his planet, wondering if this was to be his last sight of home. His life there had never been easy, but it was all he\u2019d ever known and every person he\u2019d ever cared for in his whole life was down there below him.</p><p>Kai was filled suddenly with an overwhelming sense of loss. He was leaving Scythia for what promised to be a short and unpleasant future. He had no illusions about whether or not the Lycan would kill him. Despite his promise to his mother, Kai believed Lucas would dispose of him quickly. Lucas believed Kai had tricked him and tried to make a fool of him, and the alpha was not only furious, but proud and unforgiving. He wondered why he hadn\u2019t already been dispatched, along with his mother, but perhaps the alpha thought killing the queen and her child in her own council room might cause an interplanetary incident, difficult for him to explain to the Alliance. Kai figured they would take him off planet and arrange some convenient accident for him.</p><p>At least his hands were free, and Kai knew it was only because the alphas thought he presented little threat to them. They were probably right\u2014against six huge Lycan alphas, he would have little chance. The Lycan standing beside him, the one who had spoken to him kindly in the council room, telling him no one would hurt him, shifted his feet next to him, and Kai\u2019s attention moved to the gun at his side.</p><p>There might be one thing he could do to end this on his own terms, after all. One way he could wrest some control over how and when the moment of his own death might come.</p> <p>\u201cKyle,\u201d Lucas said from one of the large chairs he\u2019d thrown himself in as they arrived. He didn\u2019t so much as glance over at Kai. \u201cTake him down to my quarters and lock him in.\u201d</p><p>Kyle and the others looked from Kai to Lucas as if he\u2019d suddenly taken leave of his senses. \u201cHim?\u201d Blayde asked in confusion, looking from Lucas back to Kai. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? Why are you calling Princess Kai him?\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced at him with a bitter look on his face before rising to his feet and stalking toward Kai menacingly. \u201cOh, I forgot to tell you in all the excitement,\u201d he said, his voice deceptively gentle. The tone didn\u2019t match his eyes, which were blazing with anger. \u201cI never got the chance to explain down there. Meet my new bride, boys.\u201d Without another word, he ripped the robes apart, displaying Kai\u2019s genitals. Kai cried out, throwing his hands over them in shame and embarrassment, but it was far too late. The other Lycans made various exclamations of shock, as Kai jerked the robes from the alpha\u2019s hands and pulled them back together, casting a furious, resentful glare at Lucas.</p><p>Lucas strolled casually back to his chair. \u201cWhat was it all of you told me?\u201d He smirked, and his voice took on a sing-song quality. \u201cGetting mated is great, Lucas\u2014you should try it. She\u2019s the best matchmaker in Lycanus, Lucas, really.\u201d Throwing himself in his chair again, he glared at each of his family in turn. \u201cYeah, this has worked out great so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-but I don\u2019t understand, Lucas,\u201d Blayde sputtered. \u201cHow can this be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it? They tricked us, damn it. Tried to make a fool of me\u2014of all of us. I guess she thought we were all too stupid to realize this...\u201d He gestured toward Kai. \u201c...is a damn boy. I think he must be the queen\u2019s son, though I have no idea why he and his mother tried to palm off a male instead of a female on me. Such a ridiculous subterfuge. Obviously the deception would be discovered sooner rather than later.\u201d He glared back over at Kai. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you enlighten us, boy? Tell us what you and your treacherous, lying bitch of a mother hoped to gain from this?\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s felt his face flame, and without thinking it through, he lunged toward Lucas, not caring if he killed him on the spot or not. No one would speak of his mother like that in his hearing without retribution. His mother had done the best she could for him. She had saved him even though he was a non-person and protected him all his life, and though he hadn\u2019t agreed with this trickery, he knew she had done it in an attempt to save him. He made it only halfway across the space dividing him from Lucas before he was caught around the waist by Blayde and hauled back. He couldn\u2019t break Blayde\u2019s hold, but he twisted his body in Blayde\u2019s arms so that he fell against him and went completely limp. Blayde tightened his hold around Kai\u2019s waist to keep him from falling, and this gave Kai the chance to wrest the gun from the holster on Blayde\u2019s hip. Pulling it up in front of him, he brandished it in Blayde\u2019s face, and Blayde fell back, turning him loose and shouting in alarm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got my gun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Lucas shouted, jumping back up to his feet, his face blanching. \u201cKai, you don\u2019t want to do this. Put it down.\u201d</p><p>Kai held the gun in a steadier hand than he would have imagined. He swept his arm from one Lycan to another, pointing the gun at eachof them in turn. All the Lycans were staring at him in amazement, yet remarkably, none of them seemed frightened, except for Lucas. Actually, he had a look on his face that Kai couldn\u2019t quite identify. Part anger, part regret, part fear, and Kai knew instinctively he wasn\u2019t afraid for himself. He began to ease toward Kai, stopping only when Kai trained the gun on him and yelled, \u201cStop! I\u2019ll shoot! I swear I will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas hesitated, but kept coming forward at an even slower pace, murmuring to him. He was telling him over and over to be calm, but Kai felt perfectly calm for the first time all evening. He would do this and it would finally all be over. This terrible half-existence he\u2019d lived his whole life. All the worry and fear would be wiped out in a split second, and he could find peace.</p><p>\u201cGet back. Get away,\u201d Kai said, and shook the gun at Lucas, snarling at him. Kai backed away a few steps until he came up against a wall. Lucas kept easing slowly toward him, his hands outstretched as if trying to calm a wild animal, while the others watched in tense silence.</p><p>\u201cDrop the weapon, Kai. Surely you know this is futile. You can\u2019t escape. I\u2019m sorry if I scared you, but no one will hurt you here.\u201d Lucas was speaking to him in a soft, conciliatory voice, but Kai didn\u2019t believe it for a second. He only wanted to prevent Kai from shooting any of his family. The thing was, Kai had no intention of hurting anyone\u2014except himself. He would save them the trouble of arranging an \u201caccident\u201d for him by choosing his own method and his own time.</p> <p>\u201cI have no interest in escape,\u201d Kai said softly. Slowly, never taking his gaze away from Lucas\u2019s, he brought the barrel of the gun to his own temple.</p><p>\u201cNo! Kai, please!\u201d Lucas sounded almost anguished. Kai shook his head. He didn\u2019t understand what they wanted from him. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and tensed his finger on the trigger.</p><p>Before he could exert the slightest pressure, something slammed into him from behind, knocking the gun toward the ceiling so that the discharge blasted from the weapon and careened upward before ricocheting wildly around the room. He\u2019d been so focused on Lucas, that he never noticed Blayde circling around behind him. The force of the impact pushed him forward into Lucas and his big body leaped on him, smacking him down on the floor and covering him. Kai hit the floor hard, the breath whooshing out of him. He could hear the shouts of the other Lycans as they took cover, but all he could focus on was trying to drag air back into his lungs with Lucas\u2019s weight on his chest, pinning him down like one of the insect specimens in the royal museum. His wrist tingled up his arm and all the way to his shoulder.</p><p>The crushing weight covering him lifted and Lucas picked him up by the front of his shirt and pulled his face up to his. He gazed down frantically into Kai\u2019s eyes and even shook him so that his head snapped back. He could feel Lucas\u2019s hot breath against his mouth. \u201cAre you hit? Speak to me, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d He shook his head a little, making a sickening pain shoot through him, and he had to close his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cKai? Stay awake. I took you down pretty hard. You might have a concussion. Don\u2019t close your eyes, baby.\u201d</p><p>Kai, whose eyelids had been fluttering, opened his eyes all the way. Baby? He wasn\u2019t a baby. No one had ever called him that before. What could it mean? Was this even his alpha?</p><p>\u201cKai, damn you, don\u2019t you fucking close your eyes!\u201d</p><p>Okay, there he was. Kai opened his eyes and stared up into Lucas\u2019s, blinking rapidly. Lucas let out a long breath, nodded and stood up, hauling Kai to his feet, but wrapping his arm around his waist to hold him up.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone all right?\u201d he asked the others. Kai decided that while he was taking inventory of the damage, he might just close his eyes for a moment and doze a bit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all good, Lucas.\u201d Someone answered, sounding far away. \u201cBetter watch your boy, though. He\u2019s going out again.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas dragged Kai around in front of him and shook him again, but very gently this time. He yelled in his face again. \u201cKai! I said, stop trying to go to sleep, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Kai pulled back his fist and punched Lucas on the chin. Lucas saw it coming and tried to duck, so it more or less bounced weakly off to the side, but it must have stung a little, because his mouth fell open in shock. Kai heard Lucas\u2019s family laughing behind him.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve met your match for sure, Lucas,\u201d one of them called out. \u201cHe\u2019s a spitfire. You better sleep with one eye open tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpitfire, my ass! Let\u2019s see how fiery he is in a cold shower. \u201d He strode off determinedly, dragging Kai behind him by his rapidly bruising wrist.</p><p>Kai tried to dig in his feet, but it was useless. Lucas just tightened his grip and jerked his arm. On the way out of the room, they passed the chair Lucas had been sitting in, and Kai grabbed at it, but Lucas patiently pried his fingers away from the arm and dodged another blow to the head as his hands came off. This time he threw Kai over his shoulder and stalked out of the room, his family\u2019s raucous laughter following them down the corridor.</p><p>Kai tried to raise himself up off Lucas\u2019s shoulder and got a stinging slap on the ass for his trouble. They went into a room that must have been Lucas\u2019s bedroom and then into a small bathroom. Lucas plopped him down on the counter and pointed a finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you move!\u201d He kicked the door shut and turned back to the tiled shower, turning on the cold water. Ignoring him, Kai had already slipped off the counter and was at the door, trying his best to make it out of the room before he turned around, but Lucas moved too fast for him. He put his hands around Kai\u2019s waist and dragged him inexorably toward the tub.</p><p>\u201cNoo,\u201d Kai said, begging now. \u201cPlease.\u201d He was already shivering at the idea of the frigid water splashing down on his flesh and Lucas stopped, staring down at him. Something flickered in his eyes. \u201cAre you going to stay awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai said miserably, his eyes shooting darts of fury at his captor.</p> <p>Lucas regarded him silently for a moment. He drew him into his arms, and Kai looked up in his face in alarm. What now? His hands were moving over his back and his hips. He pulled him even closer to him, tucking Kai\u2019s head under his chin. Taking a ragged breath, he spoke in a rough voice, the words seeming to be torn from him, as if he might have wanted to hold them back.</p><p>\u201cKai, damn it. It\u2019s getting more and more difficult for me not to touch you. I-I want to very much.\u201d</p><p>Kai opened his eyes wider in surprise. \u201cYou do?\u201d Kai\u2019s voice was muffled with his face pressed into the alpha\u2019s chest, but he must have understood Kai, because he answered softly.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you hated me. I thought you wanted me dead.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed to recoil in horror, pulling him away from his chest and glaring into his face. \u201cDead? Whatever gave you that idea? I know I\u2019ve been angry, but I would never harm you.\u201d</p><p>Kai glanced at him resentfully. \u201cYou already did. You hurt my head on that wall, and you-you fought with me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas closed his eyes as if he was in pain and ran a hand over his face. \u201cI know. I was angry, and you gave as good as you got out there on that balcony. I have the bruises to prove it. \u201d Lucas pulled him back and looked down at him, regarding him with a look almost of pride. \u201cStill, I never meant to hurt you. My wolf got carried away and tried to exert his dominance when you tried to run from me. Can you forgive me for hurting you?\u201d</p><p>Kai shrugged, still wary, and Lucas cupped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you deceived me, but we\u2019ll let that go for the moment. You\u2019re my mate, Kai. I knew it from the moment I saw you. Like I said, I\u2019m having a hard time not touching you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are touching me.\u201d Kai raised his eyes to gaze directly into Lucas\u2019s dark red ones. \u201cI-I suppose I belong to you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suppose?\u201d Lucas hissed in a sharp breath, and his eyes flashed. \u201cMake no mistake, Kai, you belong to me, all right.\u201d He leaned toward him and inhaled again, shutting his eyes tightly and making a low, groaning sound in his throat.</p><p>\u201cKai...I won\u2019t force you, no matter how I feel. But do you\u2014do you like men? Is that why you dress as female? Am I reading you right?\u201d</p><p>A wave of uneasiness coursed through Kai. He glanced away and then back up at Lucas. \u201cDo men who dress as women on your planet always like other men, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any that I\u2019ve ever heard of. But on other planets, sometimes\u2014I guess. \u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, not always.\u201d He raised his eyes upward. \u201cHells, I don\u2019t know, Kai. Tell me why you dressed as a female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t,\u201d Kai said, his voice low but firm. He pushed away from Lucas. \u201cI won\u2019t. If I disgust you, then perhaps you can be released from your vows. Your world probably doesn\u2019t recognize my planet\u2019s laws anyway. There\u2019s nothing stopping you from walking away from me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s lips tightened again. \u201cI never said anything about walking away. Is that what you want? For me to release you from your vows?\u201d</p><p>Kai raised his chin. \u201cI am an honorable person, despite what you think of me. I am a royal of Scythia. We honor our vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Just not the ones where you tell potential suitors that you\u2019re actually a male?\u201d</p><p>Kai wrenched himself away from Lucas and stood glaring at him. \u201cThere are reasons you\u2019d never understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me then, Kai. I\u2019ll try to keep up.\u201d</p><p>Kai glared at him, narrowing his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Lucas reached for him again, taking hold of his wrist. Kai responded with a little gasp as Lucas\u2019s big fingers pressed into the bruises there. Holding tightly to him, Lucas yanked back the shower curtain, adjusted the spray to add some warmer water, then picked Kai up in his arms and stepped into the shower with him.</p><p>Kai gasped and sputtered as the spray of warm water hit him squarely in the face. Not even removing his clothes, Lucas pushed Kai back against the back wall. He began to strip the ruined robe from him and in seconds he had him naked, the robes lying in the bottom of the tub, the bright blue color running in rivulets down the drain. Lucas pressed his body against Kai\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI want you so much, damn you. Tell me you don\u2019t want this. \u201d Lucas growled and lowered his lips to Kai\u2019s. One hand clutched the back of his neck while the other slid between their bodies. Lucas\u2019s hand closed around his most private part, the part he never touched except while bathing and never allowed anyone else to touch because it was so sensitive. He hissed in a sharp breath as Lucas\u2019s hand started to move up and down the shaft of the flesh between his legs, stroking him rapidly. The feelings that washed over him made his legs go out from under him. Lucas\u2019s arm went around him to hold him up, and Kai raised his face to his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI-I told you that I will honor my vows. You\u2019re my husband, and you can do whatever you want. I won\u2019t fight you again.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lowered his forehead to Kai\u2019s and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to frighten you. How\u2014how experienced are you?\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens between a married couple. Royal dau\u2014children aren\u2019t given any kind of instruction on this. We\u2019re kept very sheltered, and our husbands are supposed to teach us. \u201d</p> <p>Lucas released his hold on him and stepped back, and Kai was surprised to see him trembling. Kai put his hands on Lucas\u2019s arms and drew him back. \u201cI want you to teach me, Alpha. If you want me...\u201d</p><p>Lucas moved toward him with a low growling sound in his throat. Something leaped in his eyes that perhaps should have frightened Kai, but instead it excited him. He stepped forward so that the flesh standing up now between his legs brushed against Lucas\u2019s stomach. He couldn\u2019t imagine where he\u2019d found the nerve to do it, but it felt so amazing, so incredible that Kai pressed a bit harder, the rough material of the alpha\u2019s trousers making Kai shiver as little jolts seemed to pass through him.</p><p>With a growl, Lucas pulled him closer, putting his lips gently against Kai\u2019s, then licking at the seams of his mouth until it parted. Lucas eased his tongue inside, gently exploring. Kai clutched at Lucas\u2019s shoulders in complete dismay. No one had ever kissed him on the lips before that he could remember. Scythians didn\u2019t kiss each other on the mouth, though he\u2019d gotten his share of kisses on the cheek, along with hugs and cuddling as a small child. No one had shown him affection like this for years. Why was Lucas putting his tongue in his mouth? Was this some Lycan custom? And what on Scythia was he doing with his hand?</p><p>His breath coming quicker, Kai pushed at his shoulders, frightened a little, but didn\u2019t budge the Lycan an inch. Dragging his eyes open, Kai met Lucas\u2019s dark gaze, sparkling with some emotion he couldn\u2019t name. His hand moved faster and Kai would have screamed at the sensation if his mouth hadn\u2019t been otherwise occupied as Lucas lowered his head for another kiss.</p><p>Groaning, he felt like he was burning up, even with the water splashing down on him. The big Lycan finally pulled his lips away, but Kai still couldn\u2019t breathe. Not with what was going on between his legs. The strangest feeling was coming over him. He wanted something, but he didn\u2019t know what it was. He strained to get closer to Lucas, and his hips started thrusting forward instinctively. Hearing himself whimper, he arched his back and looked up into Lucas\u2019s eyes again, silently begging him to help, but he didn\u2019t know what he wanted help for. Something was building in him, and he was afraid he was about to fly apart.</p> <p>Lucas smiled wolfishly at him. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, gripping him harder.</p><p>Kai thought he must be dying. His body seized and he strained forward, making little grunting sounds. His toes tried to clench and curl. The same white, sticky substance he\u2019d found in his bed started spurting from the end of the rod of flesh between his legs and he looked down at himself in wonder. A drop or two even hit him under the chin. Oh dear gods, what was happening to him? He fell against Lucas\u2019s chest, totally spent and drained. Lucas held him up and rubbed his back, not saying anything, just seeming to be trying to soothe him.</p><p>This was the second time Lucas had grabbed his genitals like this. Was this sex, then? Is this what two men did together? If so, he was totally on board with it. He rubbed himself against Lucas\u2019s stomach, the friction almost painful now, but still feeling wonderful.</p><p>Lucas whispered in his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll let you rest for a minute and I\u2019ll get out of these wet clothes. I\u2019m not through with you yet, though, Kai. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai said, happy for the moment just to hang here in Lucas\u2019s arms and rub against him. Lucas chuckled softly and shifted around so that the water was splashing down on Kai\u2019s head. Kai buried his face against Lucas\u2019s shoulder, and Lucas allowed it while he carefully soaped his hands and ran them over the back of Kai\u2019s head and neck, tenderly washing away the dried blood.</p><p>When he was finished, he sat Kai down on the side of the tub and stepped out. He peeled off his wet clothing and threw it into the tub. Then he reached for a towel to dry his body. All Kai could do was gaze at him. He\u2019d never seen anything like him before.</p> <p>His alpha was big, with broad muscles in his chest and thighs. His skin was tanned and smooth, but all these things paled in comparison with what was hanging between his legs. He had the same genitals as Kai, only larger. His big piece of flesh was long, and wider than Kai\u2019s. It was sticking up at a slight angle and looked impossibly hard. He had thick, curly dark hair covering it at the base. The rounded flesh below the hair was big too, hanging heavily down between his legs. Just looking at him made Kai\u2019s stomach ache and clench, but he wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>When he finished drying, he reached down for Kai and wrapped a big towel around him. Rubbing him briskly, he went over and over the same spots on Kai, gazing into his eyes. Then he bent down and picked him up again to carry him to the bedroom. Kai was a big boy and not used to being carried around like this. Maybe this was part of the Lycan\u2019s mating ritual. He threw an arm around Lucas\u2019s shoulder and hung on, his eyes wide and confused.</p><p>Lucas carried him to the bed, dropped him down on it and climbed in after him. Kneeling over him, his eyes hungry and savage, he almost growled at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you now, Kai. Tell me you know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Frightened, but trying not to show it, Kai shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIs it different from what we just did? Will you hurt me?\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Lucas fell down beside him, the flesh between his legs an angry red and sticking up from his body. \u201cCan you really be as innocent as you\u2019re pretending? Tell me you\u2019re really not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not be sure?\u201d Lucas was almost yelling at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d Kai snapped back, raising his own voice.</p> <p>Lucas propped himself up on one elbow and narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I don\u2019t know. I never heard that word before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you call someone who hasn\u2019t ever had sex before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kai said irritably. \u201cI don\u2019t call them anything because I\u2019m not supposed to discuss things like that. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably a word for it, but it never came up in conversations with my mother and my servants.\u201d</p><p>Lucas blew out an exasperated breath. \u201cSurely you have friends. You read, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about sex. I wasn\u2019t allowed to, and royal children never play with other children. You don\u2019t seem to realize how isolated I\u2019ve been all my life. Everything I was allowed to read was carefully screened before it was given to me. As I told you, a royal is not supposed to know anything about such things before marriage, and that\u2019s how I was brought up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother said you hunted. You must have seen animals mating or had friends who talked about it as you got older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I did hunt with the royal guard, but I never saw animals doing\u2014that. Scythians don\u2019t keep animals as pets. My tutors told me that\u2019s done sometimes on other planets. I overheard some conversations occasionally, of course. But they were all females. They never discussed anything about males. Not ever. Scythian women don\u2019t like males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but surely...\u201d Lucas broke off in irritation. \u201cWhat about when you masturbated?\u201dAt his blank look, Lucas blew out another long-suffering breath. \u201cWhen you touched yourself\u2014down there? You know, to make yourself come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for the gods\u2019 sake! Do what you just did in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did that before,\u201d Kai said shyly. \u201cNot like that. I had dreams sometimes. Sometimes I\u2019d rub myself against the sheets, and it would feel good. But my servants always bathed me. I didn\u2019t take showers by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-But...you...that can\u2019t be...oh, fucking gods!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so angry? I can\u2019t help it\u2014I live on a planet with all women. Don\u2019t you get it? I don\u2019t know anything about men. No one ever taught me anything like this.\u201d Kai could feel his cheeks heat up and he squirmed uncomfortably. \u201cI know you think I\u2019m stupid and a liar. But I\u2019m not lying about this. I don\u2019t know anything about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there aren\u2019t any men on your planet, why did your mother keep you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved me, I guess,\u201d Kai said sharply. \u201cShe had fallen in love with my father, even though that was highly irregular. Almost unheard of, really.When he died she was already pregnant with me. When I was born, she decided to keep me. But she had to pretend I was female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201dLucas stared down at him incredulously. \u201cSo no one knew your true sex except your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the servants loyal to her, of course. No one else, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe raised you as a girl?\u201d</p><p>Kai flushed. \u201cShe raised me as a person. Don\u2019t you see? Males are non-persons and defective.\u201d He had dropped his gaze telling this part, but he chanced a peek back up at his mate. He could tell from Lucas\u2019s outraged expression that he thought pretending to be a person was wrong and something Kai should be ashamed of. Unable to meet his gaze, Kai kept his head firmly down.</p><p>\u201cBut why did you go along with it? I mean, once you got older. Didn\u2019t you...?\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Kai felt his face flaming. He was ashamed, but not of pretending to be a female. \u201cMales are...I\u2019m sorry, but males are deformed, in a way. That\u2019s why we have this extra flesh between our legs, Merrial said. She\u2019s my servant and told me all about it. Naturally, I tried to hide it. I wanted to be a member of the superior sex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucas\u2019s eyebrows rose and he glared down at Kai. \u201cWhy in the hells did they fill your head with that drivel? You listened to a servant? Males are not defective.\u201d Lucas\u2019s tone was outraged and Kai shrank away from him a little.</p><p>Kai shrugged. \u201cNaturally, you would say so...\u201d</p><p>Lucas passed a big hand over his face. \u201cSo you mean to tell me...\u201d his voice was deliberately calm. He took a deep breath. \u201cYou mean to tell me you pretended to be a female because you didn\u2019t want to be thought of as defective?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, partly.There were other reasons, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you won\u2019t share with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t share them with you, no. But we had our reasons. Can\u2019t you just let it go at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lucas shouted. He scooted up in bed and put his back against the headboard. \u201cA Lycan mate tells their alpha everything. There should be no secrets between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m a disappointment to you.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas shook his head glared at him again. \u201cSo you had no idea what I was doing to your cock in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what? You mean this-this flesh between my legs?\u201d</p><p>Lucas just looked at him and then tilted his head. His eyes got even narrower. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me. You have to be.\u201d</p><p>Kai looked down at himself. \u201cI-I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything.\u201d</p><p>Lucas took his flesh in his warm hand. Almost immediately, that weak feeling came over him again and he shuddered with excitement. \u201cThis...is your cock,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYour penis. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m not stupid, just ignorant of your name for it.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas didn\u2019t answer\u2014just glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kai said a bit sharply. \u201cI don\u2019t know any of this. No one ever told me.\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised his eyes toward the ceiling and seemed to be counting. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk me things you don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Kai said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start...\u201d Lucas said, rolling back toward him. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with how a man makes love to another man.\u201d He moved his big hand to Kai\u2019s stomach. \u201cNow pay attention and we\u2019ll go slowly.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cFirst, Kai, you have to realize exactly what it is we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ve gone through your wedding ceremony on your planet, and I\u2019ve agreed to be your husband. You say you want to honor your vows. Understand that this is an irrevocable step. Once we\u2019re mated, I won\u2019t be able to release you\u2014not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to do this? Do you fully understand what it means? I\u2019ll claiming you as my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but-but I thought you despised me. You said we tricked you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas regarded him silently for a few seconds. \u201cDespise is too strong a word. I\u2019m angry, yes. I don\u2019t like being made a fool of, Kai. And I hate deceit of any kind. I still don\u2019t think I know the whole truth, and so far, neither you nor your mother has been willing to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Kai shifted his gaze. He would never expose his mother\u2019s secrets to this Lycan if he could help it. Merrial had told him Lycans were powerful leaders in the Planetary Alliance. She said they\u2019d be furious and outraged if they knew the truth about the boy babies on Scythia. His mother might be arrested and killed, even though she was only following the ancient ways of their people, established long before the Alliance came into being. He had to protect her, if he could.</p><p>Lucas was still looking at him. \u201cDo you want to tell me now why your mother didn\u2019t just admit who you were? You may have been ignorant of what a man was, but she surely couldn\u2019t have been with two children. Why didn\u2019t she send you to live with your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father died, as I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis people then.Damn it, didn\u2019t she realize she could have damaged your mind, making you think that men are all defective? Making you act like a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m damaged?\u201d</p><p>Lucas let out a long breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Kai,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>The words made Kai\u2019s stomach clench, but he nodded sadly. \u201cI will release you from any vow you made to me. I\u2019ve already told you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be released. I only want the truth.\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked disappointed and disgusted, and it hurt Kai\u2019s heart to have to keep telling him no. Lucas turned his head away, and Kai reached out to touch him gently on his cheek. He turned his head in surprise and stared down at him for a long time before his eyes finally softened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damned beautiful. So desirable,\u201d he said, almost as if he were talking to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can resist you\u2014I don\u2019t think I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kai said softly. \u201cI-I want you to be my husband. In every way.\u201d</p><p>Lucas groaned and pulled Kai into his arms. Lucas kissed him for a long time before gazing down at him and giving him a little bite on his bottom lip, then licked it. Kai was beginning to associate this strange combination of pain and pleasure with his mate. It was very disconcerting. \u201cAre you sure you understand what\u2019s going to happen, baby? You\u2019ll be a Lycan mate. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kai said with a little shake of his head. \u201cBut if it means I can stay with you, then I want it.\u201d And Kai was almost surprised to find that it was true. This huge, frightening man was oddly fierce yet gentle. He\u2019s already made him feel things that excited him more than anything he\u2019d ever felt before. Even though he\u2019d been taught to find women\u2019s bodies more visually appealing, this gorgeous creature\u2019s body excited him.</p><p>\u201cTeach me. Please, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>Lucas moaned and buried his face in Kai\u2019s throat. \u201cGods, you smell so sweet.\u201d</p><p>Getting to his knees, he looked down on Kai. \u201cThis will hurt, Kai. This first time at least. I\u2019ll try to make it as good as I can for you, but you\u2019ll be so tight. I don\u2019t want to hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be my husband. In every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBalenescu mates need to be with their husbands all the time. They can\u2019t ever be intimate with another man once they mate with their husbands\u2014it would be physically impossible for them to get satisfaction. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head, and Lucas sighed. \u201cThis is so difficult to explain when you know so little about things.\u201d He tried again. \u201cYour cock\u2014this piece of flesh between your legs\u2014will never get hard for anyone but me, ever again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded and smiled. \u201cBut that\u2019s as it should be, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes softened again, and he seemed to shiver. \u201cSweetheart. Yes, that\u2019s as it should be.\u201d Slowly, he rolled Kai over to his stomach, lifting his hips to pull pillows under them. Kai watched his every move from over his shoulder. He took some oil from the table next to the bed and splashed some on his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m going to put this on you, baby. It will help when I enter you.\u201d</p><p>He put one oiled finger at Kai\u2019s hole and Kai tensed immediately. Gasping, he looked up into Lucas\u2019s face. \u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His hard fingers began to massage oil gently into his crease and ghosted over his hole as Kai shivered. \u201cThis is where I\u2019ll make love to you. You have to open to me, love. I\u2019ll try not to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Very gently, he eased one finger inside this most intimate place in Kai\u2019s body. Kai hissed in a breath and tried to squirm away, but Lucas held him firmly in place. \u201cEasy, Kai.Try to relax. I\u2019m showing you what men do together.\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded and tried hard to relax his body, opening his legs even further, but he was beyond amazed by this turn of events. Lucas stroked his back and with an oiled finger gently probed inside Kai\u2019s hole. No one had ever touched him there, and it felt strange and burned a little. The finger slowly pressed further inside and when Kai tensed against the burn, Lucas leaned over him and kissed his ear, licking at the nape of his neck until he relaxed again. He whispered in his ear as he slowly moved the finger in and out. \u201cHave you ever touched yourself here, love?\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head, and Lucas gave a soft chuckle as he kissed his ear. \u201cGood. This is mine, and you\u2019ll never feel anyone else\u2019s touch here again.\u201d Those whispers in his ear were driving him crazy and he arched his back. He couldn\u2019t decide whether to lean into the fingers or pull away. He felt another finger go inside him and he groaned at the stretch of those fingers within. They only moved in deeper and Kai cried out, trying to get away from Lucas\u2019s strong hand on his hip until the fingers suddenly brushed against something inside him. It was a spot so sensitive he couldn\u2019t decide at first if it hurt or if it felt incredibly wonderful. The fingers brushed over the spot again and again until Kai was whimpering for more, thrashing his head wantonly and pushing his ass up into the air to get it.</p><p>Suddenly the fingers pulled away and Kai almost sobbed in frustration and need. Was it over so soon? Then he felt something else nudging his hole, something larger, and he felt a moment of panic. Before he could move away, Lucas\u2019s hand pushed under him and closed around his flesh, pulling down and back up hard several times in a row. He couldn\u2019t decide whether to arch forward or back\u2014he needed more pressure, more sensation. He whimpered in confusion and Lucas whispered to him.</p><p>\u201cShh, baby. Try to relax. Push out when you feel me. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>The fingers pushed in at his hole again, and the pain was back. Lucas took his time, pushing in slowly, a tiny bit at a time and then pulling out just a little until all of Kai\u2019s focus was on this one incredible thing that was happening to his body. \u201cRelax for me. Don\u2019 forget to push out a little,\u201d Lucas instructed and when he did, it began to feel a little better. He still felt tight and full, and it still burned, but the burn was getting less and the pleasure was overriding it. Lucas\u2019s other hand continued to work the flesh between his legs until he thought he\u2019d lose his mind. He couldn\u2019t decide if he should beg him to stop or beg him to do it harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you the mating bite, Kai. It will hurt for just a moment, but I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai whimpered softly and Lucas bit deeply into the side of his neck. His teeth were like needles boring into him, and Kai tightened his mouth against the scream that threatened to burst out of him. A burning pain surged into his neck and spread throughout his body. Right away he felt something different at his entrance. The hard rod of flesh seemed even bigger, harder, and it surged inside him and filled him uncomfortably full.</p><p>Lucas withdrew until just the fat head of the thing he called his cock was stretching Kai wide, and he just as slowly pushed back in. Kai could feel every inch of Lucas\u2019s beautiful cock as it slowly filled him and drew back again. Every time he brushed over the tender place inside him Kai felt a bolt of ecstasy rush through him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing perfectly, baby. Are you all right? Does it hurt too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I love it. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Lucas kissed him on the side of his face and then trailed kisses down his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll give you everything you need, Kai. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Almost as soon as he said the words, Lucas began to thrust harder, faster, really hammering at him. Cries of surprised pleasure flew from Kai\u2019s lips and his fingers clutched at the sheet beneath him. The pleasure was almost too much and he wondered fleetingly if it might kill him, simply stop his heart with its intensity. Even if it did, he didn\u2019t want this ever to stop.</p><p>Lucas gave a loud cry as he strained against him. The next instant, feelings like he\u2019d never had before, even in the shower with Lucas, surged through Kai, filling him with intense pleasure. The wetness spurted from his flesh uncontrollably, while at the same time, he felt something hot and liquid inside him, filling him and running down the backs of his legs. Instead of dissipating, the feelings only got stronger and he was completely overcome with joy like he\u2019d never known. In some other part of his brain, he knew that Lucas was licking his neck where he bit him, bathing the bite in saliva, and it felt\u2014incredible. He tried to get closer to Lucas, pushing back into him. He realized suddenly that his breath was coming in short gasps, and he couldn\u2019t seem to get enough air inside his lungs. His heart was pounding wildly.</p> <p>Trying to let Lucas know he must be dying, he reached back and found his fingers. Lucas squeezed them tightly in his and leaned down to whisper again in his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s the venom, Kai. You\u2019ll be fine. I won\u2019t let anything hurt you. Sleep now, sweetheart. Try to rest. \u201d</p><p>Kai sagged beneath him, totally spent. His husband said he wouldn\u2019t let anything hurt him. Kai wondered as he drifted into sleep if he could keep that promise. Especially since, it was Lucas, himself, who was most dangerous to his well-being.</p><p>Lucas was drinking Lycan tea in the lounge area when Blayde came in to get himself a cup. He and Larssen were piloting the ship, yet Blayde still sat down beside him.</p><p>Lucas glanced up at him. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be helping Larssen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine for the moment. I wanted to find out if you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with this boy, Lucas? Why did they tell everyone he was a female?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cI still don\u2019t know for sure. Crazy-ass laws on Scythia. Boy children are rejected, didn\u2019t the matchmaker say? I certainly didn\u2019t see any men the entire time we were there. Kai claims his mother wanted to keep him even though he was a male child, so she pretended he was a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Well, on a planet where the women are so big and muscular, I can see that it could work. But she had to know it would come out eventually. How did he feel about it?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shrugged. \u201cHe won\u2019t tell me much. I think he\u2019s trying to cover up his mother\u2019s lies. She must have wanted him gone too, and that\u2019s why she pulled this shit to get him off the planet once he got older. The matchmaker must have told her I preferred males anyway. Kai\u2019s not talking, but he seems almost too innocent. No one at his age could possibly be as naive as he pretends. I think he\u2019s still lying to me and trying to gain my sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you mated him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t have much choice in the matter. My wolf would have taken over if I hadn\u2019t. \u201d Lucas looked at Blayde sardonically. \u201cYou must remember how that is. You were ready to mate with Ryan even believing him to be a murderer.\u201d</p><p>Blayde nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Nothing could have stopped me. At the time, I thought maybe I could train him to be a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m thinking the same thing. If I can, I\u2019ll train the deceit right out of him\u2014teach him to act like a man and always tell me the truth. I may have to keep that bottom of his reddened and well-spanked for a while to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Blayde laughed. \u201cLucky you.He\u2019s got a nasty temper, though. I don\u2019t envy you.\u201d Blayde got up and stretched. \u201cThen again, maybe I do,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019d better get back to the comm deck. Larssen will already be cussing me. Why don\u2019t you curl up next to your new mate and get some rest? You look exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cMaybe I will. I\u2019ve been sitting here thinking about what I\u2019ll tell them when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth, of course, but as little as possible.I won\u2019t tell them about the deceit. They\u2019d blame Kai, and hate him for it, and I won\u2019t do that to him. No, I\u2019ll take the blame. My mate is a male, and they\u2019ll have to accept it. If they want an heir, I\u2019ll have to use surrogates, like our father did. If Boris and his friends don\u2019t like it, they can leave and go back to the home planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking,\u201d Blayde said with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve said all along. Perhaps we should strongly suggest that anyway, as soon as we get back. His disloyalty doesn\u2019t set well with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor me. Yes, it may indeed be time to tell Boris and his friends to relocate. I don\u2019t want them upsetting Kai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very protective of him, despite the fact you think he\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lying exactly. From how tight he was, and how surprised and ignorant of lovemaking, I know he was telling the truth about some of it. He\u2019s incredibly innocent. My wolf is happy about that, of course. But he\u2019s keeping something more from me, and I need to find out what it is. I hate lies.\u201d</p><p>Blayde left with a little wave, and Lucas finished his tea and went back to his quarters. Kai had moved over to the center of the small bed and was stretched out over it. He was lying on his back, and his face looked young and vulnerable in sleep. Overcome by his strong scent in the small room, Lucas quickly took off his clothing and lay down next to him, scooting him over and spooning him. His body was warm, and Lucas knew the venom was at work, changing his boy into a Lycan mate. From this point on, they would need to be together or at least in close proximity at all times. Even now, Lucas could sense the restlessness of his mated cousins as they hurried to get back home to their mates.</p><p>If Lucas was upset or angry with Kai, his mate would feel that anger as a physical pain in the gut and feel the need to be submissive until the pain stopped. He would never be able to feel passion for another man, though Lucas would be unaffected. Not that Lucas would ever want anyone else\u2014he belonged to Kai as surely as Kai belonged to him.</p><p>Kai pulled back the string on his bow and let fly at the target, hitting it squarely in the middle. Lucas had set up the targets for him soon after they arrived on Lycanus 3, and Kai spent time practicing every day. Not because he was really interested, but because he wanted to please Lucas, who liked him to do things he considered manly, like sports and hunting and watching action flicks on the vid machine.</p><p>From the moment they\u2019d arrived, he hadn\u2019t seen much of Lucas, who had been busy with things Kai didn\u2019t fully understand. He knew he was close by, and he saw Lucas every night, but there was apparently some kind of problem with council members that he needed to take care of, and he\u2019d worked late almost every night since they\u2019d arrived. When he was at home, there was a distance between them that Kai strongly felt, but he didn\u2019t know what to do about it. He knew it was mostly because of the trickery and deception that lay between them like a poisonous cesspool, slowly seeping into every facet of their life together, no matter how hard either of them tried to get away from it or pretend otherwise.</p><p>Kai couldn\u2019t explain properly about the lies to the matchmaker and he couldn\u2019t tell his mother\u2019s secrets and risk the Alliance taking action against her. Yet since he\u2019d come to this planet, and seen the male children walking around openly, no one acting as if there were anything wrong or shameful about them, he\u2019d begun to feel terribly confused and uneasy.</p><p>What if everything he\u2019d been taught all his life had been one big monstrous lie? What if male children weren\u2019t truly defective and the priestesses had lied to the Scythian women? The women of Scythia turned the boy babies over to the priestesses to be mercifully re-assimilated back into the goddess, but what if they could have kept their children? What if the goddess was wrong about males? But that couldn\u2019t be. That would make everything he\u2019d ever known a falsehood, and the priestesses nothing more than monsters. It would make the goddess herself\u2014what?</p><p>Kai shook his head, scared by the thought and refusing to contemplate such blasphemy. All his life, he\u2019d been afraid of the goddess\u2019s wrath. As a child, he\u2019d expected any time to be snatched up by the goddess and re-assimilated. These blasphemous thoughts could get him cast into the hells where he would burn forever. He could only hope that the goddess had lost track of him so far away from Scythia. He stood still in the backyard of the alpha\u2019s home, his new home, and looked around him uneasily.</p><p>This planet was very different from Scythia. Instead of the verdant forests of his home world, the landscape seemed to be mostly desert, though Lucas had told him it wasn\u2019t all so barren. They had first landed in the middle of the night, and Lucas whisked him away to the city as soon as they arrived. The moon had been huge, easily twice as big as the moon on his planet and clearly lit up everything around them. Kai had found the landscape to be strange and beautiful. In the hills beyond the city, Lucas said there were lush forests and streams. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They needed to be close to the bauxite though, so they made their homes in the desert. Lucas\u2019s home was nowhere near as luxurious as the palace Kai had grown up in, but it was large and comfortable, and Kai loved the freedom from servants always hovering over him. Here he was allowed to bathe himself\u2014well, most of the time, that is, when Lucas let him shower alone. He could dress himself too, though Lucas usually undressed him every night. Still, Kai had no complaints. He found that he enjoyed Lucas\u2019s attentions very much. He loved the fact that his husband made love to him every night, and in ways he could never have imagined. His husband had taught him a lot about the ways men made love since he\u2019d come. Kai had grown to crave Lucas\u2019s presence, and the hours during the day when Lucas was at the mines were increasingly difficult for him.</p><p>After that first violent fight on the balcony the night they met, Lucas had never lifted a hand to him in anger. He always treated him with consideration and even affection. All in all, Kai\u2019s life had been busy since he arrived on Lycanus 3, and he was content, but he knew Lucas was holding back some of his affection and it bothered Kai. What if he decided to put him aside? Kai had heard of things like that.</p><p>His aunt Robesia, his mother\u2019s sister and a second daughter, had married a prince from Alger, their closest neighboring planet, and after only six months of marriage, he\u2019d put her aside and sent her back home in disgrace. Kai had never been told what happened between them, but she lived in the palace after that, a stooped, lonely figure that kept mostly to her rooms. Kai shuddered. What would he do if Lucas sent him back home?</p> <p>Sighing, Kai strode over to the target to retrieve his arrows, his movements still a little awkward in the stiff leather trousers Lucas insisted he wear outside. Inside, he allowed him to wear his soft leggings, but he said they were way too tight to be decent for anyone but him to see. He sighed and rubbed absently at his stomach. Ever since he\u2019d awakened after they had made love on the ship, he\u2019d felt this nearly constant cramping in his stomach. Most of the time it was only a dull ache, but lately, the pains had grown worse. Just the other night, as they got ready for bed, Lucas saw him wince and clutch at his stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Kai said, slipping under the covers and curling up around the cramps. \u201cMaybe something I ate.\u201d</p><p>Lucas came to stand beside him, and then sank down to gather him up in his arms and pat him on the back. Surprised, Kai looked up at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something you ate. Remember how I told you there\u2019d be physical changes from the mating? This is one of them, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese cramps in my stomach? What causes them?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m sorry, Kai. Whenever I\u2019m upset with you or have any negative feelings toward you, this will happen. \u201d He snuggled him closer and kissed the side of his neck and Kai was amazed to find the dull achiness in his stomach that had been plaguing him all day begin to fade away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset with me? What did I do? You mean you\u2019re doing this to me? But why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it consciously, baby. I\u2019m sorry. \u201dHe bent to kiss his lips tenderly again. \u201cIs that better? Still as much pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s easing now, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe venom in our mating bite causes a psychic connection and causes you to feel physical discomfort if I\u2019m upset with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what have I done?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cNothing.It\u2019s just the lies you and your mother told me to bring me to Scythia. I was just thinking about them. I still feel torn about it and I sense you\u2019re hiding something from me. I don\u2019t like it, yet you still refuse to tell me everything. I\u2019ll try harder to get my mind off it.\u201d He gazed down at Kai. \u201cUnless you feel like unburdening yourself now? You know you can tell me anything, don\u2019t you? I promise I\u2019ll try to understand.\u201d</p><p>Kai pulled away, miserable at being put in this position again. It always came back to this. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t understand. You couldn\u2019t. If I told you, you\u2019d take action and I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d He buried his head in his hands. \u201cOh goddess, what if I\u2019m wrong about this? Then you\u2019ll hate me like you\u2019ll hate my mother and my whole people.\u201d He turned toward Lucas desperately. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could stand it if you hated me, Lucas. You\u2019re the only one I have now.\u201d</p><p>Lucas pulled him closer and kissed his lips. \u201cI could never hate you. I promise you that won\u2019t happen. Let me help you with whatever secret you\u2019re keeping. Please, Kai.\u201d</p><p>Completely miserable, Kai could only shake his head, and then bent over clutching himself as a sharp pain sliced through him. Lucas saw it and wrapped his arms around him, making soothing noises and rubbing his back until the pain subsided. \u201cI\u2019m not consciously doing it, Kai. I don\u2019t mean to hurt you, sweetheart.\u201d He blew out a heavy breath. \u201cMaybe I should just try to stay away from you more. If we had separate bedrooms...\u201d</p><p>Kai flinched again at his words. He loved sleeping with his husband, but perhaps Lucas didn\u2019t enjoy it as much and was using this as an excuse to get away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think,\u201d he replied, unable to meet Lucas\u2019s eyes.</p><p>A tense silence fell between them. Lucas stood up abruptly. \u201cAll right then. I\u2019ll sleep in the other room tonight. Maybe that will help us both.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d walked quickly toward the door without looking back and it had taken Kai a long time to get to sleep with the dull ache throbbing inside him. Trouble was, he couldn\u2019t tell if the ache was coming from his stomach or his heart.</p><p>Since that night, he and Lucas still made love, but now Lucas left afterward and slept in the spare bedroom. He still visited him almost nightly, seeming to be unable to stay away, but Kai could feel things slipping away from him, and he had no idea how to stop it.</p><p>In an effort to fill his time, he sometimes visited with the other mates of Lucas\u2019s family members. Lucas\u2019s brother and two of his cousins had been recently mated, and Kai was getting to know the family better, especially the mates. They were often either coming or going from their trips around the galaxies with their mates, though, so he didn\u2019t get to spend as much time with them as he would have liked. He particularly enjoyed talking to Ryan, the handsome blond mate of Lucas\u2019s brother, Blayde.</p><p>Ryan had been at the docks to meet them the night they returned and Kai witnessed the passionate reunion between him and Blayde. Ryan had thrown himself on Blayde the minute he\u2019d jumped down off the ship and wrapped both his arms and legs around him. Kai had been amazed at such a public display of affection\u2014such things just weren\u2019t done on Scythia.</p><p>Blayde had peeled Ryan off him eventually, though he kept a big hand on his waist and kept Ryan pulled possessively close to him. \u201cKai, this is my mate, Ryan. You two will probably be seeing a lot of each other in the days to come. Our home is next door to yours.\u201d</p><p>The handsome little blond held out a hand to him, but his eyes were wide with surprise. \u201cBut I thought you were going to be a girl.\u201d He clapped his hands in delight. \u201cThis is a wonderful surprise.\u201d He turned to Blayde in confusion. \u201cWhat happened? Did Lucas arrange for a different mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d Blayde said quietly.</p><p>Kai, who was feeling overwhelmed with all the males swarming over the dock, looked around for Lucas. Not finding him, he started to tremble a little, but tried to smile and gave Ryan his hand. \u201cN-nice to meet you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Ryan smiled back at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll like it here\u2014and I know we\u2019ll be good friends.\u201d</p><p>Lucas came up beside Kai then, and Kai stepped close to him. Looking a little surprised, Lucas reached for Kai\u2019s hand. \u201cI think Kai is feeling a little nervous. Maybe you can come over tomorrow to talk to him, Ryan? Once he\u2019s had a chance to settle in a bit. It would be good for him to talk to one of the other mates.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded happily. \u201cI\u2019d love to. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow then, okay, Kai?\u201d</p><p>Kai smiled as Blayde pulled Ryan down the ramp and into one of the waiting vehicles. They looked like the land vehicles on his own planet, but the wheels were huge and the tires knobby. When Kai followed Lucas to one of them and stepped off the wooden dock, he sank down into the sandy soil and realized the wheels had to be so large to navigate through the terrain.</p><p>When they arrived at Lucas\u2019s large home, Kai got an overall impression of low white walls with a stone fence wrapping entirely around the home. He followed Lucas inside and stood hesitantly by the door, not sure what to do next. Lucas put down his bag and turned toward him. He looked exhausted, yet his big body as he leaned against the counter was incredibly attractive, stirring something deep with- in Kai. Predictably, the flesh between his legs started to get hard. He\u2019d noticed this whenever he looked at Lucas over the past two days of the voyage. Kai angled his body away, so that Lucas wouldn\u2019t notice. Lucas had his hand down there on Kai most of the time anyway, and Kai figured he\u2019d touch him there again if he noticed, as if it was his duty to see to it. Even though Kai ached for his touch, he knew his mate needed rest more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I sleep?\u201d Kai asked, and Lucas tilted his head as he stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWith me. My room is at the end of the hall. I did make provisions for you to have your own space, though, in the room next to mine. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to redecorate. It\u2019s very...frilly,\u201d he said, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>Kai shook his head. \u201cOh no, I like frilly things. In my room at home...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019d redecorate,\u201d Lucas said, his voice tight with anger. \u201cYou\u2019re not a female, so stop acting like one.\u201d</p><p>Kai lowered his head, but anger surged through him. He tried hard not to show it, not wishing to argue so soon after arriving, but he was getting very tired of people telling him what he was supposed to like. Who decided these things, anyway? Why was his natural preference for soft colors, frills and lace so wrong? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded and Lucas walked closer to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to snap at you. I know this must be hard for you. I\u2019m finding it\u2019s a little hard for me too.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he pulled Kai close to him and kissed his forehead. \u201cGo on to the last bedroom at the end of the hall and get in bed. You look exhausted. I have a few things to check on, and then I\u2019ll come join you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to get ready for bed, since he had no clothes at all. He\u2019d been wearing some of Lucas\u2019s things on board the ship, but usually slept naked, since that was what Lucas seemed to want. Kai wandered down the hall to Lucas\u2019s room. He got into Lucas\u2019s big bed, sinking down into a soft, comfortable mattress. The pillow smelled like Lucas, and the familiar smell relaxed Kai enough that he soon fell asleep. He awoke sometime in the night to find Lucas\u2019s big, hard body spooning him, his arm wrapped tightly around Kai\u2019s waist. Kai snuggled back against him and let sleep overtake him again.</p> <p>Now, only a few weeks later, his husband no longer slept by his side at night. How had things unraveled so much between them in such a short time? Sighing, Kai gathered up his arrows and walked back toward the house. He\u2019d been standing in the yard daydreaming so long that he looked around nervously to make sure none of the neighbors were watching him. Ryan had told him many of the Lycan people had wanted a female consort for their alpha, so Lucas could get an heir. When Ryan saw the stricken look on Kai\u2019s face, he blushed and said he talked too much and not to worry about it in the least. Lucas and Blayde and the rest of the family were handling everything.</p><p>Kai caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass doors that led inside the house. He looked very different from the person known as Princess Kai, and he no longer resembled a woman at all. Lucas had made him cut his long hair to a much shorter length. Not quite as short as his and the other Lycans, but close. He never wore makeup any more. He\u2019d been glad about the makeup, and hadn\u2019t minded at all about his hair. He liked the freedom of the shorter cut, and he\u2019d wanted to look more like Lucas, whom he considered very handsome. Still, he wondered if there was anything about him that Lucas did like, and he felt little pieces of himself slipping away.</p><p>Kai\u2019s body looked longer and leaner in the clothing he wore now too. Lucas had purchased an entire wardrobe for him, consisting mainly of the trousers and shirts and soft leather boots the other Lycans wore. They were comfortable enough, though still stiff and new. He still preferred his comfortable leggings and since he was back inside, he went to his room to change into them.</p><p>Afterward, he checked his compnetto see if his mother had sent him a message. Lucas himself had sent the queen a brief message telling her they\u2019d arrived on Lycanus 3 safely. But, at first, he\u2019d forbidden Kai to contact her. When he saw how unhappy it made Kai, he\u2019d relented, and now allowed him to send messages to her regularly. Kai was well aware that Lucas read his messages, probably hoping to learn the secrets Kai was keeping from him. It did him no good whatsoever.</p><p>The lines weren\u2019t secure into Scythia, so neither Kai nor his mother ever sent messages of any importance. Kai and Merrial had long ago worked out a system of secret communication, though, starting when he was only a child. Merrial had a beautiful wife named Lythiquo. As a young girl, Lythiquo had been quite beautiful and when she\u2019d first come to Scythia as a love slave, she worked in the royal palace. Merrial met her there, and when Lythiquo became too old to be desirable any longer, Merrial was allowed to purchase her for herself.</p> <p>Lythiquo came from a tiny planet on the outskirts of the known universe. Its sun had super-novaed and the few inhabitants who managed to escape sought refuge all over the galaxies. Lythiquo had sold herself into slavery in order to survive. Her planet, QVR 7, had a strange, obscure language known as Quevarian, and it was so obscure and difficult to master that no one really knew it any more, except, of course, for the few refugees like Lythiquo. She had taught it to Merrial, who in turn, taught the language to Kai when he was very young, and he had spent many hours practicing with both Merrial and Lythiquo. Thus, they could have entire secret conversations no matter who was nearby to hear them.</p><p>Occasionally, he and Merrial still used this language to send their messages to each other. Lucas must have noticed, but he\u2019d never questioned it. Perhaps he thought messages to a servant were beneath his notice.</p><p>Kai was sitting in the main living area, his leg swung over the arm of the big lounge chair when Lucas came in late that afternoon.</p><p>As always, Kai\u2019s heart leaped at the sight of him. Lucas came over to sit on one of the sofas. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pains?\u201d Lucas asked solicitously. \u201cI\u2019m trying very hard not to think about any of the...issues...between us. I hate the thought of you in pain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone,\u201d Kai said, lying only a little. He was beginning to be able to live with the discomfort. It wasn\u2019t too bad so long as he kept busy. \u201cI practiced with the bow you bought for me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? Did you have a good day then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, fine. Maybe a little...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little lonely. But I understand you have to work, and the other mates are all off on trips with their spouses. I\u2019m fine, really, but I was thinking. Maybe I could come with you sometimes? To the mines?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot and dirty. I don\u2019t want you in that kind of environment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. All right then.\u201d He chanced another plea. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind. I\u2019d try not to get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d Lucas said sharply and then shifted uneasily as he glanced down at Kai. \u201cDon\u2019t look like that. I want you to be with me, but it\u2019s not a place for you. Some of the workers are very rough men.</p> <p>The way you were brought up\u2014I\u2019d be too worried about you to be able to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I was thinking,\u201d Lucas said, leaning forward. \u201cYou said once that Scythians don\u2019t have any household pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Kai said. \u201cAnimals are for outside,\u201d he said firmly, repeating the words Merrial had told him so many times.</p><p>Lucas smiled. \u201cNot always. When we were kids, Blayde and I had a windiga. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>When Kai shook his head, Lucas continued. \u201cThey\u2019re pets\u2014about so high,\u201d he held his hand out by his knee, \u201cwith lovely brown fur. They\u2019re fiercely loyal and surprisingly gentle to their owners, though they can be vicious to outsiders. It\u2019s all in the way they\u2019re trained, of course. My foreman told me his windiga had kits not long ago. He said you could have one, if you like. I thought it might be good for you, and they make very good watch animals. I like the idea that he can protect you when I\u2019m at the mines all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut won\u2019t they make a mess in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you train them properly. They\u2019re very intelligent and easy enough to train. I can show you. If you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai said, nodding. \u201cWhen can I have him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him home tomorrow.\u201d Lucas stood up and held out his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s eat something. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Kai followed his mate into the kitchen area and watched while he pulled two dinners from the cabinet. Kai had never seen these kinds of dinners before he came to Lycanus 3. They were already prepared, ready in seconds and absolutely delicious once they were put through the food processor, a small appliance on the countertop. He usually let Lucas pick out the dinners for him, since he had no idea what most of them were anyway. So far, he liked the Lycan food and almost always ate whatever Lucas fixed for him.</p><p>Lucas pulled out some kind of small red fruit and popped one inside Kai\u2019s mouth. It was deliciously sweet and so juicy. The sweet liquid stained his lips. \u201cDo you like them? They\u2019re kaiberries,\u201d Lucas said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cKaiberries?\u201d Kai looked up in delight. \u201cLike my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly. They have a very short growing season and are considered a delicacy.\u201d He leaned over and licked the juice remaining on Kai\u2019s lips. \u201cAbsolutely delicious,\u201d Lucas said, and Kai felt a blush starting on his neck and working its way up.</p><p>Kai picked up a berry and held it out teasingly in front of Lucas\u2019s lips. He\u2019d only recently felt bold enough around his husband to tease him a little. Lucas seemed to like it. He opened his mouth to take the berry, but Kai held onto it, keeping the sweet, red berry just at Lucas\u2019s lips. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201cHold the berry between your lips a moment.\u201d</p><p>Lucas widened his eyes, but did as Kai asked, holding the berry between his lips and quirking up an eyebrow. Kai leaned forward and nibbled at the berry, feeling the juices running down his and Lucas\u2019s chins, feeling Lucas\u2019s soft lips against his. Lucas moaned, and Kai nuzzled his nose in closer, taking the last bite in his mouth, and licking the juice carefully off Lucas\u2019s lips. He sat back and looked up at Lucas innocently. \u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to eat a kaiberry, I think. And you\u2019re right. They\u2019re quite a delicacy.\u201d</p><p>Lucas swallowed hard and took Kai\u2019s face in his hands. He bent his head and took his mouth, making a little sound that was half-groan, half-growl. \u201cDinner later,\u201d he said hoarsely and hauled Kai across the counter into his arms. Grabbing the berries off the counter, he pulled Kai down the hall toward the bedroom. \u201cI can think of another way to eat a kaiberry,\u201d he said, and Kai squealed and pretended to try and get away.</p><p>Throwing his boy onto his stomach in the middle of the bed, Lucas ripped at his clothing before turning his attention to his own. When he had them both naked, he looked down at Kai and saw him laughing up at him over his shoulder, sticking his ass up in the air and wiggling it.</p><p>Almost mad with desire, Lucas fell down behind him and pried open the cleft between his pretty, round ass cheeks. Burying his face in the crevice, he laughed to hear Kai scream and wiggle as if he were trying to get away. He raised his head slightly. \u201cOh no, you started this. I was perfectly happy to eat my dinner, but you had to get cute. \u201cHe bent back to his task, swiping his long tongue all the way up from the back of Kai\u2019s heavy balls to the round little pink nub that was his prize. He grabbed a berry or two from the carton on the bedside and stuck them just inside the little wrinkled hole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kai squealed again when he felt the icy cold berries and tried to buck him off, but Lucas simply enjoyed the ride and then spanked his bottom a couple of times. He bit his ass cheek. \u201cStay still, boy. Accept your punishment for teasing me,\u201d he said, laughing. He bent to his task, nibbling and biting at the sweet berries, licking them from Kai\u2019s delectable ass. Kai was moaning and alternately sticking his little ass back up higher and then trying to pull away. Lucas held him still as he ate several more of the berries, enjoying Kai\u2019s screams and groans.</p><p>When he had Kai trembling and thought his boy\u2019d had enough, he licked the juice off Kai\u2019s balls and his thighs and reached beneath him to grab his rigid cock. \u201cHad enough, baby? We can save the rest for later if you want.\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak, Kai nodded frantically, and Lucas moved up behind him, turning Kai to his side and spooning him. He slid his cock inside Kai as he stroked his shaft, setting up an unhurried rhythm that soon had Kai gasping.</p> <p>\u201cI-I won\u2019t be able to last,\u201d he said, moaning and trying to thrust harder in Lucas\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease, please, Lucas, I\u2019m going! I\u2019m going!\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled against the nape of his neck and crooned in his ear. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re coming. So do it. Go ahead. Come in my hand, baby.\u201d</p><p>Kai writhed in his arms as the first wave of his orgasm hit, screaming out his name. He seemed to be hit again and again by fresh waves of the climax, and he reached behind him, gripping Lucas\u2019s hip as if reassuring himself Lucas was still there, still with him, watching over him.</p><p>Seeing Kai\u2019s pleasure brought Lucas to the edge too. He pushed harder into Kai, beginning to pound into him, making him arch his back and cry out. He pushed himself in so far his balls were resting against Kai\u2019s ass. Kai surprised him then by snapping his hips back at him and with a harsh cry, Lucas slammed into him so hard the bed shook. His hips jerked as his cock throbbed over and over inside Kai, filling him with his cum.</p><p>They both lay spent in the aftermath of the storm, and Lucas was physically incapable of pulling out. He felt himself softening, and made himself stop stroking Kai, because he knew how that could become almost painful once he\u2019d come so hard. Finally, he was able to move, and he slid out of Kai and off the bed, going into the bathroom to clean up. He brought a cloth for Kai and tenderly washed him and moved him away from the red berry stains on the sheets.</p> <p>\u201cI hope the cleaners can get that stain out,\u201d he said with a laugh, and Kai looked down at it and blushed.</p><p>\u201cOh no, what will they think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll think we spilled some juice, baby. What do you care what they think?\u201d He pulled him from the bed. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m still starving, and I need to feed you.\u201d He pulled Kai along behind him, but stopped at the doorway and looked at him very seriously. \u201cI think, considering your reaction to the berries, that I need to visit the fresh market more often. I had no idea the Scythians were so fond of fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Kai said solemnly. \u201cWe love fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Lucas started out of the room again and stopped. \u201cHow do your people feel about vegetables? The cucumbers they eat on Earth are very nice.\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded solemnly. \u201cI\u2019m always open to new things. You know the kinds of things I like to eat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, these wouldn\u2019t be for eating. Not at all.\u201d He laughed at the curious expression on Kai\u2019s face and led him to the kitchen.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Kai bent over to scoop up the mess his little windiga left on the floor of the kitchen. He didn\u2019t want Lucas to see it and perhaps get angry at his little pet. Kai had named the female windiga, Merri, after his old nurse and friend Merrial, whom he still dearly missed, despite her foolishness. She\u2019d been almost a second mother to him over the years and he missed seeing her every day.</p><p>He snapped his fingers at his pet now, like he\u2019d seen Lucas do, and she followed him eagerly from the room and outside to one of the trash containers at the back of the house. Kai didn\u2019t bother to snap the leash on her\u2014they were just going right outside and she\u2019d been getting really good about minding him when he gave her little orders lately, like to sit or stay. He didn\u2019t anticipate any problems with her now, and she hated the leash so much, digging in her little paws and pulling back against it until Kai was afraid she\u2019d choke herself.</p><p>It was a gorgeous day outside, the sun beating down as mercilessly as ever, but there was a bit of a breeze coming out of the north that made the morning pleasant. Later in the day, the temperatures would rise, but for now, it wasn\u2019t too bad, and Kai lifted his face up to the sun to enjoy the warmth.</p><p>He snapped his fingers again and started back toward the house, thinking he might go in the pool for a while before it got too hot. Merri trotted along behind him. Gazing across the courtyard to where Blayde and his mate Ryan lived, Kai wished they were at home. Blayde and Ryan chased bounties all over the galaxies and were gone sometimes for quarter cycles at a time. Kai had met Ryan briefly when he\u2019d first arrived on Lycanus 3 and had liked the young man right away. He was such a pretty little thing, and being around him made Kai wish he wasn\u2019t so tall and big boned. Maybe if he were petit like Ryan and Nikolai\u2019s mate, Prince Jagger, Lucas would be as crazy about Kai as the others were about their mates.</p><p>Not that Lucas didn\u2019t like Kai, or at least he certainly seemed to like the things he did to Kai in the bedroom. But there was something missing\u2014a look in the eyes of the other mated pairs that Kai never saw in Lucas\u2019s. He supposed it was because of the things he still couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell Lucas, for fear it would bring down retribution on his mother.</p><p>Kai plopped down on the back steps and idly petted Merri\u2019s thick fur. He wanted to tell Lucas everything\u2014he had a nagging feeling that some of the things he\u2019d been taught about the goddess might have been lies. And if it was all lies, then every day, every hour he hesitated, innocent boy babies could be lost. Not re-assimilated into the goddess\u2019s body, like he\u2019d always believed, but terminated, ended, destroyed. His mind shied away from the idea\u2014it was too horrible to contemplate. The headache started back up again and he rubbed at his temple. He wished he knew the right thing to do.</p> <p>A loud wail at the end of the alley caused him to put up his head as a large, black windiga yelped at his pet again and bounced away, heading down the alley at a fast clip. Instantly, before he could grab for her, Merri took off at a rapid pace, chasing the other animal. Kai yelled for Merri to return, but she kept going, so he had no choice but to take off after her.</p><p>They were headed away from the back of the houses, out into the desert. He could see Merri up ahead, still following the large black windiga, and she was getting farther and farther away from him. The rocky ground was hard to run on, and he kept tripping over small rocks and stumbling into small depressions in the earth.</p><p>Kai had been trained as a hunter, and was used to running long distances after game, though not in this deep sand. It made running much more difficult. He was so intent on keeping his footing and catching up to Merri that he had gone some distance before he pulled up to look around behind him. Surprised at how far he\u2019d come, he had a momentary twinge, thinking Lucas wouldn\u2019t like him being so far out in the desert alone, but he could still easily see the city, so he wasn\u2019t afraid of getting lost. There wasn\u2019t much out here, really, except the volcanic rocks. When he turned back, Merri was out of sight.</p><p>Kai turned and began running again, up toward the high hills in the distance, the direction in which he\u2019d last seen Merri. He figured she\u2019d tire soon, and then she\u2019d need him to carry her back home. He glanced up at the sky. It wasn\u2019t even midday yet\u2014he had hours before Lucas would be home. If he was lucky, he could catch up to Merri soon and get back with her long before Lucas got off work. He tried to put on a bit more speed and scanned the horizon in front of him for some sign of his little windigo. Thus, he failed to see the storm clouds that had begun to gather behind him to the south, and never even realized it was about to rain until the first big drops hit the back of his neck, and he stopped to look up at the threatening sky.</p><p>Just this side of frantic, Lucas tightened his grip on the steering wheel and drove through the desert, looking for any sign of Kai. Beside him, Larssen scanned the horizon with his night vision scopes and spoke very little. Lucas figured Larssen knew how close he was to losing it, and was trying to give him a chance to pull himself together.</p><p>After searching all night the night before, and most of the day, Lucas was getting badly frightened. The search parties, though still actively looking for Kai, had all come up empty. The anger Lucas had felt at first had quickly shriveled up to this cold feeling of dread that they wouldn\u2019t find Kai alive. He knew it was probably unreasonable, but he couldn\u2019t shake it, and the idea was making him feel desperate.</p><p>Lucas and Larssen were searching the northern perimeter again because of a chance remark Kai had made once about the forests. Rising up from the deserts, the foothills to the north of Balenescu City were covered in scrub brush, graduating to a thin treeline and then, as they rose higher, thick, green forests where the underground water sprouted out in rivers and streams. Kai had been fascinated by the forests, so much like his home planet. He\u2019d said he\u2019d like to go to them one day and do some hunting with his bow. Knowing it was highly unlikely Kai would have taken off on his own to hunt, Lucas still needed to check out every possibility, no matter how slim. He was running out of ideas. Kai had been missing for almost thirty hours, and despite the best efforts of the search teams, they\u2019d found no sign of him.</p><p>Lucas discovered him gone when he returned from the mines in the afternoon the day before. The doors were open, the compnet was turned on, but there was no sign of Kai and his little windiga. At first, Lucas thought he might be out walking the animal, but when he failed to return, he went out looking for him. His failure to find Kai anywhere precipitated this search and these escalating feelings of panic.</p><p>At first when he\u2019d found Kai gone, Lucas had feared a kidnapping, but search animals had tracked Kai directly north from their home to the desert. It was there, in the rocky terrain, that they lost the scent. The northern perimeter had been thoroughly scoured and they had come up empty-handed. Now other teams were searching the desert in various directions, but Lucas had a nagging feeling that Kai might be somewhere in the forests to the north. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen you find him, you need to tan his bottom for causing so much trouble,\u201d Larssen said teasingly, no doubt trying to lighten Lucas\u2019s mood, which had gone from brooding agitation to near full-blown terror in the last few hours.</p><p>Lucas snorted. \u201cIf I find him, you mean.\u201d He\u2019d meant that to come out in the same tone as Larssen\u2019s remark and was surprised to hear a little sound like a sob just there at the end.</p><p>Larssen gripped his knee. \u201cWe\u2019ll find him. He\u2019s a smart boy. He probably took shelter from the storm that came through, and he\u2019s waiting for daylight to start back home. You know, the winds didn\u2019t let up until midday today, and then the temperatures dropped. He\u2019s probably staying warm and getting his bearings before he starts back.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas nodded, though his mind conjured up far more lurid scenarios. His mind kept playing images of Kai injured and bleeding somewhere, needing his help. He saw him falling from a cliff, or attacked by wild animals. His Lycan wolf had been trying to force the change on him all afternoon, so it could run howling to the woods to search for its mate. If he thought it would have done any good, he\u2019d have already shifted, but he knew his best bet to find Kai wasn\u2019t on foot, at least not yet.</p><p>\u201cThe forests are ahead. Pull out the map again, and let\u2019s figure out which trails he might have taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Larssen said. \u201cThe search party went along this main trail, but there\u2019s a smaller one on the far northern side that would be worth taking a look at. Maybe we can find some tracks or pick up his scent.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded, his stomach in knots. If Kai had taken the trail, he might be able to catch his scent\u2014he\u2019d know that sweetness anywhere\u2014but he was afraid the rains had wiped most of it out. If he\u2019d ever had any doubts about how he felt for Kai, they were all gone now. He was beginning to feel like someone had reached into his chest and ripped out his heart, but he was still somehow walking around. Or like he\u2019d felt once during the cliff diving he\u2019d done on a vacation on Milanos Minor, when the sea was rushing up to meet him, and he knew he was about to slam into it, but there was nothing he could do to stop it. If he lost Kai, it would finish him, plain and simple. He swallowed down the bile that was rising into his chest and kept driving.</p><p>Kai gazed out toward the headlights coming toward him from the direction of Balenescu City and sighed. He knew he was in big trouble, and there was no way out of it. That was more than likely Lucas driving toward him so fast, and though he was happy to be rescued, he knew he was in for it. His stomach had been killing him all day, so he knew exactly how angry Lucas must be at him, and he dreaded facing that anger almost as much as he yearned to see Lucas. He\u2019d spent a long, miserable night and day in the forest and he was more than ready to be back home. He was tired, hungry and terribly thirsty, and he wouldn\u2019t even mind the tongue-lashing he was about to get, just so Lucas would take him home\u2014not much, anyway. He just hoped Lucas wasn\u2019t too angry at him.</p> <p>He\u2019d followed Merri into the woods and chased her into the bushes when she ran away from him. He was so intent on finding her that the storm was on top of him before he knew it, only becoming aware it was so close just minutes before it hit. The trees started whipping their branches around, trying to warn him of the storm\u2019s stealthy approach, and he realized then how much darker it had gotten. He stepped out in a clearing to see the dark purple clouds roiling almost directly above him. Rain was so infrequent on Lycanus 3 that this was the first storm he\u2019d experienced here, so he didn\u2019t quite know what to expect, but he knew he had to find some kind of shelter away from the trees by the looks of the lightning lighting up the skies. This looked like a really bad one.</p><p>He doubled back to a stream he\u2019d just crossed that was down in a gully with sheer rock sides. Thinking he might find some kind of cave or at least an overhang in the rock wall, he made his way back toward it and spotted a good sized outcropping a little way downstream. Climbing down to it proved tricky, though, when he lost his footing on the slippery walls and crashed down into the icy stream below, twisting his ankle and soaking his pants. He got himself up, hobbled down to the overhang and hunkered under it just as the storm hit in earnest. The winds were violent, but he had some shelter from the rain and the lightning under his rock outcropping. He was already pretty much soaked by that time. It passed through after an hour or so, but by that time, it was beginning to get dark and Kai\u2019s ankle was throbbing. He decided he\u2019d better stay where he was until morning, even though he knew Lucas would be worried about him.</p><p>As it got darker, the temperatures dropped, and he started to shiver. He had no way to start a fire, especially with everything so wet around him, so he hugged his arms around himself, curled up and tried to go to sleep, despite the shudders that wracked his body. He awoke a short time later to something hot and wet on his face, and he jumped up, startled and overjoyed to find Merri licking him with her big, black tongue. He wrapped his arms around her, alternating between scolding her and kissing her. She settled down beside him, obviously as happy to see him as he was to see her. Her thick fur and body heat helped to keep him warm until first light when he managed to climb out of the gully to find his way back down the mountain.</p><p>Fashioning a lead out of his belt, he looped one end of it around Merri\u2019s collar so she wouldn\u2019t run away again, but he had trouble locating the trail where he\u2019d followed her up the mountain. After stumbling around half the day looking for it, stopping often to rest as his ankle swelled again and set up a painful throbbing, he\u2019d finally found a clearing in the trees and located the city in the distance, so he knew what direction to go in, at least. Since then, he\u2019d given up on trying to find the trail and made his way down through the thick trees toward the direction of Balenescu City.</p><p>It was slow going and had taken him most of the day, but he and Merri finally made it almost down the mountain. It was growing dark and he was wondering if he should try to make it across the desert in the dark, with his ankle in such bad shape, or wait until morning. It was then that he spotted the lights of a vehicle coming toward them fast. He watched the vehicle\u2019s approach across the sand and started to limp towards it, shouting and waving his free hand in the air.</p><p>What looked like one of the all-terrain vehicles suddenly veered directly toward him and Kai stopped and stood still as it approached. As it got closer, he could see Lucas behind the wheel with his cousin, Larssen, sitting in the seat next to him. Lucas\u2019s face was much stormier than any of the clouds he\u2019d seen the day before, and Kai squared his shoulders, preparing himself for the tongue lashing that he knew was headed his way. He just hoped a tongue-lashing was the only kind he\u2019d get.</p> <p>When Larssen yelled, \u201cI\u2019ve spotted him! He\u2019s there, up ahead,\u201d something icy and brittle turned loose in Lucas\u2019s chest, and he was able to take a deep breath for the first time that whole, long day. Whipping the ATV around in the direction Larssen was pointing, Lucas raced toward Kai, relief that he was safe and fury that he had scared him so badly flooding him in almost equal measures.</p><p>He could see Kai up ahead in the headlights, just standing there, holding onto his little windiga by some kind of strap. Lucas threw the vehicle in gear and was out of it and running toward Kai almost before the wheels stopped spinning. His wolf clamored at him, and for once, Lucas unleashed him and let him have his way. Kai startled when he saw what was coming for him, his eyes round with horror. He stumbled backward a few steps, holding up his hands defensively.</p><p>Roaring at him, Lucas, who was by this time fully shifted into his Lycan wolf, swiped his hands out of the way and fell on him, taking him down to the ground on his back. He tried to keep the bulk of his weight off him, but he was pretty far gone by this point, and his wolf was almost out of control. Lucas heard Kai yelling and felt blows on the side of his head, but he sank his teeth deeply into the side of Kai\u2019s neck to hold him still as his body rutted at Kai\u2019s. A big hand came down on his shoulder and he lifted his head to see Larssen yelling something at him. He became aware of the little windiga going crazy next to him, too, nipping at his side and trying to protect Kai. His wolf didn\u2019t comprehend much of anything at that point except claiming his mate, and he showed his teeth to Larssen, growling over Kai.</p><p>Larssen shifted too, and shoved him off Kai, then hunched protectively over the boy, snarling. Furious that Larssen would come between him and his mate, Lucas\u2019s wolf leaped on him and a vicious struggle ensued. Since they were both alphas and more or less evenly matched, it could have gotten very violent, very fast. But when Lucas pinned Larssen on his back, some semblance of reason came back to him before he did him any serious injury, and he managed to push his wolf away and force the change on himself.</p><p>Lucas surged to his feet, shaking his head to clear it and saw Kai limping into the desert to get away from him. It took him only moments to overtake him, but Kai turned on him as he caught up to him, his chest heaving and blood running down his neck from the open puncture wounds on his throat. Thank the gods Larssen had interrupted him before he could do Kai any real harm. He would never have knowingly hurt Kai in either his Lycan or humanoid form, but his overreaction to finding him could have injured the boy. The sight of the blood on Kai\u2019s neck horrified Lucas.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he said. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Kai drew back a fist and slammed it into Lucas\u2019s nose with such force that Lucas fell backward, stunned.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me!\u201d Kai shouted, his voice raspy and breathless. With a jolt, Lucas realized Kai had never seen his wolf before, though surely he\u2019d known that the Lycans were shapeshifters.</p> <p>Kai stood over him in a fighting stance, his fists up to cover his face. When he saw Lucas make no effort to stand up and fight him, he backed a few steps, then turned and tried to run again, limping badly on one of his ankles.</p><p>\u201cKai, stop running, please!\u201d Lucas sprang to his feet and ran after him, grabbing for Kai and wrapping his arms around him, holding Kai\u2019s arms down by his side as he struggled violently. With his arms wrapped around Kai\u2019s chest, Lucas could feel his heart racing wildly as Kai shouted and struggled. He bent his head to Kai\u2019s throat, bathing it in his saliva so it would heal quickly. When Kai realized he wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him anymore, he relaxed a little, even turning his head in what Lucas\u2019s inner wolf recognized as submission. It helped calm Lucas, and he crooned to Kai as he tended him and held him in his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After several minutes had passed, Lucas became aware of Larssen standing nearby, and Lucas turned to him, his eyes pleading with him to forgive him and understand that he\u2019d been out of control. Larssen put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I knew you didn\u2019t realize what you were doing.\u201d He glanced down at Kai, whose face was red and furious, his eyes tightly shut, his face scrunched up and full of tension.</p><p>\u201cKai, it\u2019s all right now. Lucas is back to himself, and he\u2019s not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from me, both of you. You\u2019re both monsters.\u201d Kai\u2019s voice was calmer, but still hoarse and breathy. Lucas kissed the side of his face and whispered to him.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, you know we shift to our wolves when we\u2019re angry or upset. I thought you understood that. We didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>Kai opened his eyes and glared up at him. \u201cWho said I was frightened? I was startled\u2014shocked, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. And you tried to kill me.\u201d His voice broke on the last few words, and he turned his face away again.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Kai. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I\u2019ve been\u2014upset. I\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere. I thought you were lost.\u201d Lucas could hear his voice rising, and made a conscious effort to calm himself. It was suddenly all he could do not to shake Kai to make him understand that he could never disappear like that again, but he clamped down on his anger, not wishing to frighten him any further.</p><p>Kai nodded, and turned his face away, doubling over and hugging his stomach. He closed his eyes. Lucas kissed him again on the side of the face, trying to ease his pains, but Kai pushed him away.</p><p>Larssen patted Kai\u2019s shoulder as well, turning an accusing look on Lucas. \u201cI\u2019ve got the windiga in the vehicle. Take care of your boy.\u201d He glanced down at him again. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously in pain and frightened half to death. Come when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>He headed back to the vehicle and Lucas took a deep breath. \u201cKai,\u201d he said softly. \u201cKai, I can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am for hurting you and scaring you like that. I didn\u2019t mean it. I let my wolf get out of control. I\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>At the use of the rare endearment, Kai opened his eyes and stared up at him accusingly. \u201cYou attacked me,\u201d he said, pushing at his chest. \u201cI thought you were trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it must have seemed that way to you, but my wolf was claiming you. He was trying to mate with you, not kill you. I-I should have had better control, but I was...I was so...\u201d He sagged a little in exhaustion. \u201cThere\u2019s no good excuse for my actions.\u201d He stood up and hauled Kai back to his feet, still holding onto his wrist, realizing that he was absolutely incapable of turning Kai loose.</p><p>The sheer violence of his feelings scared him a little. He was the alpha and he should never allow his feelings to overwhelm him so, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He\u2019d known the attraction to Kai was strong from the first time he\u2019d seen him, but he\u2019d fallen totally in love with this boy when he wasn\u2019t looking, and the idea scared him to death. He took another deep breath to calm himself and tried to make his voice non-threatening.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been, Kai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp there,\u201d Kai said, gesturing toward the mountain with a jerk of his head. \u201cMerri ran away, and followed another windiga up in the forest. I was chasing her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean to tell me you came all this way over that damn little...\u201d Lucas could hear himself getting loud again, so he made another conscious effort to calm down. \u201cDid you ever think about coming back and letting me know, so I could go after Merri for you?\u201d</p><p>Kai looked confused. \u201cNo. I was perfectly capable of going for her, and you were at work. I didn\u2019t want to disturb you. I used to go on hunts that lasted for days, Lucas. I know what I\u2019m capable of. I would have been back sooner if not for the storm\u2014oh, and I twisted my ankle when I fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell?\u201d Lucas looked him up and down. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you were limping. Where are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my ankle.It\u2019s nothing, really, but it\u2019s a little swollen so I had to take it slow this morning. Then I couldn\u2019t find the trail again, so...I know it all sounds dumb now, because you\u2019ve probably been looking for me some. I hope you didn\u2019t have to take a whole day off work.\u201d</p><p>Looking for him some? Hope you didn\u2019t take a whole day off work? Could he be serious? Lucas had shut down the entire mining operation for over twenty-four hours and had most of the pack out scouring the area for him. He rubbed a hand over his face and pulled Kai gently toward him, checking first to make sure he came willingly. After scaring him so badly, he wouldn\u2019t have blamed him if he\u2019d shied away and never spoke to him again. Kai allowed him to draw him closer, though, and even pressed his face into Lucas\u2019s neck. \u201cI just want to go home. I\u2019m thirsty and hungry.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sighed, kissing the top of his head. \u201cYes, Kai.We can go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Kai?\u201d Ryan asked, using the tiny remote device to flip through the choices on the screen of the vid machine. \u201cNot in the mood for a vid? We can just talk, if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d Kai said, scratching furiously at his upper arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m so furious at Lucas for putting this thing in me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe locator chip?\u201d He came over to inspect the swollen place on Kai\u2019s arm. \u201cOh hells, they\u2019re not so bad once the scab heals over. Blayde put one on me a while ago.\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cAnd you allowed it? He put a chip in your arm like you were some kind of pet animal, and it doesn\u2019t make you angry?\u201d He tightened his jaw. \u201cI tried my best to kill Lucas, but he gave me some kind of sedative. Damn him.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged. \u201cKai, listen to me. You have to understand the reason behind it. The family is so well known and powerful that the mates are at risk for being kidnapped and held for ransom. Or even worse. It\u2019s kind of a long story, but when Blayde and I first got together, I was running away from this powerful official of the Alliance. The guy had everyone fooled, and he\u2019d killed my best friend and then blamed it on me. Blayde took me back to Earth to try and clear my name, or at least get me immunity, and while we were there, I was kidnapped by the bastard who accused me. Thank the gods Nikolai was kidnapped right along with me and they had no idea of just how fierce the Lycans are. He saved me from being raped and killed before Blayde found us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear goddess,\u201d Kai said softly. \u201cBut no one\u2019s after me, Ryan. The whole thing\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you were a member of the royal family back home, right? So you must have had guards and stuff, all the time.\u201d</p><p>Kai shrugged and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, things are more relaxed around here, but Lucas is still our leader\u2014our alpha. That\u2019s the same as royalty in the Lycan world. Would you rather he put guards on you to follow you around all day?\u201d</p><p>Kai, not ready to give up his anger at Lucas just yet, pursed his lips and stared out the window.</p><p>\u201cSo when Blayde wanted to chip me,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t put up a fuss. The Balenescus are bounty hunters, you know, along with their other enterprises, and chip prisoners all the time so that if they escape, they know just where to find them again.\u201d</p><p>Kai crossed his arms and huffed out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m not a prisoner either. Though I\u2019m beginning to feel like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but the chip helps Lucas keep you safe, at least in his mind. He was pretty frantic when you got lost in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t lost, I keep telling everyone. I\u2019m not an idiot, and I was heading back home when they found me. I had a little trouble locating the trail, but that\u2019s to be expected, surely. I\u2019m not familiar with these woods on Lycanus 3. But I located the city and I\u2019d started walking back when they found me. I just hurt my ankle, that\u2019s all, and I was walking slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to explain it to me.\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt was Lucas who was going ballistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean, going ballistic? You mean he was angry? I know.\u201d Kai folded his arms across his chest and got a hurt expression on his face. \u201cHe attacked me when he found me, and bit my neck. \u201cHe turned to show Ryan the healed over puncture wounds that hadn\u2019t quite faded yet. \u201cSee what he did?\u201d</p><p>Ryan raised his eyebrows. \u201cWow, he really was torn up if he tried to give you the mating bite again. Was he in his Lycan wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it frightened me half to death. I\u2019d never actually seen that before. I knew they shifted, of course, but to actually see it...And to see it coming after me! I admit I panicked a little. Then when we got home, it was even worse. He put me in his bed and made love to me for hours. So long, I think I passed out for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cOoh, nice. Fucked unconscious. It\u2019s been a while since Blayde did that to me.\u201d</p><p>Kai felt the hot stain of a blush on his cheeks. \u201cHe must have gone to sleep that way because when I woke up he still had his\u2014you know, his thing\u2014still up inside me, and his hand was holding onto my flesh. The one between my legs,\u201d he whispered conspiratorially.</p><p>\u201cYour flesh? His thing? Honey, don\u2019t you even know what to call your dick?\u201d</p><p>Kai felt the hotness spreading over his face. \u201cRyan. It\u2019s not nice to talk like that. Yes, I know the names for it\u2014Lucas has told me, but I was brought up not to discuss such things. Besides, isn\u2019t a cock some kind of bird? Why would you give it a name like that? And a prick is a cut and Dick is a man\u2019s name. Aren\u2019t they? I just don\u2019t understand all these names you have for it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan laughed so hard he fell down on his back on the sofa. Kai smiled at him indulgently. \u201cI know you\u2019re laughing at me, but it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kai. I don\u2019t mean to laugh, but what you say is true. I never thought about it like that before. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you call it, does it? Just so long as you enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, since that night, Lucas comes to our bedroom every night to make love to me and then goes to sleep. He never sleeps in the spare bedroom anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be happy about that,\u201d Ryan said.</p> <p>\u201cI am. Or I was until he wanted to put this chip in my arm. But I don\u2019t understand. If he\u2019s so angry at me for going after Merri, why does he want to love on me all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you scared him. He thought he\u2019d lost you. You know he had the whole pack out looking for you, and he even shut down the mines\u2014he never shuts down the mines.\u201d</p><p>Kai tilted his head, his mouth falling open. \u201cHe did? But he didn\u2019t tell me any of this. Why would he do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Ryan smiled. \u201cBecause he\u2019s so crazy about you, you big dummy.\u201d He socked Kai lightly on the arm to show him he was teasing. \u201cBlayde said he\u2019d never seen Lucas so upset. He was frantic when he couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kai said, shaking his head. \u201cHe lusts after me, but I think he doesn\u2019t really like me. He hates the idea that my mother tried to trick him and make him think I was a female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Ryan looked at him curiously. \u201cBut why did she do that, Kai? Can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head stubbornly. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019m sorry, but if I told someone, and it got back to the wrong people, my mother\u2019s life could be in danger. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand. But there\u2019s one thing I learned since I\u2019ve been with the Balenescus and that\u2019s the fact that they can always surprise you. Just when you think you have them all figured out, you find out that you don\u2019t. Sometimes Blayde overreacts, for example, and blows up, but once he calms down, he can really be wonderful. They only overreact because they care so much. Lucas is a good alpha and a good person. Don\u2019t be afraid to trust him with your secrets.\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019d never understand this one. It goes against Alliance law, and you know how he is about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, you\u2019re letting this secret of yours tear the two of you apart. Give him a chance, Kai. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\u201d</p><p>A small device on Ryan\u2019s wrist sounded a beeping tone, and he glanced down at it. \u201cThere\u2019s my lord and master now,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI guess Blayde\u2019s got the prisoners ready for transport. We\u2019ll be gone for a while, but think about what I said, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded and Ryan gave him a quick hug and took off to find his mate.</p><p>It was that same afternoon that Kai got the message from his mother. It wasn\u2019t long and chatty like her usual messages. It simply stated that she was no longer the queen, having abdicated in favor of his sister, Princess Delanon. Kai had known this time was coming soon, but it still surprised him a little. She had told him soon after he\u2019d arrived on Lycanus 3 that Delanon was pregnant, but he hadn\u2019t realized so much time had passed. She must be ready to have her baby by now. The gestation period for Scythians was three quarter cycles, and with a start, Kai realized he had been on Lycanus 3 for well over two of them. Still, it seemed to Kai they would have waited until after his sister was delivered of any children to ascend to the throne, and he wondered at the timing.</p><p>The next message he received was from his old nurse and body servant Merrial, and it was just as cryptic. Toward the end of the message, she had written a few lines that made Kai instantly uneasy and worried.</p><p>Princess Delanon has had unfortunate news. Her child, according to the physicians, will not be a person. As soon as it is delivered, it will be re-assimilated into the goddess. When your mother asked her to consider sending the child away, Delanon was not pleased.</p><p>Not a person? In Scythia, that could mean only one thing\u2014the child was a male. All the doubts he\u2019d been harboring since he\u2019d left Scythia came rushing back. The priestesses told the women that Scythian males were brain damaged and defective, but surely Kai wasn\u2019t the only exception to this rule. He knew he was intelligent and Lucas had carefully taught him that his genitalia were nothing to be ashamed of either. Truly, though Lucas\u2019s were a bit larger, they looked very similar, and Lucas seemed to like them very much. Ryan had even shown him some of his porn vids, as he called them, and Kai\u2019s were no different than Ryan\u2019s or the other humanoids in the vids. So what made them so defective?</p><p>Again, the blasphemous thoughts assailed him so strongly he felt a little sick. What if the goddess\u2019s teachings were wrong? What if all those children hadn\u2019t had to be re-assimilated? The idea was staggering in its enormity. He felt uneasy to even think such blasphemous thoughts.</p> <p>Why was Delanon really taking the throne from his mother so soon? Delanon had long cultivated a following among the guards. Was she staging some kind of coup? And was she doing it because her mother had blasphemed the goddess by suggesting she spare her male child from re-assimilation?</p><p>A half-buried memory came back to Kai as he sat there wondering. Once when he was a small child, he\u2019d asked Merrial what it meant to be re-assimilated. She had shaken her head and told him to be quiet, but her mate, Lythiquo, had looked troubled.</p><p>\u201cTell the child the truth, Merrial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Lythiquo. We don\u2019t know anything for sure. It\u2019s all rumors and lies. It has to be. Besides, it\u2019s forbidden by law to speak of such things.\u201d</p><p>Lythiquo had put a hand on Merrial\u2019s arm. \u201cMy friend Gasheea worked in the temples. She has seen with her own eyes the priestesses carrying them to the secret chamber. They were also carrying ceremonial knives, Merrial.\u201d</p><p>Merrial pulled her arm away sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s the foolish prating of slaves, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Lythiquo dropped her head. \u201cLike me...\u201d</p><p>Merrial looked shocked and pulled Lythiquo into her arms. \u201cNo, darling, I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>They had kissed then and made up their argument, but the memory came back strongly now to Kai. They were carrying ceremonial knives. Kai got a chill down his spine so strong it shook him to his core and he shuddered with horror. A strong voice behind him made him jump in his seat.</p><p>\u201cKai? What is it? Are you ill?\u201d</p><p>Lucas came up behind him and put his hands on Kai\u2019s shoulders. He glanced down at the compnet screen in front of Kai. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, baby? Did you get bad news from home?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Kai turned and buried his face against Lucas\u2019s stomach, throwing his arms around his waist. He nodded and Lucas rubbed a slow circle on his back. \u201cTell me, Kai. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Kai tilted back his head and gazed up at Lucas. He saw nothing in Lucas\u2019s eyes but concern. Taking a deep breath, Kai made his decision. \u201cI need to tell you, Lucas. Tell you everything. I\u2019ve been so confused and worried about my mother, but-but now I think she may be in danger because of this secret, in a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything, Kai. I\u2019ve told you that so many times.\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head sadly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid when you hear what I have to tell you\u2014I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll never want anything to do with me or any other Scythian ever again.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sat in his chair on the command deck of the star cruiser, leaning on one fist, brooding and silent. They would enter Scythia\u2019s atmosphere by morning, and beneath him in the decks below, slept an entire army of Alliance forces.</p><p>The preliminary strike force, masquerading as an Alliance inspection team, had been hastily assembled in the short span of time since Kai had informed Lucas of his suspicions, but other star cruisers were standing by for his signal, ready to launch a full invasion, if necessary. Lucas would speak to the new queen soon by satellite transmission, to see if she was amenable to an inspection of the temples. If she resisted in any way, he was fully prepared to force the issue, with full Alliance backing.</p><p>Lucas had been placed in charge of the preliminary force because of his close connection to the royal family, and Alliance officials still had hope that the children who were rejected were simply ferried off planet by the priestesses. The idea of the wholesale slaughter of thousands and thousands of innocent children, right under the collective nose of the Alliance, was simply unthinkable. If it were found to be true, retribution and justice would be swift and merciless.</p><p>Kai had cried himself to sleep the night before, though he\u2019d tried to hide it from Lucas, probably thinking Lucas would call him unmanly. The truth was, Lucas could well understand how he must be feeling. If the suspicions he conveyed to Lucas were confirmed, then his mother and sister would be arrested and made to answer for their crimes under Alliance law\u2014this meant almost certain execution. Since Delanon had so recently ascended to the throne, there might be a chance of leniency for her, but Kai\u2019s mother had been monarch for over thirty years. During that time, how many children might have been murdered?</p><p>The queen had to have known of the temple practices\u2014she had saved her own son, after all, while allowing countless others to be slaughtered in the name of her religion. If what Kai told him was true, she\u2019d also made a bid to save her grandson, but the plan had backfired. According to Alliance sources, there had been a takeover, with the dowager queen now confined to her rooms, and Queen Delanon was due to deliver her child any day. They needed to get to her before she could turn the child over to the priestesses.</p><p>Kai\u2019s planet would undergo vast changes when the Alliance took over. The Scythians would more than likely remain under martial law for the conceivable future, and the population would be required to undergo re-education for years. While the Alliance would make no efforts to change natural sexual orientation, it was to be hoped that with re-education and counseling, the women of Scythia would accept males on their planet again one day without rancor, and their society would allow natural heterosexual relationships to be accepted once again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All in all, the changes would be vast and far-reaching, and would take many years to accomplish. After all was said and done, it was Kai who had blown the whistle, and caused the changes to be made. It would have been daunting without the very real possibility of his own mother\u2019s imprisonment and execution\u2014the mother who had saved him and given him to Lucas as a mate, thereby inadvertently bringing about her own destruction.</p><p>Kai himself, though a royal, would be immune from prosecution. Lucas had made this deal with the Alliance officials an absolute prerequisite for his and Kai\u2019s cooperation and information. He\u2019d done it because he loved Kai, no matter what. The Balenescu curse, as well as his own feelings made anything else unthinkable, but he had barely spoken to Kai since the night he\u2019d made his tearful confession. Rationally, he knew Kai had no real knowledge of anything to do with the priestesses\u2014in fact, he was a victim of the ugly bigotry himself, forced to hide who he really was for all those years. If they\u2019d known about him, he would have been murdered too, and that thought gave Lucas a chill down his spine.</p><p>His own words to Kai came back to haunt him, though. You can tell me anything. Anything, that is, except the fact that your people are fucking child murderers. Don\u2019t tell me that because I cannot handle it. No matter how much I love you, how much I keep telling myself you\u2019re a victim, I keep hearing the screams of those other tiny victims in my head\u2014all those babies who were being slaughtered as I enjoyed your beautiful body.</p> <p>The night Kai finally told him, he\u2019d said it was only after he\u2019d married Lucas and come with him to Lycanus 3 that he\u2019d understood. It was then he realized most of what he\u2019d been told all his life had been terrible lies told to cover up what the priestesses were really doing in the name of the goddess. He said that at first he thought the goddess would strike him dead for even thinking such things, so he\u2019d pushed the thought away and refused to believe it. And there was his mother to consider.</p><p>And though Lucas\u2019s rational mind reminded him of all this over and over, the idea that Kai knew and hadn\u2019t told him sickened him, and he hadn\u2019t been able to forgive Kai\u2014or himself. He hoped, in time, he would be able to, but for now, he could hardly bear to be in the same room with Kai.</p><p>When he\u2019d left Kai in his quarters to come to the comm deck he\u2019d tried to be quiet and not awaken him, especially since he knew it had taken Kai such a long time to go to sleep. Kai rolled over to his back, though and raised himself on his elbows. \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head, still putting on his shoes. \u201cNo, but it won\u2019t be too long. It will be mid-morning Scythian time when we arrive and open up a channel to the planet.\u201d</p><p>Kai sat up, plucking at the blanket, avoiding looking directly at Lucas. \u201cCould I\u2014would it be possible for me to go down with the inspection team? I-I need to see my mother.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas paused and looked over at him incredulously. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible. Don\u2019t be foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, my mother was raised to believe the same things I was. Maybe she didn\u2019t realize...She could have been lied to by the priestesses, too, couldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she and her lawyers can make that case to the judges at her trial.\u201d Lucas stood up and walked toward the door. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your sympathy on her, Kai. Think about the lives your people have taken over the years. That\u2019s what you should be worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas...\u201d</p><p>The plaintiveness in Kai\u2019s voice brought Lucas up short at the door. He stopped and inclined his head back toward the bed, waiting.</p><p>\u201cLucas, she\u2019s my m-mama.\u201d</p> <p>The raw grief in Kai\u2019s voice made him sick at his stomach, but he steeled himself to it. He knew he was punishing Kai\u2014punishing himself too\u2014but he couldn\u2019t make himself unbend. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I have to go, Kai. Try to get some sleep. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>He turned to see Kai still sitting up in bed, his arms wrapped around his midsection, rocking himself a little. \u201cYou hate me now, don\u2019t you, Lucas? I can see it in your eyes, hear it in your voice when you speak to me. I\u2019ve really lost everything, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Lucas wanted to go to him, take him in his arms and tell him how much he loved him. He wanted to, but he couldn\u2019t. Not yet, at least. Still he couldn\u2019t bear to leave him like that either. He walked slowly toward the bed and sat down beside Kai. He shook his head and mumbled something like, \u201cDon\u2019t be foolish,\u201d taking Kai\u2019s hand. He tried to kiss him tenderly, to let the love he felt for him communicate itself to him, but when he touched him and inhaled his sweet scent, a powerful lust for his mate swept over him. He pushed Kai to his back and tore away the sheet. He\u2019d taught Kai to sleep naked since he\u2019d found him, and the sight of his beautiful body, already half-hard for him undid him even further.</p><p>Lucas pulled his pants down around his thighs and fell on top of him, grinding against him, his copious pre-cum spreading over Kai\u2019s groin. He wrapped his hand around Kai\u2019s cock and stroked it, pleased to feel it become rigid against his stomach. He got to his knees with a growl, pushing Kai\u2019s legs back. He spit in his hand and rubbed Kai\u2019s hole, but that was all the lubrication he\u2019d get\u2014he was too excited to wait.</p><p>Plunging into him, he felt Kai\u2019s tight ring pop as he entered him. He hesitated for just a moment, allowing him to adjust to his size before he thrust in one smooth, hard motion. Kai cried out, but did nothing to resist the invasion. Kai was breathing rapidly, but he was still with him, still seemed to be caught up in Lucas\u2019s passion. His grip was tight on Lucas\u2019s shoulders, and he thrashed his head on the pillow, moaning. Lucas began to fuck him in earnest, pulling out almost to the tip of his cock and then sliding back in again. Kai was grunting with each thrust, so Lucas pulled him up a little higher to change his position and reach his prostate. When he nailed it, Kai screamed and arched his back. Pulling him up higher on his lap, he impaled him there, using his strength to pull him up and then push him back down on his cock over and over again, picking up the pace until he was fucking him rapidly, really pounding him.</p><p>He\u2019d never been so rough with Kai before, so out of control, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself or even slow down. He did have the presence of mind to wrap his hand around Kai\u2019s erection and stroke him, keeping time with his own deep thrusts, but he was pretty far gone in his lust. In moments, Kai cried out and came copiously, his cum splashing up over his stomach and chest, even hitting him on the face. Lucas leaned forward to lick it from his chin and at the first taste of Kai\u2019s musky sweetness, he came hard, his cock throbbing and pulsing with each thrust. When he was finally spent, he collapsed against Kai\u2019s chest. He still held him on his lap, and he wrapped his arms around Kai\u2019s shoulders, holding him close. He felt Kai\u2019s tears splashing down on his back and he pulled away to peer into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he ordered. \u201cMen don\u2019t cry, Kai.\u201d Kai turned his head away, gulping hard, his breath hitching. He laid Kai down on the bed and got up, wiping at himself with the sheet. He went into the bathroom to clean up, wetting a cloth with warm water to bring to Kai. He cleaned him tenderly while he lay on his back, his hand over his eyes. When he finished, he stood regarding him quietly for a moment before turning back to the door.</p> <p>\u201cGet some sleep. We\u2019ll be there by morning.\u201d</p><p>A hand falling on his shoulder startled him from his thoughts and made him turn to see his cousins, Kyle and Nikolai behind him. Nikolai was holding out a cup of coffee to him. \u201cIt\u2019s not Lycan tea, but maybe it will do. This coffee is all they had in the commissary, but it\u2019s pretty strong,\u201d Nikolai said. \u201cAnd hot, at least.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded, reaching for it thankfully and taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need the caffeine. You should have gotten some rest before morning,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cWe\u2019re entering the Scythian atmosphere, so your conference call to the Scythian council isn\u2019t far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try not to tip our hand. I\u2019ll ask them to allow an inspection team to land first, tell them it\u2019s routine, and a new Alliance regulation. They won\u2019t be happy about it, but I think they\u2019ll agree, with restrictions on the temples and the palace. The team can pretend to make a cursory inspection. Then when the Scythians drop their defensive shields to allow them to come back up, we\u2019ll send down the first wave of the invasion team to force a real inspection. They\u2019ll take over the palace and the primary temple and be able to run things from there. If they find the evidence we think they will, the rest of the strike force will be right behind us. In the meantime, we\u2019ll put the queen and the council members in the dungeons below the palace, as well as the dowager queen, Ashlan.\u201d</p><p>His cousins nodded solemnly and Nikolai cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable. \u201cThat\u2019s Kai\u2019s mother, right? How\u2019s Kai doing anyway? I haven\u2019t seen him at all since we left Lycanus 3.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I confined him to quarters. His meals are being brought to him.\u201d</p><p>Nikolai looked startled. \u201cConfined to quarters? He\u2019s your mate, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of what he is to me, Nikolai. I don\u2019t need you to remind me,\u201d Lucas snapped.</p><p>Nikolai raised his chin and stared Lucas down. \u201cNo matter how upset I was with Jagger, I\u2019d never leave him alone to suffer like that. With you being so upset, the pain must be pretty bad, and this is his home\u2014his mother and his sister we\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s a little hard-ass even for you, isn\u2019t it, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>Lucas snarled at him, barely keeping his temper in check. \u201cWhy the fuck do you think I\u2019m sitting up here instead of down there in my quarters getting a little sleep? It\u2019s precisely because I am upset with him and it\u2019s hard to control it. The distance mitigates the pain a little, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Nikolai said with an accusing snort. \u201cThe poor kid must be feeling awful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, well, if the poor kid had been honest with me from the beginning, there\u2019s no telling how many lives we could have saved. It\u2019s been three quarter cycles since we mated. Three!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t know for sure, did he?\u201d Kyle asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t he believe the lies the priestesses were telling everybody\u2014that the babies were being re-assimilated or some such and then reborn as females?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says, yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe him?\u201d Kyle asked.</p><p>Lucas sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe anymore.

If we hadn\u2019t been so insistent about you getting a mate...\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. He\u2019s my mate, Kyle. My fated mate, according to the fucked-up curse, and if I hadn\u2019t met him then, I probably would have some other way. At least I hope so.\u201d Lucas blew out a long breath. \u201cI love him, damn it. And most of the time I realize it wasn\u2019t his fault\u2014they brainwashed the kid since he was born. Made him pretend to be female, for the gods\u2019 sake. No, intellectually I know he\u2019s innocent, but I just wish he\u2019d told me\u2014trusted me sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you really blame him, Lucas?\u201d Nikolai asked softly.</p> <p>When Lucas angled a surprised and furious glance at him, Nikolai held his ground and glared back at him. \u201cYou practically attacked him when he admitted to you he was a male that first night, remember? Then again when you found him after he got lost? He confided to Jagger and the other mates how you treat him sometimes. How you imply you\u2019re angry that he deceived you and make him feel he\u2019s not manly enough. Then you expect him to trust you? To turn over his own mother like it\u2019s nothing? I think you\u2019re asking rather a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lucas glared at him for a long moment before deflating like a balloon with the air let out. He put a hand to his forehead and leaned into it. \u201cYou\u2019re right. How can he possibly love me? I\u2019ve been such an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Nikolai grinned. \u201cYou won\u2019t get any argument from me there, but you must have done something right. Jagger says Kai\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Lucas raised his head and stared urgently at Nikolai. \u201cDid he say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you two talk at all?\u201d Nikolai said, laughing. \u201cYeah, he said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him before this all goes down. While the team is on its way down to the planet, I\u2019ll go talk to him and apologize if he\u2019ll still speak to me.\u201d</p> <p>Kyle squeezed his shoulder. \u201cHe will. You\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I only hope I can make him understand.\u201d</p><p>Nikolai looked down at the timepiece on his wrist. \u201cWell, if you want to talk to him before the team lands, you\u2019d better hurry. They\u2019re loading up in the bay now. They\u2019ll be launching shortly.\u201d</p><p>Kai stood somewhere in the middle of the crowd of soldiers, over a hundred of them, filing into the shuttle craft. His heart was racing, and he kept his head down in case someone recognized him. He didn\u2019t think it was likely, though. Lucas had confined him to his quarters from the moment they\u2019d come on board, and many of the soldiers he was standing in line with were the hastily assembled Alliance forces from various planets, including Earth. A fortunate thing, since even though he had the height of the Lycans, he didn\u2019t have their bulk. In this mixed force, however, he blended right in.</p><p>He pulled the helmet a little lower over his face anyway and shuffled slowly forward with the others as they took their places on board the ship. He couldn\u2019t help wondering what Lucas would do when he found him missing. He\u2019d be angry, of course, but maybe it would be a relief to him. What Kai was doing was an act of treason he couldn\u2019t very well ignore.</p><p>He\u2019d have an excuse now to put Kai aside and be released from his vows. Ryan, Jagger and Ethan had tried to tell him about the mating curse of the family, but Kai hadn\u2019t really believed it. Besides, Lucas didn\u2019t feel about Kai the way their mates felt about them. That much had always been obvious, even though the last few days before he\u2019d finally confessed his suspicions to Lucas had been...but no use to think of that now.</p><p>After Lucas left him that morning, it had finally become crystal clear to Kai what he had to do. He had to get down to the planet, find his mother and sister and warn them of the impending invasion. Lucas said they wouldn\u2019t destroy his planet, but he\u2019d heard stories about the Alliance aggression before he\u2019d come to Lycanus 3. If even half of what he\u2019d been told was true, he doubted his planet would survive, but at least he might be able to save his mother. He didn\u2019t\u2014he couldn\u2019t\u2014believe she had known about the children. If he could get to her before the main strike force landed, he might be able to help her escape and find sanctuary at some planet that was not in the Alliance.</p><p>Having made his plan, it had been simple enough to carry it through. When the soldier brought his breakfast tray an hour before, Kai had been waiting for him. He\u2019d hidden behind the door and struck him on the head with the slender iron bar from the closet used to hang up clothing. He\u2019d only stunned him, of course, but it gave him time to strip the man of his uniform, take his weapon and tie and gag him with strips he\u2019d torn from the sheets. He\u2019d left him there, locked in and made his way below decks without any challenges. Once he found the crowded locker room where the soldiers were changing into their combat gear, he\u2019d picked up a helmet and a jacket and blended in with the others. If his luck held out, he\u2019d be on the planet\u2019s surface before anyone even knew he was gone.</p> <p>Taking his seat on board with the others, he fastened the safety belt around him and then waited nervously for take-off.</p><p>\u201cThe transport is ready to launch, sir.\u201d</p><p>Lucas glanced up from his screen and nodded. \u201cGood. Give the signal.\u201dHe turned to Kyle and Nikolai. \u201cWell, looks like my talk with Kai will have to wait until this is over.\u201dHe turned back to the screen that showed the huge doors of the cargo bay slowly opening and the shuttle craft launching from its decks. It quickly cleared the ship and began making its way to the surface of the planet, while Communications opened a channel to the council. The face of a council representative quickly came into view.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. We\u2019ve received your hail and have dropped our shields to allow your shuttlecraft to enter our airspace. May we ask the nature of this visit?\u201d The woman looked angry, her face stiff and unyielding, but that was to be expected. The Scythians had never liked surprises. It was easy now to see why.</p><p>\u201cThe Alliance is conducting random surprise inspections of planets in the system. A new Alliance regulation, and we\u2019ll try to be as unobtrusive as possible. We\u2019ll need access to a few of your military facilities, of course, and the palace itself. \u201d Lucas kept his voice disinterested and slightly bored. He had no wish to tip their hand, if this was to fall into place the way he\u2019d planned.</p><p>\u201cNew regulation?\u201d The emissary raised one eyebrow. \u201cWe were not informed of this new regulation, or of this visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucas replied. \u201cSurprise inspections are not usually announced beforehand.\u201d</p><p>The Scythian\u2019s face turned red and her lips tightened, but she\u2019d been well trained. She managed to incline her head gracefully enough. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it that the queen is informed. \u201cShe is\u2014indisposed at the moment, however.\u201d</p><p>Indisposed? Having the baby that she planned to turn over to the priestesses? If so, they may be in time. \u201cHer presence won\u2019t be required,\u201d he said. \u201cThe inspection team will be landing momentarily, I believe. Please see to it they\u2019re given the access they require.\u201d</p><p>He cut off the transmission even as the woman was trying to formulate a reply, and turned to his cousins. \u201cSee to it that the commander of the landing force sends soldiers to both the palace and the temple as soon as they arrive. Inform him that the queen may just have given birth or be in the process now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d Nikolai said, turning away.</p><p>\u201cKyle, go below decks and make sure Kai is awake, please. I need to see if he knows how soon they turn the babies over to the damn temples after they\u2019re born and what the usual procedure would be. If there\u2019s any chance to save this baby, I want to make sure it doesn\u2019t slip through our fingers.\u201d</p><p>Lucas turned his attention back to the monitor showing the shuttlecraft landing on the planet. The doors opened quickly and the team, some hundred and twenty soldiers strong, began to jump down to the landing dock and disperse in several different directions. He watched them for a few moments, seeing them spreading out under the watchful and surprised eyes of the Scythian representatives. The cameras from the shuttlecraft showed land transports pulling up and the soldiers climbing in the backs.</p><p>His personal communication device beeped urgently and he picked it up, seeing Kyle\u2019s name on the screen. \u201cYes? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, it\u2019s Kai. He\u2019s\u2014missing. I found the soldier who brought him his breakfast this morning tied up on the floor of your quarters. Kai knocked him on the head when he came in this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucas shouted, rising to his feet. \u201cWhat are you talking about? How could he be missing?\u201d He touched a button on his console. \u201cComp, give me the location of Kai Balenescu.\u201d</p><p>The impersonal voice replied. \u201cKai Balenescu is not on board the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean he\u2019s not on board the ship?\u201d Lucas yelled futilely at the comp. Kyle came running into the room from below decks, his face blanched of color. Lucas whirled around to look at him blankly. \u201cHow could he not be on board the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shuttle,\u201d Kyle said hoarsely. \u201cHe took the guard\u2019s uniform.\u201d Kyle cast a wild glance down at the transport on the screen. \u201cLucas, he\u2019s on Scythia.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as they arrived on Scythia, Kai used the confusion of landing to cover his escape. Edging toward the end of the column of soldiers as they loaded the land transports, he ducked behind one of the trucks and made his way to the line of shuttle transports that always parked near the docks, hoping to pick up a paying fare from visitors to the planet. He slipped into the back seat of one at the back of the line, and held his weapon to the back of the driver\u2019s head. \u201cDrive me to the palace. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>The driver froze in place for a moment, then Kai saw her hand moving toward her communicator device. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d He nudged the gun into the back of the driver\u2019s head. \u201cTake me to the palace, I said. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Don\u2019t shoot.\u201d</p> <p>The woman, who didn\u2019t look Scythian\u2014probably an indentured slave\u2014put the vehicle in gear and pulled off rapidly, glancing at him continually through the rear-view mirror. Kai concentrated on the route she was taking, making sure she was taking the shortest possible route. When they arrived at the palace, he directed the driver around to the tradesman\u2019s entrance and waited while she lowered his window. He quickly punched in the code and shoved the barrel of the gun in the back of her head again to get her to move forward.</p><p>He directed the driver to the door he sometimes used when he went out hunting with the guards\u2014it was a side entrance that led directly to the kitchens. Often, as a boy, he\u2019d come in from a long day\u2019s hunt ravenously hungry and the palace cook, a friend of Merri\u2019s named Coova, had always given him sandwiches to help hold him off until dinner, clucking her tongue at his huge appetite and warning the princess she would soon get fat if she continued to eat so much.</p><p>He shook the old memories aside as they pulled up outside the door and turned to the driver, who was giving him baleful glares through the mirror. Kai leaned over her and jerked out the cord to the communicator on the dash. \u201cLook,\u201d he said to her. \u201cYou saw the soldiers landing, so you must know something is happening. Despite what you must think, I\u2019m not here to harm anyone. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, either, but you have to listen to me. I\u2019m here to help the queen. If you raise an alarm, someone will get hurt. More soldiers will be arriving soon, so the best thing you can do is get out of here.\u201d He looked her over carefully and saw that she was listening carefully to him. \u201cI can see that you\u2019re not Scythian, so you probably have little reason to be loyal to them. Go home and help your family. Stay inside until this is over.\u201d</p><p>He got out of the transport quickly. There was nothing he could do to stop her from raising an alarm, but he hoped his words had been enough to frighten her into leaving quickly and going home. If not, he had his weapon, and he was prepared to do whatever it took to get him to his mother.</p><p>Running to the door, he opened it with the use of another code and ducked inside. For a moment, no one reacted in the bustling kitchen and then a woman cooking something on the big stove next to him gave a start and a little scream. He grabbed her around the neck and pulled her back into him, holding his weapon to her head. The others froze at the sight, giving distressed little whimpers and backing away from him. \u201cNo one move. I\u2019m not here to hurt anyone, but I will if I have to. Where\u2019s Coova?\u201d</p> <p>A surprised grunt from the back of the room and then the tall, portly woman stepped forward, wiping her hands on an apron. \u201cI\u2019m Coova. What do you want here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>She walked closer to Kai, hesitating only a little. \u201cLet her go,\u201d she said, nodding at the woman Kai still held in his arms. \u201cShe won\u2019t cause any problems, will you, Hilva?\u201d</p><p>The woman, clearly terrified, shook her head wildly, and Kai released her. Coova pulled the woman behind her and stood bravely facing Kai, her eyes sharp and angry.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and how dare you burst into my kitchen this way?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Kai took a step closer and pushed back his helmet to expose his forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s Kai, Coova. Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</p> <p>Her hand flying to her throat, Coova took an involuntary step backwards, her mouth flying open. \u201cBut...but how? How are you here? Why are you dressed like that? Your hair. Your voice...\u201d</p><p>Kai held out a hand to her, palm up. \u201cI know, Coova. It must be shocking. But it\u2019s me\u2014Kai.\u201dHe changed his voice, using the soft falsetto he\u2019d used for the past few years he\u2019d lived in the palace. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goddess,\u201d she said, touching her head and then her chin in the sign of the old religion. \u201cIt is you. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time to explain, Coova, but you have to help me. The Alliance soldiers are coming for my mother. I have to save her, Coova. Please help me.\u201d</p><p>She started and then blinked at him rapidly for a long moment, but seemed to gather herself, straightening her shoulders. She inclined her head. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help you, Princess. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>Barking orders at her staff to keep quiet and tell no one of what was happening, she motioned for Kai to follow her and led him to the servants\u2019 stairway. She whispered fiercely to him as she led him up the dark, narrow stairs. \u201cYour mother is in Queen Delanon\u2019s chambers. She had her child this morning, and the last I heard they were-they were waiting for the high priestess to arrive. You\u2019d have heard about the child, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded, his face a grim mask. \u201cThe priestess hasn\u2019t arrived, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the last I heard. I was preparing tea for the queen to help her regain her strength, and no one indicated the need for an extra service.\u201d They had come to the hallway outside the queen\u2019s bedchamber, and Coova put a finger to her lips. She motioned for Kai to hide himself in the shadows of the doorway across the corridor and then eased open the door. Kai could hear soft sounds of weeping from inside the room, and watched as Coova motioned to someone inside to come to the door.</p> <p>Moments later, Merrial\u2019s tear-stained face poked around the edge of the door. \u201cWhat is it, Coova? This is not a good time. \u201d</p><p>Coova reached around the door and yanked Merrial by the arm. She sputtered and fussed as she was pulled out to the corridor. \u201cGods, Coova, can\u2019t it wait? What on Scythia do you mean by this interruption...\u201d She glanced up in alarm as Kai moved out from the shadows, backing away, her hand going to her throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Merrial. It\u2019s Kai,\u201d he said, pulling off the helmet and stepping out of the shadows.</p><p>Merrial\u2019s eyes grew impossibly wide and she put a hand to her heart. \u201cKai! What are you doing here? How can this be possible?\u201d She stepped closer to pull him in her arms and then held him at arm\u2019s length, staring at him in dismay. \u201cBut what has that horrid man done to you? Your beautiful hair!\u201d</p><p>Kai pulled away from her. \u201cIt\u2019s not important, Merrial. You have to listen to me. Go get my mother and bring her here. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>Before Merrial could move, the door behind her swung wide and Delanon herself stood framed in the doorway, her cruel eyes glittering at him. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, I think. Come in, sister. I think you and our mother have some explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>Lucas was silent on the way to the palace. The presence of Kyle and Nikolai on either side of him in the transport normally would have been a comfort to him, but he was too firmly focused on holding himself together at the moment.</p><p>Someone\u2014his mind shied away from the idea of its being Kai\u2014had warned the Scythians of their intent, and there had already been some minor skirmishes near the primary temple. So far there had been no casualties and resistance had been surprisingly light. Their satellites had picked up signs of a large resistance force gathering near the palace, but from all appearances, it was disorganized and somewhat chaotic. No one had even given the order to raise the planet\u2019s shields, so the remainder of the strike force was already on the ground. The invasion promised to be a complete rout.</p><p>In a few minutes, they\u2019d be there and able to engage whatever was left of the Scythian forces. Was Kai involving himself in this resistance? Was it possible that he could soon be facing his own mate in battle? The idea of Kai being hurt or even\u2014no, his mind refused to go in that direction, totally shutting out the possibility. He\u2019d given orders to his men to make locating Kai and returning him unharmed a top priority, and he was currently on his way to make sure those orders were carried out.</p><p>He was so angry\u2014make that enraged\u2014that Kai had put himself in such a position that his mind could barely hold any other thoughts, especially the idea that he, himself, was mainly responsible for this cluster fuck they now found themselves involved in.</p><p>As Nikolai had pointed out earlier, he\u2019d mishandled Kai from the very beginning, certainly not inspiring any trust, let alone love in the boy. At first, he\u2019d let his own fucking pride get in the way. And then, after promising Kai over and over again that he could confide in him and that he\u2019d understand anything Kai told him, he\u2019d callously broken that promise, even as late as the night before. He heard Kai\u2019s voice echoing even now in his head. You hate me, don\u2019t you Lucas? I can see it in your eyes. I\u2019ve really lost everything, haven\u2019t I?</p><p>Rather than taking Kai in his arms and making sure he knew he\u2019d never leave him, never stop loving him, Lucas had fucked him and walked out the door, letting his stubborn anger and pride get the better of him once again. He\u2019d even told Kai to bottle up his emotions, like he did, in order to be a real man. Don\u2019t cry. Men don\u2019t cry, Kai, even if their whole world is falling apart.</p><p>If anything happened to Kai because of his actions, because of his stupid pride, he wouldn\u2019t be able to live with this crushing guilt he was feeling. He\u2019d die without Kai\u2014worst of all, he\u2019d deserve to.</p><p>Kyle leaned over and spoke quietly in his ear. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived. Let me get out and talk to the strike force commander on the ground. See what he knows.\u201d</p><p>Though it was excruciating, Lucas nodded and waited the few minutes it took for Kyle to come back. They had followed the transmission coming from the chip in Kai\u2019s arm, and traced him to this area. He must be inside the palace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jumping back on board, Kyle came immediately to Lucas\u2019s side. \u201cSo far, there\u2019s been no sign of Kai, but the queen and the dowager are inside the palace. The army on the palace grounds is not as well-organized as we\u2019d feared. The ground commander is negotiating with their leader now for a total surrender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny sightings of Kai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.The Scythian leader claimed she hadn\u2019t seen him, but said there\u2019d been reports from some of the staff that Kai could be inside the palace with the queen. Some of the palace kitchen staff apparently saw him going up to her rooms.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas surged to his feet, ripping at his clothes, unable to hold the shift at bay any longer. He felt his wolf spring eagerly forward and saw that Nikolai and Kyle followed his lead.</p><p>Leaping off the back of the land transport, the three Lycans rushed through the gates of the palace grounds, the strike force falling in behind them with many of the Lycans tearing off their uniforms and shifting to their wolves as well. Moving at an incredible speed, Lucas raced toward the palace, aware of the Scythian army falling fearfully away in front of him and making no effort to hold him and his cousins back.</p><p>Once he burst through the palace doors, Lucas followed his nose, able to pick out his mate\u2019s strong scent clearly, even inside this huge structure. Racing to the second floor, he caught the scent even stronger in the upstairs corridor. Kai must have come this way only a short time before. The scent led to a set of double doors halfway down the hallway. The three Lycans burst easily through the locked doors, but had to duck quickly as shots rang out. The bullets from the weapon hit the wall above their heads and embedding themselves in the wood above the door.</p><p>A confusion of shouting as they skidded to a stop, crouching over, and then Lucas looked up wildly and saw who had shot at him.It was Kai, standing protectively in front of his mother, holding out one of the soldier\u2019s weapons. He had a small cradle behind him, and he was pointing the Alliance weapon straight at Lucas\u2019s chest. Lucas straightened slowly, making all his moves deliberate and easy, not wishing to startle him into firing again. Kai stared directly at him, his eyes wide and scared.</p><p>\u201cKai,\u201d Lucas tried to say in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d As the words fell on the charged air around him, he realized his voice was too deep and garbled with the extra teeth in his mouth. Lucas and his cousins stood up, panting heavily for a moment that seemed to stretch out impossibly long. With a hoarse growl, Lucas forced the shift back on himself and stood in front of Kai, naked, his chest heaving. Kai\u2019s eyes were round with fright, but he held the weapon steadily on Lucas.</p> <p>Kai\u2019s sister, Delanon, was standing beside him, supporting herself by holding onto the bed. Her long, white gown was stained with blood, confirming Lucas\u2019s suspicions that she had only recently given birth. Lucas was vaguely aware of several others in the room, most of them falling away to press themselves against the walls, but he couldn\u2019t spare any of them any attention. All of it was focused on Kai.</p><p>Kai shook the gun at him. \u201cGet back, Lucas. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to use that on me again, Kai?\u201d Lucas managed to say, his voice still a bit harsh and raspy.</p><p>\u201cNot unless I have to,\u201d Kai said, lifting his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. Please don\u2019t make me, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me then. Can you kill me, Kai? I wonder,\u201d he said, taking a step forward. \u201cTry for the heart when you shoot me, so it\u2019ll be quick. Mine is here, baby,\u201d he said, pointing low on his chest. \u201cA little different than yours.\u201d</p><p>Kai trembled, the gun wavering in his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please Lucas, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t let you go. I have to take your mother and your sister until we get this straightened out. I promise you they\u2019ll get a fair hearing. No one will hurt either of them\u2014do you believe me?\u201d He took another step closer and Delanon hissed a warning at Kai.</p><p>\u201cShoot him, damn you. My guards will take care of the rest and we can make it to my private transport. We can get away, Kai, if you shoot him!\u201d</p><p>Kai glanced over at her and then back at Lucas. \u201cGive me the gun, baby,\u201d Lucas said softly. \u201cCan you really kill me?\u201d</p><p>Kai held his gaze for another moment before he crumpled in defeat, dropping his arm. \u201cNo, no, I can\u2019t.\u201d He turned his face toward his mother. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mama. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can\u2019t, but I can,\u201d Delanon said, raising a small gun and leveling it straight at Lucas. She\u2019d been holding the weapon down by her side, between the folds of her long gown and the foot of the bed, so Lucas had never even seen it with all his focus on Kai. She leveled it on him and Lucas braced himself for the bullet, knowing he couldn\u2019t reach her in time to save himself.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kai screamed and leaped on his sister, who\u2019d been standing only a few steps away from him. He knocked the barrel of the gun upward, and as it fired into the ceiling, he wrenched the gun away from her. She fell back on the bed, but she wasn\u2019t done yet. The birthing knife used by the midwives to cut the cord had been discarded on a table by the bed. Delanon rolled toward it, seized this knife, and then drew back her arm to leap for Kai, screaming mostly incoherent words of hatred and jealousy.</p><p>Lucas jumped for him too, but Kai\u2019s mother got there first, and Delanon\u2019s blade plunged deep into her chest. Lucas heard Kai\u2019s hoarse shout of horror as he grabbed for his mother, but Lucas reached him first. Pulling Kai into his arms, he shielded him while Kyle and Nikolai subdued his sister. By the time they were secured, and Lucas was able to let Kai go, his mother was gasping out her final breaths and died in Kai\u2019s arms.</p><p>In the chaos that followed, Delanon and her guards were led from the room by some of the Alliance soldiers who had finally caught up with the three Balenescus. Unable to even look at the bitch who\u2019d tried to kill Kai, Lucas had given the orders over his shoulder, looking down at a sobbing Kai.</p> <p>\u201cTake her to a bedroom somewhere and allow her these women to attend her,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the women who must have been the midwives, their backs still pressed to the wall. \u201cKyle, go with them and see it\u2019s done properly. Just because they\u2019re barbarians doesn\u2019t mean we are, and she just had a child. Take the guards outside with the rest.\u201d</p><p>Merrial stepped up beside him and curtsied. \u201cSir, might I be allowed to take the child somewhere and find a wet nurse for the little mite?\u201d</p><p>Lucas hesitated, but leaned over and asked Kai if it was safe to let the woman take the baby and he nodded, still unable to raise his head. Lucas turned back to her. \u201cAll right.Take him, but not too far. Keep him here in the palace and I\u2019ll send a guard with you.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped the baby in a blanket and left, touching Kai on the shoulder and leaning over to murmur something softly to him. When she\u2019d gone, leaving only Kai, Lucas and Nikolai, Lucas put his hand on Kai\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe need to put your mother on the bed, Kai.\u201d He nodded and moved out of the way while Lucas and Nikolai arranged the body on the bed and covered her with the sheet.</p><p>Kai sat down on the bed beside her, and Lucas bent down next to him. Wrapping his arms around his waist, he rocked Kai gently in his arms while he grieved silently. When the Alliance doctors came in, Lucas helped Kai to his feet, had a quiet word with the doctors and then pulled Kai gently from the room.</p><p>It was only then that Lucas realized he and Nikolai were both still completely naked. Kai saw them notice and jerked his head to a room a few doors down. \u201cThat\u2019s my old room. I probably still have some leggings in there or maybe some robes.\u201d</p><p>Lucas and Nikolai grinned at each other over his head. Nikolai headed down the hallway to the room. \u201cSome robes maybe,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cDefinitely no leggings, though. These Scythian women simply aren\u2019t ready for that.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled and tightened his arm around Kai. Kai looked up at Lucas and then glanced away quickly. \u201cWill they put me in a room like Delanon or will they send me to the dungeons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t sending you anywhere. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d Lucas pulled him close and whispered in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted, Kai. I have so much to tell you, to explain to you, if you\u2019ll let me. Come on, love, let me take you home.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Lycanus 3, First Month, 2258 CE</p><p>Lucas held the baby on his lap while he played with Lucas\u2019s fingers, putting one knuckle solemnly in his mouth and sucking it. Lucas smiled down at him, and pulled him closer to his chest. Even though he was just Kai\u2019s nephew, he still looked so much like him.</p><p>They had just returned from his naming ceremony, performed when a Lycan child was into his sixth quarter cycle, and now Ashton Balenescu sat in his father\u2019s lap while his other father was in the kitchen with Ryan and Ethan, preparing a family luncheon. The little windiga, Merri, lay at their feet, totally in the way, hoping to scoop up any scraps that might fall.</p><p>Blayde sat down beside Lucas, plucking the baby neatly away, plopping him down in his lap, and placing a kiss on the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou and Ryan should adopt your own,\u201d Lucas said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ryan and I travel too much. I\u2019ll just spoil my nephew,\u201d he said, holding the baby up in the air and making funny faces at him while the baby stared down delightedly at him.</p><p>\u201cHe just had a bottle, so if he throws up all over you, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d Lucas told him and then laughed when Blayde quickly lowered Ashton back to his lap.</p><p>Konnor sat across from them and glanced over at Ethan, who was in the kitchen helping Kai prepare lunch. \u201cKai said there might be more babies coming up for adoption soon. Ethan and I have thought about adopting one of them. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly recommend it,\u201d Lucas said, pulling the baby back into his own lap. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll still have to have a Lycan surrogate give Ashton a little brother one day, but you can see what beautiful babies these Scythians produce.\u201d He glanced over at Kai when he said it, and received a warm smile in return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBaby, you and Ethan stop fussing with that and come over here. Blayde and Konnor are perfectly capable of working a food processor, and if they\u2019re not, they deserve to go hungry.\u201d</p><p>Blayde stole the baby back and danced out of reach when Lucas made a grab for him. \u201cI\u2019m taking him out to the pool for a little swim with Ryan and me. C\u2019mon Konnor, Ethan, let\u2019s throw the baby in the pool and see if we can teach him how to do the Lycan backstroke,\u201d he said, teasing Lucas.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, very funny. Put his hat on when you get him outside\u2014I don\u2019t want him to get too much sun. Use the sunscreen.\u201d</p> <p>Blayde waved a dismissive hand at him and carried the baby out toward the pool, tossing him up in the air as he went. Ashton\u2019s delighted laughter was the only thing that kept Lucas on the sofa.</p><p>Kai sank down beside him. \u201cYou know he only does that to irritate you,\u201d he said, poking him in the side.</p><p>\u201cWell, it worked.\u201d</p><p>Kai settled himself against Lucas\u2019s side. \u201cAshton\u2019s already spoiled by you people. When you\u2019re at work, he expects me to sit around and hold him all day like you do.\u201d</p><p>Lucas pulled Kai over into his lap and smiled down at him while he blushed and tried to get away.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t hurt you to hold him a little. He misses his father.\u201d</p><p>Kai pushed at his chest, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m too big to sit in your lap, Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said and leaned him back in his arms to give him a proper kiss, his hands straying down beneath the waistband of Kai\u2019s pants. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a very good thing you didn\u2019t turn out to be a female\u2014I\u2019d have kept you breeding all the time.\u201d</p><p>Kai punched him in the chest and pushed again to get away, but Lucas held on tightly. Still laughing, Kai subsided in his arms. \u201cAre you going to hold me all day too, like you do with Ashton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d let me, I would. I came too close to losing you, baby. I\u2019ve been working hard to earn your forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Kai got very quiet, and played with the buttons on Lucas\u2019s shirt. \u201cI do forgive you, though for a long time...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lucas said somberly. \u201cI have to win your trust. I realize it\u2019ll take a while.\u201d</p><p>Kai shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, so much, though I did think for a long time that you never loved me. I knew you liked the sex between us, but I didn\u2019t think you loved me. Part of that was the way I was brought up\u2014to think that who I was made me unlovable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been lovable. The fact that ignorant people made you feel you weren\u2019t was always their problem, not yours. The Scythians let a narrow, cruel view of religion make half their people feel like defective throwaways. And the priestesses\u2014the very ones who should have been teaching their people were the ones who were leading the charge. It still makes me sick to think of how many lives were destroyed because of them.\u201d</p><p>Kai looked thoughtful, staring down at his hands on Lucas\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat about my sister? I haven\u2019t even asked since we got home. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t care, but I couldn\u2019t-couldn\u2019t bear to think of her. And the priestesses? What will happen to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now the temples have been closed and all the priestesses involved in the murders are in prison awaiting trial. Your sister is in prison too, honey, and I think they\u2019ll all be found guilty and have to face the judgment of the Alliance Council. That will probably mean life imprisonment on one of the prison planets, at the very least.\u201d</p><p>Kai nodded and sighed. \u201cShe was so angry, all her life. I don\u2019t think she ever loved anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this was ever your fault, Kai. I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life trying to make you realize that and how wonderful you are. If I\u2019d lost you...\u201d His voice broke and he pressed his lips to Kai\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Kai said, pulling back to look into his eyes. \u201cBut I still think you need to make it up to me for a long, long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen that\u2019s just what I\u2019ll do,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cStarting right now.\u201d</p><p>*THE END* </p> </body></html>"]
