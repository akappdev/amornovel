Except Dash. She knew without confirming that he\u2019d be here, just as he\u2019d been here on this day for the previous two years, waiting to take her to the cemetery to visit and put fresh flowers on her husband\u2019s grave.</p><p>The flowers were on the counter beside her, just waiting for her to pick up and carry out of the house. But she hesitated, because this year . . . This year was different. She was apprehensive and yet resolved.</p><p>She had to move on with her life. She had to let go. It hurt, and yet at the same time, it brought her a measure of relief, as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders. It was time. All she had left to do was visit Carson\u2019s grave and make peace with her decision.</p> <p>She smoothed her shirt and ran her hands down the legs of her jeans. Not what she normally wore to the cemetery on the anniversary of her husband\u2019s burial. In the last two years, she\u2019d worn black. It hadn\u2019t seemed respectful to go casual, as if the visit wasn\u2019t that important.</p><p>But she also knew that Carson wouldn\u2019t want her to live like this. He\u2019d want her to be happy. And it wouldn\u2019t have made him happy to know she still mourned him so deeply.</p><p>With a sigh, she applied a light gloss to her lips and quickly fastened her long hair into a ponytail, leaving part of it loose in a messy bun.</p><p>This was the real Joss. Not fussy. More comfortable in jeans and a casual shirt than the expensive dresses and jewelry her husband had loved to spoil her with. Only underneath her clothing did she wear the sexy lingerie her husband had so loved to see her in.</p><p>She closed her eyes, refusing to look back, to remember how it felt when he touched her. How his hands moved over her body, knowing it better than she knew it herself. He knew exactly how to please her, how to touch her, kiss her, make love to her.</p> <p>He\u2019d given her everything she could have ever wanted. His love. His respect. Everything but the one thing she needed most, and it was something she could have never asked him for. She\u2019d loved him too much to ever demand of him something he couldn\u2019t give her.</p><p>She shook away the heavy veil of sadness, determined to get through the day and on with her life. Her new life.</p><p>She picked up the flowers, her favorite, and brought them to her nose, closing her eyes as she inhaled. They were what Carson always gave her. Every birthday. Every anniversary. Or any time just because. Today she\u2019d place them on his grave and walk away. This time for good.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to see the cold slab of marble that marked his life and death to remind her of her husband. That wasn\u2019t the way she wanted to remember him. She was through torturing herself by standing over his grave, missing him with her every breath.</p><p>He\u2019d live in her heart and soul always. That was where she\u2019d visit him in the future. Not on the grassy knoll that covered the casket underneath.</p><p>She walked briskly to the front door, letting herself out and blinking against the sudden wash of sun. Though it was spring, the Houston weather was already warm and she was glad she\u2019d worn the short-sleeved T-shirt instead of the black dress she always wore.</p> <p>And there was Dash, leaning against his car, waiting for her as she knew he would be. He straightened when he saw her, and she saw a brief flicker of surprise before he schooled his features and extended a hand to her.</p><p>She slid her fingers over his and he gave her hand a light squeeze. No words were necessary. They both grieved the loss of her husband and his best friend.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely, Joss,\u201d Dash said as he walked her around to the passenger side.</p><p>She smiled, knowing she didn\u2019t look particularly lovely today. And he was likely surprised by her casual appearance, but he didn\u2019t remark on it. He took the flowers and carefully positioned them in the back so they wouldn\u2019t fall over, and then closed her door after ensuring she was fully inside.</p><p>She watched him stride around the front of the car, his long legs eating up the distance in a matter of seconds. Then he slid into the driver\u2019s seat and his scent wafted through her nostrils.</p><p>Dash always smelled the same. Utterly masculine, though she knew he never wore cologne or aftershave. He was a no-frills kind of guy, much like Carson had been, though her husband had worn expensive clothing and even his casual wear was tailored to fit his personality.</p><p>Even Dash\u2019s car fit his personality. A sleek black Jaguar. How appropriate he drove a vehicle named for a predator. He fit the part well.</p><p>They\u2019d been partners in business, but Carson had always been the front man. The one who wined and dined clients, the polished spokesman, the one who sealed the deals, attended all the social events while Dash worked behind the scenes. The closer. The one who always did most of the legwork and fixed the problems.</p> <p>Carson had often laughed and said he was the looks and charm and Dash was the brains of the operation. But Dash was certainly not lacking in looks or charm. They were the complete antithesis of one another. Carson was fair-haired to Dash\u2019s dark brown, and while Carson\u2019s eyes were blue, Dash\u2019s were a deep brown, enhanced by his darker coloring. He wasn\u2019t any less attractive than Carson. His was just a quieter attractiveness. Silent. Brooding almost. He had made Joss nervous back when she\u2019d first met him when she and Carson had dated. Theirs had been a whirlwind courtship. Carson had swept her off her feet, and Joss had known that Dash was concerned that his friend was getting in way over his head. Moving too fast. The fact Joss knew that had made her wary of Dash, but over time, he\u2019d become her rock. Especially after Carson had died.</p><p>As they drove out of Joss\u2019s exclusive subdivision, Dash reached over for her hand, lacing his fingers through hers, and as he\u2019d done before, he squeezed lightly, a gesture of reassurance.</p><p>Joss turned and smiled at him, telling him without words that she was okay. As they stopped at a red light, Dash studied her intently, almost as if he were trying to decipher what was different about her.</p><p>Evidently satisfied with whatever he\u2019d seen in her eyes or expression, he smiled back, but he kept hold of her hand as he navigated through traffic on the way to the cemetery, just a few miles from where Joss and Carson had lived.</p><p>They drove in comfortable silence, but then they\u2019d never conversed much on the day Dash drove her to the cemetery every year. Oh, Joss visited at other times, but Dash always accompanied her on the anniversary.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the only time she saw Dash. He\u2019d stepped in from the moment Carson had passed away and he\u2019d been her rock ever since. That first year especially, she\u2019d needed him desperately and he never hesitated, no matter what she needed, whether it was help deciphering the paperwork and red tape after her husband\u2019s death or simply coming over to keep her company on the days she felt herself falling apart.</p><p>She would be forever grateful for Dash and his unwavering support over the last three years, but it was time to move on. It was time for her to stand on her own two feet and it was time for Dash to stop having to babysit her.</p><p>Today was not only about her letting go of Carson, but of Dash as well. He deserved more than to be saddled with the responsibility of his best friend\u2019s widow. He had a life of his own. She had no idea of his relationships or if he was even in a steady relationship. She realized with sudden clarity just how selfish and self-absorbed she\u2019d been since her husband\u2019s death. Dash had been a steady fixture, one she\u2019d taken for granted, but she would do it no longer. It would be a miracle if Dash were in a steady relationship because not many women would be tolerant of Dash dropping everything to rush to the aid of his best friend\u2019s widow.</p><p>When they arrived at the cemetery, Dash parked and Joss immediately got out, not waiting for him to come around for her. She opened the door to the backseat and leaned in to retrieve the flowers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them, Joss.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s low voice brushed over her ears, causing a prickle at her nape. She picked up the vase and turned with a reassuring smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Dash. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an inscrutable stare and she got the impression he was studying her again, trying to peel back the layers and get into her head. It was as if he knew something was different but couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. Which was just as well, because Joss would die if Dash could read her thoughts. If he knew just what it was she\u2019d planned and how she intended to move on with her life.</p><p>He\u2019d be horrified, no doubt. He\u2019d wonder if she\u2019d finally snapped and he\u2019d probably haul her into a shrink\u2019s office so fast it would make her head spin. Which was why she had no intention of letting him know.</p><p>Her girlfriends were another matter. Chessy would understand absolutely. She\u2019d even be encouraging. Kylie . . . not so much.</p><p>Kylie was Joss\u2019s sister-in-law, Carson\u2019s only sibling. They\u2019d both grown up in horrific circumstances, and just as Carson could never provide what Joss craved\u2014needed\u2014neither would Kylie ever understand what drove Joss.</p><p>She might even be angry with Joss\u2019s choices. Might think it was a betrayal of her brother. Joss could only hope she\u2019d support Joss even if she didn\u2019t fully understand.</p><p>But she was getting ahead of herself. First the cemetery and talking to Carson one last time. Then she\u2019d tackle her best friends over lunch. She needed as much as possible to keep busy today, because tonight?</p><p>Tonight was when it all began.</p><p>Joss waited for the betraying sting of tears as they neared Carson\u2019s grave. But oddly, she felt at peace for the first time in three long years. Yes, it was time.</p><p>She knelt and gently brushed away the leaves and dust at the base of the headstone before setting the vase of flowers in the middle. Her gaze drifted upward to the inscription. The reminder of Carson\u2019s birth and death.</p><p>Her finger slowly traced the words. Beloved husband, brother and best friend. Those words said it all. A reminder of those left behind who mourned him still. She\u2019d insisted that Dash be honored on the headstone, as he was every bit as much family as herself and Kylie. She only wished they\u2019d had children so his legacy and memory would live on through them.</p><p>But as with any young couple, they\u2019d thought they had all the time in the world. Carson was apprehensive about having children. He feared that he shared the same genetic traits that his father had possessed. No matter how many times Joss had gently reminded him that he was nothing like his father, Carson still lived in fear of hurting those he loved the most.</p><p>She understood his fear. She knew how much he loved her. She also knew he\u2019d die before ever hurting her or any children they had. But the darkness of his past still overshadowed his present. The past still haunted his dreams at night. Though Kylie, his sister, hadn\u2019t spoken of it often, Joss knew that Kylie had the same nightmares that Carson had. That she shared many of the same sleepless nights Carson experienced.</p><p>A wave of sadness overtook Joss. Such a waste. Carson\u2019s father had destroyed the lives of two innocent children. Worse, he lived on well into their adulthood, influencing their choices, always living in their fears even though he was dead. He still held them in his grasp from the grave, his memory and the memories of all he did torturing them still.</p><p>\u201cJoss?\u201d</p><p>Dash softly called her name, breaking through her thoughts, and she realized just how long she\u2019d knelt there at the base of the monument, tracing the inscription with her fingers.</p><p>He sounded worried and a little uncertain, and Dash was never nothing if not sure of himself.</p><p>She turned, tilting her head up so her gaze connected with Dash\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment, please. Wait for me at the car if you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll only take a few minutes and then I\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Again, surprise flickered in Dash\u2019s eyes. Never before had she asked to be left alone at Carson\u2019s grave. It had been too difficult, too emotional. Dash had always remained at her side, steady and strong, her rock to lean on. He\u2019d stayed with her as long as she wanted to remain and then he\u2019d take her back to the car and back home, where he\u2019d spend the rest of the afternoon sitting with her as she cried on his shoulder.</p><p>Not today. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d he said hesitantly.</p><p>She nodded firmly, making sure no tears threatened. She wasn\u2019t going to unravel in front of him. She\u2019d been doing that far too long.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he conceded. \u201cTake your time, honey. I\u2019ve arranged to take the entire day off.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Of course he would have. But she didn\u2019t intend for him to spend it with her as he\u2019d done in the past. There was too much to get done before tonight. And she didn\u2019t want to chance breaking her resolve and confiding in Dash. Not only was it not appropriate, but he would most certainly not approve. He\u2019d think she\u2019d lost her damn mind.</p><p>And maybe she had. Or perhaps she was just getting it back.</p><p>She turned back as Dash headed toward the car and then pushed herself upward to stand over the grave. She stared down, her jaw tight, locking down her emotions for the conversation she intended to have with her husband.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know,\u201d she said, almost as if he were standing there in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you, Carson. But I want you to know I\u2019m going to move on. Try to move on,\u201d she amended. \u201cStarting tonight. I know there were . . . things . . . you couldn\u2019t give me. And I want you to know I never resented you for that. God, I loved you far too much to ever expect you to give me something it was impossible for you to give.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re gone now.\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked as she said the last, and she swallowed back the surge of tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lonely, Carson. I miss you so much. Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t miss you. You were so good to me. The love of my life. I know I\u2019ll never find that again. Finding perfection once in a lifetime is incredible. But twice? No, I know there\u2019ll never be another for me like you. But there are things I . . . need,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThings you couldn\u2019t give me. Things I\u2019d never ask you for. And I wanted to come here today to tell you. To say that I wouldn\u2019t be back. Not because I don\u2019t love you or that I\u2019m going to forget you. But this isn\u2019t what I want my memory of you to be. I want to remember you in life. And us in love. And it\u2019s too painful for me to come here and talk to you, knowing that I\u2019ll never get you back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a deep breath and forged ahead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a place that specializes in . . . dominance. I need to know if it\u2019s what I\u2019m missing. If it\u2019s always been what I\u2019m missing. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answer. Maybe I won\u2019t. But I have to try. I have to know. And I couldn\u2019t go without telling you. Without explaining that I never lacked for anything when we were married. I never doubted even for a moment that you loved me, and you would have given me the moon if I asked. But this . . . This I couldn\u2019t ask you for. And right now I need something to fill the void. There\u2019s a hole in my soul, Carson. One that I may never fill again. But right now I\u2019d take even a bandage. Temporary solace, if you will. I just wanted you to know. I\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m not going into a dangerous situation. I\u2019ve made certain that I\u2019ll be safe. And as painful as it is for me to say this, I\u2019m finally letting you go. I\u2019ve held on to you for too long now. I can\u2019t do it anymore. Life is happening around me. Life goes on. That sounds so trite, doesn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s true. Chessy and Tate worry for me. Kylie worries. And Dash. God, I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t washed his hands of me yet. I\u2019ve been such a burden to him\u2014to them all\u2014these last three years and I don\u2019t want to be that woman any longer.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me the confidence and independence to fly. I want that back again, Carson. You taught me so much. You gave me the world. The problem is when you left, you took my world with you. And I want it back again. I want to live and not be this hollow shell of myself that I\u2019ve been since you died.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a steadying breath, knowing what she said next was dumb. But she had to get it off her chest. Say it and then let go of the nagging emotion.</p> <p>\u201cI also want to tell you that I forgive you. I know that sounds so stupid. You don\u2019t need my forgiveness. But I was so angry with you for so long for leaving me. I was so selfish. I\u2019ve spent three years being angry and resentful, and starting today, I\u2019m not going to be that person anymore.\u201d</p><p>She let her hand drift down to glide across the sun-warmed marble of the headstone.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I miss you. I\u2019ll always love you. But good-bye, Carson. Wherever you are, I hope you\u2019re at peace and I hope you know how very much I loved you. Thank you for loving me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as tears gathered and she didn\u2019t reopen them until she was certain she could return to the car where Dash waited without looking like she\u2019d fallen apart.</p><p>With one last glance at the grave and the flowers that had already lost a few petals to the wind, she turned, squared her shoulders and walked away. The wind picked up and the sun broke further through the clouds, shining down on her face. She turned her face upward, soaking in the warmth as peace enveloped her in its gentle embrace. It was as if Carson were sending her a message, or perhaps she only imagined him blessing her decision.</p> <p>Dash held the door open for her, his gaze fixed on her face as if he were trying to ascertain her mood. She was careful to keep herself from showing any outward emotion. Because what she would say next she was certain he would object to, and if he thought she was upset, he\u2019d never leave her alone the rest of the day.</p><p>She waited until he was behind the wheel and they were driving away before she turned to him.</p><p>\u201cI have lunch plans today, so you don\u2019t have to stay with me. And I have plans for tonight as well,\u201d she murmured, letting him make of that what he would.</p><p>Dash\u2019s brow furrowed, and he made no effort to hide his concern. He reached for her hand as they stopped at a light.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you, honey?\u201d</p><p>His tone was worried and his eyes were boring intently into hers.</p> <p>She gave him a half smile. \u201cI\u2019m having lunch with Kylie and Chessy. It\u2019s time I stop with the grieving widow act every year on the same day. It\u2019s been three years, Dash. He\u2019s gone and he\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>She halted a moment, the pain of her statement momentarily stealing her breath. But it had to be said. To be acknowledged. And perhaps saying it aloud made it that much more real.</p><p>She could swear she saw relief flash in his deep brown eyes, but it was gone so quickly she was sure she imagined it.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to come over after you have lunch with the girls?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not necessary, Dash. You\u2019ve babysat me for long enough. It\u2019s time for me to stand on my own two feet. I\u2019m sure it has to come as a relief to you that you don\u2019t have to hover over me for fear I\u2019ll lose it. I\u2019m just sorry I\u2019ve been such a burden to you for so long.\u201d</p><p>This time a glint of anger flashed in those dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not a burden, damn it. Carson was my best friend, Joss. He\u2014and you\u2014mean a hell of a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand as he accelerated after a car behind them honked angrily when Dash didn\u2019t immediately go when the light turned green.</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate that. I appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me. But it\u2019s time, Dash. I have to do this. He\u2019s gone. I have to accept that.\u201d</p> <p>Dash didn\u2019t respond. He directed his gaze forward, tension thick in the interior of the car. Had she angered him? She\u2019d only been honest, and she\u2019d sincerely thought he would be glad that he no longer had to treat her like a fragile piece of glass. That he could resume his own life without making her a priority in his.</p><p>When they arrived back at her house, she got out, as did Dash. He walked her to the door and she went in, turning back to tell him thank you and good-bye.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t good-bye,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cJust because you think you no longer need me doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to just disappear. Prepare yourself for that, Joss.\u201d</p><p>With that, he spun on his heel and strode back down the sidewalk, leaving her staring open-mouthed as he drove away.</p><p>TWO</p><p>JOSS zipped into the parking lot of the Lux Caf\u00e9 on Westheimer and parked her BMW roadster next to Kylie\u2019s silver Mercedes coupe. The car had been a gift to Kylie from Carson on her twenty-first birthday, just one year before he\u2019d been in the fatal car accident that had taken him from both his wife and his sister.</p><p>Carson and Joss had gone to Las Vegas frequently. Carson loved to gamble and he\u2019d taught Joss how to play all manner of casino games. He\u2019d even sharpened her poker skills enough that she\u2019d become a formidable opponent at the tables. Carson had always chuckled when her winnings topped his own, though she refused to play at the same table as him because his competitive streak was such that he didn\u2019t like to lose. Even to his wife.</p><p>Their favorite place to stay was the Venetian, where Joss had discovered the Lux Caf\u00e9 and all the wonderful food on the menu. She\u2019d been delighted when one had opened in Houston, and it had quickly become a favorite place for them and their friends to eat.</p><p>She hurried to the entrance, checking her watch with a grimace. Carson had always teased her about her lack of punctuality, and she was fifteen minutes late for her lunch date with Kylie and Chessy.</p><p>The two women were waiting inside when Joss rushed in. Joss\u2019s gaze immediately settled on her sister-in-law. The anniversary of Carson\u2019s death was as hard for her as it was for Joss because Carson was her only family. Joss had made the effort to make sure she and Kylie remained close after his passing. They\u2019d clung to one another, both grief stricken over their loss.</p><p>Shadows were evident in Kylie\u2019s eyes, but they brightened when she saw Joss and immediately went to hug her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Kylie whispered.</p><p>Joss squeezed her and pulled away with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d And she meant it.</p><p>Then she turned to Chessy and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay today?\u201d Chessy asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit and then we\u2019ll talk. I\u2019m starving,\u201d Joss said with a grin.</p><p>The other two women looked delighted over Joss\u2019s mood. It shamed Joss that she\u2019d been a burden not only to Dash over the last three years but to her closest friends as well. But no more. Today . . . Well, today was the first day in reestablishing her life. Of getting back on track and filling the void left by the death of her husband.</p><p>They were seated in a spacious booth\u2014Joss hated the long rows of tables that were practically on top of one another. Even if her conversation was casual, she hated to be overheard by others. And today of all days, she wanted to be afforded complete privacy.</p><p>\u201cYou look . . . different,\u201d Chessy mused, as they opened their menus.</p><p>Joss left hers closed because she knew what she wanted. The others made fun of her because with all the wonderful selections on the huge menu, she usually got the same exact thing and today was no different. Shaking Beef. Her absolute favorite thing the Lux Caf\u00e9 served.</p><p>\u201cI am different,\u201d Joss said in a low tone.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what has happened. It\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Joss said firmly.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. Do we even want to hear this?\u201d Chessy asked.</p><p>Silence fell over the table when the waiter appeared to take their orders. Only after he\u2019d departed did Kylie prompt Joss to explain what she\u2019d meant.</p><p>Joss sighed and then glanced up at Chessy. \u201cI wanted to ask you . . . I mean I know this is a personal question, but you\u2019ve talked about it before and if it\u2019s too personal, feel free to tell me to mind my own business, but I\u2019d really like to ask you some questions about you and Tate.\u201d</p><p>A dark shadow crossed over Chessy\u2019s face and sadness entered her eyes for a brief moment before she shook it away. But the look hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by either Joss or Kylie, who exchanged quick puzzled looks.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can ask me anything,\u201d Chessy said lightly, though the lightness of her tone seemed forced to Joss.</p><p>Deciding to try to figure out later what was behind that, Joss plunged ahead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that you and Tate have a dominant, submissive relationship. That he calls the shots in and out of bed. I just wanted to know . . . I mean this sounds stupid because of course you\u2019re happy. Anyone who sees the two of you can see how in love you are, but I wanted to know more about how it works.\u201d</p><p>Kylie paled and Joss hated bringing up the subject in front of her, but she didn\u2019t want to hide something this important from her sister-in-law. Not just a sister-in-law but her best friend. Kylie and Chessy were her two best friends in the world. She couldn\u2019t not share this with them because it was huge. A monumental leap forward from the life she\u2019d led the last three years.</p><p>\u201cJoss? Why are you asking?\u201d Chessy asked in a puzzled voice. One laced with concern.</p><p>Joss took another deep breath and closed her eyes. She reached for Kylie\u2019s hand because she knew this would be hard for her sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cYou both know I loved Carson with all my heart. He gave me everything. But I\u2019ve always had this . . . need. Craving. Desire. I don\u2019t know what to call it. But I\u2019ve always craved . . . dominance. And everything that goes with it. And it\u2019s the one thing I knew Carson couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t give me. I loved him too much to ever demand it of him. We spoke of it once. Early in our relationship. Before I knew about his childhood. He was always so afraid he\u2019d turn out like his father. The idea of doing anything that might hurt me or that may be construed as abuse appalled him. And I think in the beginning he feared losing me because he couldn\u2019t provide me with that kind of relationship.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s gaze had dropped, but Joss could see the tears gathering at the corners of her eyes. Joss tightened her hold on Kylie\u2019s hand, lending her strength that she hadn\u2019t had until now.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want it now?\u201d Chessy asked, her brow furrowed.</p><p>Slowly Joss nodded.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s head came up, a protest already forming on her lips, but Joss silenced her with another squeeze to her hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a relationship. I mean not a permanent one. I found perfection once. I know I\u2019ll never find that kind of love again. But I need something to fill the void. A void that\u2019s always existed, but while I was with Carson it wasn\u2019t so aching. I wasn\u2019t lonely. He provided me what I needed, even if a tiny part of me always wanted and needed more. I know that sounds terrible. I loved Carson with all my heart and soul, and I would have never done anything to hurt him. But he\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve had to come to grips with the fact that no matter how hard I wish it, he\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>Emotion knotted her throat and she blinked as hot moisture clouded her eyes. She wiped hastily at her cheeks, not wanting to make a scene in public. Kylie\u2019s head lowered again, a tear sliding down her pale cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lonely,\u201d Joss whispered. \u201cAnd I need something, someone to fill that void that Carson left behind. It\u2019s time for me to let go and try to move on. I\u2019ve found a place . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of place?\u201d Chessy asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called The House.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s expression eased. \u201cYes, I know it. Tate and I have a membership there. Tate is friends with the owner, Damon Roche. Damon is married and has a child now, so he isn\u2019t quite as active as he was before, but he still runs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s who I talked to,\u201d Joss admitted. \u201cHe vetted my membership. He was very kind to me. He wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you?\u201d Kylie blurted, lifting her head again. \u201cJoss, this is serious. What if you get hurt? What if you hook up with the wrong man? You know what kind of monsters exist out there. God knows, my father was one of them. How can you even think about going blindly into a situation like this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going blindly,\u201d Joss said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to. I\u2019ve researched endlessly, which was what brought me to The House. I\u2019ve toured the premises. I\u2019ve been there during its busiest times. I know what to expect. And Damon has assured me that, especially for my first visit, I will be very carefully monitored.\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted when the waiter brought their entr\u00e9es, but food was the last thing on the women\u2019s minds now. Their plates sat in front of them untouched as their conversation continued.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to know what it was like for you and Tate,\u201d Joss said softly.</p><p>Again, pain glittered in Chessy\u2019s green eyes. She pushed her dark hair behind her ear in an effort to disguise her hesitation, but Joss didn\u2019t miss it and she wondered what the hell was going on with her friend. She seemed . . . unhappy. And maybe it had been there for a while now, but Joss had been so self-absorbed that she hadn\u2019t paid attention to the people around her.</p> <p>\u201cIs there something you aren\u2019t telling us, Chessy?\u201d Joss demanded.</p><p>Chessy looked at once guilty and then surprised. \u201cNo, of course not. And to answer your question, when it\u2019s right, it\u2019s the most wonderful thing in the world. I never regretted giving Tate my complete submission. He always took such wonderful care of me. Cherished me. Protected me with his every breath. I was always his priority. And he was so demanding.\u201d</p><p>Joss frowned because every example had been said in the past tense.</p><p>\u201cIs that not the case now?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>Chessy smiled brightly. Too brightly. \u201cOf course it is. I was just saying. And well, perhaps it\u2019s not as perfect as it used to be, but that\u2019s to be expected. Tate has been so busy making his business a success, and when the newness wears off any relationship, it\u2019s easy to fall into a routine. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not divorcing or anything,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p> <p>But the forced gaiety bothered Joss. She shoved aside her sense of foreboding to focus on the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cAgain, if this is too personal a matter to discuss,\u201d Joss said. But Chessy waved her off and motioned for her to continue. \u201cWhat kinds of things do you and Tate do? I mean are you into bondage? Pain? Floggings? Or is it a simple matter of you obeying his commands and him calling the shots?\u201d</p><p>Kylie looked as though she\u2019d be ill, and she fiddled with her food as if she were trying to block out the conversation. Her face had grown pale, and Joss began to have second thoughts about bringing this up in front of her. But she hadn\u2019t wanted Kylie not to know. She owed her sister-in-law that much. To let her know she was going to at least try to move on and perhaps become involved, even if temporarily, with another man. It certainly wasn\u2019t something she wanted Kylie to find out by chance. She wanted Kylie to hear it from her.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of what you want,\u201d Chessy said quietly. \u201cYes, we practice all of those things and much more. I am his to do with as he wishes. He knows how far he can go. We\u2019ve been together long enough that he well knows my boundaries. Perhaps better than I know myself. But it\u2019s important in the beginning that you\u2019re very honest with your partner and that you set boundaries. He needs to know exactly what you are and aren\u2019t comfortable with. And you\u2019ll need a safe word until your relationship evolves enough that he knows just how far he can push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a kid in a toy store,\u201d Joss said ruefully. \u201cI want to try everything. At least once. I don\u2019t know my boundaries. I won\u2019t know until they\u2019re crossed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s even more important that you pick the right guy. One who understands that you\u2019re new to the scene. That you want to experiment but that you reserve the right to pull the plug at any moment. And for God\u2019s sake, Joss, don\u2019t agree to go home with a guy until you know him very well. Stay at the club. Do all your experimenting there in a public facility where there\u2019s plenty of security.\u201d</p> <p>Joss nodded. She\u2019d already considered that, and no way was she bringing a guy home. To the place she and Carson had lived and loved. It would be the height of disrespect to practice what would have appalled her husband under his own roof. And neither would she agree to go off with some stranger where God only knew what could happen once he had her alone and at his mercy.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t considered all the risks. She had! She\u2019d visited The House more than once. She\u2019d questioned Damon Roche endlessly, and the man had exhibited a huge amount of patience and understanding. But now she was having second thoughts listening to Chessy\u2019s warnings.</p><p>But no. She\u2019d thought this through. It was all she\u2019d thought about over the last months. And while moving forward with her new life on the three-year anniversary of her husband\u2019s death may seem tacky, for her it was symbolic. She wasn\u2019t backing out now.</p><p>She\u2019d positively shivered when Chessy had stated that she was her husband\u2019s. That she belonged to him and he could do as he wished. Joss wanted that. She craved it with a dark need she didn\u2019t even fully understand. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t belonged heart and soul to Carson. She had. She\u2019d held no part of herself back from him.</p><p>But this need for dominance went deeper than just belonging. She wanted to be . . . owned. Cherished. Utterly adored. All the things her husband had given her but . . . more. She wanted to cross that gray line. Wanted to shatter her boundaries. She wanted to discover what they were and just how far she was willing and wanted to go. How would she know if she never tried?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kylie asked quietly. \u201cI can see it in your eyes, Joss. I know that look. You\u2019re actually going to do this.\u201d</p><p>Joss nodded, feeling a sense of relief at affirming it.</p><p>Chessy reached across the table to catch Joss\u2019s other hand and squeezed it until Joss was holding on to both her friends\u2019 hands.</p> <p>\u201cThen I wish you luck,\u201d Chessy said.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t you have to go?\u201d Joss asked, suddenly remembering that Chessy had mentioned several days earlier that she and Tate were spending the afternoon together. \u201cIsn\u2019t Tate expecting you? I don\u2019t want to keep you. I just wanted to ask you those questions.\u201d</p><p>Again that barely discernible flicker in Chessy\u2019s eyes before she dropped her gaze and her hold on Joss\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chessy said lightly. \u201cHe had to cancel. An important matter came up at work.\u201d</p><p>Joss grimaced. \u201cSorry. I know you were looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I do have to run. I need time to prepare for tonight. Though I\u2019ve made up my mind about it, I\u2019m still nervous enough to need time to get ready and talk myself into going through with it.\u201d</p><p>Chessy smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll expect a report first thing tomorrow, and if I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m coming over. And if you aren\u2019t home, I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d</p><p>Joss smiled. \u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>She rose after placing several bills on the table to cover lunch. Kylie stood too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d Kylie said.</p><p>Chessy shot Joss a raised brow look and then glanced pointedly at Kylie. Joss sighed. She knew what was coming. With a wave to Chessy, Joss walked out of the restaurant, Kylie at her side.</p><p>When they got to the cars, Kylie put a hand out to Joss\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cJoss, have you really thought this through?\u201d she asked in a pleading tone. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about you. This isn\u2019t like you at all. What would Carson think? Joss, he\u2019d die if he knew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKylie, Carson is dead,\u201d Joss said gently. \u201cWe can\u2019t bring him back. God, if I could, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat. I\u2019d forget everything about my wants or needs if I could have him back. But he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Tears clogged her throat. Tears she\u2019d refused to allow herself to shed today. She\u2019d been determined that this year would be different. That she wouldn\u2019t spend the anniversary of her husband\u2019s death listless and grieving.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes were grief stricken. Tears welled up and slid soundlessly down her cheeks. \u201cI miss him so much, Joss. He was my only family. I still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Joss enfolded her in a hug, holding her tightly as Kylie\u2019s shoulders shook. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You have family. You have me. I\u2019m not going anywhere. This doesn\u2019t change things between us. I swear it. But Kylie, I have to pick up and move on with my life. This is killing me. My grief has been slowly killing me, and Carson would hate that. He\u2019d never want me to spend the rest of my life mourning him. He\u2019d be the first person to want me to be happy even if it wasn\u2019t with him.\u201d</p><p>Kylie pulled away, wiping hastily at her tears. \u201cI know that. I do. And I want you to be happy, Joss. But does it have to be this way? You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be at the mercy of a monster. You can\u2019t possibly want to put yourself in a position where you\u2019re helpless under a man\u2019s power. He could hurt you. Abuse you. Believe me, you don\u2019t want that. You could never understand how degrading and powerless that feeling is and I do. And I don\u2019t want that for you. Carson would never want that for you.\u201d</p><p>Joss gently wiped away the rest of Kylie\u2019s tears. \u201cNot all men are like that, Kylie. I know your concerns. I\u2019m not negating what you and Carson went through. I\u2019d never allow that for myself. And look at Chessy and Tate. You know what kind of relationship they have. Do you honestly believe Tate would ever harm a hair on her head? He loves her. He adores her. He absolutely respects the gift of her submission. And that\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is hurting her,\u201d Kylie said fiercely. \u201cYou had to have seen what I saw today. What we\u2019ve seen for the last while. She\u2019s not happy, Joss, and I\u2019m worried about her. What if he\u2019s abusing her?\u201d</p><p>Joss blinked, utterly shocked by Kylie\u2019s assertion. Yes, she\u2019d noticed that Chessy wasn\u2019t her usual cheerful, sunny self. She\u2019d sensed that something was off about her best friend, but never had she entertained, even for a moment, that Tate was hurting her physically.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on with Chessy and Tate,\u201d Joss said carefully. \u201cBut I do know that there is no way he\u2019s abusing her. Chessy would never stand for it. She\u2019s too strong and independent, despite the fact that she gave Tate her submission. Not to mention she\u2019d tell us if he was hurting her. We\u2019re too close of friends. We\u2019d know, Kylie. We\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever knew the hell that Carson and I endured,\u201d Kylie said painfully. \u201cWe hid it from the world. Our father appeared to others as a doting parent incapable of ever doing us harm. But behind closed doors he was a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Joss said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about Chessy. I\u2019ll talk to her if it makes you feel better. I know Tate. We all know Tate. We\u2019ve all been friends for years. There is no way he is abusing Chessy. And sweetie, I know you\u2019re not happy with my choice. I don\u2019t expect you to accept it, but I\u2019d like for you to respect it at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Kylie said brokenly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d never forgive myself if I didn\u2019t at least try to steer you away from the path you seem so determined to take. But if this is really what you want, if it\u2019s what you need and it will make you happy, then I\u2019ll try to respect your choices. I just don\u2019t want to lose you too.\u201d</p><p>Joss hugged her again. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose me. You\u2019re my sister and my best friend. Carson was not my only tie to you and now that he\u2019s gone it doesn\u2019t mean that our tie is severed. You\u2019re my family, Kylie. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie pulled away, a watery smile quivering on her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll expect a report tomorrow just like Chessy. I won\u2019t sleep tonight for worrying about you. I just hope you know what it is you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Joss murmured. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>DASH Corbin parked his car outside The House and sat for a moment, wondering again why he was here tonight. Normally on the anniversary of Carson\u2019s death, Dash would spend the day\u2014and evening\u2014with Joss. Not that he didn\u2019t spend plenty of other days with her, but for the first two anniversaries of Carson\u2019s passing, he\u2019d spent the entire day with Joss. Holding her. Comforting her. Supporting her.</p><p>And it was his own personal hell.</p><p>It sucked to be in love with his best friend\u2019s wife. He\u2019d lived with guilt for the entirety of Carson\u2019s marriage to Joss. Carson had known. He\u2019d guessed, though Dash had done his best never to allow his feelings to show. But his best friend was perceptive. He knew him better than anyone else ever had. They weren\u2019t just business partners. They were as close as brothers, though Dash hadn\u2019t existed in the hell that Carson and Kylie had endured growing up.</p><p>No, Dash\u2019s family was the complete antithesis of Carson\u2019s. If you could call the piece-of-shit bastard who\u2019d fathered Carson family. Dash\u2019s parents were still as solidly in love now as they were forty years ago when they\u2019d married. Dash was one of five siblings, the middle child. Two older brothers. Two younger sisters who were spoiled and protected by their older brothers.</p><p>Carson had been befuddled by Dash\u2019s close-knit family from the moment he\u2019d first met them. He hadn\u2019t known how to react to a normal, well-adjusted family setting. But Dash\u2019s family had embraced Carson\u2014and Joss, when Carson had married her. And even Kylie, though she was more reserved and more wary of his large family than Carson was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dash sighed again and got out, walking to the entrance of The House. He wasn\u2019t even interested in any action tonight, but he was restless and on edge. Joss had occupied his thoughts the entire day. Ever since he\u2019d taken her to the cemetery and had seen the difference in her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to make of the abrupt change. She\u2019d walked out of her house in jeans and a T-shirt, looking so young and beautiful that it still made his chest ache to remember the image of her.</p><p>And then she\u2019d asked to be left alone at the grave and she\u2019d stayed there, her lips moving as she\u2019d spoken to Carson for a long while. When she\u2019d returned, there was a marked difference in her demeanor. And then that spiel about not needing him. Apologizing to him, for fuck\u2019s sake. Apologizing for being a goddamn burden. For taking up too much of his life and time. Hell, she didn\u2019t even realize she was his life. Or at least he hoped she would be.</p><p>He checked in with the man working the door and wandered through the lower levels. The social rooms. The places where people met up, drank good wine, mingled before moving upstairs to the common room or one of the private suites.</p> <p>There were plenty of beautiful women and no shortage of interested looks thrown his way. It had been a while since he\u2019d come here to work off some steam. Usually after he\u2019d spent time with Joss, pretending the woman he was with was her. It made him a bastard, but he made certain the woman he was with was taken care of. She had no way of knowing that she was a poor substitute for the one woman he couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Was she finally moving on? She\u2019d talked the talk during the car ride home. She\u2019d been blunt, painfully so, and it had cost her. He\u2019d seen the na**d emotion in her eyes when she\u2019d said that Carson was gone and he wasn\u2019t coming back and she had to move on and accept that. But did she mean it?</p><p>He was afraid to hope. And he was afraid of making the wrong move. He couldn\u2019t afford to f**k it all up by pushing her too soon. She viewed him as a friend. She viewed herself as a burden to him. Someone he\u2019d babysat through her grief. Never even realizing that he lived for the moments when he was with her.</p><p>Carson had known that his best friend was in love with his wife. He\u2019d known and accepted it. Dash had been afraid that it would ruin not only their friendship, but their business partnership as well. But Carson had understood. He trusted Dash never to act on that attraction. And he\u2019d also exacted a promise from Dash that were anything ever to happen to Carson, Dash would be there for Joss.</p><p>Hell of a note when his best friend entrusted his wife to his care if something happened to him.</p> <p>Worse was the fact that Carson had exacted that promise mere weeks before he\u2019d been killed in an accident. Almost as if he knew. Had he sensed that something would happen and that Joss would be left a young widow?</p><p>At the time, Dash had brushed off the very serious pledge that Carson had confronted him with.</p><p>If anything ever happens to me, man, I want you to promise me. Promise me that you\u2019ll be there for Joss. I know you love her. If there ever comes a day that I can\u2019t be there for her, I want you to promise me that you\u2019ll take care of her and love her like I do.</p><p>The words echoed through his mind. Prophetic? Or just coincidence?</p><p>At the time, the promise had just been a painful reminder of all that Carson had and all that Dash didn\u2019t. Joss was . . . She was beautiful. Not just physically. She could light up a room by simply walking in. She had a gentle smile that could charm even the hardest heart. And she\u2019d never so much as looked in the direction of another man after she\u2019d met Carson. God knows, there\u2019d been no shortage of men only too willing to seduce another man\u2019s wife. But Joss acted as though she had no clue of her effect on men. And that made her all the more desirable to Dash.</p><p>After making a quick round of the social rooms, he picked up a glass of wine\u2014Damon Roche served only the best\u2014and headed up the stairs to the common room.</p> <p>There was the usual eclectic mix of sexcapades occurring in the large, open room. Though there were no actual partitions, the room was sectioned off simply by the participants taking their own spaces for their activities.</p><p>A mixture of sounds and smells greeted him as he walked farther into the room. The slap of flesh on flesh. The smack of a whip or a flogger. The sighs, moans and cries of ecstasy. Some of pain. Some of pleasure. The air was thick with the scent of sex.</p><p>He crossed the room, taking in the occupants, wanting to ensure that Tate and Chessy weren\u2019t present tonight. Not that he was a prude by any stretch, but seeing his other best friends ha**g s*x wasn\u2019t high on his list of priorities. Though he shouldn\u2019t have worried because he hadn\u2019t seen them at The House in months. The few times in the past he had seen them, he\u2019d cut short his own visit, because he would never do anything to make Chessy uncomfortable.</p><p>She was a very special woman, and Tate was a lucky son of a bitch to have such perfection. Submissive. Beautiful. Gifting Tate with her absolute trust. There was not a more precious gift than a woman who gave her submission to a man.</p><p>It was what he wanted for himself, what he\u2019d always sought out in any relationship he\u2019d formed. But for Joss, he\u2019d deny that part of himself if it was the only way he had a chance at having her. Knowing Carson\u2019s background, Dash knew with certainty that Carson and Joss had never delved into that lifestyle.</p><p>But then he\u2019d never gone beyond casual sex after Joss. Once she\u2019d come into Carson\u2019s life, a whirlwind, there hadn\u2019t been another woman for Dash. He sated his needs, made certain his partner\u2019s were met as well and then he moved on, never willing to commit, even though he\u2019d known that Joss was unattainable. Only now that wasn\u2019t true. She was free. But could she ever love another man as she\u2019d loved Carson?</p><p>That was the question of the day. And could Dash be content with only a part of her heart?</p><p>He nodded before he could stop himself. Hell yes, he\u2019d take any part of her he could get. The question was, when did he make his move?</p> <p>Today had given him the first ray of hope in three years that Joss was ready to move past her grief and live her life again. He\u2019d been patient. He\u2019d been whatever she needed him to be. But he wanted to be so much more.</p><p>He retreated to the corner of the room, politely declining with a gentle smile a woman who offered to service him. Another night he may have let her, close his eyes and imagine Joss under his firm but tender grasp. But tonight his thoughts were consumed with Joss, and he couldn\u2019t muster the heart to pretend as he\u2019d done so many other times.</p><p>His family thought him a fool for not moving beyond his feelings for Joss a long time ago. They\u2019d eyed him with sympathy for the last three years. His brothers had even asked him when he was going to act. But he\u2019d known it wasn\u2019t time. Not then. But now?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the petal of hope that unfurled when he\u2019d been with Joss earlier today. He\u2019d seen the difference in her eyes and in her demeanor. But then that bullshit apology for being a burden, and she\u2019d acted as though she were finished being that burden to him.</p><p>To hell with that. If she thought he was just going to step aside, she was very wrong.</p><p>He stood watching with waning enthusiasm, not even sure what had driven him here tonight. What he wanted was to be with Joss. Watching a movie and trying to get her mind off her grief, which is what he\u2019d done the last two anniversaries\u2014and plenty of times in between. The day hadn\u2019t gone at all as he\u2019d expected. He\u2019d cleared his calendar, made certain his clients were covered so that he could spend the day with Joss.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected her to all but dismiss him after their trip to the cemetery.</p><p>His gaze was drawn to the entryway where a couple entered, and he did an immediate double take.</p><p>What the ever-loving fuck?</p><p>He stared, unable to believe what he was seeing. Joss had just walked through the doorway, a man Dash knew from The House at her side, his arm wrapped intimately around her waist, his hand splayed very possessively over her hip, leaving no question of his . . . ownership. Or impending ownership.</p><p>She was dressed in a killer black sheath that hugged and outlined every single one of her perfect curves. And she wore a pair of fuck-me shoes that just begged for a man to do just that. Fuck her in those heels until she screamed his name over and over.</p><p>Her hair was upswept, a few tendrils floating lazily down her slender neck, drawing attention to the delicateness of her features.</p><p>And she looked scared to death.</p><p>Dash was striding across the room before he even realized what he was doing. For that matter, what the f**k was she doing? Here! In a goddamn establishment devoted to all manner of sexuality.</p><p>And the man she was with was a regular at The House. He had a string of submissives, and rarely was he with the same woman twice in a row. And yet here he was with his arm wrapped very possessively around Joss, lust evident in his eyes.</p><p>What the hell did she think she was doing?</p><p>He was just a few feet away when Joss lifted her shocked gaze to his, her mouth falling open in surprise just as mortification seized her features. Panic flickered in her eyes and she took a step away from the man at her side.</p><p>The man, Craig, was quick to pull her back, and that infuriated Dash all the more. Dash reached for Joss\u2019s arm, swiftly pulling her into the safety of his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Corbin?\u201d Craig demanded, reaching for Joss\u2019s other hand.</p><p>Dash immediately inserted himself between Joss and Craig, shielding Joss with his body.</p><p>\u201cGet the f**k away from her,\u201d Dash barked. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Craig\u2019s eyebrows shot up and he stared for a moment before finally putting his hands up in a gesture of surrender. Not typical for a man like Craig. A Dominant who didn\u2019t yield to anyone. But then Dash was convinced he likely looked like a crazy person about to explode, judging by the wariness in Craig\u2019s gaze. And Craig wouldn\u2019t be wrong about that assumption. Dash was precariously close to losing his tenuous hold on his control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go find other company for the evening,\u201d Craig murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Dash said behind clenched teeth. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ever make the mistake of coming near her again or I\u2019ll take you apart. We clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, I got it.\u201d</p><p>Craig gave Dash\u2014and Joss\u2014a wide berth before continuing into the room.</p><p>Dash turned to see Joss\u2019s pale, shocked face and swore under his breath. He grabbed her hand and hauled her into the hallway. She still hadn\u2019t uttered a word. Her face was stricken, and she looked so humiliated that Dash wanted to put his fist through the wall. The last thing he wanted was to embarrass her, but f**k it all. What was he supposed to do when she showed up looking like a woman a man would die to possess? A woman he was dying to possess.</p><p>He ushered her down the stairs and down the hallway to the exit as fast as he could without making her trip in those spikes disguised as shoes. He was tempted to throw her over his shoulder and barrel out like a caveman. He managed to temper that particular urge. Barely.</p><p>As soon as he had her outside, he turned to her, trying to curb the anger that coiled through his veins.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d he clipped out.</p><p>\u201cI d-didn\u2019t drive,\u201d she stammered out. \u201cI took a cab.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. That was worse. Had she not expected to go home alone tonight? Was she planning to sleep over with whatever guy she hooked up with here? But then how the hell did he know if this was even her first time? For all he knew she could be a regular and maybe she and Craig had hooked up before. Dash certainly hadn\u2019t been in enough recently to be caught up on the goings-on at the club.</p><p>He herded her over to his car and opened the passenger door, ushering her inside.</p><p>\u201cDash?\u201d</p><p>The one word, laced with fear and uncertainty, cut him to the core. Damn it, the last thing he wanted was for her to be afraid of him. He had to calm the f**k down before he lost his damn mind. And destroyed any chance he had with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home,\u201d he said in a more gentle tone.</p><p>He walked around to the driver\u2019s side and slid in, starting the engine and backing out almost before he had his door closed. He roared down the winding drive that led up to the house and waited impatiently for the gate to open to allow him to exit.</p><p>As he accelerated down the highway, he felt Joss\u2019s nervous gaze flicker toward him. Saw her bite the bottom of her lip as she obviously struggled with what she wanted to say.</p><p>He reached for her hand, squeezing it in a reassuring manner.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk when we get home,\u201d he said, his voice a command, one that he hadn\u2019t used with Joss before.</p><p>But it worked. She immediately closed her mouth, though her bottom lip was still sucked between her teeth as she nibbled nervously. Mortification still gripped her features, and it made Dash ache to know she was suffering. Embarrassed. Likely thinking he was going to tear a strip off her hide. And maybe he was. He wasn\u2019t at all sure what the f**k he was going to say to her yet.</p><p>They drove the rest of the way in tense silence, her hand firmly trapped in his. He could feel her trembling and it slayed him that she feared him. He\u2019d nip that in the bud just as soon as he got to the bottom of this.</p><p>She looked surprised when he pulled into his neighborhood, which was just a few miles from her own subdivision. She turned to look at him, a clear question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk here,\u201d he said shortly as he pulled into his drive.</p><p>She went silent again, her head bowed as she stared at her lap. Undone by her defeated demeanor, he reached over and gently cupped her chin, nudging until she was forced to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, honey. Now come inside so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and he got out quickly, walking around to collect her from the car. He led her inside his house, satisfaction gripping him that she was in his space. Finally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Though they\u2019d spent plenty of time together over the last years, it had always been in a neutral location. Or her own home, the one she\u2019d shared with Carson. The last time she\u2019d been in his house was when Carson was still alive, and the couple had been frequent visitors back then.</p><p>He curled his arm around Joss\u2019s waist as he ushered her through the foyer and into the living room. She stiffened but made no move to distance herself from him. She was too busy looking like she was waiting for the anvil to drop from the sky on her head.</p><p>When they entered the living room, he loosened his hold and took a step away, dragging a hand raggedly through his hair. Then he turned, not sure how exactly to pose the questions burning his tongue. Fuck it. He only knew one way. Blunt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing in The House tonight, Joss?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>She flinched at the fury in his tone and her eyes became shadowed.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re getting into by being there,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo idea at all. Do you have any clue what could happen to you? What Craig would have done to you? Let me tell you. He would have had you bent over while he flogged your pretty ass and then he would have f**ked you without mercy, uncaring of your pleasure. It would have been all about his own. He would have taken you and used you and wouldn\u2019t have given a damn about you or your pleasure. What the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips, her eyes going glossy with tears. Ah hell. The last thing he wanted was to make her cry when she\u2019d made it the entire day, or at least the time she\u2019d spent with him, without shedding a single tear.</p><p>\u201cI do understand, Dash,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI understand far more than you think.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cHave you been going to The House before tonight?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. This was my first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Joss. What the hell? Do you have any idea what might have happened to you if I hadn\u2019t been there? There is no way in hell I\u2019m allowing you to go back to that place. You don\u2019t belong there.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quivered and then she seemed to mentally shake herself. She steeled her features and leveled a firm stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I was doing. You don\u2019t understand, Dash. You\u2019d never understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d he challenged.</p><p>She stared at him a long moment, her eyes uncertain, almost as if she were trying to decide whether to trust him. He was on edge, because damn it, he wanted her to be able to come to him for anything. Anything at all. And he wanted her trust.</p> <p>Then she closed her eyes and sank onto the couch, sitting forward, her face buried in her hands. Her shoulders shook and it was all he could do not to go to her. Not to comfort and hold her and tell her everything would be all right. But he waited. Because whatever she had to tell him he sensed was huge. And that it would forever change the way he looked at her. At any possibility of them being together.</p><p>She lifted her head, her eyes swimming in tears. \u201cI loved Carson with all my heart and soul. He was my soul mate. I know that. And I know I\u2019ll never find that kind of love again.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s breath caught and held because that wasn\u2019t something he wanted to hear. That she\u2019d resigned herself to a loveless existence because she didn\u2019t think another man would ever love her as Carson had. When in fact, Dash was that man. He already loved her\u2014had loved her forever\u2014and given the opportunity, he\u2019d show her that she damn well could find another man who\u2019d give her his everything.</p><p>\u201cCarson gave me everything I could ever possibly want or ask for. Except . . .\u201d</p><p>She broke off and looked down again, her shoulders sagging in defeat.</p><p>\u201cExcept what, Joss?\u201d Dash asked softly, puzzled by her statement. He knew damn well Carson would have given her the moon. Anything that was in his power to provide Joss, he would have done absolutely.</p><p>\u201cDominance,\u201d Joss whispered.</p><p>Dash\u2019s nape prickled and a curl of . . . hope? quivered through his veins. His pulse raced and he had to calm himself and clarify that he\u2019d heard her correctly. Because there was a whole lot he didn\u2019t understand.</p> <p>\u201cDominance?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Then she looked up at him, misery clouding her beautiful eyes. \u201cYou know how he grew up. What he endured. How he and Kylie were horribly abused. In the beginning, when we first met, we talked about my . . . need. What I thought I needed and wanted. And he wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014bring himself to do anything that could possibly be construed as abuse. He worried constantly that somehow he would inherit his father\u2019s abusive nature, that it was somehow genetic, and he\u2019d die before ever doing anything to hurt me. As if he would! It was why he was reluctant to have children. He wanted them. God, he wanted them and so did I. It\u2019s my biggest regret that I didn\u2019t have his child, a part of him to live on now that I\u2019ve lost him. But he was so terrified that he\u2019d abuse his own children.\u201d</p><p>The last part came out in a sob and Dash could no longer keep his distance. He crossed the room, sat on the couch next to her and pulled her into his arms. She buried her face in his chest as he ran his hands through her hair.</p><p>\u201cCarson would never hurt you or his children,\u201d Dash said with absolute confidence.</p><p>Joss pulled away, her tear-filled eyes gutting Dash. \u201cI know that. You know that. But he didn\u2019t. And I couldn\u2019t convince him of that. His father messed him up, Dash. Him and Kylie both. They never recovered from all he had done to them and it affected them well into their adult life. It still affects Kylie. When I told her what I planned to do, she freaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear what it was you planned as well, Joss,\u201d Dash prompted gently. \u201cWhat was tonight all about?\u201d</p><p>Joss turned away, clenching her fingers into tight fists. \u201cI know you think I don\u2019t have a clue what I was getting into, Dash, but I\u2019m not stupid. I didn\u2019t just up and decide to go to The House. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought about and researched for months. I talked with Damon Roche a lot. He wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting into and that I wasn\u2019t making a hasty, emotional decision.\u201d</p><p>Well, thank God for that. Damon was a solid guy. He may run an establishment that catered to every conceivable kink or fetish, but he took it very seriously and he vetted his members very carefully.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s like I told you today, Dash. Carson is gone. He\u2019s not coming back. And I have to pick up and move on. I can\u2019t mourn him the rest of my life. I need . . . I want . . .\u201d</p><p>She faltered and Dash simply waited for her to collect her thoughts because this was huge. He was learning a side to Joss he never suspected existed. How could he have?</p><p>\u201cI have to know if what I think I want and need is true. I have this need inside me, Dash. It\u2019s an ache, a hole in my soul that\u2019s even larger now that Carson is gone. I loved him too much to ever ask or demand that he give me something he wasn\u2019t capable of. And it sounds like I was unhappy. God, I wasn\u2019t! I loved him, Dash. I loved him with all my heart and I don\u2019t regret a single thing about our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. I know,\u201d Dash murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut that need has always been inside me and I can\u2019t even explain it to myself, so how can I make you understand that this isn\u2019t a game? It isn\u2019t me being irrational and looking to fill a void left by Carson\u2019s death. It\u2019s always been there. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d Dash said simply. \u201cTell me what it is you want. What you need. I\u2019ll listen, Joss. And I won\u2019t judge you. I\u2019ll just listen and we can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Relief shone in her eyes. Had she expected condemnation? Had she expected him to accuse her of being disloyal to Carson or his memory?</p><p>\u201cI want to be . . . owned.\u201d A shiver stole over her body, one he could feel even with the short space that separated them now. \u201cI want what Tate and Chessy have. I want a man to possess me, to own me. I want to submit to him and I want him to take care of me. Protect me. God, it makes me sound like some helpless, dependent twit. But that\u2019s not it. Carson taught me to stand on my own two feet. To be independent. It\u2019s not that I have to have this in order to survive. It\u2019s what I want. My choice.\u201d</p><p>Dash put his finger over her lips to silence her. \u201cShhh, honey. You don\u2019t have to defend your choices to me. I\u2019m here to listen. Don\u2019t defend. Just tell me what\u2019s going on in that pretty head of yours.\u201d</p><p>His heart was about to beat out of his chest. Had fate been kind to him after all? Had a gift he\u2019d never dreamed of receiving suddenly dropped into his lap? Had Carson known\u2014of course he\u2019d known. He knew of Dash\u2019s sexual preferences. That he was dominant and that he desired submissiveness in a woman. Now the promise that Carson had exacted from him made so much more sense. Carson had known his wife wanted something he himself could never provide her, and he wanted to make sure that if something happened to him that Dash would step in and give her what Carson had never been able to. God, the sheer selflessness that such a gesture entailed was mind-boggling. He\u2019d been granting his blessing. Jesus.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a decision I made lightly, Dash. I was okay with it. Until I saw you tonight. I was so mortified. And I felt guilty, because seeing you there made me feel as though I were betraying Carson. I didn\u2019t want you to know. Chessy and Kylie knew. I told them. They\u2019re worried about me, but they also know I took all the necessary precautions before just showing up at The House tonight. And I was ready. Or at least I thought I was. But then you were there.\u201d</p><p>Her brow suddenly furrowed as if it had just occurred to her that Dash had been there. He could see the question in her eyes before she ever voiced it.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing there, Dash?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he brushed aside her question because there were so many other more important things to discuss. It was all he could do to hold himself back. To temper the urge to brand her. To move in, take her and give her everything she said she wanted\u2014needed.</p><p>\u201cI need to know something from you first, Joss. I need to know how serious you are about this. I need to know if this is truly what you want and what you need and that it\u2019s not just an experiment or you looking to fill a void.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be any more serious,\u201d she said in a resolved tone that convinced him she was indeed that.</p><p>He leaned forward, his breath mingling with hers, their lips so close he could feel the warmth from the inviting bow. Just a fraction of an inch and he would be kissing her.</p><p>\u201cI was there because that\u2019s who and what I am, Joss,\u201d he said, taking in her response, watching every flicker that crossed her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s always been what I am. And let me tell you this right now. If this is what you want. If this is what you need. Then I\u2019m going to be the only damn man you offer your submission to.\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>JOSS sucked in her breath and held it until she was light-headed and precariously close to toppling over. Dash\u2019s lips were so close that she could feel the harsh exhalation of his breath. She could see the determined glitter in his eyes. And for the first time, she became aware of him as something more than a friend. Her husband\u2019s friend. Someone she\u2019d turned to for support many times over the years.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even process his heated declaration, but she knew he was utterly serious. There was a glint in his eyes, a firm set to his jaw. She could see the pulse thudding at his neck and she could smell every part of him, his scent wafting tantalizingly through her nostrils.</p><p>Dash dominant? Not that she had any difficulty in believing that of him. He was a man well accustomed to getting his way. He had a quiet authority about him. He didn\u2019t need to be loud to get his point across. She\u2019d been present too many times when he\u2019d spoken and everyone had immediately quieted, listening to what he had to say.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t someone who shouted orders. He didn\u2019t need to. There was an intensity to him that made people aware of the power emanating from him. She hadn\u2019t been blind to it, nor was she immune. As she\u2019d pondered just earlier that day, in the beginning he\u2019d intimidated her. She\u2019d felt his concern and disapproval over how fast her relationship had progressed with Carson. But once he\u2019d become convinced that she was the right woman for his best friend, his loyalty to her was sealed.</p><p>But his words still rang in her ears. That brusque vow. She shivered under the intensity of his gaze, those dark eyes eating her up, exposing her, making her feel vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cI d-don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said helplessly, her hand lifting and then fluttering downward again as she tried to make sense of the entire evening.</p><p>And then his next words tilted her universe even further off its axis.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long damn time for you, Joss. I thought I\u2019d never have you, and I was okay with that because you made Carson happy and I know Carson made you happy. But as you said, he\u2019s gone now, and I\u2019ve waited. For what seems like an eternity I\u2019ve waited for the right moment. For when you were ready. Maybe I waited too long, or perhaps now is the perfect time. But if you think I\u2019m going to stand by and allow another man to touch what I consider mine, you\u2019re very mistaken.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, overwhelmed by it all. Dash spoke as if he wanted her. Had wanted her for a long time. But no. That wasn\u2019t possible. He\u2019d never betray his best friend. Had Dash developed feelings for her after Carson\u2019s death? Was he simply stepping in for his best friend, wanting to take care of Carson\u2019s widow?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be an obligation to Dash. She\u2019d been one for far too long. Today had been about letting go. Not only of Carson but of her dependence on Dash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what flabbergasted her more was that Dash was everything she\u2019d said she wanted, if she was to believe his impassioned statement. Dominant. He liked submissive women. And he wanted to introduce her to the lifestyle. He wanted to possess\u2014to own\u2014her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI never imagined. I didn\u2019t realize . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose you didn\u2019t,\u201d Dash murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I could just come out and say. But Joss, you\u2019ve made the first move. Now it\u2019s my turn to make all the others. You\u2019ve laid out what you want. What you need. What you desire. And I\u2019m going to be the man who gives you those things.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, still utterly overwhelmed by the day, the moment, this. How had so much changed so quickly? Then she shook her head in automatic denial even though a part of her, the part that had gone for so long unfulfilled, screamed at her that this was it. This was what she\u2019d been looking for. But Dash?</p> <p>No, they were just friends. He had been her husband\u2019s best friend. How would it look to others? How would her friends, his family, Kylie take the shift from them being friends to becoming lovers? More than lovers. Much more. She couldn\u2019t even fathom just how much more this kind of relationship he proposed entailed. It wouldn\u2019t be a one-night stand. Two people hooking up in the heat of the moment. What Dash proposed was . . . permanent?</p><p>\u201cStop overanalyzing this, Joss,\u201d Dash said in a patient tone. But his jaw was still tight. His eyes still glittered with unshakable resolve. God, was he serious? How could she even question that when every single part of him screamed of his absolute certainty?</p><p>And Dash was not impulsive or remotely flighty. That wasn\u2019t who or what he was. She\u2019d known him long enough to know that his every movement, whether in business or in his personal life, was carefully thought out. But the idea that he\u2019d obviously given them such careful consideration blew her mind.</p><p>\u201cBut Dash. We can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She said it emphatically even as she questioned why they couldn\u2019t. But of course they couldn\u2019t, could they? There was more than just him and her to consider. There were their friends. Kylie. His family. It was all making her head ache with the speed at which her world had been irrevocably altered. She hadn\u2019t experienced such a tailspin since the day she\u2019d learned her husband was gone.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked simply, calmly. As if he hadn\u2019t just upended her carefully ordered existence.</p><p>Well, but that would be a lie. Her world had been upended on the day Carson had died, and it had never been set to rights. Until now? Was this what she needed to get her life back? To reclaim herself? Was Dash what she needed or would any man do? Even as she thought it, she knew it wasn\u2019t so. She wouldn\u2019t feel this way\u2014this uncertain\u2014with another man because it wouldn\u2019t be personal. She wouldn\u2019t have feelings she couldn\u2019t sort out for another man.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean, Dash? I don\u2019t understand any of it. You said you\u2019ve waited. What are we talking here? How long have you waited? You act as though you want me\u2014have wanted me. But I had no idea. How could I have? You are\u2014were\u2014my husband\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful of what you ask, Joss,\u201d Dash warned. \u201cYou may not be prepared for the answer.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, not knowing what to make of that particular statement. Was she blind? Was she a complete idiot for not seeing this before? She mentally went back over all the times Dash had been with her over the last years. But all she saw was unwavering support. Emotional support. All the times he\u2019d picked up the pieces when she was certain that she\u2019d fallen apart.</p><p>But he\u2019d kept her strong. Pushed her when she hadn\u2019t always wanted to be pushed, but he\u2019d never taken her anger or rage personally. It was a wonder he hadn\u2019t walked away from her a long time ago. But if what he suggested was true . . .</p> <p>Oh dear God. What was she supposed to do? What she wanted was being placed squarely in her lap. But Dash?</p><p>She looked up at him again, this time without the blinders. Without the knowledge that he was untouchable, a friend. Her husband\u2019s best friend. Someone she could never even look at with anything more than the bonds of friendship.</p><p>And what she saw took her breath away.</p><p>This was a living, breathing, gorgeous specimen of alpha male. The promise of dominance and a whole lot more shone in his dark eyes. She shivered as she took in the way he looked at her. Had he always looked at her as he was looking now? Had she been completely oblivious to the strong current of attraction that arced between them as strongly as any electrical surge?</p><p>Her gaze wandered over his face, down his body, took in the broad set of his shoulders, his muscled chest, even the thickness of his muscular thighs. Not an inch of spare flesh to be found on his body.</p><p>Then heat consumed her cheeks and she looked away, embarrassed to be caught checking him out in such an obvious matter.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t bothered. Indeed, he looked . . . pleased.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Joss. See me,\u201d he breathed out. \u201cFinally. See me. Who I am. What I am. And that I want you with my every breath.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d she whispered, remembering his admonishment that perhaps she wouldn\u2019t want the answer to her question. But now she had to know. She had to know how long he\u2019d gone unnoticed by her.</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d he said with a casual shrug. He tried to play it off lightly, but she could see the shadows that suddenly entered his eyes. The . . . pain. And the longing. Oh dear God. It couldn\u2019t be true. It simply couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d she croaked out. \u201cYou mean before . . . When Carson and I were together?\u201d</p><p>He gave a clipped nod and all the wind left Joss in a sudden whoosh, leaving her sagging on the couch. He made a sudden grab for her, steadying her before she could topple sideways.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d she murmured faintly.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d Dash bit out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have laid that on you, Joss. What could you have done? You were in love with another man. Married to another man. My best friend. You knowing would have solved nothing and would have put a strain on our relationship. On the three of us.\u201d</p><p>She raised her gaze to him, haunted, she was sure, because what she had to ask next . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd Carson?\u201d she whispered. \u201cDid he know?\u201d</p><p>Dash hesitated only a moment, as if he were deciding just how blunt to be with her. Then he gave a quick shake of his head, almost as if he were deciding that she should have it all. That maybe he thought she was finally ready to hear what she\u2019d been ignorant of for so long.</p><p>\u201cHe knew,\u201d Dash said grimly.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Joss said shakily. \u201cHe knew? And you were friends? Dash, I don\u2019t understand any of this!\u201d</p><p>Dash sighed and then gently pulled her forward until she was nestled into his chest. He laid her head against his shoulder and kissed the top of her hair as one hand glided downward, separating and stroking the tresses that had now tumbled down from the clip that had secured them earlier.</p><p>There was so much more in his embrace than the comfort he\u2019d offered for the last three years. She knew it now, but hadn\u2019t known it then. Her entire body was on high alert. Her pulse raced and thudded in her veins. Her br**sts tingled and her ni**les beaded and tightened against the dress. She hadn\u2019t worn a bra and she knew that Dash could feel the imprint of her ni**les through their clothing.</p><p>\u201cCarson understood,\u201d Dash said in a low voice. \u201cAnd yes, we were friends and we remained friends because he knew I would never betray him and he knew you would never betray him. He knew that I would never act on my attraction. But yes, he knew. And I think it gave him a measure of comfort to know that if anything ever happened to him I\u2019d step in. That I\u2019d be here and that I\u2019d give you everything you could possibly want or need.\u201d</p><p>She pushed off his chest to look him in the eye. \u201cBut Dash, that had to have been . . .\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, seeing the fire in his eyes. As if he\u2019d suppressed his need and want for so long and now it was unleashed, vibrant and blazing in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was hell,\u201d Dash quietly confirmed. \u201cIt was heaven and it was hell. Heaven when I got to spend time with you. When I simply got to look at you or see you smile. It was hell going home at night knowing you were in Carson\u2019s arms and not my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d she choked out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Dash!\u201d</p><p>His expression gentled and he put his hand up to stroke her cheek, rubbing downward in a tender caress.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know, Joss. I was in an impossible position and I never wanted that for you. For Carson. I loved you both and I would have never done anything to destroy your marriage or cause trouble. So I waited. But I\u2019m done waiting and you need to know that.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught again at the sincerity emblazoned on his features.</p><p>His hand trailed downward until his fingers brushed ever so lightly across her lips. She was tempted to lick them, wanting to taste him on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut now I feel as though I\u2019ve been handed a gift I never dreamed of receiving. I was prepared to deny everything about myself. For you. I never imagined you\u2019d want what it is I can give you. So I would have suppressed that need to dominate. I would have never demanded anything of you that you weren\u2019t prepared to offer freely. But now that I know what you want? Brace yourself, Joss, because now that I know, I\u2019m not going to hold back any longer. I can give you all that you want and need and so much more. So very much more. You just have to decide whether you trust me to give that to you. And whether you think you can possibly come to care for me as much as I care for you.\u201d</p><p>She did lick her lips then. Nervous. Anticipation tingling up her spine. And hope. Slowly unfurling like the petals of a flower at the first brush of spring. Warming in the sunshine after a long winter, waiting to bloom and burst free of constraints.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cTonight . . . It went nothing as I had planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank f**k for that,\u201d Dash muttered. \u201cGod, when I think of what could have happened had I not been there. It\u2019s fate, Joss. She\u2019s a fickle bitch and at long last she\u2019s smiled on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d she asked quietly, her gaze never leaving his.</p><p>He leaned in, cupping her face with exquisite tenderness and reverence. His lips hovered precariously close to hers, his breath warming her skin. And then he kissed her.</p><p>Heat exploded through her veins, rushing until she could hear the roar in her ears. It was like an electric shock, something so unexpected and yet wonderful. Desire, long dormant, rose like a fury, curling through her womb and spreading outward like a wildfire.</p><p>Her skin prickled, chill bumps rising and dancing across her skin until she shivered uncontrollably against him.</p><p>He deepened the kiss, swiping his tongue warmly over the seam of her lips until she parted them breathlessly and he swept in, colliding with her tongue. He moaned softly against her mouth. She swallowed up the sound, suddenly hungry, so very hungry for more.</p><p>Never had she imagined feeling this way again. Of experiencing the intense craving, of having desire grab hold and completely overtake her. She\u2019d been cold, so very cold, for so very long, and now she was warm. Bathed in fire. His heat consumed her. His smell, his taste, the very essence of him. How could she have never known? How could she have never imagined? How could she have never seen him as the desirable, alpha male who was currently kissing her senseless?</p><p>When he pulled away, his eyes were hooded and flush with answering desire.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now, Joss, is that you are mine. At long last, you are mine. And if all you said is true, if what you want and need is my dominance, then be assured. I will possess you. I will own you. And you will never know another man than me.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>DASH watched the myriad of emotions washing through her eyes. She was so expressive. She\u2019d always been so. It was one of the things he\u2019d enjoyed most about her. One only had to look into her eyes to know her mood. Happiness, sadness, excitement.</p><p>Arousal.</p><p>The last, he found, was extremely satisfying. Never had she looked at him as she did right at this moment. Triumph surged, even as he tempered his reaction. This wasn\u2019t in the bag. Not by a long shot. Her next words confirmed that for him.</p><p>\u201cI need time to think . . . About this\u2014us,\u201d she said in a shaky voice. \u201cThis was so unexpected, Dash. I don\u2019t want to make a hasty decision that I\u2014we\u2014will later regret.\u201d</p><p>Her honesty was another thing he\u2019d always admired about her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d Even as his mind screamed that there was every need to rush. He didn\u2019t want her to think about it. Didn\u2019t want her talking herself out of it. But he couldn\u2019t blow this. Not when he was so close to getting what he\u2019d wanted for so very long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long . . .\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, lifting her hand to her temple as if it ached before letting it flutter back down to her lap. He took her hand, rubbing the pad of his thumb over her silky skin. Such slender, delicate fingers. Like the rest of her. He couldn\u2019t get enough of touching her. He\u2019d certainly touched her in the past, but always in the capacity of a friend. Affectionate. Nothing even resembling intimacy. They both knew his touch was intimate now, and it was a thrill he wouldn\u2019t soon get over.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, honey. But I want you to promise me something, okay?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately look up, he lifted his free hand and cupped her chin, his touch as delicate as her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook at me, Joss. This is important.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his, all the turmoil boiling in her gorgeous blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take as long as you need to think about it\u2014us. But I want you to promise me that you won\u2019t go back to The House. Not without me. Not for any reason. Not until this is decided between you and me, and I hope to hell that, even if you don\u2019t choose me, that you won\u2019t go there on your own. I don\u2019t want to imagine you under another man\u2019s hands. Him touching you everywhere I want to be touching you. Do this for me at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re issuing me an ultimatum,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cYou want me to promise that if I don\u2019t choose you, I\u2019ll deny what my heart wants. What I need. How is that fair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t fair,\u201d he said bluntly, watching the flash of surprise in her eyes, how they widened at his statement.</p><p>He didn\u2019t follow up on it. It was certainly too soon to lay that on her, on top of everything else the evening had wrought. She needed time to ponder other matters without him spouting declarations of love that she wouldn\u2019t believe were sincere.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking you for is a chance, Joss. Choose me. Let me initiate you into the world you want so badly. Give me that at least. If it\u2019s not what you want, if it turns out this isn\u2019t what you need, then we\u2019ll step back and reevaluate. What I want is the opportunity\u2014the exclusive opportunity, if you will. Because I\u2019ve already said that I would have suppressed my need to dominate if that\u2019s the only way I could have you. You knocked me for six when I saw you walk through the door into the common room and my world has been spinning ever since. All I want is a chance, honey. A chance. And I don\u2019t want you going back there. Not without me. Not with anyone else until I\u2019ve had the chance to prove to you that I\u2019m all you need. Is that so wrong of me to ask?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment before finally and slowly shaking her head.</p><p>He leaned forward, brushing a kiss across her furrowed brow, trying to relax the lines that had formed under the force of her concentration.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you time, Joss. All the time you need. But don\u2019t wait too long. You\u2019ve waited this long to act. There\u2019s no need to waste further time when this is something you\u2019ve obviously given a lot of thought to. You know you can trust me. I hope to hell you already do. And that\u2019s a huge step over any other man you would have chosen and a hell of a step up from the guy you came into the common room with. Because, honey? I care about you and your pleasure. Craig doesn\u2019t and he wouldn\u2019t. Given the opportunity, I\u2019ll lay the f**king world at your feet. There isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do to have you, to possess you. I just need the chance to prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>The longing in her eyes was nearly his undoing. His impassioned speech had spoken to the heart of her. Of that he was certain.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take long,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cI just need time to think. This is a lot. I mean I had no idea, Dash. Today was going to be me letting go. Not only of Carson, but of you as well. I felt like I\u2019d been a burden to you for far too long and that it was time for me to stop leaning on you. Time to let you get on with your life. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ve had any long-term relationships. Most women wouldn\u2019t appreciate you dropping everything to comfort your best friend\u2019s widow. I thought I was doing you\u2014and myself\u2014a favor by picking up the pieces and standing on my own two feet. And now you want that even more. I can\u2019t wrap my head around it, and as I said, I don\u2019t want to make a snap decision that we\u2019ll both regret. I care about you, Dash. Very much so. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever properly thanked you for all you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your thanks, Joss. I want you. Simple. Just you. And your submission. But as I said, if it turns out that this isn\u2019t what you want, then it doesn\u2019t have to be that way between us. I\u2019d sacrifice a hell of a lot to have you any way I can have you.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow filled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want that for you, Dash. I don\u2019t want you to change for me. I don\u2019t want you to be someone you aren\u2019t. That\u2019s as bad as if I\u2019d expected\u2014demanded\u2014something from Carson I knew he wasn\u2019t willing or able to give. I would have never asked him for that. So I can\u2019t ask you to deny who you are for me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her forward into his arms, his lips finding hers, silencing her. She melted so sweetly into his body that it was all he could do not to sweep her into his arms and carry her to his bed. But he\u2019d waited this long. He\u2019d wait for as long as it took for her to be ready.</p> <p>\u201cHow about you let me decide the sacrifices I make. Didn\u2019t you make sacrifices for Carson? That\u2019s what love is, honey. You wanted and needed something he couldn\u2019t give you, but it didn\u2019t make you love him any less.\u201d</p><p>She went still against him and then nestled even farther into his embrace, tucking her head underneath his chin. God, they fit. Like two puzzle pieces. He wrapped both arms around her, anchoring her there, simply enjoying the feel of her in his arms in a way he\u2019d never been able to enjoy before. Because now she knew where he stood, and she was allowing it. She damn well knew he was holding and touching her not out of friendship, but as a man who very much wanted her heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cNow about that promise?\u201d</p><p>She slowly drew away and looked him in the eye. \u201cI promise, Dash. Just give me a little time to sort through all of this. It\u2019s been a difficult day for me, and everything I thought was going to be, didn\u2019t turn out the way I expected at all. I need to process this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and started to speak, but she continued on in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to use you, Dash. And maybe I was okay with using a stranger. Someone who didn\u2019t mean anything to me. But I won\u2019t use you. Not you. I won\u2019t use you as a crutch or some experiment. You mean too much to me. Your friendship means too much to me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and tenderly stroked a piece of hair from her cheek to behind her ear. \u201cBut honey, I don\u2019t mind if you use me. As long as the end result is having you. I\u2019ve used all manner of women over the past few years. I\u2019m not proud of that fact, but it is what it is. They were all a poor substitute for what I couldn\u2019t have at the time. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pretended they were me?\u201d she whispered in an astonished tone.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m not proud of it. But there it is. I couldn\u2019t have you, so I slaked my hunger and desire for you with other women. And maybe it changes the way you\u2019ll look at me. It\u2019s a chance I have to take. But I won\u2019t lie to you. There have certainly been other women. I thought I was in a position to never have what I most wanted, so I dealt with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fault you for being with other women, Dash. God, how could I? I was married. I would have never expected you to be faithful to a woman who wasn\u2019t even yours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said simply. \u201cBecause, honey? Once I have you, there\u2019ll never be another woman. And you can take that to the bank.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise again. It was as if it had all just sunk in at once. Her eyes dulled and went hazy with shock. Her body trembled and she balled her fingers together to try to hide the fact that they were shaking.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay here tonight, Joss.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand when the protest formed on her lips. And then he cupped her chin, stroking his thumb down her jawline.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been thrown one hell of a curveball. I get that. And I\u2019m not asking you to go to bed with me. Not yet. Not tonight. But stay here in the guest room. I\u2019d feel better if you weren\u2019t alone. I\u2019ll make us breakfast in the morning and then I\u2019ll take you home. And then I\u2019ll give you time. In the morning we\u2019ll set a date. Dinner. Dancing. Whatever pleases you. Then you can give me your answer, and depending on the answer, we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed visibly and he could see the indecision in her eyes. Her weighing her options and trying to absorb the events of the day.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he whispered, angling his head to kiss her again.</p><p>She emitted a sweet sigh as his tongue pushed in to taste her all over again. Kissing her was addictive. Now that he\u2019d kissed her for the first time, he knew it would never be enough. He wanted to taste her everywhere. Her breasts. He wanted to get between her legs and savor every inch of her feminine flesh. And then he wanted to brand her. Possess her in every conceivable fashion there was to possess a woman. Until she had no doubt as to his ownership. No doubt that he was the last man who\u2019d ever make love to her.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he said again, as he reluctantly ended the kiss and drew away.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and then exhaled it in a long wave, her shoulders slumping downward with the action.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>WHEN Joss walked into Dash\u2019s kitchen the next morning, he knew she hadn\u2019t slept well, if at all. But then neither had he. How could he when he was imagining her in the next bedroom? So f**king close and yet a world away. Out of reach. He\u2019d lain in his bed, staring up at the ceiling, alternately thanking and cursing fate.</p><p>He was so close. This close to having his heart\u2019s desire, and he kept wondering if this was all some sick joke fate was playing on him. Dangling the proverbial carrot in front of his nose only to cruelly yank it away. What if Joss backed out? What if she\u2019d acted on impulse and after careful consideration chose to change her mind?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t handle it. It had been bad enough before when he\u2019d known he had no chance with her. But now? Now that he\u2019d kissed her, had tasted her, had held her in his arms? He couldn\u2019t bear it if he lost her now. Before he even had her once.</p><p>Not that once would ever be enough. Not with her. Other women? Once had been all he\u2019d ever wanted. He hadn\u2019t wanted to form relationships even though not doing so was torture in itself. He saw Joss and Carson. Was tortured by what they had and by knowing he\u2019d never have the same.</p><p>Most of the time he sucked it up and dealt. But the nights when he couldn\u2019t, when he was lonely and aching for what could never be, he\u2019d gone to The House. Sated his needs and then went back to his self-induced purgatory.</p><p>He hoped to f**k that was over. For good. He could only hope. If willing it made it happen, then she\u2019d have already been in his bed. Tied to it so she\u2019d never leave.</p><p>Desperate? That didn\u2019t even cover it. Not by a long shot.</p><p>He had no pride when it came to Joss. And he didn\u2019t give one damn.</p><p>He poured a cup of her favorite coffee and slid it along the bar as she sat down. She was wearing one of his T-shirts, a fact that made him absurdly happy, and a pair of pajama bottoms she\u2019d had to cinch tight to keep from falling down her hips. Not that he would have minded . . .</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep, baby,\u201d he said in a gentle tone.</p><p>She flinched and closed her eyes, but not before he saw a surge of grief swamp them.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t call me that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t think. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>It was what Carson had always called her.</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of other endearments I\u2019ll use for you, honey.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and a smile flirted with the corners of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s better. Surely it wasn\u2019t that bad of a night?\u201d</p><p>But even as he said it, he knew it likely had been. It had been hell for him, and he wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d been handed a huge shock. And on the anniversary of Carson\u2019s death. He inwardly winced, but then timing wasn\u2019t always his friend. He wasn\u2019t going to not act just because it was the date of his best friend\u2019s death. Fate\u2014and Joss\u2014had forced his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was a lot to take in,\u201d she admitted, bringing the cup to her lips.</p><p>She took a sip and then closed her eyes as pleasure washed away the lines of fatigue on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou spoil me,\u201d she said, lowering the cup.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I intend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo last night wasn\u2019t a dream then.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over the counter so they were face-to-face, their gazes locked. \u201cIt was a dream. My dream. Now all we have to do is make it reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so simple,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Or it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s what we choose to make it. Me? I\u2019m a straightforward guy, but then you know that already. I\u2019ve waited long enough, so you\u2019ll have to excuse my impatience now that what I want is within reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this supposed to work, Dash? I spent all night thinking\u2014wondering\u2014what this all means. Before it was surreal. It was in the abstract. Not real and in my face. I fantasized. I wondered. I even conjured up various scenarios. But now that it\u2019s here, right in front of me, I don\u2019t know what to do. What to expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we both eat. We\u2019ll talk over breakfast and I\u2019ll answer any question you want the answer to. But as I warned you last night, if you\u2019re unprepared for the answer, it\u2019s best you don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cNo, I want the truth. I want the reality. I need to know what this means. What me being with you means.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to squeeze her hand. \u201cHead over to the breakfast nook. I\u2019ll grab our plates and meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she shuffled the short distance, holding the mug of coffee between her palms as if trying to infuse her entire body with its warmth. He\u2019d much rather wrap himself around her. He\u2019d give her all the warmth she needed and so much more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Patience, Dash. Don\u2019t blow this, man. Not when you\u2019re so f**king close. You\u2019ve waited too long for this.</p><p>He tempered his eagerness and took his time gathering the plates and bringing them to the table where Joss sat. She just looked . . . right. In his house, wearing his clothes, still slightly rumpled from just coming from bed, even with her hair blow-dried from her shower. The only thing that would make it better is if she\u2019d just come from his bed.</p><p>Soon enough.</p><p>He slid the plate in front of her, watching her eyes widen, a broad smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>He smiled back at her. \u201cOf course. Did you think I\u2019d serve you anything else? Waffles with lots of butter and even more syrup. Dig in and enjoy. I\u2019ll bring back milk and the bacon.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI do love them but I can\u2019t indulge often. Too many calories!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he returned again with their drinks and the plate of bacon. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a thing wrong with the way you look, Joss. Utter perfection from the top of your pretty head to the tip of those pretty pink toes you sport.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, her cheeks going a shade of pink that nearly matched those toes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to take this . . . this change in our relationship. I\u2019m off balance. Just yesterday I was planning to let go of you much the way I had to let go of Carson. And now . . .\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand in bewilderment and let it fall back to her lap.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cYou may have thought you were getting rid of me, honey, but I\u2019m not going anywhere. I would have waited for as long as it took, but there was never a question of me making a move. You just happened to make it first.\u201d</p><p>He watched her process his declaration, the brief furrow of her brows as they knitted in consternation. As though she was still trying to understand everything he\u2019d dumped on her in the last twenty-four hours. And then she lowered her gaze, effectively putting an end to her silent contemplation.</p><p>She dug into her waffles and he watched, savoring her enjoyment over the breakfast he\u2019d prepared for her. She ate as she did everything else. Artlessly. No self-consciousness. She was a woman unafraid to show her pleasure over even the simplest things. And he intended to bring her a hell of a lot more pleasure than waffles for breakfast. He had in mind a hundred ways he wanted to spoil her.</p><p>\u201cNow, you wanted to know how this works. What exactly do you mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her fork stilled in midair on its way to her mouth. Then she lowered it, licking her lips in agitation.</p><p>\u201cYou have to know, I mean you do know now, that I\u2019m completely new to this. I told you the things I wanted, but you haven\u2019t told me what you want. How you expect this to work. What you\u2019ll want of me. What you\u2019ll do to me.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as she said the last, and he hoped she was imagining all those things he\u2019d do to her. And that those images intrigued and aroused her as much as they did him.</p><p>\u201cI think the question is, what do you want me to do to\u2014with\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>Impatience flared in her eyes, an emotion he was well acquainted with.</p><p>\u201cDash, please. Don\u2019t play games with me. This is important.\u201d</p><p>At that his expression became utterly serious. He leaned forward, his gaze boring into her.</p><p>\u201cThis is no game, Joss. Don\u2019t think that even for a minute. What I feel for you, what I want to do to you, is no game. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen help me out here,\u201d she said in a pleading tone. \u201cI\u2019m lost without a road map. I need your honesty. I need to know what you\u2019re thinking. I need to know how you see this playing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cthat if we are to get into the particulars of our relationship, I\u2019d prefer to do it in the living room where I can at least be touching you when I tell you my expectations and you outline your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t know what it is I want?\u201d</p><p>He could sense her frayed nerves. He knew she was precariously close to cracking. No matter his impatience, no matter his urgency to claim what he wanted and had wanted for a damn long time, she needed delicate handling and all the reassurance he could grant her while still remaining firm. He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014allow her to slip through his fingers when he finally had her exactly where he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, honey,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou were clear enough last night. Just because you\u2019re no longer dealing with a stranger doesn\u2019t mean that things change. If anything, you should be much freer and without inhibitions with me. I want to know every single thing that\u2019s going on in that pretty head of yours. And you\u2019ll get everything in mine as well. That I can guarantee.\u201d</p><p>She rose, simmering with impatience\u2014and nervousness. \u201cThen let\u2019s do it. I want to know. I need to know before I make any decisions.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand, pulling her into his side, wanting simply to touch her as he\u2019d wanted to from the moment she\u2019d entered his kitchen. He caressed her cheek and watched her eyes go warm with pleasure. It was a look he\u2019d savor the rest of his life. Because she saw him. Finally, she saw him.</p><p>He guided her into the living room and sat down first on the leather couch before pulling her down and into his arms. She stiffened for a moment and he simply waited. Then she relaxed and melted into his arms, laying her head on his shoulder.</p><p>He could smell the scent of his shampoo, could feel a slight dampness that hadn\u2019t been removed when she\u2019d blow-dried her hair after her shower. He liked his scent on her. If he had his way, she\u2019d smell like him all the time. His. He closed his eyes, savoring the moment\u2014and the thought\u2014that finally, she would be his. No, she hadn\u2019t yet voiced her decision but he wondered if she knew he could see acceptance in her eyes already.</p><p>She was nervous, yes, but he also saw the agreement simmering in those gorgeous blue eyes. Anticipation licked up his spine. Spread out from his groin until his balls ached with it.</p><p>She tilted her head up so she could see him and then to his surprise, she touched him. Grazed her fingertip over his jaw. It was as soft as a butterfly\u2019s wing and yet he felt it all the way to his soul. It scorched a path over his skin, his entire body alive with pleasure at her touch.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Dash. Be honest with me. What will it mean to belong to you? What do you expect of me? I need to know these things. I need to know what I\u2019m supposed to do. What you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will mean . . . everything,\u201d he breathed out. \u201cTo me and I hope to hell to you as well. You\u2019ll be mine, Joss. In every sense of the word. Mine and no other\u2019s. I will take care of your every need. Provide whatever you could possibly want. In return for your submissiveness, I\u2019ll give you the f**king world on a platter. I\u2019ll cherish you, protect you, spoil and pamper you endlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a pretty awesome deal for me. But what about you, Dash? What do you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said simply. \u201cJust you, Joss. And believe me when I say that\u2019s enough. It\u2019s all I want. It\u2019s all I need. Just you.\u201d</p><p>The yearning in her eyes took his breath away. She hadn\u2019t exaggerated. She\u2019d been as lonely and as aching as he had been the last three years.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do to me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow will you exert your dominance? And do you want my submissiveness only in bed or will it extend out of the bedroom as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you prefer?\u201d he asked, turning the question back on her.</p><p>She shook her head, her lips forming a tight, determined line. \u201cI already told you what I wanted. It\u2019s time for you to give me an idea of what you have in mind. I want it all, Dash. No sugarcoating. I want to know exactly what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want everything, Joss. And by that I mean I want your complete obedience in and out of the bedroom. I\u2019ll call the shots. You might think I\u2019m caging you, but honey, it will be the most gilded cage in the world and there won\u2019t be a woman on earth who is more cherished or spoiled than you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cNow, I think what you\u2019re asking and what you want to know relates to the more physical aspects of our relationship. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her cheeks turning that delightful shade of pink again.</p><p>\u201cI like complete submission, but surrender is more than just physical surrender. It\u2019s complete emotional surrender as well. And in some ways, emotional surrender is much more powerful and a much more precious thing to be given. It\u2019s an honor, and I don\u2019t say that lightly. A woman can give her body and never share her heart, her mind, her very soul. But a woman who gives freely of both body and mind is the most precious of gifts to receive. I don\u2019t fool myself into thinking that at any time the women I\u2019ve been with\u2014have dominated\u2014have given me anything but their body. And I was okay with that, because they didn\u2019t have my heart either. We shared our bodies and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment, allowing her to absorb his heartfelt words. Watched as she processed them, her eyes reflecting a myriad of emotions. Then he touched her, much like she\u2019d touched him, running his fingertip lovingly down the line of her jaw and finally to brush across the softness of her lips.</p><p>\u201cWith you, Joss, it will be so much different. So much better. So much more. Physically? I\u2019ll want complete and unfettered access to your body. It will be mine to do with as I please. Bondage, spankings, there are no limits. I like to inflict pain, pleasurable pain. Pain can be the sweetest of pleasures if given in the right manner. There is nothing more that I wish than to see my marks on you. The blush of red after I\u2019ve flogged your sweet ass. I want to tie you up so that you are completely helpless and at my mercy, but honey, I\u2019ll have the most tender of mercies with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had glazed, going dark and swirling with desire. He knew he was speaking to the heart of her. Every single thing she\u2019d fantasized about, she\u2019d dreamed about and ached for, he was going to give her. And he\u2019d enjoy every damn minute of making all her fantasies reality.</p><p>He dropped his hand down the curve of her neck until it rested just over the beat of her heart.</p><p>\u201cEmotionally? I want your heart. Your soul. Your complete and absolute trust and your surrender. I want your gift of submission and I\u2019ll cherish it as I cherish you. I\u2019ll respect it and never give you cause to regret your decision. That\u2019s the promise I make you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in bewilderment, her eyes flashing, shadows lurking in the hollows. \u201cHow did you know? How could you know, Dash? How can you see what I\u2019ve only been able to see myself lately? How could you possibly reach into my head and know?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed her brow, running his hand around and then up and down her back, reveling in the feel of her in his arms. Finally in his arms.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s what I want most too, honey. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted for so very long. And I\u2019ll make you another promise. I won\u2019t rush you. I won\u2019t overwhelm you. We have all the time in the world. Yours will be a gentle initiation into my world. Now that I know you can finally be mine, I intend to savor every moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as though I\u2019ve already made my decision,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you? Perhaps you need time to justify it, but you\u2019ve already made your choice, Joss. I saw it in your eyes when you walked into my kitchen this morning, and it was all I could do not to do a fist pump or something equally adolescent. You make me that way. Like a kid just gifted with his fondest desire. Birthday and Christmas all rolled into one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014I need\u2014to talk with Chessy and Kylie. Especially Kylie. She\u2019ll be hurt by this. She won\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Then her eyes widened in alarm and she glanced frantically at the clock above the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Dash! I have to call them! I completely forgot. I promised I\u2019d call them. They were worried. Chessy said if she didn\u2019t hear from me she was calling the police. I hope she hasn\u2019t already!\u201d</p><p>Dash chuckled. \u201cGo call the girls. Tell them you\u2019re in good hands. There\u2019s plenty of time to explain to them later. But for now put them at ease. I\u2019m glad you have such loyal, devoted friends. Our friends,\u201d he amended. \u201cAnd Joss, they will understand. If they love you\u2014and they do\u2014they\u2019ll only want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>She surprised him again, this time framing his face in her hands and kissing him full on the mouth. Liquid pleasure rushed through his veins unlike anything he\u2019d ever known. He allowed her free rein, held himself back and let her do the kissing, the exploring. And when she pulled away, her eyes were glazed with passion, surely a mirror of his own.</p><p>Oh yes, she saw him. He was filled with triumph and intense satisfaction. The blinders had come off, and she saw him, not as a friend, not as support, but as a man who wanted her with everything he had.</p><p>And she wanted him.</p><p>There would be many wonderful days ahead, but he\u2019d always remember this one. Not that he harbored any idea that it would be easy and that they wouldn\u2019t have obstacles to face and overcome. But they would get there. He\u2019d make damn sure of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she said in a husky voice. \u201cI just need to tell them I\u2019m okay. And yes, I\u2019ll explain everything to them later. They\u2019ll want to know. For now I\u2019ll just tell them that I backed out of The House. Kylie will be glad. She didn\u2019t want me to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe worries about you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and she has good reason to fear the monsters of the world,\u201d Joss said painfully. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want for me what she had to endure for all those years. She fears dominance, control, abuse and being powerless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Dash said quietly. \u201cBut you don\u2019t fear that from me, do you, Joss?\u201d</p><p>The shock in her eyes filled him with fierce satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dash! Never!\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again before pushing her upward from the couch. \u201cGo and make your calls before the police get involved. If I know Chessy, she was absolutely serious about calling the police. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she hasn\u2019t hauled Tate over to your house already. You call the girls. I\u2019ll call Tate and let him know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p> <p>SEVEN</p><p>JOSS leaned back on her couch with a deep sigh and flopped her head backward to stare up at the ceiling. She felt emotionally wrung out, and for the first time she couldn\u2019t blame it on Carson\u2019s death or the anniversary of it.</p><p>It was a different kind of turmoil, one she\u2019d never imagined when she\u2019d bravely\u2014or rather thought she was bravely\u2014taking control of her future. Now that future was one huge question mark.</p><p>She sighed again and closed her eyes, weariness assailing her. She would have drifted off, despite the chaos her mind was in, if the doorbell hadn\u2019t rung. And rung again. Insistently.</p><p>She knew without confirming that it was likely Chessy or Kylie or even both. They wouldn\u2019t have been put off by Joss\u2019s phone call simply telling them she\u2019d backed out. They\u2019d want to hear the entire story themselves.</p> <p>With a resigned groan, she pushed herself up from the couch and shuffled toward the door.</p><p>Dash had dropped her off barely half an hour earlier after all the necessary phone calls had been made. He\u2019d kissed her. She shivered as she remembered the raw desire she\u2019d seen in his eyes. Felt the heat of his kiss. Remembered his fingertips sliding down her face to her neck as he\u2019d said good-bye and that he\u2019d see her soon.</p><p>The promise in his voice had given her much to think about. Now that she was back on her own turf, so to speak, she had a lot to contemplate and process.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door she wanted to groan again. Chessy and Kylie both stood staring back at her. Chessy\u2019s gaze was sharp and discerning, looking over Joss as if she could peel back the layers of Joss\u2019s thoughts. Kylie looked more uncertain\u2014and worried.</p><p>Chessy pushed by her, Kylie following behind in her wake.</p><p>\u201cOkay, spill it, girlfriend. We don\u2019t buy that bullshit you said about simply deciding to opt out of The House and spending the evening with Dash instead.\u201d</p> <p>Joss followed Chessy and Kylie into her living room and flopped back on the couch she\u2019d just vacated.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to leave a single detail out,\u201d Chessy continued. \u201cI\u2019ll sic Tate on Dash if I have to. One way or another, I\u2019ll get the dirt, so you may as well cough it up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Kylie asked anxiously. \u201cDid something happen last night, Joss? Did someone hurt you or frighten you?\u201d</p><p>Joss smiled ruefully. What to say to those questions? Yes, no and yes?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she reassured. \u201cHonestly. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s lips tightened and she got that \u201caha\u201d look on her face that suggested she\u2019d known something was up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d Kylie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat really happened, Joss?\u201d Chessy pushed. \u201cI saw you yesterday. I heard you. And whether you had any apprehensiveness, I know you, and you were bound and determined to go to The House and see it through. And then I get a phone call saying oh never mind, I didn\u2019t go and I\u2019m at home?\u201d</p> <p>She snorted in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI went,\u201d Joss hedged.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s forehead furrowed. \u201cBut you said you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t go,\u201d Joss corrected. \u201cI merely said I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Chessy asked quietly. \u201cWhat happened, Joss?\u201d</p><p>Joss sighed. \u201cDash happened.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s mouth rounded into an O about the time realization sparked in her eyes. \u201cOh shit. Dash was there, wasn\u2019t he? Oh my God, did he freak?\u201d</p><p>Kylie looked absolutely confused as she jerked her head back and forth between Joss and Chessy, trying to keep up with what was going on.</p><p>Before Joss could answer, Chessy pushed forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Joss. I should have warned you, but shit. Dash is hardly in there. I mean I know he\u2019s a member, but it didn\u2019t even occur to me to tell you that, because what were the odds that he\u2019d show up on the night you went?\u201d</p><p>Kylie shook her head in bewilderment. \u201cDash\u2014our Dash\u2014goes to The House? Why?\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s cheeks warmed and she and Chessy exchanged looks of understanding.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Dominant,\u201d Chessy said gently. \u201cLike Tate.\u201d</p><p>Kylie went silent, processing the revelation. Tension vibrated from her, and it made Joss uneasy for what she\u2019d have to tell both her friends. But especially Kylie.</p><p>Kylie was . . . Well, she was very black-and-white. Her worldview was very narrow and she didn\u2019t often venture outside the parameters she\u2019d set. She had good reason to be as she was, but it didn\u2019t always make things easy. Kylie was rigid, and this would likely throw her for a loop.</p><p>\u201cHe was there when I walked in with another man,\u201d Joss said in a low voice. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go well.\u201d</p><p>Chessy winced. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hauled me out and took me back to his house intending to lecture me after he scraped an inch of skin off my hide. He didn\u2019t think I had any clue what I was getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you inform him differently?\u201d Chessy asked.</p><p>Joss nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s when it got . . . interesting.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s perplexed look deepened and Chessy\u2019s eyes widened. Both of her friends sat forward, picking up on Joss\u2019s tone.</p><p>Joss sucked in her breath, knowing her friends would know sooner or later and she\u2019d rather it come from her.</p><p>\u201cDash said . . .\u201d</p><p>She struggled with just how to put it. This was much harder than she imagined because she still hadn\u2019t come to terms with it herself!</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Chessy prompted.</p><p>\u201cHe said that if that was what I wanted\u2014what I needed\u2014then he was going to be the only man who gave those things to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Chessy breathed.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s reaction was a bit more explosive. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t understand. He what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants me,\u201d Joss said in a low voice. \u201cHas wanted me a long time. I didn\u2019t know. I feel so stupid, but I had no idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cI mean I used to think, a long time ago, the way he looked at you sometimes . . . I thought there was something there. But then you and Carson were so happy and Dash remained friends with you both, and Dash never made a move after Carson died, so I thought I imagined it.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s face flushed with anger. \u201cHe had a thing for you when you were married to my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he ever acted on it,\u201d Chessy gently chided. \u201cYou can\u2019t control who you\u2019re attracted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarson knew,\u201d Joss murmured. \u201cDash told me that Carson knew and that it didn\u2019t affect their friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would certainly prefer him to some stranger you pick up at The House,\u201d Kylie said, an edge still to her voice. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried about this. You and him. I never imagined Dash to be that kind of person. I worry that he could hurt you physically and emotionally, and I worry about the strain it might put on all our friendships.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s features tightened. \u201cThat kind of person? What\u2019s that supposed to mean? Tate\u2019s that kind of person, Kylie, and he\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Kylie said wearily. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Joss, okay? It seems like lately she\u2019s making a lot of impulsive decisions, and I don\u2019t want her to get hurt. And I worry about this thing with Dash. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the fact he was attracted to his best friend\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Impatience and frustration warred with Joss. \u201cI\u2019ve considered all of those things,\u201d she snapped out. \u201cI\u2019ve taken into account how it would affect our circle of friends, especially if it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath before continuing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never looked at Dash as anything but a friend until now, and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that. I hate feeling like I\u2019m betraying my dead husband for even considering this. I would have never been unfaithful to Carson, even if I\u2019d known that Dash had feelings for me. And I don\u2019t like you questioning his integrity because he had feelings for me that he never acted on until now.\u201d</p><p>Kylie grimaced and looked away. Chessy leaned farther forward, taking Joss\u2019s hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cYes, it could change things,\u201d Chessy said in a calm voice. \u201cBut you can\u2019t live your life without taking risks. If this is something you want to go for, you at least need to try. It\u2019s worse to live with the what-ifs than it is to take the plunge and fail. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have everything to lose,\u201d Joss said in a raw voice. \u201cI lost Carson and it would devastate me to ever lose Dash\u2019s friendship. It would devastate me to lose yours or Kylie\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to lose anyone else I love.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s face filled with love and understanding. It made Joss\u2019s eyes go watery, and damn it, enough with the tears. It was time to move beyond all that. To stop being such an emotionally fragile person.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, life is all about risk and there are no guarantees, as you well know,\u201d Chessy said gently. \u201cLet me ask you something. If you knew back when you and Carson got married that you\u2019d only have a few short years with him, if you knew he\u2019d die, would you have done anything differently? Would you have walked away from him then to spare yourself the pain of losing him later?\u201d</p><p>The question shook Joss to her core. Without even thinking about it, her response was immediate.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course I wouldn\u2019t have walked away! I\u2019d do it all over again, and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing, even knowing I\u2019d lose him. Because what time we did have together was wonderful. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything in the world,\u201d she said painfully.</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you willing to take a chance with Dash?\u201d Chessy asked. \u201cWhat if it works out? What if he makes you happy? What if he gives you what you want and need? What if you find love again? What if you have one wonderful year with him, and he gives you what you need and then you split up? Wouldn\u2019t you rather have that year and not live with regret over not ever giving it a chance? You can\u2019t stop taking risks just because you lost someone already. It\u2019s no way to live, in fear of living in case of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Kylie said grudgingly. \u201cAnd I do want you to be happy, Joss. Even if it\u2019s not with Carson. I\u2019ll support you no matter what happens with Dash. As you told me, we\u2019re sisters, and we\u2019re best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Joss said sincerely. \u201cThank you both. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without such wonderful friends\u2014sisters. You\u2019ve both given me a lot to think about. And I do have to give this careful consideration.\u201d</p><p>Chessy squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you to it then. Just know that I\u2019m only a phone call away. And I also want you to know, that no matter what, I love you. Tate and I both love you. And he\u2019ll personally kick Dash\u2019s ass if he ever hurts you.\u201d</p><p>Joss smiled, but sadness tugged at her heart. She didn\u2019t want to cause a rift between her friends. She didn\u2019t want Tate to ever become angry with Dash over her.</p><p>Kylie rose and then leaned down to hug Joss fiercely. Joss returned the hug and then pushed herself up to go walk her friends out.</p><p>\u201cKeep in touch, hon, okay?\u201d Chessy said. \u201cAnd if you ever need to talk, just pick up the phone. Night or day. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Joss said truthfully. \u201cAnd thank you both again for caring about me. I\u2019m not going to do anything to cause anyone hurt. I hope you both know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Kylie assured. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you with the things I said. I do love you, Joss. And I do want you to be happy. I know that Carson would want you to be happy. It takes a pretty special guy to remain friends with a man who had feelings for his wife. If Carson could and did live with that, then so can I.\u201d</p><p>Joss hugged them both and then watched as they walked down the paved sidewalk to where they were parked out front. She stood there as they drove away and then she went back inside to get her purse and her keys.</p><p>It was automatic to get in her car and drive toward the cemetery. She wasn\u2019t even aware of what she was doing until she neared the gates leading inside. She braked and came to a stop at the entryway, staring ahead at all the headstones that dotted the landscape.</p><p>She\u2019d been coming to talk to Carson. To explain about Dash and ask Carson\u2019s blessing. When she\u2019d sworn she was moving on, letting go, and wouldn\u2019t return here. Not again.</p><p>With a shake of her head, she backed up enough to execute a U-turn and then drove away, aiming her car in the direction of Dash\u2019s subdivision.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>HE shouldn\u2019t have brought her home. He shouldn\u2019t have left her alone after dropping such a bomb on her. He should have kept her here with him, within touching distance. Not given her time and space for her to change her mind or talk herself out of what he knew she was agreeing to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dash gripped the back of his neck as he poured another cup of coffee and glanced at the remnants of his and Joss\u2019s earlier breakfast. In a kitchen that had never entertained another woman. Certainly not breakfast after a sleepover.</p><p>He liked her stamp in his home and in his space. Liked the remembrance of her walking into his kitchen wearing his shirt, and those sleepy, beautiful eyes.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to let her go. Not after finally making a move to make her his. But it was the right thing to do.</p><p>You had to let her go to see if she\u2019d come back to you.</p> <p>He shook his head at the absurdity of his thoughts. It wasn\u2019t like him to spout hokey psychological shit, and he wasn\u2019t one of those who indulged in philosophical crap \u201clike if you love someone, set them free.\u201d</p><p>He was more of a \u201cif you love them, then never let them go\u201d person. And yet he hadn\u2019t kept Joss. He\u2019d driven her home and had very civilly informed her that they\u2019d be seeing one another soon. And then he\u2019d kissed her. Not as he\u2019d wanted to. She\u2019d looked too fragile, too close to unraveling at the seams, and so his kiss had been one of comfort and reassurance. Not a kiss of a man consumed with passion for the woman he was holding.</p><p>He looked up when his cell rang, and he remembered he had an important call today. He cursed, because his mind was not on business. Bringing in a new partner, while necessary, wasn\u2019t ideal at the moment. He\u2019d wanted to ease Joss into it, and then everything had changed. Would this put a barrier between them at a time when she was finally seeing him as more than a friend?</p><p>He picked up the phone and strode into his office, his mind quickly shifting gears to the task ahead. He had to put Joss out of his mind, at least until he squared away this particular matter. And then? He was pulling a full-court press. He missed Carson too, but his best friend was gone. His business partner was gone. It was time to start thinking about his own best interests instead of pushing them down, as he\u2019d done for the last six years.</p><p>He and Carson had founded a successful consulting business. Corporations called on them when they needed or wanted to downsize and cut costs. Most of their contracts came from the many oil companies in the Houston area, but they also did consulting work for other large corporations and even a few smaller ones.</p> <p>Carson\u2019s natural affinity for people and Dash\u2019s analytical mind had been a very successful combination. The two had worked in tandem, Carson on the front lines, wining and dining potential customers, Dash on the back end, doing the analysis, drawing up the proposals that Carson would later present.</p><p>Only now Dash had been forced to be both the front line and the back end. By bringing Jensen on, Dash would effectively take over Carson\u2019s responsibilities and push himself to the forefront while Jensen would handle the behind-the-scenes details.</p><p>\u201cDash Corbin,\u201d he said, when he entered the confines of his home office.</p><p>He closed the door behind him and then went to his desk to open his laptop as Jensen Tucker gave his greeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called,\u201d Dash said. \u201cWe have a lot to discuss. Did you have time to look over the documents I couriered over?\u201d</p><p>Jensen Tucker was someone Dash had met through business a few years earlier. He and Carson had dealings with him, and Dash respected the other man. Thought he\u2019d be perfect as a partner when he and Carson looked to expand. That was all before Carson\u2019s death.</p> <p>Dash had set aside their plans and focused on keeping the business afloat because he\u2019d wanted to make damn sure Joss and Kylie were both provided for. Kylie was a damn good office manager, but losing Carson had put a strain on her. Dash had wanted Kylie to take a break from work. Take a few weeks off to deal with the grief and shock over her brother\u2019s death, but she\u2019d insisted on coming in to work. She\u2019d needed the outlet, something to occupy her time, but Dash knew it was a temporary bandage. He wasn\u2019t sure if Kylie had ever truly dealt with that grief or accepted Carson\u2019s death.</p><p>Neither Joss nor Kylie would likely take well to Dash replacing Carson, but perhaps Joss would be more accepting than Kylie since Kylie was the one who would have to work with someone other than Dash and her brother.</p><p>The two men spoke of their ideas, Jensen adding several of his own that Dash found appealing. They\u2019d met several times already but all that was left was for Jensen to formally accept and the two businesses to merge.</p><p>What was once Breckenridge and Corbin would now become Corbin and Associates. Leaving room for further expansion down the road if he and Jensen so chose that route.</p><p>Jensen wasn\u2019t an arrogant ass who insisted his name be plastered or that he receive credit. Dash wouldn\u2019t have minded giving the man his due, but he was content to leave Dash\u2019s name at the forefront and work more behind the scenes.</p><p>Where before Carson had been the front man and Dash had worked out the kinks, troubleshot and worked the back end, now Dash would take his place, leaving Jensen to do more of the legwork.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t planned it as a way to be able to give Joss more of his time and not be so wrapped up in his work. After all he hadn\u2019t had any clue that he would be making a move this quickly. But the timing was perfect, because if he had his way, work would take more of a backseat to his relationship with Joss now that he finally had her precisely where he wanted her.</p><p>The men spoke several more minutes, confirming what Dash already knew. That Jensen would be joining him. All that was left was for him to come on board and for Dash to announce it.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing, Jensen,\u201d Dash said at the end of their conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need time\u2014a few days\u2014before we make this public. I want to tell Joss and Kylie myself.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cAre they resistant to my presence?\u201d</p><p>Dash could hear the wariness in the other man\u2019s voice. The hint of irritation that Dash would approach a business decision allowing emotion to rule. But Dash wasn\u2019t heartless.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about your presence,\u201d Dash said. \u201cAnd I want it to come from me. No one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will they be trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dash said shortly.</p><p>\u201cI can give you a few days. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need. We\u2019ll meet on Monday. My office.\u201d</p><p>Jensen agreed and then rung off, leaving Dash sitting at his desk in brooding silence.</p><p>He\u2019d told Jensen the women wouldn\u2019t be trouble. And they wouldn\u2019t, simply because they had no choice in the matter. Carson had left Joss enough to keep her financially protected her entire life, but the business had been left in Dash\u2019s hands. Joss had no power, no decisions. She\u2019d have to accept whatever Dash decided. As would Kylie. But neither had to like it, and Dash didn\u2019t want this to drive a wedge between them. Any of them.</p><p>When he finally made his way from his office back toward the kitchen, he heard the sound of a vehicle outside his house. Frowning, because he wasn\u2019t expecting company, he walked toward the window that looked out to his drive.</p><p>To his surprise, he saw Joss\u2019s car parked there. But she hadn\u2019t gotten out. She was still sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, her hands curled tightly around the wheel.</p><p>A curl of apprehension snaked down his spine as he stepped out the front door. When she saw him, the car door opened and she stepped out.</p><p>It was obvious even from a distance that she was upset. She was pale, her eyes large and wounded. And when she lifted her gaze to meet his, fear gripped him.</p><p>He was ten kinds of a fool for pushing her so hard, so soon. This was it. She was here to tell him . . . no. And this time, she\u2019d run, and she\u2019d keep running. He may never see her again, and that simply wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>He\u2019d lost her before he\u2019d ever had a chance to win her.</p><p>She looked desperately unhappy. Sadness shadowed her eyes and that was the very last thing he wanted for her. It hurt him to see her like this. It hurt him to know that he was the reason for her sadness.</p><p>\u201cJoss,\u201d he began.</p><p>To his surprise, the moment he said her name, she hurried toward him and threw herself into his arms. He caught her against him, holding her so she didn\u2019t fall. So they both didn\u2019t fall. And he savored the warmth of her body, her softness tucked so sweetly against him.</p><p>For a moment he closed his eyes and inhaled the scent of her hair, wondering if this was good-bye.</p><p>\u201cOh Dash,\u201d she said, his name catching on a sob.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey? Why are you so unhappy?\u201d</p><p>He stroked a hand down her hair, pushing it behind her ear as he gently pulled her away so he could look into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was on my way to the cemetery,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI was going to explain to Carson. To ask for his blessing or perhaps make him understand. It sounds so stupid, I know.\u201d</p><p>Dash slowly shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid, honey. He was your husband. You loved him very much. It\u2019s only natural that you\u2019d want to share this kind of thing with him.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as a tear slid down one cheek. That single tear nearly ripped him in two. He didn\u2019t want Joss sad any longer. He wanted her happy. Even if it was without him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I promised him\u2014myself\u2014that I wouldn\u2019t go there anymore. It\u2019s not how I want to remember him. I can\u2019t go there anymore. It hurts too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came here instead. Why?\u201d he asked, dreading her response.</p><p>She lifted her gaze back to his, emotion smoldering in those beautiful eyes. Eyes that were drenched with moisture. Misery clouded the depths, and he swore viciously to himself, because this wasn\u2019t what he wanted at all.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to try,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t know unless I\u2014we\u2014try.\u201d</p><p>His insides caved in, relief overwhelming him. His knees wobbled and he had to steady himself so they didn\u2019t both end up on the ground.</p><p>Then he hugged her to him, holding her, savoring her touch and smell. He pressed his lips to the top of her head and closed his eyes, giving silent thanks that she hadn\u2019t bolted. That she had enough guts to give them a chance.</p><p>It was all he\u2019d ever ask. If he could have this, he\u2019d never ask for another single thing in his life.</p><p>\u201cJoss, look at me, honey,\u201d he said gently, putting enough distance between them so he could angle her head upward. So she met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you this unhappy, then you have to know I won\u2019t ask it of you. I only want you to be happy. For us both to be happy. Preferably with one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t know if you\u2014this\u2014will make me happy unless we try,\u201d she said softly. She licked her lips, nervousness evident in her features. \u201cI do want to try, Dash. But you have to promise to be patient with me. I don\u2019t know what to do here. I don\u2019t know how to act or react. I\u2019m without a guidebook. This isn\u2019t something I ever imagined happening.\u201d</p><p>He caressed her cheek, wiping away the last traces of tears.</p><p>\u201cWe have all the time in the world, Joss. No rush. No impatience. Give me your trust. And your submission. I\u2019ll do my very best to ensure you never regret it.\u201d</p><p>Her expressive eyes gleamed with sudden light. Her pupils flared and he saw the stirrings of desire in the deep pools. Asking for her submission had fired her imagination. Had reminded her of all she wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor now, come inside. Let me make you a cup of coffee. There\u2019s nothing more I\u2019d love than to just sit with you awhile. We can talk. Just be. We\u2019ll talk about us. Make a date. I want to take my time with this, Joss. It\u2019s too important to rush. I\u2019ve waited this long. I\u2019ll wait a hell of a lot longer if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she murmured, her eyes warming.</p><p>He saw her acceptance. Not only of what he proposed, but of the inevitability of them. As a couple. He watched closely for any signs of hesitation. Of fear or uncertainty. But her gaze remained steady until he was satisfied that this was truly what she wanted. A chance. His chance to have her.</p><p>He was nearly undone by the implications. Joss in his arms. In his bed. His.</p><p>\u201cThere are other things I need to discuss with you,\u201d he said, reminded of his conversation just moments ago with Jensen.</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, evidently picking up on the change in his mood.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Dash? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He tucked her hand into his and then guided her into his house.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2019s wrong. Just something I want you to hear from me.\u201d</p><p>She tensed but remained silent as he took her into the kitchen where the half pot of coffee remained from earlier.</p><p>He poured two cups and warmed them in the microwave before returning to her, handing her one of the mugs.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go into the living room where we\u2019ll be comfortable,\u201d he urged.</p><p>When he had her settled on the couch, he took the armchair that was diagonal to the sofa, even though what he wanted most was her in his arms. Against him. Her body warming his.</p><p>He sipped idly at the coffee, wondering which of the two tasks he should tackle first. Cement their relationship? Or possibly crush her with the news that he was replacing Carson?</p><p>He winced, deciding to postpone the latter until after they\u2019d discussed their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI know this was a lot for you to take in, especially on the day of Carson\u2019s death,\u201d he began. \u201cI need you to understand that I didn\u2019t plan it that way, Joss. You forced my hand when I saw you at The House. Yes, I absolutely intended to make my move. Soon. But the anniversary of your husband\u2019s death wasn\u2019t when I wanted to begin this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Dash. I don\u2019t remember if I told you that or not. But I am. Sorry for the way it happened. For it even happening at all. You have to know that wasn\u2019t one of my prouder moments when you saw me at The House. I was . . . embarrassed. That certainly wasn\u2019t the way I would have wanted to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t intend to tell me at all,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She grimaced and then slowly shook her head. \u201cNo. How could I? You were Carson\u2019s best friend. I thought your loyalties would be with him. I imagined if you knew, you wouldn\u2019t approve. And I couldn\u2019t bear your disapproval, Dash. I couldn\u2019t lose you. Not over something so . . .\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, obviously unsure of the word to describe her wants and needs. He leaned forward, catching her gaze and holding it.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I hope we\u2019ve gotten past your fear of my disapproval. Secondly, your desires aren\u2019t meaningless, Joss. They\u2019re who you are. They make you who you are, and you can\u2019t change that. Not for me. Not for anyone. You shouldn\u2019t have to. I understand why you suppressed that part of yourself while you were married to Carson. I get that. But honey, he\u2019s gone. You said it best. He\u2019s not coming back, and there\u2019s no reason for you to continue denying your wants and needs, who you are and what you are. Even if I weren\u2019t who I am, I would never expect you to be anything but who and what you want to be. But as we share the same needs and desires, it\u2019s my hope that we can forge ahead and discover a new world . . . together.\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed visibly and then leaned back, running a hand through her silky hair. \u201cSo what happens next, Dash? I was being honest when I said I\u2019m without a map. Now that I\u2019ve gotten to this point, admitted to myself and to you what I want and need, what do we do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and then because he could no longer stand the distance between them, he got up and slid onto the couch next to her. It was a compulsion to touch her now that he could. After so long of keeping neutrality between them, the door was finally open. They were embarking down a path there was no returning from.</p><p>Regardless of whether things worked out long term for them, there was never any going back to the easygoing friendship they\u2019d maintained for so many years. Part of Dash embraced it wholeheartedly while another part of him feared irreparable damage between them. Of opening a rift that could never be mended.</p><p>It was a risk he was willing to take, even if it required the utmost caution. By nature he was cautious. All the risk he incurred was in his business life. His personal life had always been carefully ordered, strictly maintained. His dominance exerted itself, and he always kept his emotions and actions in check. Except when it came to Joss. She brought out another side to him, one never seen or experienced by others.</p><p>She made him want to throw caution to the wind and revel in the storm.</p> <p>Never had he imagined that the part of him he feared she couldn\u2019t accept was the one thing she wanted the most. He\u2019d always assumed that he\u2019d have to suppress his natural tendencies if he wanted any chance with her. Never would he have dreamed that she\u2019d not only accept it\u2014and him\u2014but that she would overtly seek it out.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know whether it made him the luckiest bastard alive, or perhaps the most stupid. Only time\u2014and Joss\u2014would tell.</p><p>If only he had a window into the future. Just a glimpse down the road to see if this thing between them flourished and thrived. Then he\u2019d know if he was making the right choice for them both.</p><p>But no, there was no looking into the future. Nothing but here and now and his instincts and heart\u2019s desire to guide him. He just prayed for the wisdom to differentiate between what he craved most and what she actually wanted and needed.</p><p>Desire and frustration could color a man\u2019s perception for sure. They were two emotions he was well acquainted with since meeting Joss the first time. Wanting, needing her with his every breath. Knowing she would never be his. That she belonged to another man. His best friend.</p><p>Fate, the fickle bitch, was finally smiling on him. He just hoped to hell she didn\u2019t get the last laugh.</p> <p>He pulled Joss into his arms and reclined against the back of the couch, bearing her so she cuddled against his chest, molded into his side, her hair teasing his chin. And her scent. God, she smelled so damn good. He was torturing himself needlessly. She was here in his living room, in his arms, asking him what was next. All he had to do was take the leap. Close his eyes and jump.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you, honey,\u201d he murmured, trying to collect his scattered thoughts. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that we take things nice and slow. The last thing I want is to scare or hurt you. But I\u2019m tired of waiting, Joss. I\u2019ve wanted you so damn long and now that you\u2019re here and the gloves are off, I\u2019m ready to move forward.\u201d</p><p>She slid her open hand over his chest, stopping right over his heart. He picked up her fingers and kissed the tips of each, enjoying the way she shivered in reaction.</p><p>So responsive. So expressive. God, what she\u2019d be like in bed. His bed.</p><p>His dick roared to life and swelled against the confines of his jeans. What had been a comfortable position was now torture as his body screamed for release.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt or frighten me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, Dash. I know you. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught because he sensed there was more to her statement than just those simple words. A request?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, honey? Be honest with me. What are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>She pushed upward, levering herself so she stared down into his eyes. Her dark hair, such a startling contrast to her sapphire-colored eyes, tumbled downward, spilling onto his chest until he ached to bury his fingers in it and kiss her until neither of them could breathe.</p><p>She licked her lips and then nibbled delicately at her bottom lip, a sign of her nervousness. But her eyes were earnest as she stared down at him.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to take things slow. I know you don\u2019t want to rush or make a mistake. But I don\u2019t want to wait. I want to feel, Dash. I want to live again. I want to feel like a woman again. I\u2019ve been so alone and . . . cold,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo very cold for so very long. I want to remember how passion feels. How it feels when a man makes love to me, when he touches me. And I don\u2019t want you to ask. Does that sound stupid? I want you to take . . . control. I just want you to do whatever it is you want to do. I want you to make the decisions for both of us.\u201d</p><p>He stopped breathing. His heart was pounding so hard that he was surprised it wasn\u2019t making an audible sound. His blood pumped through his veins with such force that he felt lightheaded.</p><p>She was handing him everything he\u2019d ever dreamed of on a silver platter. Her trust. Her submission. Her. Just her.</p><p>He cupped her cheek, caressing the baby-soft skin with his thumb. \u201cBe very sure of what you\u2019re asking, Joss. Very sure. Because I want it. I want it all. And I\u2019ll take it. You have to be damn sure you\u2019re prepared for the reality, though.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, chill bumps racing across her arms and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>NINE</p><p>JOSS\u2019S heart was racing, her pulse thundering in her veins as she took in Dash\u2019s dead serious expression. There was something incredibly sexy about the way he looked at her right now. So intense. So determined. But it was the edge in his expression, the tightness of his jaw and features, that gave her a giddy thrill.</p><p>Like she\u2019d just unleashed the lion. A very hungry lion. And she was about to be devoured whole.</p><p>She shivered uncontrollably at the image of him biting her, sinking those perfectly straight white teeth into her tender flesh. Of him marking her, possessing her, branding her.</p><p>All the things she\u2019d fantasized about with a dominant male. Only she\u2019d never imagined Dash in the role of the man dominating her, and now? It was all she could think of. Dream of. Fantasize about.</p><p>He\u2019d made her see him for the virile, mouthwateringly gorgeous, alpha male he was. He\u2019d forced her to see beyond the veil of friendship and she liked what she saw. Anticipated what she saw and now knew to be true.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d thrown down the gauntlet, would he react to the challenge? Would he take her at her word or would he be cautious and take it slow?</p><p>It was the last thing she wanted. She didn\u2019t want caution or reserve. She wanted it all. Everything he had to give her and more. She could see the hunger in his eyes, could see the lust and desire as if it were written in ink on his forehead. He made her feel alive for the first time in three long years. He made her feel feminine and desirable. Beautiful. He made her feel beautiful.</p><p>And she\u2019d been honest. She didn\u2019t want to think. Didn\u2019t want to have to make decisions. Maybe that made her a coward, but she wanted to relinquish absolute control. She wanted to . . . surrender.</p><p>\u201cGod, Joss.\u201d</p><p>Her name came out a harsh whisper, rushing out in a forceful exhalation of his breath. His eyes burned, a quick and sudden fire that turned her insides to water.</p><p>\u201cKnow what you\u2019re saying, honey. Understand what you\u2019re asking. Because I\u2019ll only ask this once. If you agree, if this is what you want, then there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019ll be mine and only mine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her throat too tight to give voice to her assent.</p><p>\u201cThe words, honey. Give me the words so there\u2019s no misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she croaked. \u201cGod, Dash, what do I have to do? Beat you over the head with it? Don\u2019t make me beg. I want this. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Regret shimmered in his rich brown eyes, and he put a finger to her mouth. She wanted to lick it, to see if he tasted as good as he looked, as she imagined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never have to beg. Not for me you won\u2019t. I\u2019ll give you whatever you want. Unconditionally and without reserve. And I\u2019ll never question you again. But there are a few things we need to get out of the way\u2014important things\u2014before we get swept away in everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she quietly agreed.</p><p>His voice had dropped, the tone serious, his gaze brooding and yet . . . hopeful. Almost as if he was afraid she would change her mind and cut and run. Maybe she couldn\u2019t blame him. If it was true that he\u2019d waited all this time, had wanted her all this time, he likely felt like the rug could be pulled out from underneath him at any moment. Or perhaps he thought this was all a dream, one he\u2019d wake from and it would all be gone.</p><p>It was a feeling she was well acquainted with. Ever since she\u2019d seen him in The House, her world had been irrevocably altered. It would never be the same no matter what happened between them.</p><p>She feared that. Her biggest fear was that this wouldn\u2019t work out, that it would end badly and she would have lost not only Carson, but also a man she considered her friend. Perhaps not her best friend. Her friendship with Chessy and Kylie was steadfast, but it was a different kind of friendship than the one she had\u2014or rather used to have\u2014with Dash.</p><p>When she\u2019d decided to let him go on the same day she relinquished her hold on Carson\u2019s memory, she hadn\u2019t been happy. Far from it. She\u2019d felt as though she were losing someone important to her all over again. Only now she stood to gain far more.</p><p>Or she could lose it all.</p><p>Maybe she was crazy for even entertaining this. She and Dash may well be better off shutting the door that had been opened. But could they ever return to a normal friendship now?</p><p>No. Not after all of this. Not after he\u2019d laid it all on the line. Even if she ended the relationship before it ever began, there was no going back to the way it was. Ever.</p><p>Her only option was to pursue this. Lay it out just as he\u2019d laid it out so bluntly. And hope like hell that she didn\u2019t lose more than she gained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve explained what it is you want and need,\u201d Dash said, his voice now controlled as he stared intently at her. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t discussed my needs. My expectations. Nor have we discussed your boundaries and what happens if I ever cross them.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. They were fast venturing into unknown territory. Of course she had no idea of Dash\u2019s expectations. How could she when she\u2019d never dreamed he was the kind of man she craved? A dominant, alpha male unafraid to take what he wanted. Not ask. Take.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want a man who asked permission. She didn\u2019t want a man who treated her like a fragile piece of glass. Carson cherished her. No doubt about it. And she loved him for it. Loved him for always treating her so precious. But now? She wanted a man not afraid to cross the line. Because she had no idea what the boundaries were that Dash spoke of. Hers. And she wouldn\u2019t until he crossed them.</p><p>She wanted to see just how far she could be pushed. She was seized by a decadent thrill at the thought of exploring the darker edges of desire. Sex. Power. Dominance. She wanted it all. Wanted to revel in a strong man\u2019s authority and control. Oh how she craved it with every fiber of her being.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with yours,\u201d Dash said, closely examining her as if he could read her thoughts.</p><p>Maybe he could. He and Carson had both mercilessly teased her about being an open book. They\u2019d told her she\u2019d never make it as a business partner, not that she had any desire to join their company. She didn\u2019t know how Kylie stood working for the two intensely driven men! They\u2019d both told her on more than one occasion that one only had to look at her to have a direct window to her soul.</p><p>It could be construed as criticism, but both men had made their statements with great affection. As though it was a compliment instead of a fault.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know my boundaries,\u201d she said in frustration. \u201cHow could I? Dash, you know this is new for me. That my only experience comes from my fantasies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, but we have to establish what you would do if I do cross a boundary of yours. I understand you won\u2019t know until it happens. What I want is to implement safeguards for that eventuality. Because I will push you, Joss. I know you think I\u2019m being gentle with you and maybe I am. For now. But once you\u2019re under my control, I\u2019ll push your limits.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded her understanding.</p><p>\u201cNow, many people in these kinds of relationships use safe words. I\u2019m not a fan of them myself, but I understand the necessity of them. Especially for a woman being introduced to this world for the first time. After a while you won\u2019t need a safe word because it\u2019s my job to find out your boundaries and push you to the very edge without crossing that line. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChessy told me it was important to communicate with the man I . . . experimented . . . with that I was new to the scene and to make it clear I reserved the right to pull the plug at any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChessy is a very smart woman. She\u2019s knowledgeable about the lifestyle,\u201d Dash said.</p> <p>\u201cShe should be,\u201d Joss muttered. \u201cShe and Tate . . . Well, you know since you both have memberships at The House.\u201d</p><p>Dash smiled. \u201cI can see the question in your eyes. I could swear I also see a hint of jealousy. Or maybe that\u2019s wishful thinking on my part. You want to know if I\u2019ve ever seen Chessy and Tate, and specifically Chessy . . . na**d. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in whether or not you\u2019ve ever been with her,\u201d Joss said quietly.</p><p>Dash\u2019s expression softened. \u201cDid Chessy tell you Tate shared her with other men?\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDoes he?\u201d</p> <p>Dash chuckled. \u201cGuess you aren\u2019t as knowledgeable as perhaps I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the idea of me being with Chessy bother you?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>Joss flushed. \u201cYes. No! Yes, damn it, it does. Sorry. I know I can\u2019t judge your past. But yeah, it bothers me a lot. I mean I know you\u2019ve had other women. I would certainly have never expected you to wait for me forever. How could you have known Carson would die and leave that opportunity for you? But the idea of you being with my friend . . . Yes, it bothers me. I won\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>Dash slid his hand over hers, squeezing warmly. \u201cSorry, honey. I was teasing you and I shouldn\u2019t have. To answer your multitude of questions, yes, Tate does, upon occasion, share Chessy with other men. No, I\u2019ve never participated. Yes, I\u2019ve seen her na**d, though I\u2019ve tried to be careful and avoid The House when I know they\u2019re going to be there.\u201d</p><p>Joss latched onto the part about Tate sharing Chessy with other men. It boggled her mind because Tate was forbiddingly possessive of Chessy. When they were together, Tate was always in touching distance. When Joss had been married, it hadn\u2019t bothered her. She hadn\u2019t been envious. She\u2019d been thrilled that her friend was married to a man who so obviously adored her. Jealous of the kind of relationship they had? Yes, a tiny part of her had been very envious.</p> <p>After Carson had died, it had been painful to watch Tate with Chessy because it reminded her of all she\u2019d had and lost. That close connection to another man. The knowledge that he loved her absolutely and without measure.</p><p>\u201cHe shares her?\u201d Joss asked again, incredulity seeping into her voice.</p><p>Dash gave her a gentle smile. \u201cIt\u2019s who and what they are, honey. It\u2019s a kink they both enjoy. Tate likes to watch while another man dominates his wife\u2014under his direction. So technically the Dominant acting out a scene with Chessy is in fact submissive because he takes orders from Tate.\u201d</p><p>Joss shivered at the mental image and wondered what that was like. Could she have sex with a man while Dash watched and directed? Her ni**les tightened and came to erect points. Her respirations sped up as pictures flashed through her mind. It was too much to take in. Yes, she\u2019d known of Chessy and Tate\u2019s relationship. She knew Chessy gave one hundred percent of her submission to Tate, in and out of the bedroom as she\u2019d discovered recently.</p><p>What was it Chessy had said? That she was Tate\u2019s to do with as he chose. She hadn\u2019t considered to what extent that held true, but wow. As shocking as it was, it was also extremely . . . arousing.</p><p>\u201cIs that something that turns you on?\u201d he asked silkily.</p><p>She caught his gaze and saw his eyes glittering and she wondered if it turned him on. Would he want to do that with her? Give her to another man while he stood on the sidelines? She hadn\u2019t imagined Dash to be the sort who would share anything, especially a woman he was in a relationship with.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cIn theory it sounds . . . hot. But the reality? I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d feel about that. It\u2019s definitely not something I\u2019d want to do right away. I would think that takes a certain level of comfort. And trust.\u201d</p> <p>Dash nodded. \u201cVery true. The man and the woman have to be in complete accord. Their relationship has to be cemented before introducing elements like that. For the woman, she has to have complete trust in her Dominant in order to allow him to give her to another man. That kind of trust is priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for the man?\u201d Joss asked, her curiosity only growing. She felt horribly na\u00efve and ignorant of such things. But now that she\u2019d begun her journey into that very world, she was starved for knowledge. It all fascinated her. \u201cWhat does he get out of it? Wouldn\u2019t he have to have absolute faith in the woman he gives to another man?\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded again. \u201cAbsolutely. The man has to trust that he is able to provide everything his woman needs, and that her experience with another man is not only pleasurable for both himself and her, but he also has to trust that when it\u2019s all said and done, he is the one she goes home with, is committed to, and that the experience doesn\u2019t give her a taste of the forbidden that she indulges in when he\u2019s not a participant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermission to cheat,\u201d Joss murmured. \u201cIt blows my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not cheating,\u201d Dash corrected. \u201cNot at all. Cheating is emotional betrayal. When consent is given by both parties, there is no betrayal. It\u2019s why a relationship has to be absolutely solid before ever venturing into that territory. There can be no doubts, no misgivings, and trust has to be well established between the couple. Otherwise it\u2019s a doomed exercise.\u201d</p><p>Joss cocked her head to the side. \u201cDoes it not work out sometimes? I mean do you know of situations where jealousy became involved? Or the woman ends up cheating or is no longer satisfied with what her Dominant is giving her?\u201d</p><p>Dash shrugged. \u201cOf course. It happens. I\u2019ve witnessed couples still in the beginning stages of their relationship rush into situations they have no business being in. It usually doesn\u2019t end well. I\u2019ve found what most often happens is that the man becomes jealous over another man pleasuring his woman and then he starts to doubt his own abilities. He mentally compares himself with the other man in question. Wonders if the guy pleases her more than he can. If she prefers the other guy to her Dominant. As I said, it takes a special level of commitment and trust for such an arrangement to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it works for Tate and Chessy,\u201d she said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t voiced as a question, but the inflection at the end of her words made it such.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does apparently,\u201d Dash replied. \u201cThey\u2019re happy. Tate is happy. Chessy is happy.\u201d</p><p>Joss frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure anymore, Dash. I\u2019m worried about Chessy.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Joss shook her head. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I don\u2019t want it to get back to Tate. It could be nothing. Just a feeling I have.\u201d</p><p>Dash frowned. \u201cI\u2019d never betray your confidence, Joss. Nor do I indulge in gossip. And I damn sure wouldn\u2019t tell Tate anything that made him doubt his wife. But I\u2019d like to know why you have your \u2018feeling.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Joss sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know really. She just seems . . . unhappy . . . lately. She hasn\u2019t said anything. I know that Tate has been very busy at work. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m imagining it. Kylie has noticed too. She actually worried that . . .\u201d</p><p>She broke off, ashamed to voice what Kylie had suggested. She genuinely liked Tate, and she didn\u2019t believe for a minute that he would abuse Chessy in any way. Things may not be perfect between them but there was no way Tate would ever hurt Chessy. Not physically.</p><p>\u201cShe worried what?\u201d Dash demanded, concern replacing his frown.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that. Now what did Kylie say?\u201d</p><p>Joss grimaced. \u201cShe worried that Tate was abusing Chessy. We had lunch together. You know that. And I don\u2019t know, Dash. She just seems so unhappy lately. And if you bring Tate up, she clams up and gets this look on her face.\u201d</p><p>Dash looked incredulous. \u201cKylie actually thinks Tate abuses her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Joss said honestly. \u201cKylie is . . . Well, you know how she is. You know what she and Carson both suffered. So it\u2019s natural that she would jump to conclusions others wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cNo f**king way. The sun rises and sets at Chessy\u2019s feet. Tate is crazy about her. If she\u2019s not happy, there has to be another reason. Maybe they argued. Who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Joss said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he abuses her either. Not for a minute. I like him. I like him a lot. And he\u2019s so good to Chessy. I look at them and I feel so . . . envious. It shames me to admit that, but it\u2019s true. I look at them and I want\u2014crave\u2014what they have.\u201d</p><p>Dash reached out to stroke her cheek, feathering his thumb over her skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll have it, Joss. All you have to do is reach out and take it. It\u2019s yours. I\u2019m yours. For as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath. Yes, she knew he wanted her. He\u2019d certainly been blunt enough about that. But he made it sound so . . . permanent. And she had no idea what to think about that.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking for permanent. She didn\u2019t want permanent. She\u2019d found the love of a lifetime and lost it. She knew she\u2019d never get that back. People just didn\u2019t find perfection twice in a lifetime. Once was hard enough, but twice? Impossible.</p><p>She licked her lips, suddenly uncomfortable with the direction of her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked huskily, returning the topic to them. \u201cHave you ever shared the woman you\u2019re with? Is that something you enjoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the right woman, yes. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m lining up to do that with you, though. I\u2019ve spent too long fantasizing about what it would be like to have you in my bed, under my control. There\u2019s no way in hell I want to immediately jump into sharing you with anyone. I\u2019m not saying never. If it\u2019s something that turns you on and it\u2019s something you want to explore at a later date, then we can cross that bridge when we get to it. For now? I\u2019m more focused on you and me, specifically you. I\u2019m a selfish bastard and I\u2019m very possessive of what I consider mine. And Joss, you are mine.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed again, but she couldn\u2019t suppress the surge of pleasure that winged its way through her veins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very okay with that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Now, let\u2019s get back to your boundaries and my expectations.\u201d</p><p>She immediately tuned in, anxious to hear what all this . . . arrangement . . . entailed.</p><p>\u201cTo start with, we\u2019ll establish a safe word for you. It\u2019s important that you only use it when you\u2019re genuinely frightened, uncertain or if something hurts you. If anything I do ever hurts you I want to know about it immediately because it will never happen again. We clear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIn time I\u2019ll know your limits even better than you,\u201d he said in a confident tone that caused her heartbeat to speed up.</p><p>\u201cAnd your expectations, Dash?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really simple,\u201d he said. \u201cBy offering me the gift of your submission, you\u2019re placing your care and well-being in my hands. I expect your obedience and your respect. Now, respect has to be earned. I get that. And I\u2019ll earn it. Obedience, however, is taught, and I\u2019ll teach you well. You\u2019ll obey my instructions without question or hesitation. If you truly don\u2019t understand a command, you\u2019ve only to ask and I\u2019ll explain. But don\u2019t question just because you\u2019re nervous or hesitant about complying with my wishes, because that will not please me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. It surprised her how horrified she was over the idea of not pleasing him. She wanted to make him happy. She wanted him to be proud of her, to take pride in her. And she never wanted to do anything to shame him or make him regret their relationship.</p><p>Was it her natural submissiveness guiding the ship here? Had she always been this way and suppressed it because she didn\u2019t understand it or realize what it was she wanted? Or perhaps she\u2019d only recognized it when she\u2019d come into contact with others in the lifestyle. They\u2019d made her see what it was she was missing.</p><p>She licked her suddenly dry lips again. \u201cAre there punishments involved? I know some Dominants . . . Well, I\u2019ve heard that they punish their women if they disobey or displease them. Is that something you do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMany find punishments to be pleasurable. In many cases, punishment is in fact a reward. It sounds twisted and contradictory, but pain can be very erotic, as can control and authority. As to whether I enjoy punishments, the answer is yes. In certain situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich situations?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cDoes the idea of my hand on your pretty ass arouse you, Joss? Does the idea of me tying you up so you\u2019re utterly helpless and then flogging you make you hot?\u201d</p><p>Her entire body was one giant flush of heat.</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong of me to say yes?\u201d she whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His entire expression softened, his eyes glowing with tenderness.</p><p>\u201cHoney, nothing about your desires and needs is wrong. Nothing. Do you understand that? I need to know what pleases you, what turns you on, your deepest, darkest fantasies. If I don\u2019t know what they are, how can I give you what you need?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He brushed the back of his knuckle down her cheekbone, stroking and then sliding back up to stroke downward again. His touch was infinitely soothing. It also aroused her. Almost violently. Never had she craved something so much as his touch right now. His hands on her body. Mouth on her skin.</p> <p>\u201cIn time you\u2019ll hide nothing from me,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere is nothing you can\u2019t share with me. Nor will there ever be. You can be yourself with me, Joss. I\u2019ll protect and cherish your heart and soul. You don\u2019t need defenses around me. They wouldn\u2019t do you a damn bit of good anyway because I intend to strip you of them. Bare. Until there\u2019s nothing between us but your delectable skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour expectations seem simple enough,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou want my trust and my obedience.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIn theory, yes, quite simple. But obedience entails quite a lot. You\u2019ll never know from one day to the next what it is I\u2019ll demand of you. The not knowing is a powerful enough aphrodisiac. Anticipation makes it much sweeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd punishments, Dash? We spoke of what turns me on, but what about you? Do you enjoy meting out punishment on your submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask if I\u2019m a sadist and enjoy inflicting pain for the sake of inflicting pain, no. I won\u2019t set you up to fail just so I can punish you, honey. That\u2019s not the way I work. Because I find much more satisfaction in your obedience. That\u2019s what will make me happy. Not you failing a task so that punishment ensues. However, yes, there are some certain aspects of punishment that I enjoy, though I\u2019d argue they aren\u2019t true punishments because both me and my submissive enjoy them. I prefer to think of them as sexual pleasure. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. My pleasure. And yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou like the control,\u201d she mused. \u201cNot necessarily inflicting pain, but inflicting your will on the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re gaining a greater understanding.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll get there, Dash. Just please be patient with me. I want to learn, to explore. But I\u2019m a little wary and uncertain. I\u2019m so afraid of making a mistake. Of disappointing you and myself.\u201d</p><p>His expression became utterly serious. He framed her face in his palms, forcing her to look directly into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou will never disappoint me, Joss. I need you to know that. We\u2019ll find our way together.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath and then smiled. \u201cI believe you. Now that we\u2019ve gotten all of the talk out of the way, when do we start? And how do we start?\u201d</p> <p>TEN</p><p>\u201cI want you to move in with me,\u201d Dash said bluntly.</p><p>Joss\u2019s eyes widened in surprise and her lips parted, a rush of air escaping the perfectly formed bow.</p><p>\u201cBut Dash . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThis won\u2019t be a part-time relationship, Joss. Nor will it be a secret.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed with consternation and she shook her head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anyone to know! Not that I\u2019m ashamed of you. That isn\u2019t it. But this is private. I don\u2019t want our relationship, what our relationship is, to be public knowledge!\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cIt won\u2019t be public, honey. Not certain aspects of our relationship. I\u2019m not going to flaunt it. But I\u2019ll want you here with me, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea for me to move in with you.\u201d</p><p>He let his words, their meaning settle over Joss and he saw the instant she realized his purpose.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking. Of course you wouldn\u2019t want to be in the house I shared with Carson. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr to you,\u201d Dash said gently. \u201cThis is a fresh start for you, Joss. It needs to be. And in order to do that, you have to break free from the past so you can move ahead with your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so sudden,\u201d she murmured. \u201cSo much has happened and it\u2019s happened so quickly. I\u2019ve barely had time to process it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing me giving you more time would accomplish would be giving you more of a chance to back out. I\u2019m not going to allow that. I\u2019ve waited too long. I won\u2019t let you go now. Not when I\u2019m so close to having everything I ever wanted. Maybe that\u2019s selfish of me. But I can live with it if you can.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully, her eyes lightening as she glanced up at him. \u201cI can live with that. What else then? I just move here with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re here, we\u2019ll move further into the physical\u2014and emotional\u2014aspects of our relationship. You\u2019ll find I\u2019m a very demanding man, Joss. I hope to hell you\u2019re prepared for that. I won\u2019t be easy. I won\u2019t have mercy.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse leapt, jumping at the pulse point of her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now why don\u2019t we go over to your house so you can pack a few things. You don\u2019t have to get everything today. Just what you need for the next few days. We can always go back for more later.\u201d</p><p>Left unsaid was his concern that once she was here, once they embarked on their sexual odyssey, she would run and run hard. Go back to her home and shut him out forever. He hoped to hell she was as strong as she put off and that she truly did want all she\u2019d said.</p><p>He had no doubt he could give her everything she could possibly want or need and so much more. The question was whether she knew exactly what it was she truly wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to let Chessy and Kylie know,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll worry. They know about you. I mean they know about us. But still, it\u2019ll shock them that we\u2019re moving so quickly. I\u2019ll endure a lecture from Kylie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not Chessy?\u201d he asked in amusement.</p><p>Joss smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, Chessy was supportive of my decision to go after what I wanted. She was concerned, don\u2019t get me wrong. But she understood it and encouraged me to go through with it. Kylie? Well, she thought I\u2019d lost my damn mind, and she\u2019s scared to death of what I\u2019m getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it should make her feel better to know you aren\u2019t hooking up with some random stranger who doesn\u2019t give a f**k about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt upset her that you had feelings for me while I was married to Carson,\u201d Joss said quietly. \u201cI think she felt like you betrayed Carson.\u201d</p><p>Dash scowled. \u201cI never betrayed him. He knew. He damn well knew and we were still friends. He trusted me. He knew I\u2019d never act on that attraction. He was my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Joss said gently. \u201cKylie is just very black-and-white. She has a narrow view of the world. It surprised her and she doesn\u2019t deal with surprise very well.\u201d</p><p>Dash grimaced, knowing that Jensen replacing Carson would come as another big surprise to Kylie. An unwelcome one at that.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you frowning?\u201d Joss asked. \u201cAre you angry that Kylie was upset?\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cNo. I was just thinking about what else I wanted to discuss with you. And with Kylie.\u201d</p><p>She looked worried and he hastened to soothe her, not wanting anything to disrupt the mood between them. Not when things were so . . . good.</p><p>\u201cYou may or may not know that before Carson died, we had talked about taking on another partner. I wasn\u2019t sure how much Carson shared with you regarding business. I know he was determined that you never have to work or worry about money coming in.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s expression immediately became worried. \u201cIs it money, Dash? Is the business not doing as well? I can go back to work, you know. Even though I quit a year after Carson and I married\u2014at his insistence\u2014I\u2019ve kept up my certifications and I\u2019ve taken the necessary classes so I could keep my nursing license. I can go back to work. I don\u2019t want to be a financial burden on you. Do what you must to keep the business going. It\u2019s what Carson would have wanted.\u201d</p><p>He put his finger to her lips, loving her more than ever. She was so selfless and generous. Most women would be horrified at the mere thought of their financial security diminishing. But not her. She was prepared to go back to work. In fact, he remembered it had taken Carson an entire year to talk her into quitting. No, they hadn\u2019t needed her salary, not by a long shot, but Joss hadn\u2019t wanted to quit. She hadn\u2019t wanted to be dependent on Carson. He admired her for that.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the business, honey, and the truth is, what Carson would have wanted is not for you to go back to work. You have to know that. Carson only wanted you safe and happy and provided for. And he ensured that by leaving you a percentage of the business. You don\u2019t have to worry. I plan for the business to expand and become more profitable than even before. It\u2019s a fact that things faltered a bit after Carson died. My head and heart weren\u2019t in it and it suffered the first year. But I pulled it together. What I wanted to tell you and Kylie both is that I\u2019m taking on a partner. Carson and I had planned to expand before he died. Those plans got put on hold as I focused on making sure the business remained solvent. But now is the perfect time to take on someone else. I can\u2019t do it all myself. I don\u2019t have the desire to. There are other things that I\u2019d rather focus on now. You. And I can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m tied to the desk and traveling all the time.\u201d</p><p>Joss blinked in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re replacing Carson?\u201d</p><p>He winced because while he knew Kylie would draw that same conclusion, he\u2019d hoped that Joss wouldn\u2019t see it that way.</p><p>As if reading his mind, Joss leaned forward, her expression earnest, her eyes soft with understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way, Dash. I\u2019m not upset that you\u2019re \u2018replacing\u2019 Carson. I suppose I just didn\u2019t realize how demanding the business was. Oh, I know how much time Carson put into it. But what I didn\u2019t know at the time was that you stepped up and shouldered far more responsibility so that Carson would be free to spend more time with me. Thank you for that, Dash. I know you made a lot of sacrifices, but I\u2019ll forever be grateful that you gave that to him. To us. That I got to spend as much time with him as I did before he died. I\u2019ll always treasure those memories. The trips. The days at home just spending time together.\u201d</p><p>Moisture rimmed her eyes, but she didn\u2019t allow herself to cry. It looked as though she exerted great restraint not to break down even though her lips trembled with that effort.</p><p>\u201cAnd if by taking on another partner, it enables you to step back and have a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around the business, then you have my full support. You\u2019ve given so much to me and to Carson. It\u2019s only fair that you have a turn at reaping the rewards of your success.\u201d</p><p>Damn but this woman just made him happy. He was so damn proud of her. Now if only Kylie would take the news as graciously as Joss had. But then he\u2019d expected no less from Joss. He hadn\u2019t entertained even for a moment that she would be resentful or that she\u2019d object. He\u2019d definitely considered that it might be upsetting for her. That was only normal. She was a woman who\u2019d loved her husband, a love most men would kill for, and if they could have that kind of love and devotion from a woman like Joss, they\u2019d never want for more in their life.</p><p>He wanted it now. Craved it. Was obsessed with it and her. He\u2019d do whatever it took to make her happy again. He\u2019d prove to her that lightning could strike twice in the same lifetime. She\u2019d mentioned on more than one occasion, in passing, that she didn\u2019t expect to ever find love again. Not like she had with Carson. Hell, she\u2019d resigned herself to that fact, accepting it.</p><p>Fuck that. If she only gave him the chance, he\u2019d prove to her that she could be that happy again. That not only would another man give her the world, but that he\u2019d love her and cherish her. He\u2019d wrap her in cotton and protect her from everything that could ever hurt her.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided on his replacement?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He covered her hand with his and squeezed. \u201cHoney, I\u2019m not replacing him. No one could ever replace Carson. He built this business. He made it what it is today. I helped, yes, but this was his vision. His brainchild. He was a brilliant, business-minded man.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHave you decided on the new partner yet then? Or have you only just recently made the decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d he said. \u201cI met Jensen some years ago when Carson was still alive. Carson and I had actually discussed bringing him in as a third partner when we decided to expand. And we\u2019d planned to in the next year. But that was before he died so unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that his name? Jensen? Have I met him?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her brow wrinkling in concentration. She was evidently trying to place the name. He almost laughed. As if she\u2019d ever notice another man with Carson in the same room. It had been one of the things he most envied about Carson. Joss\u2019s absolute devotion and fidelity when it came to her husband.</p><p>When he was with her, she had eyes for no one else. Her focus was on him, her love for him evident in the warmth of her gaze. More than one man had looked at Carson with envy in his eyes. And the hell of it was she was oblivious to her allure. She had no idea that in a room full of business associates every male\u2019s eyes were on her. Lusting after her. Eaten alive with jealousy over Carson\u2019s good fortune. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was likely at one or more functions that you and Carson attended. But I don\u2019t think you were ever formally introduced. He knows who you are, what you look like, but I doubt you\u2019d know him. He\u2019s not a loud person or someone who gains attention. He\u2019s quieter, stands back and observes. That\u2019s what makes him a solid option for the business. He has a good eye for people. Uncanny instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you tell Kylie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grimaced again. \u201cSoon. I spoke with him today to finalize things. And then I asked him for a few days before we went public and proceeded with bringing him on board. I wanted to tell Kylie\u2014and you\u2014the news myself. I didn\u2019t want to just spring it on her at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to take it well,\u201d Joss murmured.</p> <p>Dash shook his head. \u201cCertainly not as well as you took it.\u201d</p><p>Joss sighed. \u201cKylie is very loyal. She\u2019s also, as I\u2019ve said, very black-and-white. No middle ground. She and Carson were very close. Carson was all she had for so long. He was all she had when they both lived in hell with their father\u2019s abuse. And yes, I agree. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll take it well at first. After she\u2019s had time to think about it and time for it to sink in, she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Dash said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a done deal. No backing out now. And it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the company. In time she\u2019ll realize that.\u201d</p><p>This time Joss reached out to squeeze his hand. \u201cYes, she will. She\u2019s very intelligent and Carson said she was a dream as an office manager. He used to say that she kept you both organized and well-oiled.\u201d</p><p>Dash laughed. \u201cYes, she certainly does that. I hope you\u2019re right. I\u2019d hate to lose her over this. It was important to Carson that you both be provided for. He wouldn\u2019t want Kylie working somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let her make any rash, impulsive decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf she does something hasty like quit, don\u2019t accept her resignation. Give her time to consider. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no desire to train a new office manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know if you need help, all you ever have to do is ask. I don\u2019t know much about your business but I\u2019m a quick study.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, letting his lips linger against her temple, inhaling the sweetness of her scent.</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, but I like the idea of you not working. I like the idea of having all your time. I\u2019m a selfish bastard. I don\u2019t want to share you with anyone and certainly not a job.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then sighed, her expression becoming troubled as he brought the topic back to their relationship.</p> <p>\u201cYou really think it\u2019s a good idea for me to move in? You don\u2019t think it\u2019s too sudden? I\u2019d hate to sabotage us before we ever get off the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me worry about that,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI want you here, Joss. In my space. My life. My bed. There are certain aspects I won\u2019t rush you into and I\u2019ll be infinitely patient. But others? Like you moving in with me and you being with me all the time? Yeah, I\u2019m going to press because it\u2019s what I want and I always go after what I want. I don\u2019t lose, Joss. And I\u2019m damn sure not going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>JOSS finished packing her bag and then surveyed the three stuffed suitcases with a rueful smile. It looked as though she were moving out, and she supposed, in fact, she was. Dash wanted her with him. All the time. She still wasn\u2019t sure exactly how she felt about that.</p><p>She\u2019d enjoyed every moment of her marriage to Carson. She\u2019d liked not being alone, and in the months following his death, she hadn\u2019t wanted to be alone even for a moment. God, when she looked back at who and what she was, she wanted to cringe.</p><p>A trip to the grocery store was enough to put her in tears. Dash had come, had taken her to the grocery store so she could at least keep her kitchen stocked. She didn\u2019t eat out. Hadn\u2019t eaten out in a year after his funeral.</p><p>Only after a year had she begun to venture out, at Chessy and Kylie\u2019s urging, for regular lunches with them. But dinner? She hadn\u2019t been out to dinner since Carson died. It had been too painful. She hadn\u2019t wanted to socialize. To get caught up in meaningless chitchat when all she could remember was the way she and Carson laughed and loved.</p><p>Carson loved eating out. Loved good food and fine dining. He\u2019d taken her to some of the best restaurants in the country\u2014and Europe. It was through him that she developed the taste for good wine. She didn\u2019t know the difference between a red and a white much less the nuances of the different labels and brands.</p> <p>Her wine cabinet here was still fully stocked, not a single bottle opened, except for Carson\u2019s favorite. A wine she made sure she kept on hand. On the anniversary of his death, she\u2019d open that bottle and drink with him. With his memory. She savored every sip, wishing with her every breath that he were there to share it with her.</p><p>She sighed. No more of that. She was turning a new page in her life. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe she was making the worst decision\u2014an emotional decision. But she was an emotionally driven person. She wore her feelings on her sleeve, and as Carson and Dash had both commented on, one only had to look into her eyes to know exactly her mood.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the artifice or the energy to project what she didn\u2019t feel. She didn\u2019t even know how to mask her emotions. It wasn\u2019t something she was adept at. As a result, Carson had always known when she was unhappy or worried. And he\u2019d moved heaven and earth to rectify whatever had gone wrong.</p><p>Dash would be like that. She knew. He was warm and kind. Gentle and understanding. He\u2019d be patient with her and he wouldn\u2019t fault her for any mistakes she made. But she didn\u2019t want to make mistakes. She wanted to meet him as an equal, not some weak woman who needed him to fix her.</p><p>Only she could fix herself. Her shattered heart. That was on her and no one could do it for her. Perhaps this was just the first step in reclaiming her independence, which sounded stupid when she wanted a dominant man. When she didn\u2019t want to make decisions or be forced to make difficult choices.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think. She just wanted to . . . be. That was all. Happy. Whole again, or at least as whole as she could ever be when she was missing half of herself.</p><p>Maybe Dash could do that for her. Maybe he would give her that missing piece of her soul. And maybe she\u2019d made a huge mistake. How would she know unless she tried?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she lugged her suitcases into the living room and checked her watch. Dash had said he\u2019d give her two hours before he returned to get her. It was agreed she\u2019d take her car to his house and park it in case she needed to go somewhere when he wasn\u2019t available. But he\u2019d made it abundantly clear that for the most part, she would be with him. He would take care of her, of her every need, and he didn\u2019t plan for them to spend much time apart.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that either, but the lonely part of her heart swelled in relief that she wouldn\u2019t be alone any longer. The rest? She\u2019d take it as it came. One day at a time. It did her no good to focus on the future when she needed to live for today. The present. Because as she\u2019d well learned, the future was not guaranteed. It was what you made it.</p><p>She had fifteen minutes before Dash would arrive. Plenty of time to call Chessy and Kylie and let them know of her decision. But she\u2019d have to endure the conversation twice and that wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She\u2019d have to endure questions, disbelief, surprise and doubt.</p><p>It would be far easier just to e-mail them both and explain her plans.</p><p>Satisfied with that decision, she walked over to where her laptop lay on the coffee table and sat on the couch, opening it up to her e-mail program.</p><p>After pondering the best way to tell her friends what was going on she finally decided to just take the plunge. State it matter- of-factly. Not get into details. Just a basic explanation and how to reach her if they needed her. She fully expected her cell phone to start ringing the moment they got the e-mail so she typed a request that they not do so.</p><p>She informed them that she needed a few days with Dash to get her bearings. She promised to update them and that they\u2019d get together for lunch at the end of the week. Although she didn\u2019t look forward to that lunch because it would end up an inquisition.</p><p>She\u2019d just hit Send on the e-mail when her doorbell rang. Her pulse accelerated and she rose, smoothing her palms down her worn jeans.</p><p>This was it. Dash was here to pick her up.</p><p>She glanced around her house, her and Carson\u2019s house, sadness tugging at her heart. Maybe she should have moved right after he died. It likely wasn\u2019t healthy to maintain the house as it had been when he was alive. Pictures of them and him still dotted the living room and other rooms of the house.</p><p>Joss and Carson happy. Smiling. In love.</p><p>She had finally cleaned out his closet and put away his clothing. But all his knickknacks? Trophies, plaques, pictures? They were still where they\u2019d been hung or positioned on the shelves. No wonder Dash didn\u2019t want to move in here. It was hard to compete with a dead man, and with all the reminders of him displayed around the house, how could Dash hope for Joss to focus on him?</p><p>As she opened the door, she muttered a silent vow that she was going to go hard at this. That she\u2019d give Dash one hundred percent of herself. No holding back. No reservations. And she darn sure wasn\u2019t going to be doing a mental comparison between Dash and Carson when it came to sex. It wasn\u2019t fair to either man and it wasn\u2019t fair to her.</p><p>Dash stood there, sunglasses covering his eyes, but when she looked up at him, he shoved them up over his head so he could look back at her. There was something in his gaze that made her quiver on the inside. Intense. Brooding almost. And there was marked triumph reflected there.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked in a low tone.</p><p>She smiled, determined not to show any hesitancy. She was fully committed. On board. She wouldn\u2019t waffle now and she\u2019d give Dash no reason to question her commitment.</p><p>\u201cI have several suitcases,\u201d she said hesitantly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to bring so I brought a little of everything. One of the suitcases has all my girly stuff. I was certain you wouldn\u2019t have all that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cNot to worry, and honey, now that you\u2019re mine, it\u2019s my duty and honor to provide for you. So if there\u2019s something you need later, I\u2019ll make certain you get it.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to buy me things, Dash. I can afford it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and glinted fire. She had the sudden impression she\u2019d taken a wrong turn and she\u2019d been determined to get off on the right foot with him.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he said in a firm tone. \u201cAnd I provide for what is mine. You\u2019ve gifted me with your trust and your submission. My duty as the one who takes care of you is to provide for your every need and desire. So get used to it, Joss. I have every intention of spoiling you shamelessly. I won\u2019t be pleased if you question every gift I bestow on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed. She hadn\u2019t looked at it like that, but she still had a lot to learn about this kind of relationship.</p><p>So far it seemed she got far more out of the bargain than he did. Pampered? Spoiled? Cherished? What did he get in return? He\u2019d said that she was enough. That her trust and her submission were enough. But surely there had to be more in it for him.</p><p>\u201cNow, if we\u2019ve got that out of the way, point me to your luggage and I\u2019ll get it out to the car for you.\u201d</p><p>She started to tell him that she could get it or at least help, but as if anticipating just such a statement, he silenced her with a quick, stern look. Her hand fluttering upward, she motioned toward the living room where her suitcases were.</p><p>It took him two trips to get all of her things in the trunk of his car, but he ushered her into the passenger seat and then slid in on the driver\u2019s side. To her surprise, before he even started the engine, he leaned over and kissed her. Hard. Hungry. None of the tender reserve he\u2019d shown before.</p><p>He devoured her mouth until her lips tingled and swelled. When he pulled away, his lids were heavy with desire and his eyes blazed fire.</p><p>\u201cHope to hell you know what you\u2019re getting into,\u201d he murmured as he cranked the ignition. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to wait, so it begins now, Joss. Right now. As soon as we step into my house, you belong to me. You\u2019re mine to do with as I please.\u201d</p><p>The words slid over her, warm and arousing. Her pulse beat hard at her pulse points, and her mouth went dry. Not even licking her lips alleviated the sudden dryness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI know what I\u2019m getting into, or at least I have a good idea. And I want it, Dash. I want . . . you.\u201d</p><p>There was savagery in his expression. She shivered uncontrollably. Arousal. But mostly anticipation. She was on the brink of something new and possibly wonderful. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. But she\u2019d never know unless she took that leap.</p><p>When they arrived at Dash\u2019s house, Joss opened the door and started to get out, but Dash reached over the center console and took her hand, pulling her back.</p><p>Without a word, he got out and walked around to her door. He reached in for her hand and she slipped her palm over his until their fingers were twined.</p><p>She was moving into Dash Corbin\u2019s house. She was going to have sex with Dash Corbin. God, Dash was going to own her. She started to shake as soon as she got her legs underneath her. Reaction was quickly setting in.</p><p>It had all seemed so surreal and now it was here. She was about to embark on a sexual journey and she was scared to death. What could Dash possibly want with her? He was experienced in this lifestyle. He had certain expectations. Expectations she couldn\u2019t hope to meet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJoss, honey, you\u2019re shaking like a leaf.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up guiltily. She hadn\u2019t wanted him to see her nerves. But as he said, she was trembling head to toe. How could he not see it? Or feel it, for that matter. Her hand was solidly twined with his, and her skin felt cold and clammy despite the warmth of the day.</p><p>He squeezed and offered her a reassuring smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. I know you\u2019re nervous, but there\u2019s no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just occurred to me that you have a lot of experience in this lifestyle while I have none,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat do I possibly have to offer you? I\u2019m sure a novice isn\u2019t high on your list of wants.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped just in front of the door and fixed her with his steely gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat you have to offer me is something no one else can ever hope to offer me. You, Joss. You\u2019re giving me you and that\u2019s all I want and need. I swear it. You have no idea how long I\u2019ve dreamed of this. Of us. Together. Yes, I want to have sex with you, but it\u2019s so much more than that. You may not believe it yet, but you will. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>His quiet vow comforted her. She squeezed his hand back and then smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly good for my ego, Dash. I haven\u2019t felt beautiful in so very long. I haven\u2019t felt desirable. I haven\u2019t felt desire, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d he prompted. \u201cDo you feel it now? For me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cIt shocked the hell out of me. I never expected to feel this way about you. Never imagined wanting you so badly. But there it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck,\u201d he muttered. \u201cGlad to know I\u2019m not the only one suffering here.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThen how about we do something about that suffering?\u201d</p><p>He looked shocked. So much so that she regretted her forwardness. Embarrassment crept up her neck, a wave of heat that flooded her cheeks.</p><p>Then he let out a low growl, leaning down to claim her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a damn good idea. Let\u2019s go inside. I\u2019ll get your things later. I want to get you settled in. I want you to be comfortable here, Joss. I want you to consider this . . . home.\u201d</p> <p>He tugged her inside, a wave of cooler air washing over her, removing the heat from her cheeks.</p><p>She\u2019d been to Dash\u2019s many times, but she\u2019d never ventured beyond the living room, the kitchen or the guest bathroom. He led her through the living room and up the stairs to the master bedroom.</p><p>A prickle of awareness tingled up her spine as she took in the masculine feel to his bedroom. The bed was huge with a multitude of pillows. It was a four-poster, and she hadn\u2019t imagined him to like that kind of furniture. It almost seemed feminine, something a woman would have in her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he queried.</p><p>She glanced up and then smiled. \u201cSilly thoughts. I was looking at your bed and thinking that it seemed incongruous with what I know about you. I would have never imagined you having a four-poster.\u201d</p><p>A gleam entered his eyes and amusement quirked his lips. \u201cI need something to tie my woman to. It\u2019s only natural that I\u2019d have the proper equipment for the job.\u201d</p><p>Heat flooded her cheeks once more. She had to be bright red. Then came the realization that she wouldn\u2019t be the only woman in this bed. It shouldn\u2019t bother her, but it did. Dash owed her no explanations for his past sex life. She\u2019d been married, for God\u2019s sake. She certainly couldn\u2019t have expected him to remain celibate when he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever have a chance with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking now?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cMore silliness,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let it go, and hell, she was honest to a fault, much to her detriment.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI was thinking about the other women who\u2019ve been in your bed\u2014this bed,\u201d she said unhappily. \u201cStupid, I know. But it bothers me.\u201d</p><p>Dash turned her so she faced him and he gripped her shoulders, holding her directly in his line of vision.</p><p>\u201cThere haven\u2019t been any women here, Joss. Not here. I won\u2019t say there haven\u2019t been other women, but I didn\u2019t bring them here. I couldn\u2019t. Maybe before Carson died, I may have gotten to that point, but after? I couldn\u2019t bring myself to even form a relationship. Not when I was so set on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t mean so much, but it does, Dash. It means a lot that there hasn\u2019t been anyone for a while.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and kissed her forehead. \u201cIt means a lot that there hasn\u2019t been anyone for you since Carson. I was afraid that by waiting so long, by waiting to declare my intentions as long as I did, that I would lose you to another man.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cHow do you know there haven\u2019t been other men?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI would have known, Joss. You may not have seen me every day, but I checked up on you. I was watching. And waiting.\u201d</p><p>She harrumphed but smiled, touched by the fact he\u2019d been there. Waiting. For her.</p><p>He walked her backward until the backs of her legs bumped the edge of the bed. Then he lowered her down until she was perched on the edge. Once she was sitting, he gathered her hands in his and knelt in front of her.</p><p>Now, granted she didn\u2019t know everything about dominance and submission, but didn\u2019t he have all this backward? Shouldn\u2019t she be in the position of subservience to him? Not the other way around!</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Dash?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be the one kneeling for you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, squeezing her hands in his. \u201cDarling Joss. I\u2019m at your feet, literally. I admit it\u2019s not a position I normally find myself in. But with you all the rules change. I wanted to put us on more equal footing for the discussion to come. And perhaps I wanted to humble myself to you to make a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat point?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cThat for all the power you cede to me, in fact, it\u2019s you who holds all the power in this relationship we\u2019re embarking on. That may sound contradictory, but it\u2019s absolutely true. You hold all the cards. You\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat. Because it\u2019s you who decides whether to give me your submission. It takes a strong, confident woman to hand over control to her partner. And the thing is, yes, you are submitting to me, but my desire to please you far outweighs my desire to dominate and control you. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI suppose. I just never thought of it in that light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it now,\u201d he directed. \u201cAnd listen to everything I\u2019m about to tell you. I\u2019m going to lay out the rules, though I hate that word. There are no rules between us, honey. No hard-and-fast guidelines. What we do, I want us to enjoy. I want to bring you pleasure and I want you to please me. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement. One I hope we both find happiness in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, to get to my expectations. Or rules if you want to call them that. I prefer to consider them requests. Requests that you will choose whether to agree to or not. But I want you to have a very clear picture of what will go on between us because I want you to have the opportunity to back away. It\u2019s not what I want. I hope to f**k you want the same things I do. But there\u2019s only one way to find out. Lay out the ground rules and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready, Dash. Don\u2019t hold back any longer. I\u2019m dying over here because I don\u2019t know what it is I\u2019m supposed to do. I\u2019m so afraid of making a mistake. Of disappointing not only you but myself.\u201d</p><p>His smile was exquisitely tender. It made her feel so very warm on the inside where she\u2019d been cold for so very long.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t disappoint me. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible. The only way you\u2019ll disappoint me is if you walk away without giving us a fair chance. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be all roses and sunshine in the beginning. There will be adjustments we both have to make. Compromises. But together I think we can overcome any obstacle to our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the most wonderful things,\u201d she said in an aching voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re able to see to the heart of me, how you can know so much about me when I know so little myself.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hand over her cheek and then through her hair to twist the loose strands.</p><p>\u201cRule number one, and these are in no particular order. So bear with me while I get to them all. And be patient. I know you\u2019ll have questions, but try to save them until the end when I\u2019m finished outlining the guidelines. Then, once I\u2019ve covered all the bases, you can ask any questions you want. Anything you don\u2019t understand we\u2019ll talk about. I\u2019ll be as honest as I can possibly be with you, Joss. Even if I worry the truth will frighten or intimidate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019m listening, Dash. I won\u2019t interrupt or question you until you\u2019re finished. No matter how hard that may be,\u201d she added ruefully.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, the first is that when you are here with me, in this house and we\u2019re alone, I want you na**d unless I tell you otherwise. Starting now, or rather when we\u2019re finished going over my expectations.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened but she kept her promise and bit her lip to prevent her immediate objection.</p><p>\u201cSecond, when I tell you to do something, I expect instant, unconditional obedience. You may not understand why I ask you to do what I ask, but I expect you to trust me and at least be willing to try.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. That didn\u2019t sound too hard, although she had no idea what those requests would be. Part of her anticipated the unknown. The other part of her was terrified. She hated not knowing exactly what she was walking into or agreeing to.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to kneel in my presence unless I request it. The only time I want you to kneel is if I summon you. Then I\u2019d like you to kneel, with your arms resting on your thighs, palms splayed upward. This is a standard position of submissiveness. Thighs open so that no part of you isn\u2019t accessible to me or my gaze. The only other time is when I return from work or if I\u2019m away for any reason, when I return, I\u2019d like for you to be in the living room, on your knees, waiting for me. I want you to be the very first thing I see when I walk through my door. I want a reason to want to come home, and if you\u2019re here, waiting for me, believe me, sweetheart, it\u2019s what I\u2019ll want more than anything. You, waiting, my reward after a long day.\u201d</p><p>She got the impression this was important to Dash. Something he enjoyed and craved. And if that was the case, she wanted to do it for him. She wanted to please him and bring him happiness. She never wanted to disappoint him. She had too much pride for that. No, she may not have the experience other women he\u2019d been with had, but that wasn\u2019t going to prevent her from doing her damn best to be the most desirable submissive he\u2019d ever had a relationship with.</p><p>There were no half measures for her. From the moment she\u2019d decided to embark on this new lifestyle and explore her sexuality and her needs, she\u2019d known that she\u2019d throw herself completely into it. No holding back of anything. She\u2019d give wholly and unreservedly of herself and hope that the man she was with would appreciate the gift she gave. And nothing in Dash\u2019s words had given her any reason to doubt that he would most certainly cherish and protect her gift of submission.</p><p>\u201cWhen I issue a command, I expect instant obedience. No hesitation. No questions. I want you to trust me to take you to a place you\u2019ll enjoy and feel safe in. I\u2019ll never ask you to do something that I think you\u2019d object to. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t push you out of your comfort zone. But as I mentioned earlier, the further we get into this, the faster I\u2019ll learn what your boundaries are and I\u2019ll never purposely cross them unless it\u2019s something we discuss and agree to try.\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded, because as with his other expectations, they didn\u2019t seem unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cNow, we briefly touched on punishments and pain. Pain can be very erotic if administered correctly. Both for the man and the woman. Many women enjoy a man exerting his dominance with crops, belts, his hand or any number of other methods, all of which I\u2019ll introduce you to over time.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not into punishment for the sake of punishments. I prefer to think of them as rewards. Which sounds stupid, but after you\u2019ve experienced the various levels of pain, spanking and other things as well, I think you\u2019ll understand what it is I\u2019m trying to explain to you.</p><p>\u201cI will absolutely push the line. I\u2019ll bring you damn close without crossing those lines. I\u2019ll pay attention and in time I\u2019ll be as in tune with your body as even you are. It\u2019s my job as your Dominant to know exactly what you want and need, sometimes even better than you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI want a man who will take. A man who won\u2019t ask. Who won\u2019t force me to make decisions. I want those choices taken from me. It excites me. I can\u2019t explain the need or the craving I have for that, but it\u2019s there. Maybe it\u2019s always been there. And I want that from you, Dash. I\u2019m prepared to go a lot further with you because I trust you and I know you\u2019d never willingly hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that trust, Joss. It humbles me,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how precious it is to receive that kind of gift from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else or have we covered it all?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cImpatient little submissive, aren\u2019t you? I love your enthusiasm, Joss. Your willingness to put so much faith in me to know what you\u2019ll enjoy. Yes, there will be other things, but I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you on the very first day you\u2019ve moved into my house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sleep in my bed every night. There are times when I\u2019ll want to bind you in the bed so that you\u2019re helpless and dependent on me for everything. I\u2019ll make love to you while you\u2019re spread out and tied to my bedposts. Where your body will be available to me whenever I choose to take it. And I\u2019ll take you often, Joss. Before we go to bed at night. During the night. And first thing in the morning before you\u2019re fully awake. I\u2019ll slide into your beautiful body and I\u2019ll be the first thing you feel each morning. I\u2019ll be the last thing you know when you go to sleep at night. And you\u2019ll go to bed knowing you are mine and that you belong, heart and soul, to me. You\u2019ll never have cause to doubt it because not a day will go by that I won\u2019t prove that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not heard a single downside to this,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cQuite frankly it all sounds too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew more serious. \u201cIt won\u2019t all be perfect, Joss. You need to know that going in. You need to prepare yourself for the fact you may not enjoy everything I have planned. The very last thing I want is to frighten or repulse you. Or make you do something you aren\u2019t comfortable with. It\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to communicate. I want you to be brutally honest with me even if it\u2019s not something you think I want to hear or know. I want your promise that you\u2019ll tell me what\u2019s going on in your head when we do these things. I\u2019ll want to know how you feel, how what we do makes you feel. I don\u2019t want this to be you sacrificing your pleasure and enjoyment because you\u2019re worried about disappointing me. Believe me when I say that if I\u2019m unable to bring you ultimate pleasure, then I don\u2019t want to be doing this.</p><p>\u201cIt may sound on paper like it\u2019s all about me. And for some Dominants it is. It isn\u2019t about their submissive\u2019s pleasure or her desires or even her happiness. I\u2019m not that selfish, however. I hope to f**k I never become that self-centered. Pleasing you makes me happy. It\u2019s all I want. It\u2019s what I demand. So yes, while it is somewhat about my pleasure and you pleasing me, know this: making you happy is what will make me happy and content. I need that, Joss. I need you.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and held on tight, burying her face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat I think you are is perfect. So perfect that I wonder if you aren\u2019t too good to be true. Not just this situation but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re on the same page here,\u201d Dash said with a smile. \u201cWe seem to be saying the same things but perhaps in a slightly different way. But we both want the same things. You want to be happy and you want me to be happy in our relationship. And conversely, I want you to be happy, first and foremost, because trust me, honey. You being happy will make me extremely happy.\u201d</p><p>She let out the air from her lungs in a long exhale.</p><p>\u201cI want this, Dash. I\u2019m ready to dive in and take the plunge. I\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t know if I can stand a few days with you walking on eggshells and me never knowing when it all begins. I\u2019m ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what I want you to do while I\u2019m getting your suitcases from the car is to undress. Take your time and use the bathroom. Whatever makes you feel more comfortable and at ease. I want you na**d the entire evening. I want to cook you a special meal and feed you by my own hand. And I want to enjoy the sight of your gorgeous body while I\u2019m doing this for you. And then, when we\u2019re done eating and ready to think about bed? Then we\u2019ll go to bed together and see if you\u2019re every bit as sweet and f**king sexy as you are in my dreams. It\u2019s time to make my dreams come true. Mine and yours.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>JOSS surveyed her reflection in the mirror and winced at the stark fear in her eyes. They were wide and it was obvious that she was jittery as hell.</p><p>Naked. He wanted her na**d, and God, but that made her utterly self-conscious. He expected her to parade around with no clothing. To eat a meal with him. Naked. No barriers, no shield, no protective measures.</p><p>It was the height of vulnerability and yet it was also a signal of her trust and her willingness to do as he\u2019d asked, or rather demanded, no matter how gently the demand had been voiced.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath and then ran a brush through her hair, debating whether to leave it down or clip it up. Deciding that leaving it down offered at least a small measure of protection, she set aside the brush and arranged her hair so it fell over her shoulders in the front and covered at least part of her breasts.</p><p>Her ni**les peeked through the strands of her hair though and she wondered if it was in fact a more erotic sight than if she\u2019d pulled her hair up and left her br**sts completely bare.</p><p>There was only one way to find out. Leave the refuge of the bathroom, quit hiding like a coward and gauge Dash\u2019s reaction to her nudity.</p><p>He\u2019d certainly been blunt about his desire for her. She\u2019d seen the evidence of his arousal in his eyes, in the way he spoke. But then he hadn\u2019t seen her na**d. Hadn\u2019t touched her any more intimately than a few caresses to her face and her arms.</p><p>Now he would have unfettered access to any part of her body. Her breasts. Her pussy. She flinched at the crude term, but there were certainly more vulgar terms for the female anatomy than pussy. Words she hated. Cunt. That was the worst and she hoped it was a word Dash would never use.</p><p>It was silly to be such a prude about her body or how it was referred to. But she couldn\u2019t control her reaction to the harsher words. They brought to mind unpleasant images. Reduced sex to mindless f**king. No intimacy or tenderness. She wanted those things. Needed them.</p><p>No matter that she was turning over her body, her soul, to another man. That she wanted to submit and craved a man\u2019s dominance. She still wanted to be treated respectfully, and it was important to her that she wasn\u2019t just a sexual conquest. A woman to be used and then discarded as though she meant nothing.</p><p>She wanted to matter. She wanted to feel again as she\u2019d felt when she was married to Carson. Wanted that connection to another man. Maybe she was a fool for even starting down this path. But she\u2019d never know unless she tried, and Dash was a man she did trust. As determined as she\u2019d been to move forward with her decision, the moment the man from The House had approached her, dread had filled her. She\u2019d been uncertain and afraid even as she sought to go through with it.</p><p>She now knew that regardless of whether or not Dash had been there and called a halt to the whole mess, she wouldn\u2019t have gone through with it. She would have chickened out and ran, and she would have never gone back.</p> <p>In a way she was grateful that Dash had been there and that he\u2019d intervened, even as humiliating as she\u2019d found the entire experience. Because it forced his hand. It made him act on long-held desires. And now she could see if this was truly what she wanted, and she could do it with a man she knew would never hurt her.</p><p>But there were different kinds of hurt. Not just physical ones. It was the emotional pain she feared the worst. Of somehow messing up a friendship she valued, a friendship she\u2019d desperately clung to after Carson had died.</p><p>If she lost Dash too, what would she do?</p><p>She shook her head, refusing to go there. She\u2019d procrastinated long enough. If she didn\u2019t get moving, Dash would know she was standing in there wavering. He deserved better than a woman who was having second and third thoughts. She\u2019d agreed to this. She\u2019d been firm in her commitment. She wasn\u2019t backing out now. Or ever.</p><p>Gathering her courage, she opened the bathroom door and stepped into the bedroom. Her suitcases were empty and stacked against the far wall. Her eyes widened when she realized he\u2019d unpacked all her belongings and put them away already.</p><p>She walked to the closet, curious, and when she opened the door, she saw all her things she\u2019d packed hanging on hangers. She took up the right side while Dash had moved his things to occupy the left.</p><p>Her shoes were neatly lined up on the floor beneath the hanging clothes.</p><p>She glanced at the dresser and knew without looking that he\u2019d put away her panties and bras and pajamas. Her cheeks flushed hot when she imagined him sorting through her intimate wear and putting them away.</p><p>He\u2019d said he would be in the kitchen, but the thought of walking in there, na**d, sent terror through her veins. It made her achingly vulnerable. Powerless. But wasn\u2019t that the point? She was ceding all power to him. She\u2019d made a point of saying she didn\u2019t want to make choices, that she wanted them made for her. It still discomfited her, that it made her appear weak and spineless. But what was it Dash had said? That it took a strong woman to submit to a man?</p><p>She held on to the assurance. Tucked it away so she could remind herself of those words every time she felt she was weak.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is it, Joss,\u201d she murmured to herself as she stood at the door of the bedroom. \u201cNo going back now. Once you walk out of here your decision is made.\u201d</p><p>She stood a moment, battling herself, trying to summon the courage necessary to take that final step. Her hand curled around the knob and she yanked the door open, striding through the doorway before she could talk herself out of this insanity.</p><p>She walked to the head of the stairs and looked down, seeking any sign that Dash was close or that he\u2019d see her descend the stairs. But no, he\u2019d said he\u2019d be in the kitchen and that he\u2019d give her all the time she needed to prepare.</p><p>How the hell could she ever be prepared to walk na**d into the kitchen where a man waited who had been very blunt about his intentions?</p><p>\u201cStop being such a coward,\u201d she admonished herself fiercely as she forced her way down those steps.</p><p>At the bottom, she didn\u2019t hesitate. Take the plunge. She headed for the kitchen, determined to get that first moment of awkwardness away. The sooner she got it over with, the sooner her nerves would settle and maybe the fear would melt away.</p><p>Dash had his back turned to her, tending to something on the stove when she entered the kitchen. She did so quietly and yet he still knew the instant she came in. He turned, his eyes flaring with appreciation as he took in her appearance.</p><p>They burned brightly, smoldering as his gaze raked up and down her body. But it was the approval that put her at ease.</p><p>\u201cYou look just as beautiful as I imagined,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cEven more so than I dreamed. You\u2019ve occupied plenty of my fantasies, honey, but the reality has nothing on those dreams.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, bolstered by his praise. Maybe this wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all. Her shoulders slumped as she relaxed and some of the awful tension that had her in knots loosened and she could breathe normally again.</p><p>He set a pot off the stove and then hurried toward her. To her surprise, he slid his hand around her neck and pulled her to him, his lips finding hers in a heated rush.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve dreamed of this moment,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cYou. Naked. In my home. Here in my kitchen while I prepare a meal I intend to feed you by my hand. It\u2019s more than I ever dared hope for, Joss. I hope to hell you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now,\u201d she said with a smile as he drew away, his eyes glittering with desire.</p><p>\u201cGo into the living room and get comfortable,\u201d he directed. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in a tray momentarily.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lingered a moment longer before he reluctantly turned away and went back to the stove.</p><p>As he\u2019d directed, she went into the living room and sank into the sumptuous leather. She wasn\u2019t cold, but the urge to pull one of the throws around her was strong. But that wasn\u2019t what he wanted. It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d commanded of her, and she wouldn\u2019t start their relationship off on a bad foot by disobeying his very first directive.</p><p>A few minutes later Dash entered the living room carrying a tray with one plate. Evidently he\u2019d been serious about feeding her, because there was no extra serving. He stopped at the coffee table and slid it onto the glass top before settling onto the couch next to her.</p><p>To her surprise he reached for one of the pillows and placed it on the floor next to his feet. Puzzled by his action, she sent him an inquisitive look.</p><p>In response he simply held out his hand to hers, his gaze steady and . . . challenging? Was this a test? And if it was, what was she supposed to do?</p><p>When he continued holding out his hand, but not reaching to take hers, she slid hers into his and his fingers curled around hers.</p><p>\u201cI want you to kneel on the pillow so that I can feed you,\u201d he said in a low, husky voice.</p><p>She held back the questions that burned her lips. Instead she simply nodded and rose, with his assistance. She sank onto the pillow as gracefully as she was able, and remembering his instructions for when she knelt, she spread her thighs and rested her hands, palms up on the tops of her legs.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural at this, Joss. Make sure you\u2019re comfortable and we\u2019ll begin our meal.\u201d</p><p>It was a little mortifying to be sitting, thighs splayed where he could easily see her most intimate parts. And yet her cl*ttingled, swelling with her arousal. Her ni**les hardened and her breathing shallowed, little puffs of air escaping her parted lips.</p><p>He forked a bite of the pasta and saut\u00e9ed shrimp, gently blew on it before pressing it lightly to his lips to test the temperature. Then he held the fork to her mouth, prompting her to open.</p><p>As he held the fork for her to eat, his other hand delved into her hair, stroking and twisting the strands around his fingers. He kept up his gentle assault on her senses and he fed her more, each time bringing it to his lips first.</p><p>There was something decidedly intimate about him feeding her. How he ensured that it wouldn\u2019t burn her by testing it first. The idea that the food had been to his mouth first and then to hers was as jolting as if he\u2019d kissed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gradually she relaxed, the tension that coiled in her muscles loosening as they continued their intimate dinner in silence.</p><p>What would happen after? He\u2019d said they\u2019d go to bed. He\u2019d hinted that they would have sex. But her mind was overwhelmed with the possibilities. Would he tie her up this first night? Would he exert his dominance immediately, as she\u2019d asked him to, or would he go slower? Ease her into his world?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t decide which option held more appeal. She wanted to experience the full measure of his dominance but she didn\u2019t want to be overwhelmed from the very start. She wanted this to work.</p><p>Trust.</p> <p>He\u2019d asked for her trust. Had told her to put her faith in him. That he\u2019d come to know her boundaries, her needs and her desires better than herself. If this was going to work, she had to do just that. Put herself into his care. Fully in his care. And trust that he\u2019d never take things too far.</p><p>He held a glass of wine to her mouth, gently tipping it so she could take a small sip. Emotion knotted her throat when the flavor hit her tongue, making it hard to swallow. She held it in her mouth a long moment before she composed herself enough to swallow without choking on it.</p><p>It was her favorite. How had he known? It was a wine Carson bought for every birthday and anniversary. And though she\u2019d drank Carson\u2019s favorite every year on the anniversary of his death, she hadn\u2019t tasted her favorite wine since the last time she drank it with Carson.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d Dash murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cMy favorite. But then you knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cOf course. There isn\u2019t much I don\u2019t know when it comes to what pleases you. I told you I was prepared to spoil you shamelessly. This is only the beginning.\u201d</p><p>A drop of wine slipped from the corner of her mouth and when she would have lifted her hand to wipe it away, he stopped her and then leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Instead of wiping it with his fingers, he swept in and lapped at the corner of her mouth with his tongue.</p><p>A burst of heat singed her skin. He didn\u2019t just lick it away quickly. He tongued the sensitive area and then nibbled at her lips before swiping one last time with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he said, and she knew he wasn\u2019t talking about the wine.</p> <p>Intimacy surrounded them, cloaking them and enclosing them in a tight circle of desire and heat. Nothing else existed. The rest of the room faded away. There was just him and her and the delicious meal he\u2019d prepared and served her in such an intimate fashion.</p><p>She\u2019d imagined many things when she\u2019d considered the pathway she was taking. But nothing had prepared her for the reality. Would it have been this way with another man? She knew it wouldn\u2019t. No one but Dash could ever provide her with this experience. The depth of this experience.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how beautiful you look?\u201d Dash said in a voice edged with desire and arousal. \u201cDo you have any idea how long I\u2019ve dreamed of this? Of you at my feet, eating by my hand, na**d. So damn beautiful that it\u2019s a physical ache inside me.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, curious as to the effect. She could see the intense satisfaction in his eyes and it made her wonder why. What was it about a woman at his feet that gave him such pleasure?</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something, Dash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He sat back so he could see her fully. She was careful to maintain her position because she wanted him looking at her just as he was right now. With so much approval and . . . contentment.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about a submissive woman that appeals to you so much? I\u2019ve often wondered about Chessy and Tate. It\u2019s obvious he loves her so much. He practically worships her. He\u2019s so . . . possessive of her. It\u2019s why I can\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that he shares her with other men. But I\u2019m straying from the point,\u201d she added with a light laugh. \u201cI want to know why it appeals to you so much.\u201d She swept her hand down her body, indicating her position. \u201cYou like this\u2014me\u2014in a submissive position.\u201d</p> <p>He touched her hair, stroking his hand down the long tresses, pulling them briefly away from her br**sts so he could see her fully. There was definite male satisfaction in his gaze. That approval removed her hesitance. Gave her confidence where before she\u2019d been so vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cHow to explain how I feel?\u201d he mused. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a cut-and-dried explanation for why it pleases me. It\u2019s not a power trip. In some cases, yes, it\u2019s about power. But for me, it brings me great pleasure, and yes, satisfaction. It\u2019s a heady sensation for a woman to put her absolute faith and trust in me. That she trusts me to provide for her. That she gives up control because she trusts that I\u2019ll give her what she needs. That I\u2019ll take care of her. That I\u2019ll absolutely protect her with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like to be needed then.\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment, weighing her words. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s one way to put it. But it goes much deeper. My instinct is to provide. To protect. To absolutely cherish, spoil and pamper my woman. In this case, you. But it\u2019s a drive strictly personal to you. With other women, yes, I\u2019ve enjoyed all those things. It brings me pleasure to be able to give those things to another woman. But with you it\u2019s very different. I don\u2019t just want your trust and submission. I need them. I need to do these things for you, Joss. Never think even for a moment that another woman is interchangeable with you. That it would be this way with another woman. Because that simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that you\u2019ve suffered so long,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cI never knew, Dash. I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I had known. You mean a lot to me. Even when Carson was alive, you meant a lot. It would have hurt me to know you were hurting. I couldn\u2019t have stood it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly at her, his eyes glowing with warmth and affection.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I was determined that you not know, honey. You have such a huge, soft heart. You would have been in an untenable position. You loved Carson and were absolutely faithful. He knew it and I knew it. It\u2019s why he never worried that I had feelings for you. One, he knew that I would never act on them. You both meant too much to me for me to ever drive a wedge between us. But he also had absolute faith in you. He knew you would never be unfaithful to him. That you\u2019d never even entertain the idea. I knew that as well. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair for me to have revealed what I felt for you. It would have only hurt you and that\u2019s the last thing I ever wanted. Carson made you happy. You were happy and you damn sure made him happy. What else could I ask for? It seemed selfish to insert myself because the end result would have only been pain for us all. You. Me. Carson. I loved you both. And you would have never strayed, so what was the point? I wouldn\u2019t have wanted you at Carson\u2019s expense. It would have devastated him and I would have lost a friend. You would have lost friends, your life, everything. All for me. That wasn\u2019t what I wanted for you. It was never what I wanted for you. I only want you to be happy. And so I waited. I waited for you to be ready. But there was never a question of me stepping in. Once Carson died, I knew without a doubt that I would be the only man in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a heavy answer for such a simple question,\u201d she said in amusement. \u201cCertainly gives me a lot to think about.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and rubbed tenderly over her skin, his thumb feathering over her lip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to weigh you down or burden you unnecessarily. I don\u2019t want you to think at all. I only want you to feel. I want you to feel what I feel. I want you to burn with the same need that I burn with\u2014that I ache with. And then I\u2019ll ease it, Joss. I don\u2019t want you hurting. Ever. I\u2019ll give you everything you could possibly ever need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need . . . you,\u201d she whispered, finally giving voice to her most pressing need.</p><p>The evening\u2014entire day\u2014had been an exercise in frustration. She was restless and edgy, wondering, constantly battling with herself over whether she was making the right decision.</p><p>How could she know until he made love to her?</p><p>He hauled her up and into his lap before she could even blink. His hand pressed possessively against her thigh as he anchored her to his body. Her legs were draped over his lap toward the end of the couch and she was nestled into his body just as though she\u2019d been made for him. They fit perfectly. His hard, muscled body was the perfect complement to her much softer one.</p><p>His hand moved up her body to cup one breast. For a moment he simply held it, feeling the weight of it in his palm. Then he brushed his thumb over the straining peak and she sucked in her breath.</p><p>It was a bolt of electricity, shocking in its intensity. If she had any doubts about their chemistry and whether they were compatible in bed, those doubts fled in an instant.</p><p>She ached for him. Her body was aware, painfully so. Every nerve ending was on alert. She was wet already and he hadn\u2019t even ventured close to her most intimate flesh.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me, Joss? Right now? Are you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me what to do, Dash. I don\u2019t want to mess up. I want our first time to be . . . perfect.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, kissing her nose and then her closed eyes and then her mouth, pulling gently at her bottom lip with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI guarantee that it will be perfect for me. You in my bed? There\u2019s no way to mess that up. But I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make it perfect for you, honey.\u201d</p><p>She framed his face in her hands, forcing his gaze to hers. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back with me, Dash. Don\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m breakable. I want . . . everything. I don\u2019t want you to hesitate or fear overwhelming me. I want to be overwhelmed. I want you.\u201d</p><p>He emitted a low growl, one that sent a cascade of chill bumps over her skin. Her ni**les puckered into rock-hard points, aching for his touch. His mouth.</p><p>Then he simply stood, carrying her with him. She gasped at his strength, how effortlessly he picked her up.</p><p>His gaze was fierce, his eyes burning with fire as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cYour safe word, honey. What is it?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her mind going blank at his demand.</p><p>\u201cThink of one and hurry,\u201d he urged. \u201cAnd use it if I go too far. But be sure, Joss. Don\u2019t use it unless you are absolutely at your breaking point. Trust me to take you there. I won\u2019t be easy, but the minute you say your safe word, it ends.\u201d</p><p>She frantically searched her mind, frustrated by how frighteningly blank it was. Damn it! How hard could a safe word be to think of? No? Stop? Those wouldn\u2019t do. They were words she might cry out in the heat of the moment and not mean them. It had to be unmistakable. Something that would stop him in his tracks, though she couldn\u2019t imagine ever wanting him to stop.</p><p>\u201cGhost,\u201d she finally croaked out.</p><p>If it surprised him, he didn\u2019t show it. No emotion flickered in his eyes. Would he object to her using a mention of her husband when they were in bed making love together?</p><p>\u201cGhost it is,\u201d he said in a strained voice. \u201cYou say that word and I stop no matter how far into it we are. Trust me, Joss. I\u2019ll stop no matter how hard it may be. I\u2019ll protect you. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to caress the hard line of his jaw. \u201cI trust you, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hard, breathless, every bit of his pent-up desire unleashed in that single moment. It was like a violent thunderstorm, one that excited her. There was no fear. No hesitation. She wanted this. Wanted it so much she ached, she hurt.</p><p>\u201cI hurt, Dash,\u201d she whispered, voicing the fleeting thought in her mind. \u201cMake it stop. Make love to me. Make it all stop.\u201d</p><p>His gaze grew tender once more, his breaths ragged and filled with the same edgy pain she herself was experiencing. He was as desperate for this as she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you feel good, honey. I\u2019ll make it good for both of us.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>DASH carried Joss up the stairs, impatience simmering in his veins. He kept telling himself to take things slow. No matter what Joss said\u2014demanded\u2014no matter how much she said she wanted him not to hold back, he tempered his urges, not wanting to f**k this up. Not when he finally held all he desired in his arms.</p><p>He gently deposited her onto the bed and stood back, staring down at her gorgeous body. Her eyes were drugged and heavy with desire. Yearning. Her hair was splayed out over his pillow and her body. God, she was beautiful. She\u2019d said she hurt, that she ached, but God, so did he.</p><p>His dick was about to come out of his pants. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his erection tore right through his jeans.</p><p>He had to be patient because if he wasn\u2019t careful, the minute he touched her, the moment he finally got inside her, he\u2019d come violently and it would all be over within thirty seconds.</p><p>He wanted this to be f**king perfect. He wanted to tease and torment Joss until she was desperate for release. Though she\u2019d said she wanted him not to hold back, she wanted his dominance, wanted him to exert his control and authority over her from the start, he knew he couldn\u2019t do it. Not yet.</p><p>This first time had to be perfect. He wanted to lavish his love on her. He wanted to make love to her. There would be plenty of time for sweaty, mindless f**king, but no, even when he allowed himself to lose his tightly leashed control, it wouldn\u2019t be f**king. It would never be something so crude with Joss.</p><p>When they made love, no matter the circumstances, whether she was bound and helpless or if he flogged her pretty ass until it was rosy with his marks, it would be something beautiful. Just as beautiful as she was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d he breathed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Always he was in control. His restraint was something that never failed him. He was confident in his abilities to please the woman he was with. He never faltered. Never hesitated. But now? He felt like he was making love for the first time in his life. That he was an untried virgin with no idea what to do with the veritable feast of womanhood that lay before him.</p><p>As he pondered those thoughts, the realization came that this was, in fact, the first time for him. His first time to make love. His first time to have sex when his emotions, his heart, were involved. He\u2019d never been in love with the women he\u2019d been with.</p><p>Desired them? Yes. Aroused? Absolutely. But his heart had never been involved to the extent it was with Joss. He was terrified of doing the wrong thing. Of touching her wrong. The pressure he put on himself was overwhelming. The fear of failure. Of not making this as perfect as he wanted.</p><p>It was a hell of a position to be in. His heart\u2019s desire within touching distance and he was too afraid to take the plunge.</p><p>Joss, sweet, loving Joss seemed to know exactly what he was thinking\u2014feeling. She smiled and extended her hand, an invitation for him to come to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Dash,\u201d she said, her smile as soft as her silky skin. \u201cI\u2019m nervous too. But we\u2019ll get through this together. I trust you to make it beautiful\u2014perfect. How could it be anything else between us?\u201d</p><p>He let out a groan, pissed at himself for allowing his uncertainty to show. Some Dominant he was when he was paralyzed with fear over touching her.</p><p>Then he lowered his body to hers, allowing his weight to press down on her, but he propped himself up on his forearms so he wouldn\u2019t crush her. She was tiny and delicate, so much so that she looked as though she could be broken if handled too roughly. But it wasn\u2019t her body he was most concerned about. It was her heart. Her emotions. He didn\u2019t want to overwhelm her. He didn\u2019t want her to fear him. Never that. Anything but that. He couldn\u2019t bear it if she ever looked at him with fear in her beautiful eyes.</p><p>Holding himself up on one arm, he traced the lines of her face with his free hand, committing to memory every second of this first time. He could scarcely comprehend that she was finally his. That she was in his bed, na**d, and that he\u2019d be making love to her in just moments.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted her to be overwhelmed, but in fact, he was utterly overwhelmed himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long for this,\u201d he said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and turned her cheek into his palm, nuzzling farther into his touch. Then she pressed a kiss against his hand, just a simple, sweet gesture that turned his heart over in his chest.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Dash,\u201d she whispered, her eyes burning brightly. They glowed in the soft light of the bedroom, alive with answering desire.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers, inhaling her scent as he tasted her lips. He pushed in with his tongue, licking over hers, exploring her mouth.</p><p>He was so hard that it was painful. He had to get rid of the barrier between them. He wanted his flesh against hers. Wanted to feel her softness and her warmth.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute to get out of these clothes,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again and stretched, lifting her arms above her head. It was a gesture of surrender. Was it intentional? A signal of her submission?</p><p>He removed his clothes, nearly tearing them in his haste. Her eyes widened when his erection sprang free from constraint. He glanced down and winced, understanding her surprise. He was harder than he\u2019d ever been in his life. His dick strained upward, so swollen and tight that the veins were clearly outlined. The head was nearly purple and already liquid leaked from the tip.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare touch himself. He didn\u2019t trust himself not to spend himself right then and there.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful body, Dash,\u201d she said shyly, color blooming in her cheeks.</p><p>He felt heat stain his own cheeks, embarrassed by her scrutiny. Never had he felt self-conscious about his body before. He kept in shape. Took care of himself. He wasn\u2019t normally modest, but it was important to him that Joss appreciated his physique. Maybe that made him vain, but he wanted her approval. He wanted her to want him every bit as much as he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re who\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cSo damn beautiful you make me ache, Joss.\u201d</p><p>She arched her body in silent invitation. He needed no urging. He moved swiftly to the bed, no thoughts of dominance. Of commanding or arranging her in a submissive position. Tonight all he wanted was to have her. To seal the relationship beginning between them. Dominance\u2014her submission\u2014could come later.</p> <p>\u201cSpread your legs, honey,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cLet me see that pretty pussy. I want to taste you. I\u2019ve been dying to taste you. I want you to come in my mouth. All over my tongue.\u201d</p><p>She trembled and chill bumps danced across her skin. Her ni**les beaded and puckered, an invitation for him to taste.</p><p>He wanted it all. And before the night was over, he\u2019d taste every inch of that delectable skin. No part of her would go unexplored. He\u2019d know what pleased her, where her pleasure points were.</p><p>He was dying for her to taste him as well. To have her mouth wrapped around his dick, her tongue lapping at his balls. But there was plenty of time for that. They had all the time in the world. Soon. Soon, he\u2019d have complete mastery of her body. He\u2019d have her complete obedience and submission. But tonight was all about her. Sating her desires, showing her how good they could be together.</p><p>When she hesitantly parted her thighs, giving him a clear look at her feminine flesh, he saw moisture gleaming on the delicate folds. Satisfaction gripped him. She wanted him. Was highly aroused. He desperately wanted to push into that sweet pussy, to feel her heat consume him, grip him like a fist. But he forced himself to exercise restraint.</p><p>Instead he closed the distance between them, crawling onto the bed between her splayed thighs. Unable to resist, he ran a finger through her folds, lightly grazing her cl*tbefore circling her tiny opening.</p><p>She arched upward like a shot, her reaction intense and immediate. She gasped when he continued his careful exploration. He dipped one finger inside, barely rimming her entrance. She was dripping with desire. So wet and moist. He could take her now. She was certainly ready. But he wanted her mindless. Completely out of her head before he took them both over the edge.</p><p>Savoring the thought of ultimate satisfaction, he continued touching her, petting her, bringing her closer to orgasm. When she began trembling, her entire body tightening, he drew away, giving her a moment to come down.</p><p>\u201cDash . . .\u201d</p><p>His name came out needy, desperate. He chuckled and kissed the inside of her thigh, lightly grazing the skin with his teeth. She shivered again, already working back up to release. He planned to take his time, savoring every second of this experience.</p><p>Using his fingers to gently part her folds, further exposing her to him, he leaned down, inhaling deep, absorbing her scent. A low growl worked from his throat. He was desperate for her. He wanted to dive in, devour her with his mouth and then later his cock.</p><p>His balls ached with the need to possess her. And then an unwelcome thought intruded, ripping him from the fantasy of f**king her long and hard. Another groan, this time of dismay, ripped from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Dash?\u201d</p><p>Her worried question had him raising his head. He sighed, disgusted with himself for not addressing this sooner. For not even thinking about it. He\u2019d been so wrapped up in securing Joss\u2019s consent, so focused on the act itself that he hadn\u2019t given any consideration to protecting her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey. God, I could kick myself in the balls for this. I can\u2019t believe this didn\u2019t come up before now. I gave no thought to protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed in puzzlement. She didn\u2019t understand what he was getting at.</p><p>\u201cBirth control,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI have no doubt that you\u2019re safe. I\u2019m not worried about getting anything from you and you have nothing to fear from me. It\u2019s not that I want to use condoms. Hell, I\u2019d give anything not to have to use them. But we have to consider pregnancy, Joss. And if you prefer me to use condoms, I will, absolutely. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks bloomed with color and she averted her gaze a moment. He hated that the moment was spoiled. They were both so into it that this unwelcome intrusion was like a slap in the face, effectively stifling the mood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to use them either,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t like them. Carson . . . We used them at first, when we were first together, but I\u2019m sensitive and they made me . . . dry.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious she was embarrassed by the intimacy of their conversation. Her cheeks flamed with color and she wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything to hurt you,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to be comfortable. If we have to wait, we will. I won\u2019t use something that you won\u2019t enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m safe,\u201d she said. \u201cI was on birth control when Carson was alive. He didn\u2019t want children. At least not right away, and as I said, condoms weren\u2019t an option. I never went off them, even after he died. I probably should have. It\u2019s not as though I anticipated having a sexual relationship with anyone. I couldn\u2019t. But it was habit and it never occurred to me to go off them. They regulated my periods and made them more bearable for me. Before I went on them, my periods were difficult. They were irregular and for the weeks I was on them, it was awful. I was moody, I hurt and the cramps and headaches were unbearable. For a time, I had to take pain medication just to make it through my period. My doctor advised that I go on birth control even before Carson and I were married, but I hesitated because I feared not being able to get pregnant when I went off them. I\u2019ve read a lot that it takes some women a long time to get pregnant after going off birth control and I wanted children very much. I was disappointed that Carson was so resistant, but when it was evident that he wouldn\u2019t bend, I really had no choice, no reason, not to go on birth control, especially since condoms weren\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Dash said, relief gripping him. \u201cAnd are you okay with being with me without condoms? I\u2019m safe, honey. I can provide you my medical history. I\u2019ve never been with any woman without condoms. Not even once. And I have regular checkups. But there hasn\u2019t been another woman in a long time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to justify your sexual history to me, Dash. And yes, I\u2019m okay with you not using condoms. I trust you. And you already know there\u2019s been no man for me since Carson.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed again and she ducked her head.</p><p>\u201cHe was my first. My only. I was a virgin when we met. And when he found out, he insisted we wait until we were married. And since our courtship was such a whirlwind, it wasn\u2019t as though we had to wait long. He wanted to marry me much sooner than he did. If he\u2019d had his way, we would have been married within weeks of meeting. It was me who insisted we wait. I wanted him to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not yourself?\u201d Dash asked.</p><p>\u201cI was sure of him,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI knew he was the one. I loved him\u2014fell in love with him from the start. But I wanted him to be certain. I didn\u2019t want us to rush into a marriage if he wasn\u2019t absolutely certain that I was whom he would be happy with. And I wanted him to be happy. He had such a hard childhood. He deserved to be happy.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s heart turned over all over again. He was seized by his own love for this special, generous woman. Most women would have jumped at the chance to marry Carson Breckenridge. Wealthy. Handsome. Successful. And he loved to spoil Joss. He did so shamelessly. From the very start. Yes, Dash had his own set of reservations over the speed of Carson\u2019s relationship with Joss. Carson was his best friend and he hadn\u2019t wanted him to get hurt. He, like Joss, well knew of his past. His horrific upbringing.</p><p>But all reservations had fled when he\u2019d seen firsthand how fiercely loyal and devoted Joss was to Carson. She didn\u2019t have a mercenary bone in her body. She\u2019d insisted on continuing her job as a nurse even though Carson had pressed her to quit from the moment they started dating.</p><p>She\u2019d persisted, however, because she hadn\u2019t wanted it to be perceived she was with Carson for his money. It was only after a year into their marriage that Carson had been able to persuade Joss to quit. And he\u2019d done so by telling her of his desire to have her all to himself. So she could travel with him on the many business trips he took. When Joss was working, she\u2019d been tied to her schedule and she couldn\u2019t up and leave on a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>It had frustrated Carson, because he\u2019d wanted Joss with him at all times. And so he\u2019d pressured her into quitting so her time would be his.</p><p>Dash had worried that Joss wouldn\u2019t be happy once she quit her job. She was a natural in the medical field. Her specialty had been pediatrics, and before she\u2019d married Carson, she\u2019d planned to go back to school to become a nurse practitioner.</p><p>All of that had changed the moment Carson entered her life. Did she have regrets? Did she have the desire to complete her training and go back to work? It was something he\u2019d discuss with Joss later. Right now he wanted to reestablish the mood that had been broken by his boneheaded move.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be happy again,\u201d Dash said tenderly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d very much like a part in making that happen for you. If you give me the chance, Joss, I\u2019ll make you smile again.\u201d</p><p>At that she did smile, her eyes lighting up, transforming her entire face into something so blindingly beautiful that it took his breath away.</p><p>\u201cYou already make me smile, Dash. You make me feel . . . beautiful. I haven\u2019t felt beautiful in a very long time. Thank you for that. For giving me that part of myself back again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her belly and then peppered a line down to the apex of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to make you feel beautiful, honey. You\u2019re so gorgeous it hurts to look at you sometimes. Never doubt that. You don\u2019t need any man to make you feel beautiful. You are. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and rolled her h*ps as he once more parted her folds and gently blew over her clit. Then he flicked his tongue over the taut bud, delighting in her instant, honest response.</p><p>He loved that she held nothing back. No part of herself. She put it out there, making herself vulnerable. He would protect her always. Shield her from any and all hurts. He would encourage her to be herself with him always because he\u2019d always protect her heart and soul. With him, she could be anything at all. He\u2019d never judge her. Never hold her back. He loved her too damn much to ever change her or make her into something she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He hoped to hell that he could make her see that. That he wanted her just the way she was.</p><p>He licked her again, his fingers digging into her h*ps as he held her down and open to his mouth. He became more aggressive, growing bolder, encouraged by her response. He sucked and licked, thrusting his tongue inside her to taste her sweet honey.</p><p>He ate like a man starved, and he was. For her. He wanted her to come all over his tongue. He wanted to drink deeply of her, not wasting a single drop of her desire.</p><p>That all changed with her broken plea.</p><p>\u201cDash, please, I\u2019m so close and I want you inside me. I need you inside me. I want to come with you there. Please, I need it.\u201d</p><p>Damn if she\u2019d ever beg him for anything. He\u2019d promised her that. No begging. Not for anything he could give her.</p><p>And his body agreed with her desperate plea. He wanted inside her every bit as much as she wanted him there. He wanted her body to suck greedily at his cock. Wanted to feel all of that silken heat enveloping him. He wanted to come long and hard deep inside her, filling her with his release.</p><p>He broke away, his breaths coming hard, nearly panting with exertion and excitement. His dick was to the point of begging. He was so hard that it was agonizing. He wanted\u2014needed\u2014to be inside her. Now.</p><p>He propped himself up and over her, sweat dripping from his forehead. One hand went to her forehead, pushing away her hair as he stared down at her. With his other hand, he positioned himself between her legs, lodging the head of his c**k at her opening.</p><p>At the very first touch of her velvety heat, he nearly lost it on the spot. Teeth clenched, he called on every bit of his strength to hold himself back.</p><p>Slowly and reverently he pushed inside her, his eyes rolling back in his head at the exquisite pleasure. She wiggled and arched, trying to draw him deeper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI\u2019m holding on by a very thin thread, Joss. I don\u2019t want to hurt you and I don\u2019t want to come the minute I get deep inside you. Be very still. Let me do the work. If you move, I\u2019m not going to make it and I want us to come together. I want you with me. Always with me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glowed, her lips curving into a sensual smile. Sultry and provocative. A temptress he had no hope of resisting.</p><p>But she acquiesced to his demand. She went still beneath him, giving him complete control.</p><p>Her eyes widened, the pupils flaring when he slid all the way inside. God, he\u2019d never felt anything like this. Bliss. Utter bliss. He\u2019d waited for goddamn ever for this moment. He wanted it to last for f**king ever.</p><p>He could spend the rest of his life inside her and die a happy man.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so damn good, honey. I have a damn good imagination, but fantasy has nothing on the reality.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her eyes lighting up at his heated statement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I never fantasized about you,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t say that to hurt you, but this is all a shock to me. I\u2019m still reeling from it all. I never imagined this. How it would feel.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t fault you for not fantasizing about another man when you were married. But I won\u2019t lie. I\u2019d like it very much if you fantasized about me now. It may be selfish but I want you to think of me as often as I think of you. And honey, I think about you constantly.\u201d</p><p>Delight registered in her eyes, and she reached up to cup his jaw as he went still inside her, deep, surrounded by her heat.</p><p>\u201cWho needs fantasy when you can have the real thing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It was enough to send him right over the edge. He could feel his release boiling up his dick, threatening to erupt.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re there,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI can\u2019t hold back any longer.\u201d</p><p>Her hand caressed his face, her touch feather light and so sweet. It made his teeth ache.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there, Dash. Take us both over. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew and slammed forward, rocking her body with the force of his thrust. He pulled back, just an inch, and hammered home again. And again.</p><p>She closed her eyes, her face reflecting the strain, the pleasure. How very close she was to reaching completion.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, honey. Let me see you come.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open and she stared back at him, drugged, sluggish, like she was zoned out, in another world.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need, Joss. I want you with me all the way. I\u2019m not coming without you.\u201d</p><p>Even as he said it he knew that if she wasn\u2019t as close as he was, he would leave her behind. He couldn\u2019t hold back much longer at all, and he wanted her to orgasm. This was about her and her needs. Her pleasure. Later\u2014another time\u2014it could be about him. Him taking but giving back as much as he took.</p><p>She was his now and he wasn\u2019t about to let her go. He\u2019d spend every day showing her, proving to her, that she was his first and only priority. The rest could be damned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d she gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. I\u2019m there, Dash. Just come. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d</p><p>Taking her at her word, he let his urge take over. The urge to master her, possess her, mark her. Branded. There would be harsher ways that he\u2019d put his stamp on her. Later. They had all the time in the world and he planned to make the most of it. The last years of frustration and aching need disappeared with the knowledge that she was finally his for the taking.</p><p>He thrust hard and deep, losing himself in her satiny heat.</p><p>Their gazes locked. They both tensed for the impending explosion.</p><p>No kink. No games. Just two people expressing themselves with their bodies. Him showing her without words the impact she had on him.</p><p>He nearly cried out as his orgasm swept him away. His release burst from his cock, an explosive surge that was the perfect mixture of pain and ecstasy. He\u2019d never felt anything to equal this. Never.</p><p>His name spilled hoarsely from her lips. Her hands flew to his shoulders, her fingernails digging into his skin, marking him much the same as he marked her. She arched upward, meeting his thrusts as he emptied himself deep inside her.</p><p>His orgasm went on and on, each thrust forcing more of his release into her womb.</p><p>He\u2019d brought up birth control, his concern of protecting her, but at this moment, he sorely regretted that she was on birth control. There was nothing more enticing than the thought of her swollen with his child.</p><p>He knew without a doubt that if she weren\u2019t on birth control, they would create a child. Nothing this earth-shattering could possibly result in anything else. A perfect union of heart and mind.</p><p>One day. He\u2019d gladly give her the children she wanted so much. As many as she wanted. It would suit him perfectly for her to be barefoot and pregnant in his home. Tied to him irrevocably. Maybe that made him a chauvinistic bastard, but he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>He wanted to take care of Joss for the rest of her life. Pamper and spoil her endlessly. Surround her with his love and their children. He wanted a family with her, a family he never dreamed would be possible, but was now within reach after Carson\u2019s death.</p><p>He regretted his best friend\u2019s death with all his heart, but he couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014give up a dream that was now in his grasp just because the woman he loved had been married to his best friend.</p><p>He gathered Joss tightly into his arms, easing his weight down on her, blanketing her with his body as they both trembled with the aftershocks of their lovemaking.</p><p>His dick twitched inside her, giving up the last vestiges of his release. She was hot and tight around him, squeezing him gently as her pu**y rippled with her orgasm. He could stay this way the entire night. Deeply embedded inside her, a part of her.</p><p>She was filled with his seed, a fact that gave him immeasurable satisfaction. He wanted to mark her in other ways. More primitive ways. He wanted to see his s**en on her body. Her breasts, her ass, dripping from her mouth.</p><p>He closed his eyes, already hardening even after the most gut-wrenching orgasm of his life. She did that to him. He\u2019d never get enough of her.</p><p>Reluctantly he withdrew from the warm clasp of her body. Judging by her muttered protest, she didn\u2019t like it any better than he did. But he needed to take care of her needs and then he needed to ready her for sleep.</p><p>He kissed her swollen lips. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, honey. I have to get a washcloth to clean us both up so we don\u2019t mess up the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be too late for that,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cYou came a lot.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this night. Call it pent-up frustration. You do that to me, Joss. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come so hard or as much in my life.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off her, careful not to make a bigger mess. He didn\u2019t want her sleeping on sticky sheets. He wanted only the best for her.</p><p>Now that she had moved in with him, they\u2019d be using the bed and soiling the linens on a regular basis. He made a mental note to order several more sets of the expensive sheets that adorned his bed. He planned to get a lot of use from them.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>DASH returned from the bathroom holding a damp washcloth. It was silly to be self-conscious when they\u2019d just made love, but when he gently cleaned between her legs, wiping away the remnants of his release, heat crowded her cheeks and she found herself unable to meet his gaze.</p><p>He smiled indulgently, obviously noting her discomfort.</p><p>\u201cGet used to it, honey. It\u2019s my duty\u2014and privilege\u2014to take care of you. To see to all your needs, even the more intimate ones.\u201d</p><p>When he was finished, he tossed the cloth aside and climbed into bed next to her. She didn\u2019t hesitate when he pulled her to him. She cuddled into his arms and let out a contented sigh as she rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat was wonderful, Dash,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile, or rather sensed it. She angled her head up to see she was right. His eyes were full of tenderness and . . . joy? He looked enraptured, sated and content. His smile was lazy and a little cocky. Arrogance looked good on him. He certainly wore it well.</p><p>\u201cI had a very good idea of how great we\u2019d be together,\u201d he said. \u201cGod knows I\u2019ve dreamed about it enough. Thank goodness the reality far surpassed even my most vivid fantasies.\u201d</p><p>She levered herself upward, pushing against his chest so she could stare down at him. His hand covered hers as though he simply had to touch her. She liked the connection. The intimacy of being held after lovemaking. She\u2019d felt so lonely for such a long time that she savored the fact she wasn\u2019t alone any longer.</p><p>She had someone to share things with. Her life. She was getting way ahead of herself, but she couldn\u2019t help but hope that the best was yet to come and that each day would be better than the last.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been awful for you,\u201d she said, her lips turning downward. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine wanting someone for so long and thinking you could never have her.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her cheeks, palming her jaw as his thumb brushed over her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou were well worth the wait, honey.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so. I hope you don\u2019t change your mind. I\u2019m . . . liking this\u2014us. I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m still reeling from it all, but it feels right.\u201d</p><p>He palmed the back of her neck and pulled her down to his mouth. He kissed her hungrily, his tongue delving deep. Hot, wet and exquisitely tender.</p><p>\u201cNever going to happen,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI won\u2019t change my mind, Joss, and if I have anything to say about it, neither will you. You\u2019re stuck with me now and it will take everything you\u2019ve got\u2014and more\u2014to ever get rid of me. I\u2019m a persistent son of a bitch and I don\u2019t back down from something I want. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She touched her forehead to his, their breaths mingling. \u201cI\u2019m glad you want me. It makes me feel special and it\u2019s been so long since I felt special to someone, Dash. I\u2019ve been so lonely. At night I lie in my bed and I ache. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and stroked his hand through her hair. He dropped kisses on the top of her head while rubbing his other hand down the length of her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been lonely too, honey. But those days are over for both of us. We have each other now.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against him and then yawned broadly, nearly cracking her jaw with the effort.</p><p>Dash leaned over, his hold loosening on her as he reached into the nightstand drawer. She looked at him in question when he pulled out a long, satin sash.</p><p>Without a word, he took her wrist and wound the material around it, securing it in a knot. He checked the tightness, inserting his finger between the tie and her skin. Seemingly satisfied, he then secured the other end to his own wrist so that she and Dash were bound together by their wrists.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll tie you to the bed,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOther times, like tonight, I\u2019ll tie you to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if I have to get up to go to the bathroom?\u201d she blurted.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThen you wake me so I can free you. But under no circumstances, unless it involves your safety, are you to touch the restraints I put in place.\u201d</p><p>Knowing this was the first true test of her submission, she nodded silently. His eyes flared with approval and he leaned in to kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep, honey. I\u2019ll make us breakfast in the morning when you wake.\u201d</p> <p>She settled against his chest, the way their wrists were tied forcing her to face him. Unsure of what she was supposed to do with her hand or even if she could move it, she let him take her hand with his and he laid them both between them.</p><p>He\u2019d told her to sleep, but even as sated and content as she was, sleep eluded her. She had a sleepy, lethargic heaviness to her limbs, the kind that she hadn\u2019t felt since her husband made love to her.</p><p>She\u2019d sworn not to bring Carson into her relationship with Dash. It wasn\u2019t fair and it certainly wasn\u2019t fair to compare the two men. Not fair to Dash or Carson.</p><p>Besides, one wasn\u2019t better than the other. They were just . . . different. She found the differences fascinating. Dash was only the second man she\u2019d ever made love with, and yet she\u2019d gotten lucky with both experiences. Two virile, heart-stoppingly gorgeous men. She\u2019d been loved by one, and the other? She wasn\u2019t sure if Dash was in love with her. He was certainly infatuated. And he wanted her. He\u2019d been very blunt about that.</p><p>Did she want him to love her?</p> <p>That was the million-dollar question. Her knee-jerk response was no. She didn\u2019t want him to love her because she didn\u2019t want to love him. It sounded awful, but all she wanted was relief from the overwhelming loneliness she\u2019d endured ever since Carson\u2019s death. And who was to say that she wasn\u2019t simply a conquest for Dash? Forbidden fruit?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility that he\u2019d seen her as a challenge. No, he hadn\u2019t acted on his attraction. He\u2019d been honorable. He hadn\u2019t even pressed her right after Carson\u2019s death. He\u2019d waited. But in that time, his fixation could have grown into something that was nothing more than a need to win.</p><p>Dash wasn\u2019t someone used to not getting his way. He was ruthless in business. Carson had remarked on it many times. He\u2019d admitted that if it weren\u2019t for Dash, their business wouldn\u2019t be what it was now. Carson fully recognized that he didn\u2019t have the heart to be cutthroat. But Dash?</p><p>She shivered, realizing that it had been there all along. His dominance. His personality. She just hadn\u2019t seen it until now. She\u2019d never really studied him. She\u2019d first seen him as someone who didn\u2019t approve of her and later as a friend. But never a dominant, to-die-for alpha male. And never would she have dreamed that she\u2019d be lying in his arms, tied to him after making love.</p><p>His free arm was crooked above his head and he lazily ran his fingers through the strands of her hair as he stared down into her eyes. He hadn\u2019t turned off the lamp and she could see every part of his expression.</p><p>She licked her lips, her thoughts wandering to their earlier conversation about Jensen Tucker. She knew she didn\u2019t have the right to ask for what she wanted. Dash owed her nothing when it came to the business he\u2019d owned with Carson.</p> <p>Yes, Carson had left her a percentage of the business, but she had no say in the running. She was given a portion of the profits, but it had been clear that she was to have no authority. Some women may have been insulted by that dictate, but Joss had no desire\u2014or the knowledge necessary\u2014to assist in the running of her husband\u2019s business.</p><p>It was in good hands. Dash was the best. She had absolute confidence in his ability to keep them all solvent.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you for something?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>His brows drew together as if he picked up on her uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet Jensen. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m objecting to him taking Carson\u2019s place or becoming your new partner. But I\u2019d like to meet him. I\u2019ll understand if you say no. I don\u2019t even have a solid reason for wanting to meet him before he takes over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can meet him,\u201d Dash said gently. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to justify your reasons to me. I\u2019ll invite him over for drinks, or if you prefer a more public place, we can arrange to have drinks out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you prefer is fine.\u201d And then the realization struck that he was giving her the option of not making it public by offering her the chance to meet Jensen outside of Dash\u2019s home. Because if they met here, it would be obvious that she and Dash were involved.</p> <p>Did she care? She didn\u2019t even know Jensen. But apparently she would come to know him and see him on a semi-regular basis now that he was partnering with Dash.</p><p>It would become public knowledge soon enough. No reason to hide her relationship with Dash. She had nothing to be ashamed of and she\u2019d die before ever making Dash feel as though she were ashamed of him.</p><p>\u201cWe can invite him here,\u201d she said, thinking he\u2019d be pleased with the use of \u201cwe\u201d instead of saying he could invite Jensen.</p><p>And in fact, he did looked pleased with her insinuation, that she\u2019d called his home her own.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll call him in the morning and ask him over for drinks tomorrow evening. Will it bother you, Joss? Because I can\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m just setting up a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between two acquaintances. I can\u2019t pretend that you aren\u2019t mine and that you mean nothing more to me than being my best friend\u2019s widow. If that bothers you, I need to know now because I have no intention of hiding you\u2014us\u2014from anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with it,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThe important people already know. I don\u2019t care about anyone else. I won\u2019t live my life according to what others think and say.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cThat means a lot to me, honey. Though, I\u2019d understand if you needed time to adjust. I know we agreed to jump into things. It\u2019s what you wanted and hell, it\u2019s certainly what I want. I don\u2019t want to wait any longer. But I\u2019d absolutely understand if you want to keep our relationship quiet for a time. At least until you\u2019re more settled and sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath. Did he think she wasn\u2019t sure? Had she given him reason to doubt her sincerity? Or was he simply afraid that it was too good to be true?</p><p>It was hard for her to believe that she was the source of someone\u2019s hopes and dreams. Carson had been happy with her. He\u2019d never let a day pass that he hadn\u2019t let her know just what she meant to him. She\u2019d considered herself the luckiest woman alive.</p><p>Carson was . . . larger than life. Handsome. Wealthy. Extremely loving and generous. Always affectionate. He wasn\u2019t a man who worried about what others thought. If they were together in public, he touched her frequently. Just little shows of affection. He held her hand, put an arm around her or he kissed her, giving others no doubt of his feelings for her.</p><p>Any woman would have wanted someone like Carson, and he\u2019d wanted her. Just her. She wasn\u2019t in his league. Didn\u2019t come from his world, though he\u2019d argue that his current circumstances weren\u2019t ones he was born into. His upbringing hadn\u2019t been good. He\u2019d fought for every dollar he earned, the lifestyle he\u2019d claimed. For himself and for Kylie.</p><p>His devotion to his family, to both Joss and Kylie, forever endeared Carson to Joss. He was one of a kind. How could she hope to ever find that kind of love and devotion again?</p><p>Except here was Dash. All of the things Carson was and yet . . . more. He was too perfect for her. The manifestation of every single fantasy she\u2019d ever entertained. She hadn\u2019t considered that there was a man in existence who could possibly meet her criteria, and yet he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat will your family think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>One of the things she and Carson had in common was that neither had family. Except Kylie. And Joss had come to think of her as her own sister. Not just a sister but her best friend. But her father had divorced her mother when Joss was young, and her mother passed away after an extended illness when Joss was still in college. Her mother was why Joss had pursued a degree in nursing.</p><p>The nurses in charge of her mother\u2019s care had been wonderful. Compassionate, warm. They\u2019d gone the extra mile to make Joss\u2019s mother as comfortable as possible in her final days, and Joss had vowed she would make the same difference in someone\u2019s life.</p><p>Yet she\u2019d quit her job after marrying Carson. At the time she hadn\u2019t minded. She\u2019d been in the throes of a new relationship and utterly confident in their marriage. And the truth was, she\u2019d craved the kind of relationship where she was cared for. Protected. Cherished. Carson had provided all the things she desired. Except dominance.</p><p>Perhaps she should consider going back to nursing. She\u2019d kept up her training for that eventuality, but she still hadn\u2019t taken steps to go back to work.</p><p>\u201cMy family will be very happy for me,\u201d Dash said. \u201cMy brothers thought me a fool for waiting as long as I did. They\u2019ve known how I felt about you for a long time. My mother worried for me. She thought I was a fool to have a thing for a married woman. And not just any married woman, but a woman married to my best friend and business partner. Talk about a recipe for disaster,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cI hope they like me,\u201d Joss whispered.</p><p>The idea of meeting his family now made her nervous. Yes, she\u2019d met them in the capacity of Carson\u2019s wife, and they had embraced them both. But she\u2019d never known that they knew Dash had feelings for her, and now she\u2019d be meeting them as Dash\u2019s . . . lover? Someone they knew was important to him. That changed everything. She just hoped she measured up and they accepted her new role in Dash\u2019s life.</p><p>Dash smoothed the hair from her brow and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cThey\u2019ll love you. And they\u2019ll be thrilled that we\u2019re finally together.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound so . . . final. A done deal. Inevitable. Though they hadn\u2019t talked about anything more serious than a sexual relationship and the fact that she would submit to him, but his actions, the way he spoke, hinted at something far more permanent.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain how she felt about that. What if she was setting herself up for more hurt?</p><p>Chessy had asked her if she\u2019d rather have one perfect year with Dash and then lose him or if she\u2019d prefer not to even give them a chance. At the time she\u2019d considered that any time she had with him would be worth it no matter the end result. Much like her time with Carson. She wouldn\u2019t go back and change a single thing, even knowing she\u2019d only have him for three years. Three of the best years of her life.</p><p>But now? She wondered if she\u2019d been wrong to think that any time with him was preferable to none at all. It had taken her three years to put herself back together after losing Carson. Could she survive losing someone she loved a second time? And for that matter, how did she feel about Dash?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in love with him. Not yet. It was too soon. Her feelings confused her. She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the entire situation. It had happened too quickly. So much had changed in such a short period of time and she couldn\u2019t afford to let her emotions rule her actions. Not only did she not want to get hurt, but she didn\u2019t want to hurt Dash either.</p><p>\u201cI know I said I wanted to meet Jensen soon, but if it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019d prefer to wait on your family awhile.\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly, pressing tiny kisses to her face, eyes and nose.</p><p>\u201cWe have all the time in the world, Joss. No rush. I like the idea of having you to myself for a while before I have to share you with others.\u201d</p><p>She yawned and snuggled closer to him, as close as she could manage with their wrists bound together. On impulse, she kissed the side of his neck, inhaling his masculine scent and savoring it.</p><p>So many nights she\u2019d spent alone, aching, so very empty. And now she was in bed with Dash, and he was wrapped possessively around her, his leg thrown over hers. She could feel his erection, his quick intake of breath when her teeth grazed his neck. She barely had time to wonder if he planned to deny himself when suddenly she was turned, the hand that was tied to his yanked high over her head.</p><p>With none of his earlier patience or tenderness, he roughly spread her legs with his free hand and was inside her, hard and deep, before she could even take a breath.</p><p>Pleasure burst over her like an exploding firework. She was too stunned to cry out, to give voice to the overwhelming sensation of him being so hard and thick inside her.</p><p>\u201cThis time is for me,\u201d he growled as he pumped into her. \u201cYou make me crazy, Joss. I swore I wouldn\u2019t take you again tonight. That I\u2019d take things slow. But your mouth on my neck broke every ounce of my restraint.\u201d</p><p>She smiled but her vision was hazy. All she could do was feel the power of his movements. His ownership of her body. Her bound hand was pressed firmly into the pillows. He held her down, making movement impossible. And she didn\u2019t care. She loved the vulnerability of her position. She loved knowing she was powerless as he slaked his lust. It excited her, bringing her closer to the edge.</p><p>No foreplay. No workup. And yet she was already precariously close to coming. All he had to do was touch her, exert his dominance, and she was his to command.</p><p>\u201cSo damn sweet,\u201d he muttered, his face strained as he pounded into her, mindlessly, like a rutting beast in the throes of mating. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this, Joss. Of you. And me. Together. Finally together. I\u2019ll never let you go, honey. I hope to hell you\u2019re prepared for that. If you ever try to walk away from me, I\u2019ll fight like hell to keep you right where you belong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She arched upward, wanting, needing more, desperate for release. Her skin itched, like it was alive. Edgy. Bordering on pain.</p><p>His impassioned statement spoke to the very heart of her. Soothed every fear. He made her feel cherished and . . . loved. And she hadn\u2019t felt loved and adored in so very long.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d said that this time was about him, he slid his fingers between them, finding and stroking her clit. She went wet around him, her entire body tightening, clenching with agonizing need.</p><p>\u201cGet there,\u201d he commanded. \u201cCome for me, Joss. Now.\u201d</p><p>To her utter surprise, her body obeyed him. She was helpless to do anything but obey him. She hadn\u2019t thought she was there yet. Almost but not quite. But the moment the forceful command was given, she began coming. Wave after wave washed over her, spreading throughout her body until she felt nothing but the sweetest of pleasures.</p><p>He spurted deep inside her, filling her with his liquid heat. For several moments, the only sound that could be heard was the slap of flesh against flesh and their ragged breaths spilling from their mouths.</p><p>And then he lowered himself to her body, panting with exertion. He closed his eyes and rested his forehead to hers, his nostrils flaring as he sought to catch his breath.</p><p>When he withdrew only an inch, she moaned softly. The sound was part pleasure and part pain. She was deliciously sore in places she hadn\u2019t used in a long time. Her entire body tingled in the aftermath of her orgasm. Her cl*tthrobbed, a tiny pulse point between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI should clean us up,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to untie you from me nor do I want to withdraw from your body just yet. I like it here. You connected to me not only by being tied, but me deep inside you for as long as I can remain there.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her free arm around him, rubbing her palm over his buttocks and back.</p><p>\u201cI like it too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe can always change the sheets in the morning, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed her lips, the soft smooching sound echoing in the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to roll us over so you\u2019re on top. There\u2019s nothing more I\u2019d like than for you to sleep draped across me. I wouldn\u2019t normally stay hard enough to stay inside a woman this long, but I swear, honey, you so much as breathe and I get hard and stay that way. I just had the two most earth-shattering orgasms of my life and I\u2019m still hard as a stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you inside me,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damn good thing because I intend to spend a hell of a lot of time inside you from now on.\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>JOSS came awake, violently aroused, her body responding, even in the deep sleep she\u2019d fallen into. Dash was over her, their hands unbound, both of his framing her h*ps as he plunged deeply inside her.</p><p>She gasped, her eyes flying open to see his glittering gaze boring into hers. His expression was intense, his jaw tight as he thrust again and again.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he murmured, leaning down to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cUgh, morning breath,\u201d she said, twisting her lips to the side so he wouldn\u2019t taste her unbrushed teeth.</p><p>He laughed and forced her mouth back to his. \u201cYou taste wonderful, Joss. You have nothing to worry about there. Get used to it, because the hell I\u2019m going to wait to have you each morning until you\u2019ve done all your girly preparation.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew and she would have protested, but he quickly flipped her over so she was facedown on the mattress. God, he was demanding. So forceful. She loved every second of it.</p><p>Reaching beneath her, he lifted her behind just enough that he could plunge back into her from behind. Her fingers curled into the sheets, making tight fists as he rode her roughly, pressing her further into the mattress.</p> <p>He was deeper, bigger this way. He filled her to capacity, stretching her, the sensation an exquisite mix of pleasure and edgy pain. She closed her eyes, giving herself over to the sensation, to him. She surrendered completely, allowing him to take his pleasure however he wanted.</p><p>His palms cupped her ass, molding the cheeks and caressing as he spread her wider before thrusting again. His thumb brushed over the seam of her ass and she shivered as dark thoughts overtook her.</p><p>She and Carson had never tried anal sex. Would it be something Dash wanted? The thought didn\u2019t frighten her. If anything, it aroused her even more, and she was already nearly out of her mind with pleasure.</p><p>As if reading the unspoken question, Dash leaned down, blanketing her with his body, stilling his movements so he was buried deep inside her. He kissed her shoulder and then nipped a line up the curve of her neck until she shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your ass, Joss. Make no mistake about it. I\u2019ll have every part of you and you\u2019ll hold nothing back from me. I own you now. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>The words sent her hurtling straight over the edge. Sex was much more about the mind, at least for women. Desire started in the brain. Her body merely followed suit. And with those words, she was violently aroused. It was too much. Her orgasm flashed, bright and burning hot. She bucked upward, desperate for more. She wanted it hard, deep and fast.</p><p>\u201cMy darling likes that,\u201d Dash murmured even as he powered into her, as fast and as hard as she needed so desperately.</p><p>She wilted into the mattress, her strength gone, her mind complete and utter mush. He wasn\u2019t finished yet and he took his time, teasing and tormenting her hypersensitive flesh. He dragged his c**k through swollen tissues and then plunged forward again until finally he found his own release, straining forward, covering her body with his own.</p><p>When he was finished, he lowered his full weight to her body, pressing her down onto the bed. She could feel the sharp rise and fall of his chest as he sought to catch his breath. And he was still pulsing in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he murmured against her neck.</p><p>She tried to shake her head but couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was wonderful, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He remained there a moment longer before finally pushing upward. Then he withdrew, her body still clutching greedily at him as he pulled free.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to the small of her back and then got up from the bed. She didn\u2019t have time to turn over before he gathered her in his arms and picked her up, carrying her toward the bathroom.</p><p>He turned the shower on and after testing the temperature, he pulled her inside with him where he proceeded to wash every inch of her body. It was torment. He paid extra special attention to the still-quivering flesh between her legs. He had her worked up and well on her way to another orgasm by the time he washed and rinsed her hair.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She obeyed instantly, lowering herself to the wet floor of the shower. The warm spray cascaded over both of them. His c**k was painfully erect, huge and stiff.</p><p>\u201cGet me off, Joss,\u201d he commanded. \u201cBut I want you to get yourself off too. Touch yourself. But don\u2019t come until I do. If you do, you\u2019ll be punished.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the authority in his voice. It was almost worth it to disobey him just to find out what his punishment would entail. Did that make her an idiot? But no. She didn\u2019t want to start off by blatantly disobeying him. She didn\u2019t want punishment. She wanted pleasure. And he\u2019d already said that he would spank her regardless of whether she disobeyed him or not.</p><p>He guided his erection to her lips and she slid her fingers down her belly between her legs to find her clit. Her entire body clenched the moment she touched herself and she knew she\u2019d have to be careful or she would end up coming before he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about this,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYour gorgeous mouth wrapped around my dick.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up, taken by the sight of him na**d, wet, water beading and running down his beautiful body. He looked like a god. Utterly perfect. Muscled, lean in all the right places. Not a spare ounce of flesh. He was a man who took excellent care of his body.</p><p>She tightened the suction around his cock, enjoying the instant reaction she got. Though he was in command and she was the submissive, she realized how much power she truly had. She liked that feeling. That she held him in the palm of her hand and that she was in control of his pleasure.</p><p>Warming to the task at hand, she made love to his cock, savoring the taste and feel of him in her mouth. Hot, so alive, pulsing with strength. He could so easily hurt her, but he was so careful to temper his power. His touch was tender, his movements weighed with her protection in mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close, honey. You need to get there too.\u201d</p><p>She found her sweet spot, exerting just the right amount of pressure, and then moved in a slow circle, her orgasm rising and swelling deep in her belly. But still she waited. Remembering his directive that she not come until he did.</p><p>He palmed her forehead and then reached with his other hand to grasp the base of his cock.</p><p>\u201cTake it one more time. Deep, honey. Take it deep. And then I\u2019m going to pull out and come all over your mouth.\u201d</p><p>The erotic words, the image he inspired, nearly had her coming. Her hand froze, leaving her dangling precariously on the edge. She sucked him deep, taking him all the way to the back of her throat, and she swallowed against the tip, thinking it would bring him pleasure.</p><p>His groan told her she wasn\u2019t wrong. And then suddenly he ripped himself from her mouth and began pumping his c**k with his fist.</p><p>\u201cCome, Joss.\u201d</p><p>His command was guttural, as though he could barely form the words. The first jet of s**en hit her cheek. The second splashed over her lips and the third hit her chin. Hot, much hotter than the water. It scalded her skin and she rolled her cl*tharder and faster, trying to catch up.</p><p>As the last jet of s**en hit her chin and rolled down her neck, quickly washed away by the spray of the shower, her orgasm rocked her to the core. Her knees gave out and she would have slipped but Dash looped his hands underneath her armpits and held her steady as she quivered and shuddered with her own release.</p><p>Gently he pulled her to her feet, supporting her weight until he was certain she was steady. Then he turned her into the spray, rinsing his cum from her body.</p><p>The heat of the shower combined with the earth-shattering orgasm she\u2019d experienced left her shaky. He helped her from the stall and then wrapped her in a huge towel. He briskly dried her hair and then made certain he removed the moisture from other parts of her body.</p><p>When he was done, he dropped a kiss on her forehead and patted her gently on the behind.</p><p>\u201cDry your hair and comb it out while I go prepare breakfast. Normally, I\u2019ll tend to all your needs. It will give me great pleasure to dry and brush your hair for you. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hungry, as am I. But wear nothing, Joss. We\u2019ll eat in the living room with you at my feet.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, wondering if her question would anger him.</p><p>He glanced curiously at her, cocking his head to the side. Then he cupped her cheek and kissed her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey? I can tell you want to ask. You never have to be afraid to ask me anything. I want you to trust me and be confident in me\u2014us. So ask what it is I can see you\u2019re dying to ask.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully. \u201cI was just . . . nervous. I mean you said you wanted me to wear nothing, but isn\u2019t Jensen coming over today? Will you expect me to wear nothing when people are over?\u201d</p><p>Color flooded her cheeks and she ducked her head. She wanted this to work. She liked this side of Dash she\u2019d never imagined. The forceful, dominant, utterly alpha male. She\u2019d never felt so . . . free . . . in her life, which sounded absurd given that she\u2019d ceded absolute power and control to another man. She should feel constrained. Confined. But she felt as though she\u2019d finally set free a side of herself that she\u2019d always longed to let loose. Now that she\u2019d tasted Dash\u2019s dominance, she had no desire to go back to her stale, sterile existence of the last three years.</p><p>Dash\u2019s expression became utterly serious. He framed her face in his hands, forcing her to look directly into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything that embarrasses or shames you, honey. Never. Yes, when we\u2019re alone, I absolutely expect you to wear whatever I tell you. But I would never put you in a position where you weren\u2019t comfortable. If we go to The House, yes, you will absolutely heed my instructions in a public setting, and you will be na**d in front of others. But not here in my\u2014our\u2014home. This is your sanctuary and it\u2019s the one place above all others where you will feel safe and protected at all times. Nothing touches you here, Joss. Nothing but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said in a shaky voice.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her, slipping his tongue inside to taste her.</p><p>\u201cNow, dry your hair and then come into the living room so I can feed my woman.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, a ridiculous thrill coursing through her veins at his words. My woman. Like she belonged to him. And she did even if it was still hard for her to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cI want this to work,\u201d she said fiercely, surprising herself with the vehemence of her statement.</p><p>\u201cIt will work,\u201d Dash said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve overcome the most difficult part. Making the decision to gift me with your submission was the hard part, honey. The rest you just have to leave to me and trust that I\u2019ll provide you all the things you want and need. And I\u2019ll do that, Joss, or die trying.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the statement even though she knew it was just a figure of speech.</p><p>Regret simmered in his eyes and his expression softened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. That was not well done of me. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She reached for his hand and slid it around to her lips. She pressed a kiss into his palm and then stared back up at him, smiling. \u201cI know. And I\u2019ll try not to be so sensitive. You shouldn\u2019t have to watch your every word for fear of hurting me. I\u2019ll work on it, Dash. I promise. It\u2019s just that the thought of losing you too . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hugged her to him and she hugged back, savoring the closeness, the intimacy that was still new and shiny.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lose me, Joss. Believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Even as she agreed, she whispered a prayer that things would work out and that nothing ever happened to Dash. She couldn\u2019t survive it again. Once had nearly destroyed her. If something ever happened to Dash, she wouldn\u2019t survive this time.</p> <p>SIXTEEN</p><p>JOSS reclined onto the sofa, taking the glass of wine Dash offered her. She sipped, her stomach churning with nervousness. It was silly to be so anxious to meet Jensen, her husband\u2019s replacement, but she was. She\u2019d likely never come into contact with him after this meeting since she had nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of Dash\u2019s business. Kylie would be more affected by Jensen coming on board since she would have to work for him.</p><p>She knew Kylie wouldn\u2019t take it well. She hoped that by meeting Jensen and offering him her acceptance, it would smooth over whatever objections Kylie had when told of the new partner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on edge, honey. Why?\u201d</p><p>Dash settled down on the couch next to her, reaching for her with his free arm. She went readily, balancing her wineglass in her other hand as she snuggled into Dash\u2019s embrace.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>He squeezed her to him and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll like him. He\u2019s very good at what he does. You must know that I\u2019d never do anything to jeopardize yours or Kylie\u2019s futures by choosing the wrong person to bring into the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to take it well, is she?\u201d Joss asked, turning anxiously to face Dash.</p><p>\u201cAt first I don\u2019t imagine she will, but she doesn\u2019t have a choice. She works for me, not the other way around. She won\u2019t have a choice but to accept him. I won\u2019t allow her to cause problems. If it comes down to it, she\u2019ll have to be let go. It\u2019s not what I want and I\u2019d certainly ensure that she\u2019s well provided for. I promised Carson that I would always look after the both of you. It\u2019s a promise I intend to keep.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, gazing curiously at him. \u201cHe asked you to do that? I mean specifically?\u201d</p><p>Dash grimaced. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d she persisted. \u201cIs this something you two discussed?\u201d</p><p>Dash sighed. \u201cYes. We spoke about it a short time before his accident. I\u2019ve often wondered since then if he didn\u2019t know. If he had a feeling that something was going to happen. It\u2019s not something we ever discussed and then out of the blue he brought it up. And he was serious about it. It wasn\u2019t an off-the-cuff \u2018just in case\u2019 conversation. He was absolutely serious and he wanted my promise that if anything ever happened to him that I\u2019d ensure you and Kylie were taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Joss weighed his words for a moment, discomfited by the idea that she was merely a method of Dash fulfilling a promise to his best friend. But no, he\u2019d said that he had feelings for her long before then. When she and Carson were first married. A dozen questions bubbled to the surface but she wasn\u2019t certain they should be asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that look, Joss. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>This time she sighed, casting her gaze downward to his waist. He slid his fingers underneath her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze once more.</p><p>\u201cIs that what I am to you? An obligation?\u201d</p><p>His frown was immediate. In fact he looked pissed. She regretted voicing her brief fear because it was obvious he had no liking for it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer that. It was a silly question,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut there\u2019s another question I wanted to ask you. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wondered ever since we began this. Since you told me you had feelings for me when I was married to Carson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d Dash said. \u201cBut be prepared for an honest answer, honey. If the truth hurts you then be careful what you ask. Because I won\u2019t lie to you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He\u2019d always been honest. She knew that much.</p><p>\u201cWhen Carson and I first began dating, I felt as though you didn\u2019t approve of me. That you didn\u2019t approve of our relationship or the fact that things moved so quickly. At the time I chalked it up to you being concerned about your friend. But lately I\u2019ve wondered . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been wondering?\u201d Dash asked gently.</p><p>She lifted her eyes to his, studying his features.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you were attracted to me. But you didn\u2019t say when those feelings started. Were you attracted to me from the very start? Is that why you didn\u2019t seem happy about me and Carson being together? Were you . . . jealous?\u201d</p><p>Dash was silent for a long moment and then he heaved out his breath, his shoulders drooping slightly. He turned away from her, directing his gaze toward the fireplace. His hold loosened on her and she shifted away, just so she could better see him.</p><p>\u201cThat was part of it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI was jealous as hell. The first time I met you. Do you remember? Carson brought you to the company Christmas party and there you were. So beautiful it made my teeth ache. You were adorably shy, reserved. And you clung to Carson\u2019s side the entire night. I couldn\u2019t look at you without resenting the fact that he\u2019d found you first.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It shames me that I treated you so curtly in the beginning. I actually hoped that things wouldn\u2019t work out between you and Carson because I wanted you for myself. I had planned to swoop in and claim you the minute things ended between you and Carson. But it became very clear that he had no intention of letting you go. I damned my luck. Here was the woman of my dreams and she was with my best friend. I saw how happy you made him. I fully admit, I looked for faults. I looked for any evidence that you weren\u2019t what was best for him. Hell, I hoped that he\u2019d lose interest or you\u2019d do something to put him off. That makes me a total bastard, but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her, his eyes dark with regret.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to fail just so I could have you as my own. But I saw how devoted you were to him. I saw how other men made veiled invitations, flirted with you, propositioned you, and you never even looked their way. You were one hundred percent loyal and devoted to Carson. How could I not want that for my best friend? It was hell, Joss. Hell watching him be so damn happy and resenting him with every breath. And worse was the fact that after he found out, he wasn\u2019t even pissed. He laughed and said he couldn\u2019t blame me for wanting you when he was consumed with that same want. He told me that it was a damn good thing he\u2019d met you first because I would have locked you in my bedroom and never let you out. He wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in bewilderment, unable to process everything he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cI thought all this time you didn\u2019t like me. Not at first. Later, I knew you\u2019d come to accept me, but I always felt like you didn\u2019t approve in the beginning. You intimidated me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his forehead to hers, stroking her hair with one hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that, honey. You\u2019ll never know how much. But I was in an impossible situation, and having to see you with Carson, seeing the both of you so blindingly happy, was like a fist to my gut every single time. But you have to know, I need you to know, that I never wished him ill. Losing him hurt me, and if I could have him back, I\u2019d let you go in a heartbeat, even if it meant killing myself in the process.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Joss\u2019s eyes. She blinked furiously, determined not to let them fall.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt means a lot to me that you cared so much about him. He loved you, you know. He never had a family. Just Kylie. You and your family meant so much to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll regret his death for the rest of my life, but honey, you need to know that at the same time I do not regret having this opportunity with you. I\u2019d give anything to have him back, but I can\u2019t bring myself to regret having you in my bed and in my life.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, a wobbly smile, her lips quivering with the effort. He kissed each corner of her mouth to steady her lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret it either,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI want to see where this takes us, Dash. I\u2019m willing to take the risk.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang, interrupting the intimacy that surrounded them like a fog. He kissed her once more and then smoothed her hair that was slightly mussed. She hastily ran her fingers through her hair as he rose. He touched her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, honey. There\u2019s not a thing wrong with you. Sit tight and I\u2019ll let Jensen in.\u201d</p><p>She scooted to the edge of the couch as Dash disappeared to answer the door. She sucked in steadying breaths, cursing her sudden bout of nerves. He was just a man. His opinion of her didn\u2019t matter. But she wanted this meeting because she was curious about the man who\u2019d fill the vacancy left by Carson.</p><p>A moment later, Dash returned, Jensen Tucker close behind. She sucked in her breath at her first look at the man Dash was taking on as a partner. If she\u2019d thought Dash was intimidating in the beginning, Jensen Tucker scared the hell out of her.</p><p>He looked intense, brooding, utterly focused and scary as hell. His skin was tanned, matching his hair and eyes, brown, as though he spent a lot of time in the sun. He had a rugged appearance that screamed military or cop. She wondered what his past was and if she was right in her assessment that he was a warrior.</p><p>Kylie would likely dive under her desk the moment she laid eyes on Jensen. Joss felt sorry for her because Kylie feared strong, dominant men, and Jensen Tucker definitely qualified on all counts.</p><p>When Dash stopped in front of her, he extended his hand to help her up. She rose gracefully, though her heart was pounding as she stared up at Jensen. Then he smiled at her, a gentle smile that transformed his entire face from brooding to a much softer-looking man. It was as if he knew he intimidated her and was taking pains not to do so.</p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat and extended her hand to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Joss Breckenridge,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cDash has told me a lot about you. I\u2019m very happy to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jensen\u2019s hand closed over hers, firm, strong, just as he appeared. But he surprised her by lifting her hand to his mouth to press a kiss to the back of it.</p><p>He squeezed once before letting her go and Dash reclaimed her hand, pulling her into his side as if to openly declare his possession. Joss found she didn\u2019t mind at all. Her heart fluttered over the fact that Dash was publicly putting his stamp on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to meet you as well, Joss. Pictures don\u2019t do you justice. You\u2019re far more beautiful in person.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, wondering where he would have seen pictures of her. She tucked that away to ask Dash later. It relieved her that Jensen made no mention of Carson. No condolences, no dancing around the issue of him replacing her dead husband. He didn\u2019t bring it up at all, as Joss had feared he would, and that it would make the entire evening awkward.</p><p>Delighted that everything seemed to be off on the right footing, she directed her attention to both men, remembering her duties as hostess. Though it had been several years since she\u2019d entertained, when she and Carson were married, they\u2019d entertained often.</p><p>She was naturally shy and it had been hard to overcome her self-consciousness and get used to being open and friendly with strangers. But over time and with Carson\u2019s encouragement, she\u2019d managed to become adept at handling social situations.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you two like to drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd please, sit down and make yourselves comfortable. There are appetizers in the kitchen. I\u2019ll bring them out as soon as I\u2019ve gotten you your drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to serve us, honey,\u201d Dash murmured, but there was approval in his eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get the tray of food and I\u2019ll fix mine and Jensen\u2019s drinks. Would you like a refill of your wine?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d</p><p>Dash watched as she walked away, the heels she wore accentuating her shapely legs. They didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Jensen either. The other man glanced up at Dash, a gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you moved in so quickly,\u201d Jensen murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman a man would do anything to possess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dash said shortly. \u201cAnd she\u2019s definitely claimed. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Jensen chuckled. \u201cNo need to get uptight. I prefer very specific qualities in the women I\u2019m with. Not many women are up for what I demand. I doubt Joss would take me very well.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, Dash lifted an eyebrow as he studied the other man. They were venturing into personal territory, an area they\u2019d never delved into. Their dealings had been purely business, but he assumed if they were going to be partners that at some point they\u2019d learn more about one another.</p><p>\u201cCare to explain that? That\u2019s pretty vague,\u201d Dash muttered.</p><p>Jensen\u2019s features were indecipherable. \u201cSubmission. I require absolute submission in the women I\u2019m with.\u201d He shrugged casually. \u201cNot many women are willing to give a man absolute control.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise Dash in the least. Jensen was a hardass bastard. Dash had figured they had more in common than just business interests, but they\u2019d certainly never discussed their personal lives.</p><p>\u201cI think Joss may surprise you in that area,\u201d Dash said dryly. \u201cNot that I want you testing her receptiveness. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently we have more in common than I thought,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cAnd if I get what you\u2019re saying, then you really are a lucky bastard. Too bad she\u2019s taken. If she\u2019s not only beautiful and intelligent but submissive as well, then I\u2019m sorry I met her too late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStory of my life,\u201d Dash murmured. \u201cI was too late the first time. Fate gave me another chance and I don\u2019t intend to f**k it up.\u201d</p><p>Sympathy shone in Jensen\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo you had a thing for her when she was married. And to your best friend. That had to suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>A thoughtful look crossed Jensen\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m fairly new to the area as you know. When we first met, it was through business trips to Houston. But now that I\u2019m here, I haven\u2019t really had time to scope it out. Any clubs here? You know anything about the places in this area?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s one good one. Very exclusive. It\u2019s called The House. Owned and managed by Damon Roche. Wealthy son of a bitch and he caters to an upscale clientele. He\u2019s backed off in recent months. He\u2019s married and has a daughter who occupies most of his time, but he still keeps a hand in the operations. I can give you his contact information and put in a word for you. He does an extensive background check on prospective members, but it\u2019s a very well-run, safe place. I think you\u2019d like it. There\u2019s something for every sexual proclivity there and no shortage of submissive women looking for what a man like yourself provides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll take you up on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do me a favor. Since we\u2019ll be working together, and not that I expect you to apprise me of your comings and goings, but I intend to take Joss there a few times and I wouldn\u2019t want her to be uncomfortable, so I\u2019d appreciate a heads-up if you plan to be there. I\u2019d rather avoid the nights when we\u2019d run into people she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jensen said.</p><p>\u201cThere is another couple who has a membership there. You\u2019ll likely meet them at some point because they are friends of mine and Joss. Chessy and Tate Morgan. They\u2019re married and they go, though more infrequently than they used to. I plan to get with Tate to ensure we don\u2019t run into them on the nights I take Joss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would appear you\u2019re acquainted with many people who share our choice of lifestyle,\u201d Jensen said dryly.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t as uncommon as one might believe,\u201d Dash countered. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something most couples advertise. I never dreamed that Joss would be open to this kind of relationship. Hell, I\u2019ve waited three long years to make my move and I was damn near too late. She showed up at The House one night when I was there and I hadn\u2019t been in a damn long time. It was fortunate I was there or she would have ended up with some other guy who wouldn\u2019t treat her as well as I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky indeed,\u201d Jensen murmured. \u201cIf I had been there, she certainly wouldn\u2019t have gone home alone. I\u2019ll have to check this place out. You\u2019ve intrigued me now.\u201d</p><p>Dash scowled at Jensen\u2019s statement until he saw the twinkle in the other man\u2019s eyes. Jensen was yanking his chain, the bastard, and Dash had risen to the bait.</p><p>\u201cOne other thing you need to know, or rather prepare yourself for,\u201d Dash said quickly, wanting this part of the conversation over before Joss returned from the kitchen.</p><p>Jensen arched an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I told you I wanted to tell Joss and Kylie myself before we announced our partnership. Joss took it very well, but then I expected nothing less from her. Kylie, however, won\u2019t take it as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told her yet?\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cI plan to tell her Monday when she comes to work. The thing is, you should know dominant men scare the f**k out of her. I don\u2019t know how much you know of her situation. Hers and Carson\u2019s. They grew up in hell. Their father was an abusive son of a bitch who ran his household with an iron fist. His brand of dominance was bullshit. No true Dominant would ever abuse his wife or children. But she doesn\u2019t know the difference. She fears strong men, and hell, you scared Joss to death when you first walked in. I could see it in her eyes though she covered it well and recovered quickly. But you should know that Kylie is going to be extremely wary around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be a bastard to her,\u201d Jensen said, a defensive note to his voice.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Dash said. \u201cI just thought you should know where she\u2019s coming from. Don\u2019t take it personally. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her experience with men in general. She doesn\u2019t trust anyone. Carson shielded and protected her well into her adult life. I\u2019m not sure he did her any favors even though I understand where he was coming from. I\u2019m just letting you know that things may not be easy at first between the two of you. And I\u2019d appreciate it if you were patient and understanding with her.\u201d</p><p>Jensen nodded, his expression growing dark. \u201cHow bad was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst,\u201d Dash said quietly. \u201cHis wife tucked tail and ran, leaving the kids at his mercy, and he abused them horribly. Kylie got the worst of it maybe because she reminded him of his wife. Who the hell knows? Carson wasn\u2019t always able to protect her, though God knows he tried. Her father raped her and beat her. Repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Jensen swore. \u201cNo wonder she\u2019s so wary around men. Can\u2019t say I blame her. I\u2019ll be careful with her. I don\u2019t want her to fear me. It sickens me that any woman would have reason to fear men as she does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn that we agree,\u201d Dash said. \u201cCarson couldn\u2019t give Joss what she needed. Dominance. And she loved him too much to ask it of him. But he knew. And now that she\u2019s taken that step and wants what I can give her, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make her happy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you luck,\u201d Jensen said sincerely. \u201cShe\u2019s a good woman. You\u2019re a lucky son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dash said quietly.</p><p>They both fell silent when Joss reentered the room carrying the silver tray with the hors d\u2019oeuvres she\u2019d prepared earlier.</p><p>She was a dream in the kitchen. When she and Carson had entertained in their home she\u2019d always prepared all the food despite Carson telling her he\u2019d have it catered. She\u2019d always laughed and told him there was no need and that she enjoyed cooking. Dash looked forward to her cooking for him even if he planned to spoil her by cooking for her. It was a duty they could share. He liked the idea of being in the kitchen with her. His kitchen. He wanted her to settle in and make herself at home. Put her stamp on his sterile environment. He couldn\u2019t wait for her to light up his entire home and make it her own.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Joss. This is delicious,\u201d Jensen said appreciatively after downing two of the confections.</p><p>\u201cI got caught up in conversation and didn\u2019t fix our drinks,\u201d Dash said ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ll remedy that at once. Hand me your wineglass, honey. I\u2019ll pour yours first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll get them,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cYou two continue your conversation. I can make most drinks. Carson bought me a book one year and it became my mission to be able to make any drink requested when we entertained. Try me. What can I get for you?\u201d</p><p>Jensen smiled and sent Dash another look before mouthing, \u201cLucky bastard.\u201d Dash grinned and acknowledged Jensen\u2019s silent compliment with a smug nod.</p><p>\u201cSurprise me,\u201d Dash said. \u201cFix me whatever you decide. I\u2019ll like whatever you make. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cOnly thing I don\u2019t care for is rum. Anything else goes.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s smile was breathtaking. Her eyes warmed with delight and sudden shyness. Dash could see her worry even as her mind was buzzing with what to fix. She didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. Didn\u2019t she realize that it wasn\u2019t possible to disappoint him? She could fix him rubbing alcohol, and as long as she smiled at him that way, he\u2019d drink it down and never taste it.</p><p>\u201cSit, please, and make yourselves comfortable,\u201d Joss said, gesturing toward the chairs. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a moment with your drinks. Dash? Is your minibar stocked or do you store most of your liquor in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you need should be there,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t, let me know and I\u2019ll get whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>She sent him another dazzling smile and hurried toward the bar to the far left of the living room. He watched her, unable to tear his gaze away from her. Satisfaction gripped him by the throat, spreading clear to his soul.</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019ve got it bad,\u201d Jensen murmured. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you though. She\u2019s a jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is that,\u201d Dash said in a low voice as the two men took their seats. \u201cShe wanted to meet you. She asked for tonight\u2019s meeting. I wonder what she thinks of you and if she\u2019s as smitten as you are.\u201d</p><p>Jensen grinned. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019d complain if she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll slice your balls off,\u201d Dash bit out.</p><p>Jensen laughed and Joss looked up from where she was mixing the drinks, a puzzled look on her face.</p><p>Dash smiled back at her and waved her off. \u201cJust guy talk, honey. Don\u2019t let us interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this thing with Kylie,\u201d Jensen began, turning the subject to a more serious matter. \u201cHow much of a problem do you anticipate my presence will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Dash said honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d take any new partner well at first. In her mind, you\u2019ll be replacing her brother. She\u2019s used to working for me and Carson, but more so for Carson. He brought her into the company when she graduated college. A protective measure on his part because he wanted her where he could take care of her. As I said, he likely didn\u2019t do her any favors, but I also understand why he wanted to protect her. She\u2019s . . . fragile. She still carries the emotional scars of her childhood abuse. Carson was determined to shield her from any hurt in her adult life.</p><p>\u201cAfter he died, she took it hard and it was a while before she could work comfortably with me, even though I\u2019d been there from the start. But she worked in a closer capacity with Carson. I was more of a secondary boss. When I took over, she reported directly to me and acted as my personal assistant. I had one before Carson died, but I dismissed her so Kylie would still have a position.</p><p>\u201cI thought she could act as assistant to us both. She is certainly capable of handling the workload and she knows every single thing that comes through the business. She\u2019s good. But you may opt to hire your own assistant depending on how she reacts to your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, she\u2019s been babied and coddled by you both,\u201d Jensen said.</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease be understanding with her, Jensen,\u201d Joss said quietly.</p><p>Both men looked up to see Joss standing there, drinks in hand. Her expression was troubled, clear worry reflected in her eyes.</p><p>She handed them their drinks and then took a seat next to Dash on the couch. She reached for his hand and he wondered if she even realized that she was reaching out to him for support.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of being a jerk to her,\u201d Jensen said gently.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to insinuate you would,\u201d Joss said, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Kylie is . . . fragile.\u201d</p><p>Her words echoed Dash\u2019s own description of just moments ago.</p><p>\u201cShe sees things very black-and-white and she\u2019s cautious. She\u2019s had reason to be,\u201d Joss continued. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll frighten her. I don\u2019t say that to insult you,\u201d she hastily added. \u201cBut you\u2019re a very intimidating man. I worry about her\u2014for her. When she feels threatened, she lashes out, and I worry that will anger you or perhaps make you want to replace her. She needs this job, Jensen. Not for the money. Carson provided very generously for her and for me. But she needs the stability. The routine. She\u2019s very good at what she does. I know most people would look at her and think that she got the job because she was Carson\u2019s sister, and that\u2019s true to an extent. But she\u2019s very intelligent and capable. She graduated with a business degree with honors. She\u2019s an asset, as I\u2019m sure Dash can attest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss, you don\u2019t have to defend her to me. Dash has told me of her past, and it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019d be wary. I give you my guarantee that I\u2019ll do everything in my power to put her at ease. If she does the job and proves herself to be as indispensable as you say she is, then she\u2019ll have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Joss said earnestly. \u201cShe\u2019s more than a sister-in-law to me. After Carson d-died, she had no one. Just me and Chessy and of course Dash and Tate.\u201d</p><p>Dash squeezed her hand, proud of the way she\u2019d managed to speak of Carson\u2019s death, only stumbling slightly over the word \u201cdied.\u201d She was making progress, and it gave him hope that he could come to mean more to her and that Carson wouldn\u2019t be a wedge between them even in death.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very loyal friend to her,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cI hope she knows just how lucky she is to have you.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s cheeks colored adorably and she was obviously uncomfortable with Jensen\u2019s compliment. Dash wanted to pull her into his arms and hug her. Hell, he wanted Jensen to get the hell out so he could take her to bed and make love to her all damn night.</p><p>Already his mind was alive with all the possibilities. Free rein. There were dozens of ways he planned to have Joss at his mercy. He could barely contain himself and couldn\u2019t wait to show her all the ways he\u2019d exert his dominance.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan to tell Kylie?\u201d Joss asked, directing her question at Dash though she included both men in her question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMonday morning,\u201d Dash said. \u201cWhen she comes into work.\u201d</p><p>Joss frowned but held silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey? You obviously want to say something,\u201d Dash gently encouraged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide,\u201d she began.</p> <p>\u201cSay what you want to say,\u201d he directed.</p><p>She drew in a breath. \u201cI just thought that perhaps something like this should be said outside of work. It\u2019ll be a shock. And we\u2019re friends. I mean, you\u2019re more than just her employer. I think you owe it to her to tell her someplace more intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d Dash asked slowly.</p><p>She glanced nervously up at him and he wanted to pull her into his arms and reassure her. She had nothing to fear from him. No disapproval. There was nothing she could do that would earn his censure.</p><p>\u201cYou could invite her here,\u201d Joss said. \u201cWe could tell her together. It may be easier than at work. It would also give her time to come to terms before she has to go to work. Time to deal with it so she has it together by the time she has to go in on Monday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cNo one wants her hurt by this and obviously I\u2019m going to be a sore subject with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you came too?\u201d Joss said.</p><p>Jensen looked surprised and then wary.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean right away,\u201d Joss said hastily. \u201cBut perhaps it would be a good idea for you two to meet in neutral territory. She can see that you aren\u2019t an ogre. We could have Kylie over and have a dinner party Sunday night. We could invite Tate and Chessy to come so that Kylie meets Jensen in a group setting. What do you think, Dash?\u201d</p><p>Hell, if it meant her coming to terms so quickly with him and her being together, and she didn\u2019t mind their friends knowing it? He\u2019d agree to damn near anything. Kylie be damned. Joss wanting to host a dinner party at Dash\u2019s house, as a couple? Hell yes.</p><p>Dash glanced over at Jensen. \u201cYou up for dinner Sunday night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay yes,\u201d Joss said impulsively, leaning forward to take Jensen\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019re very much family. It\u2019s always been that way with Carson and Dash\u2019s company. I\u2019d like for you to be a part of that.\u201d</p><p>Jensen looked befuddled and Dash nearly chuckled. Another victim of Joss\u2019s magic. She could soften even the hardest heart and no one could ever refuse her. Not when she asked so prettily. Hell, it would be like kicking a puppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Jensen said, and was rewarded by a blinding smile from Joss.</p><p>She latched onto both of Jensen\u2019s hands and squeezed, delight shining in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cook a marvelous dinner,\u201d she said, excitement evident in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll like Tate and Chessy. You\u2019ll like Kylie too when you\u2019ve had a chance to see what she\u2019s really like.\u201d</p><p>Jensen smiled back at her. Joss\u2019s enthusiasm and evident happiness was contagious. Jensen glanced Dash\u2019s way, and he didn\u2019t even have to mouth the words this time. It was evident in his look. Lucky bastard. Yeah, Dash was lucky all right. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done to deserve this chance with Joss but he wasn\u2019t about to spend any time pondering the whys and wherefores.</p><p>He\u2019d grab the opportunity with both hands and hang on for all he was worth.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p> <p>\u201cMY darling deserves a reward,\u201d Dash said in a husky voice.</p><p>Joss glanced up as he closed the door after seeing Jensen out. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned down to kiss her. \u201cYou were, as always, a fantastic hostess. You made Jensen feel welcome and alleviated any potential awkwardness by asking for a meeting before he came on board. Thanks for that, love.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back and twined her arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m glad you approve. Now what\u2019s this about a reward?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, sending a shiver down her spine. She got the feeling that this reward was not going to be a typical one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I have in mind,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIn exacting detail. And then you have to be honest and tell me if you\u2019re up for what I have planned. The hell of it is I don\u2019t know who will be more rewarded. You or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any reason we can\u2019t both be rewarded?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell not,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what it is you have planned and I\u2019ll tell you whether I\u2019m up for it,\u201d she said with a grin.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her, keeping her linked to him and her arms in place around his neck. As he walked her backward into the living room, he nibbled and nipped at her neck and up to her ear, sending chill bumps dancing over her skin.</p><p>\u201cFirst you\u2019re going to strip down until you\u2019re completely na**d,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to tie you up so you\u2019re completely powerless and subject to my every whim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, sounds good so far,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to insert a plug to prepare you for me. After that I\u2019m going to spank that sweet ass of yours until it\u2019s rosy with my marks.\u201d</p><p>She shivered uncontrollably, her mind exploding with the images he evoked. She let out a small whimper as he sucked the lobe of her ear into his mouth. God, she could come with just his words. She was already aching with need. Her ni**les tingled and hardened to painful points. Her cl*tpulsed and twitched between her legs until she clamped her thighs together to alleviate the burn.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to f**k your mouth, Joss. But I won\u2019t come. Not yet. When I\u2019m close, I\u2019ll flog you again until your ass is burning and you\u2019re on fire with the need for relief. And then I\u2019m going to f**k that ass. I\u2019m going to take you hard and rough, to the very limits of what you can withstand. I won\u2019t be gentle. Not tonight. I\u2019m going to take you as roughly as you can stand. And then I\u2019m going to come all over your ass. I\u2019ll mark it with my cum just like I marked you with the crop. And then I\u2019ll f**k you some more, filling your ass until it spills down the insides of your gorgeous thighs. Think you can handle that, honey? Are you ready to be completely and utterly dominated? Taken over and used purely for my pleasure?\u201d</p><p>The words were silky in her ears, sending her into a dreamlike haze. She could barely form a coherent response, so aroused was she by his statements. It was everything she\u2019d fantasized about, only now it was real and in the here and now and not in her darkest dreams. Was she ready? Was this truly what she wanted or was it merely a fantasy better left in the realm of fantasies, never to be brought to life?</p><p>\u201cTell me, Joss,\u201d he said roughly, tightening his hold around her. \u201cGive me the words.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke his demand, his fingers wound around her hair, pulling it tight until her scalp tingled. This was a side of Dash she\u2019d never seen, never dreamed existed. She licked her lips, her mouth dry with desire and need. So much need.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cI want it, Dash. I want it all. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour safe word,\u201d he said in a guttural voice. \u201cRemember your safe word. If I go too far, use it and I\u2019ll stop immediately. Tell me the word so I know you remember.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled to remember what she\u2019d decided on. She couldn\u2019t imagine Dash going beyond her limits when he seemed so in tune with her needs.</p><p>\u201cG-ghost,\u201d she stammered out.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he said softly, sucking at her ear again. \u201cBut be sure, Joss. Because when you say that word, it ends and the mood will be broken. There won\u2019t be any going back. So be very sure that you truly want me to stop and aren\u2019t just overwhelmed by the moment. I\u2019ll push your limits. You want a man to push you. You\u2019ve said as much. So don\u2019t chicken out the first time things get intense. Because this will be intense, Joss. You need to understand that. When I say I\u2019m going to mark your ass, it\u2019s no game. I will spank you hard. I\u2019ll raise welts on that pretty skin of yours. I won\u2019t break the skin, but you\u2019ll wear the marks the next day and be reminded that I put them there. I want to look at them the next morning and remember that I put them there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her agreement but then quickly voiced her acceptance, knowing he\u2019d force her to say the words, to fully acknowledge the step they were taking.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t use it unless I\u2019m absolutely certain I don\u2019t want to continue,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI trust you, Dash. I know you won\u2019t go too far. And I do want it all. The full measure. I don\u2019t want you to hold back. I want you to do what it is you want without fear of hurting or frightening me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means a lot to me, honey. Now, if we\u2019re finished with talking, I\u2019d rather get on to getting you na**d and bound and at my mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGo into the bedroom, undress and kneel at the foot of the bed. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I get the necessary items. Remember your position. Thighs spread, palms up and resting on your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, Dash. You don\u2019t have to remind me. I won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly at her. \u201cI know you won\u2019t, honey. Now go. I\u2019ll be there in just a moment.\u201d</p><p>Joss hurried toward the bedroom, her pulse thudding in her veins. She was so aroused and excited that she was dizzy with it. His words echoed in her mind, vivid and erotic. She was wildly aroused, so excited that she couldn\u2019t remain still.</p><p>Even when she\u2019d hurriedly undressed and sank to her knees to wait, she fidgeted with impatience. Yes, she\u2019d fantasized about a man having complete control over her body. Of being bound and vulnerable. Of having a man mark her. Inflicting pain that quickly faded to pleasure. But would the reality hold up to her darkest fantasies? Would she enjoy him spanking her and would it be enjoyable or would it be painful with none of the pleasure she imagined?</p><p>There was only one way to find out. She\u2019d given herself to Dash to do with as he pleased. She hoped with all her heart that it didn\u2019t turn out to be awful. She didn\u2019t want to wimp out and use her safe word the very first time he pushed her boundaries. He\u2019d said she\u2019d never disappoint him, but how could she do anything else if she backed out the minute things got edgy?</p><p>The wait seemed interminable, though she was sure only moments had elapsed since she\u2019d left Dash to wait for him in the bedroom. She forced herself to maintain her position and be patient. She\u2019d do nothing to disappoint him. Not when he\u2019d been so patient and understanding with her.</p><p>He entered a scant second later carrying rope, a flogger and a plug that looked enormous. Her eyes widened as she imagined taking that into her body. It didn\u2019t look possible!</p><p>He smiled at her reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, darling. I\u2019m not going to just shove it in. I\u2019ll work you up and go easy. You\u2019ll take it just fine. And then you\u2019ll take me. All of me.\u201d</p><p>She shivered again, her eyes half-lidded as a drugged sensation overtook her. He had yet to touch her and already she had entered another zone altogether. Euphoria heightened her senses. She was painfully aware of his presence. Anticipated that first command, that first touch. She wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d possibly hold out. She was already so close to the edge and there was so much more to come. He\u2019d very vividly outlined precisely what he planned.</p><p>He dropped the instruments on the edge of the bed and then slowly unzipped his pants, pulling his rigid c**k free of confinement. Then he positioned himself in front of her, his erection straining upward. He grasped the base and lowered the tip to her lips.</p><p>\u201cMaintain your position. Don\u2019t move a muscle. Open your mouth and let me in.\u201d</p><p>Careful to remain perfectly still, she parted her lips as he nudged inward. He didn\u2019t take her roughly. In fact, his thrusts were slow and measured, sliding over her tongue, allowing her to taste and feel the thickness of his cock.</p><p>She savored the wholly male taste of him. Inhaled his scent. His hands slid into her hair, gripping her harder and holding her firmly in place as he f**ked her mouth. A tiny spurt of liquid spilled onto her tongue and she swallowed, sucking greedily for more. He laughed and withdrew, tapping her cheek lightly in reprimand.</p><p>He lowered his hand, motioning for her to take it. Then he lifted her to her feet, holding her when she was unsteady, so on edge. Her knees felt like jelly. Thankfully she didn\u2019t have far to walk. She felt drunk. High on anticipation, eager to experience all that he\u2019d promised her.</p><p>\u201cGet onto the bed. I want you in the middle, on your knees, facing the headboard. I\u2019m going to tie your hands above your head to either post and then I\u2019m going to tie your ankles to the lower bedposts. You\u2019ll be helpless, Joss. Completely and utterly at my mercy. And tonight I plan to have no mercy with you. I\u2019m going to push you to the very edge of your limits. We spoke of those limits and that you wouldn\u2019t know what they were until you got there. Tonight we\u2019ll both find out just what those limits are. Remember your safe word. There is no shame in using it if you\u2019re truly past your limits. But give yourself time. Don\u2019t back out at the first moment of uncertainty. Trust yourself\u2014and me\u2014to get you where you want to go. Just let go, Joss. I\u2019ll be here to catch you. I\u2019ll always catch you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, his words washing over her like the sweetest of balms. He gave her peace. Reassurance. That she could be who she truly wanted to be with him. That he wouldn\u2019t judge her nor would he be disappointed in her if she did back out. His tenderness only made her more determined that she\u2019d take anything he dished out and beg for more.</p><p>She crawled onto the bed, her limbs shaking, her entire body quivering with need. Harsh, edgy craving. She wanted him\u2014what he could give her\u2014more than she\u2019d wanted anything else in her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was the first step in claiming her destiny. Of becoming the woman she\u2019d always wanted to be. Of claiming the man she\u2019d always wanted. Her past melted away. Thoughts of Carson fled. She loved him\u2014would always love him\u2014and this was no betrayal of her marriage.</p><p>Peace enveloped her in its tender embrace. Surrounding her, filling her heart. Much as Dash had in only a few short days. How could she have never known?</p><p>Because she\u2019d never opened her eyes fully. She\u2019d never looked at him, truly looked. And now that she\u2019d finally seen him, she recognized him as the missing piece of her soul.</p><p>\u201cArms up,\u201d Dash ordered.</p><p>She arranged her arms over her head, supporting herself on her forearms but holding her hands up for him to coil the rope around her wrists.</p><p>He wrapped the soft rope around one wrist and then stretched the rope to the post at the corner. Then he took another piece and repeated the process on the other side so both wrists were bound, the rope pulled tight so there was no give.</p><p>When he finished her hands, he went to the bottom of the bed and secured each ankle before stretching the rope to both posts, effectively rendering her motionless. There was no possible way for her to move.</p><p>Her thoughts were muddled, scrambled, and she searched for what he\u2019d said was the next step. Then her breath caught. The plug. He\u2019d said he was going to insert the plug and then flog her.</p><p>Her pulse accelerated the moment his hand slid over her buttocks, petting and caressing until she was twitching with need. Then he pulled away. She tried to look over her shoulder but it put too much strain on her shoulders so she faced ahead, waiting breathlessly for what came next.</p><p>His hand moved back to her behind, parting her cheeks and then she felt the cool shock of lubricant. He traced the seam, pausing at the entrance, smearing the gel over the opening. Then he pushed in with just a fingertip and her breath caught.</p><p>Her body protested the barest of penetrations, squeezing and rejecting his finger. But he persisted, exerting firm pressure until it slid inward to his knuckle. She gasped, jolted by the sudden breach.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed the plump cheek of her behind and then nipped her flesh with his teeth. Using her distraction, he slid in another finger, more lubricant easing its pathway.</p><p>He began to stroke, in and out, lubricating her passageway. After several long moments that drove her insane he withdrew his fingers and then squeezed more of the gel over the seam. Then she felt the blunt head of the plug probing gently at her tight ring. He pushed inward the barest amount before withdrawing it and pushing forward once more.</p><p>He slipped his free hand underneath to her belly and then down, through her folds to her tingling clit. He began stroking her, rubbing in a tight circle as he forced the plug deeper into her body.</p><p>Her pu**y was quivering with need, wet with desire, and she found herself trying to push back against the plug, wanting\u2014needing\u2014more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, darling,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAlmost there. Embrace it. The pain will pass. Reach for it, hold on to it. Allow the pleasure to take over.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slipped lower, rimming her vaginal opening while he pushed the plug even farther. It was now at its widest point, stretching her impossibly. The burn was intense but his fingers were working magic on her cl*tand pussy. She was nearly mindless, restless and edgy, fighting off her impending orgasm because she knew without the intense buildup the plug would only hurt.</p><p>Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t stand another minute, it was as if her body caved in, completely surrendered and allowed the plug access. His fingers left her cl*tand she breathed in deep, steadying breaths, sweat beading her forehead as shallow pants burst from her lips.</p><p>He kissed her bottom again and then pressed another kiss to the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cGive yourself a moment to come down,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI want you so on edge when I finally f**k your ass that you\u2019ll be mindless with pleasure. I\u2019m getting the flogger now. I want you to think about how the kiss of leather will feel on your skin. Don\u2019t shy away from the pain. Embrace it. Because after the pain comes the pleasure. For many women, pain is the gateway to subspace. Once you reach that level, you\u2019ll feel nothing but the sweetest of pleasures. I\u2019ll get you there, Joss. Trust me to get us both there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, incapable of speech. She wanted his mark on her skin. Wanted to feel the fiery sensation of the leather slapping her skin. Everything she\u2019d heard about, read about, fantasized about was about to happen.</p><p>She closed her eyes, listening to the sounds of his movements. And then she heard the sharp smack of leather. Her eyes jerked open. The noise had jarred her from her dreamlike state, but there was no pain. It took her a moment to realize that he hadn\u2019t struck her. Not yet.</p><p>She flinched when he touched the leather flap to her spine near the base of her skull and slowly slid it down her back to her buttocks where the plug split her cheeks. She held her breath, anticipating, waiting. But nothing happened.</p> <p>\u201cBreathe, Joss. Don\u2019t hold it in. I\u2019ll make you wait even longer if you don\u2019t relax.\u201d</p><p>She blew out her breath, sagging as she tried to force herself to comply with his order. And then pain blew over her skin like a blowtorch. She jumped, unable to prevent her reaction to the shock of that first blow. Her eyes widened in surprise. That had hurt!</p><p>It was instinctive to immediately say her safe word, to retreat behind the safety that word gave her. But she bit her lip, determined to stick it out.</p><p>The second blow didn\u2019t take her as unaware as the first. She breathed through the burn until it faded and then, as he\u2019d promised, pleasure replaced the pain, a different kind of burn spreading over her body.</p><p>The third didn\u2019t hurt as much as the first two even though it was, in fact, harder. By now she knew what to expect and didn\u2019t dread them as much as she had the first. Pleasure was faster to replace the discomfort and she reached for it. Embraced it just like he\u2019d told her to.</p><p>He peppered blows over each cheek, never hitting the same place two times in a row. He picked up the speed and they came harder now, one after the other, until the world around her fell away. Everything was hazy, a sense of euphoria seeping through her veins, spreading like wildfire over her body.</p><p>Was this what he referred to as subspace? She\u2019d read about it. Knew it happened for some women when they entered a different plane and felt no pain, only the sweetest of pleasures.</p><p>It was a high she\u2019d never experienced before. She lifted upward, seeking the blows before they fell. She craved them. Wanted more. Harder. Faster.</p><p>It took her a moment to realize that he\u2019d stopped. Her flesh hummed and buzzed with heat. She was supersensitive. She flinched when his hand touched her behind, caressing the welts he\u2019d raised.</p><p>\u201cSo f**king beautiful,\u201d he said, his voice thick with desire. \u201cMy marks on you. Never seen a more beautiful sight. I know I said I was going to f**k your mouth and then your ass, but honey, I\u2019m dying to get inside that ass. I\u2019ll never make it if you wrap those pretty lips around my dick.\u201d</p><p>She moaned softly, closing her eyes as she imagined Dash f**king her from behind. Taking her where no man had ever been before. And her helpless to do anything but take it. Whatever he wanted to do to her, however he wanted to do it.</p><p>He pressed his lips to one cheek and then the other, the reverence in his actions bringing tears to her eyes. She breathed in deep, inhaling the scent of desire in the air. Savoring it, committing to memory this night. All of it. She knew there would be more nights to come, but this was the first. Not the first time they\u2019d made love, but the first time he\u2019d truly demonstrated his dominance\u2014and she, her submission.</p><p>It was a beautiful thing. Never would she have imagined the sheer beauty of such an act. Now she understood better why Dash said it was a gift. One to be cherished. But she wasn\u2019t the only one offering the gift of herself. Dash was gifting her with his dominance. His absolute care of her. His demonstration of power. It could so easily be abused and yet he walked that fine line between not enough and too much.</p><p>He gently began pulling the plug from her behind. Her body clutched at it, not wanting to let it go. He exerted steady pressure and suddenly it was free, her opening caving in after so much pressure. She sagged, feeling deflated once the sense of fullness was gone. She was left achingly empty, bereft of that pleasurable tightness of her stretched around the plug.</p><p>How much better would it feel when he was filling her instead of a rubber object? She craved it with every part of herself. Wanted him deeply within her, possessing her, demonstrating his absolute ownership of her.</p><p>The bed dipped at her knees as he climbed onto the bed and positioned himself between her spread legs. His hands trailed up the backs of her legs, over the sensitive skin behind her knees and then higher to her ass. He cupped and petted the twin globes, running his fingers over the raised welts before finally spreading her, opening her to his pending invasion.</p><p>She immediately tensed, her reaction automatic. He smacked her ass, just enough to jar her, but not enough to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cRelax, honey. It\u2019ll hurt a hell of a lot more if you tense up like that when I\u2019m trying to get inside you. I used plenty of lubricant. You\u2019re ready for me. You can take me. Relax and let me do the work.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to do as he commanded. And he waited, maintaining his position behind her, stroking and caressing her body until finally the tension began leaving her and her muscles became loose and limber once more.</p><p>It was at that moment that he pushed forward, parting her cheeks and thrusting inward. It wasn\u2019t hard or forceful. He only gained about an inch, but she sucked in her breath, her eyes going wide as she felt herself stretch to accommodate him.</p><p>If she\u2019d thought the plug was impossible then he was even more so. How on earth could she possibly hope to take him? What choice did she have? Whether she thought she could or couldn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t giving her an option. He was going to force his way inside her.</p><p>The thought gave her a decadent thrill. A dark and edgy sensation that snaked through her veins, catapulting her right back into the same subspace as before. The whole experience took on a dreamlike quality. She hovered between fantasy and reality as he pushed forward, pressing steadily inward until she stretched even farther to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there, honey,\u201d he soothed, caressing her back with both hands. \u201cJust a bit more and you\u2019ll have taken all of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d she whispered, biting her lip to prevent her from begging for more.</p><p>When he pulled away she whimpered her displeasure, but then he was back. With one powerful thrust he was all the way into her. Her cry shattered the quiet and she instinctively tried to lurch forward, away from his invasion, but her bonds kept her from escaping.</p><p>His hands curled around her hips, his fingers digging into her flesh, marking her the same way the flogger had. He let out a low growl and yanked her back to meet his thrust. He was buried to the balls. She could feel the heavy sac and the crisp hairs surrounding his c**k against her behind.</p><p>She was panting, gasping for breath, dizzy and buzzing from a high like she\u2019d never experienced. Then he reached underneath her, stroking lightly over her clit. She let out another sharp cry, her orgasm nearly rocketing through her. Oh God, not yet. She couldn\u2019t come yet. It would all be over and that wasn\u2019t what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cHow close are you, honey?\u201d Dash ground out.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d she said in a desperate voice. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Not yet. Not until you\u2019re ready to come. I\u2019m so close, Dash. Too close.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed between her shoulder blades, but his fingers stilled at her clit. He twitched and pulsed inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close too,\u201d he said in a guttural tone. \u201cI want it to last. You\u2019re so sweet, Joss. So damn sweet. Your ass is as perfect as the rest of you. So tight and hot, sucking me in like a greedy fist.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, breathing deeply through her nose. He wasn\u2019t touching her and yet she still hovered precariously on edge. It wouldn\u2019t take much at all for her to go off like a bomb.</p><p>He slid both hands up her body underneath to cup her breasts. He toyed with her ni**les as he lay over her, perfectly still inside her. He cupped and toyed with her breasts, caressing and rolling the ni**les between his fingertips.</p><p>Finally he lifted himself upward again and his hands fell away from her breasts. He grasped her waist and withdrew, hammering forward again, driving deep and hard. For several moments he repeated those motions. Withdrawing until only the tip remained inside her opening and then thrusting savagely.</p><p>He\u2019d told her he\u2019d show her no mercy. That he\u2019d f**k her rough and hard. That he\u2019d push her boundaries. But not since that very first blow that had shocked her with the pain and intensity had she even considered calling a halt to it all. She wanted it too much. Craved it with her entire being.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d had a taste of his dominance, she was already addicted. Like a druggie desperate for her next fix. She\u2019d never get enough of him. His power. His control. It called to the deepest, darkest parts of her soul. She came alive under his ownership. Like a flower in spring after lying dormant for the winter.</p><p>\u201cGoing to go hard at you, Joss,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll be rough and I won\u2019t stop unless you use your safe word.\u201d</p><p>She shook uncontrollably. She\u2019d thought he\u2019d been rough and hard already. There was more? Had he been holding back until now?</p><p>She soon had her answer when he levered himself higher over her, in a position of greater dominance. He spread her cheeks wide with both hands, holding her open to his invasion. And then he took her with savagery that took her breath away.</p><p>Hard. Fast. Deep.</p><p>Over and over he rammed into her, overwhelming her with the power of his possession. The room blurred around her. She wasn\u2019t cognizant of anything but the power he demonstrated. It hurt. It burned. It was the most intense pleasure she\u2019d ever experienced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then he ripped himself from her body and hot jets of s**en splattered onto her behind. Some of it slid inside her still- open entrance, distended from his fierce penetration. The rest spilled onto her back and her ass. Then, as he\u2019d promised, he thrust inside her again, still coming, still pumping his release deep into her body.</p><p>She felt the hot liquid seep from her opening with every thrust. It ran down the insides of her legs in a hot rush. Then he plunged forward to the hilt, pressing hard against her ass as his body quivered over hers.</p><p>He reached around, sliding his fingers over her cl*tonce more. She jerked in response. She was so worked up, so incredibly aroused, that his touch was nearly painful and yet she craved more. Needed more. She needed to come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay inside you until you come,\u201d he said in a strained voice. \u201cI want to feel you fall apart with me deep in your ass.\u201d</p><p>His fingers exerted more pressure, rolling her cl*tin a tight circle. The dual sensation, his c**k in her ass, his fingers caressing her clitoris, it was all too much.</p><p>Her orgasm crashed over her like a giant wave. She lost all awareness. She was lost in the throes of her release. She was covered in his cum, his c**k still deeply embedded in her as she convulsed and squeezed him even tighter.</p><p>He groaned. She cried out. And then both fell forward as much as the ropes restraining her would allow.</p><p>His chest rose and fell sharply, a match to her own as she struggled to gain her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked tenderly as he brushed the hair from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d she hummed.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute to get you untied and cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going anywhere,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He chuckled at that. \u201cI suppose not since I have you tied securely to my bed. I like it. I like it a hell of a lot. I could get used to having you at my beck and call at all times.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even muster a protest to his joking. She was too undone. Tired. Exhausted. But more sated and content than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>Moments later he gently untied her, after cleaning the s**en from her skin with a damp cloth. When she was free, he sat her on the edge of the bed and inspected her ankles and wrists for any abrasions. Then he kissed each slightly red spot where the ropes had pressed into her skin and rubbed the feeling back into her feet when she muttered that she couldn\u2019t feel them.</p><p>For that matter she couldn\u2019t feel much of anything. She was too shattered by her experience. She felt numb and out of it, like she\u2019d just come out of a stupor. Perhaps she was still in it.</p><p>When he was finished, he pushed up to his knees and pulled her into his arms so her head was pillowed on his shoulder. He stroked his hand up and down her back as he kissed her hair.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, Joss,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She attempted a smile as she pulled away, but she was too bone weary to pull it off. Instead she reached out to his face, cupping both her hands over his jaw. She caressed his face, letting her fingers wander over his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cI think that was the most incredible sexual experience of my life. That\u2019s what I think,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>He smiled, relief evident in his eyes. He leaned forward, resting his forehead against hers. It was an action he often performed. She liked the intimacy of the gesture. Loved that he was openly affectionate. She found it endearing that he liked touching her so often.</p><p>\u201cI meant to make it last much longer,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m not normally so quick on the draw. But you make me that way, Joss. You make me crazy. I touch you, kiss you, feel you and I have to have you until I\u2019m nearly blind with lust.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him and leaned that inch between their mouths to kiss him. \u201cWe have plenty of time to draw it out longer and make it last. We\u2019re still learning one another. This is all still new.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBet your sweet, sore ass we do,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cHeads-up, because I will put you through the paces and make you last a lot longer than we did tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ass is sore,\u201d she said, wincing as she shifted her weight.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to kiss it and make it all better,\u201d he said in a silky voice.</p><p>He reached forward, scooping her effortlessly into his arms, and then settled her onto the bed, pulling back the covers and then arranging them over her. He kissed her again and then walked around to crawl into bed on his side.</p><p>She went readily into his arms, enjoying the solid warmth of his body. He didn\u2019t tie her tonight. Maybe he\u2019d forgotten or perhaps he was afraid that the rope he\u2019d used earlier had abraded her skin and he was giving her a rest. It didn\u2019t matter. She was as close as she could get to him and he was wrapped around her. It was enough.</p><p>In the middle of the night, Dash was awakened by Joss stirring restlessly. He started to wake her, thinking she was having a bad dream, but before he could, she murmured, \u201cCarson.\u201d</p><p>He went still, the single word freezing his heart. She sounded . . . sad. Like she was missing him. Not what he wanted to hear when he\u2019d just made love to her. When she wore the marks of his dominance and possession.</p><p>She turned away from him, curling into a ball, never waking. Dash lay there, only inches away but seemingly a world apart.</p><p>And while she slept, quiet and peaceful now, Dash lay awake, in brooding silence.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>DASH was quiet and almost brooding the next morning. His mood had been off ever since they\u2019d gotten out of bed. She\u2019d hesitantly offered to cook him breakfast, but he\u2019d shrugged off her offer and prepared the meal for them both. But he hadn\u2019t fed her as he\u2019d done the last several meals. In fact, they sat across from one another at the small breakfast table situated in the nook off the kitchen.</p><p>She tried to initiate conversation several times, but his answers were short and distant, as though he had something on his mind. She replayed the night before over and over in her head, wondering if she\u2019d done something to displease him. But he\u2019d seemed perfectly content with the way things had played out. She hadn\u2019t backed down from his challenge. She hadn\u2019t used her safe word. She\u2019d seen it out to the very end, regretful when it was over.</p><p>But why was he so distant?</p><p>She puzzled over it all through breakfast and when they were done eating, she took over, taking their plates into the kitchen without asking him. The truth was she wanted to get away for a few moments to ponder the change in his mood.</p><p>She stiffened when he walked into the kitchen behind her, and she turned from the sink where she\u2019d stacked the plates to face him.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>She hated guessing games. She wasn\u2019t someone who could hide her feelings well at all. And Dash would know that something was bothering her, even if it was him that was the problem.</p><p>He blinked in surprise and then his features eased and softened, the strain and tension gathered on his forehead relaxed.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey, why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t said two words to me all morning,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to sound nagging or to intrude if it\u2019s none of my business, but it\u2019s driving me crazy and I can\u2019t think of what I could have done to displease you.\u201d</p><p>His face softened even further and he closed the distance between them, gathering her in his arms and leaning her back against the sink.</p><p>\u201cYou did nothing to displease me. I was just pensive this morning. Nothing to do with you. Last night was wonderful, as were you, Joss. I\u2019m sorry if I made you feel that you\u2019d done something wrong. You were and are perfect.\u201d</p><p>For the oddest reason, she felt like he wasn\u2019t telling the truth, or at least the whole truth. She\u2019d caught him watching her periodically through the morning as if he was trying to discern her thoughts. He should know by now she was an open book. There was no hiding it when she had something on her mind. It was either there to read in her eyes or she simply came out and addressed it.</p><p>It was one of the things Carson had loved most about her. No coy, passive-aggressive games. No pouting endlessly over some imagined slight. If something upset her, he knew about it. He never had to ask because she was too honest and up front, especially with people she cared about.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cI\u2019m still learning all of this and I don\u2019t want to mess up, so if I do, you have to tell me, otherwise I\u2019ll never know how to correct the mistake.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, hugging her tightly against him. \u201cYou did nothing wrong, Joss. And if you had, I have every confidence that it would have been done innocently. You\u2019re too honest and straightforward about things. It\u2019s one of the things I most admire about you. There\u2019s no guessing with you because you tend to take the bull by the horns.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed, some of her worry dissipating. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I sound defensive, but this is very important to me. I need you to understand that. This isn\u2019t a game to me. It isn\u2019t me seeking out a relationship with just anyone. I chose you. Surely that has to mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means everything,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMore than you can possibly know. What you don\u2019t understand is that there are any number of men more than willing to give you the things you want. They\u2019d spoil and pamper you endlessly. They\u2019d lay the world at your feet. But I\u2019m damn glad you chose me to be that man, even if I leaned on you pretty heavily.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo matter how hard you leaned on me, if I didn\u2019t want to do this with you, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed. Carson taught me a lot about independence and standing on my own two feet. I\u2019ll always be grateful to him for that. He taught me that I could be the person I am and I should never be willing to change who I am to please someone else. He was right. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve tried to do and be in my everyday life.\u201d</p><p>His features tightened again, his eyes going blank. Did he resent her talking about Carson? Was he defensive about the fact she\u2019d been happily married to another man?</p><p>She understood, she supposed. It couldn\u2019t be all that wonderful to have her previous lovers, never mind there had been only one, thrown in his face at every turn.</p><p>From now on she was going to be more careful about discussing Carson with him. But it was only natural and it would take her time to adjust to the sudden change in their relationship. He\u2019d gone from friend and confidant to her lover in a matter of days. Before, she had no compunction about discussing her relationship with Carson, or even just Carson himself, with a man he\u2019d called best friend. It was nice to be able to talk about Carson with someone who knew him almost as well she knew him. It enabled her to keep his memory alive and talk about the good times they\u2019d always shared together.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do today?\u201d she asked impulsively. \u201cHave you called Tate, Chessy and Kylie to see if they can make dinner tonight? If so I\u2019ll need to run into the store and pick up things for the meal I\u2019m planning. City Market has steaks that are simply divine. I thought we could grill steaks and I\u2019ll make all the fixings. Baked potatoes, salads, homemade rolls and a really yummy dessert.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his mouth to her, kissing her with tenderness and care that he hadn\u2019t demonstrated this morning until now.</p><p>\u201cI think that sounds wonderful. Let me go make the phone call to Tate. Do you want to call Kylie or would you prefer me to call her and issue the invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her,\u201d Joss said quietly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll wait and let you explain when she arrives. I planned to tell her to get here at least thirty minutes from the others so you\u2019d have time to discuss Jensen with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. You make your calls. I\u2019ll make mine. Then I\u2019ll run you to the grocery store to get everything we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need you to take care of the wine,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cCarson despaired of me ever getting it right.\u201d</p><p>She nearly bit her tongue in frustration. Just moments before she\u2019d sworn that she\u2019d stop bringing up Carson and inserting a wedge between her and Dash. No man would want to be constantly competing with another man, especially a dead man.</p><p>Joss waited for the expected surge of pain that always accompanied her speaking of Carson. But it wasn\u2019t there this time. There was lingering sadness that she dealt with from time to time but mostly it had subsided. For the first time, she could see the grass on the other side of the fence, and it looked appealing from where she stood.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>THOUGH hosting a dinner party was nothing new for Joss, she had a raging case of nerves because this was her first dinner acting as Dash\u2019s host. And the attendees were all friends. There was no reason for her to be nervous, but she was. Because though her friends knew of her relationship with Dash, she hadn\u2019t openly flaunted it in front of them.</p><p>She put the finishing touches on the salad and stuck the bowl in the fridge before popping the potatoes in the oven. The steaks were marinating, and Dash would throw them on the grill closer to the time to eat.</p><p>First, they would talk to Kylie, and Dash would tell her that Jensen was partnering with Dash. Joss dreaded the confrontation but knew it was better had here in private, in a place Kylie felt comfortable in, rather than Dash telling her in the office and springing it on her in a place where she couldn\u2019t react honestly.</p><p>The doorbell rang and she hurried out of the kitchen, calling to Dash that she\u2019d get it. She wanted to be the first to greet Kylie.</p><p>When she opened the door, Kylie smiled at her and Joss pulled her into a hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask how you\u2019re doing but your look says it all,\u201d Kylie said wryly. \u201cYou look . . . happy, Joss. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>Joss impulsively squeezed her again. \u201cThanks. How are you doing? I know it\u2019s only been a couple of days, but I feel like I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to you in forever!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you wimped out on me and Chessy and e-mailed us,\u201d Kylie said in a dry tone.</p><p>Joss laughed. \u201cYes, I did. I figured it would be easier to just e-mail you both and get it out. It would certainly take less time than a phone call because you both would grill me mercilessly.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged at the corners of Kylie\u2019s mouth as they entered Dash\u2019s living room. Kylie glanced around and when she saw no one she turned to Joss, lowering her voice.</p><p>\u201cIs he good to you, Joss? You look happy but are you really?\u201d</p> <p>Joss smiled, letting her happiness show on her face as she looked at her friend. \u201cHe\u2019s very good to me, Kylie. Things are better than I imagined they could be. I really am happy.\u201d</p><p>Kylie reached out and squeezed her hand. \u201cThen I\u2019m happy for you. I know I didn\u2019t seem that way in the beginning, and I\u2019m sorry for that. I was just worried about you. I do want you to be happy, Joss. I hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I love you. Don\u2019t ever forget that.\u201d</p><p>Dash entered the living room and walked over to kiss Kylie\u2019s cheek. \u201cGlad you could make it, Kylie. Would you care for a drink? I have something I need to discuss with you before the others arrive.\u201d</p><p>Kylie sent him an inquisitive look. \u201cWine will be fine. You choose. I\u2019ll like whatever you offer.\u201d</p> <p>Dash poured glasses for both women and returned, holding them out to the two women.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d Kylie asked curiously.</p><p>Dash sighed and briefly looked discomfited. But Joss knew he wasn\u2019t the type to dance around an issue. He\u2019d come out and say it and then deal with the blowback, whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cA new partner is joining our business,\u201d Dash said as bluntly as Joss knew he would be.</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes widened and her lips parted but she didn\u2019t respond. She simply stared at Dash, seemingly frozen by his statement.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Jensen Tucker,\u201d Dash continued. \u201cCarson and I had considered taking him on a few years ago. When Carson died, I put those plans on hold and focused on keeping the business afloat. But it\u2019s time. He\u2019s a solid addition and he\u2019ll be an asset to the company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just replacing him?\u201d Kylie said hoarsely. \u201cWhy? You\u2019re doing a fine job, Dash. Why do you need this guy? What could he possibly have to offer?\u201d</p><p>Her voice rose, her tone growing more emotional at the end.</p><p>Joss went to Dash and laced her fingers through his, squeezing to signal her support. He squeezed back, shooting her a grateful look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with this?\u201d Kylie asked Joss accusingly.</p><p>Joss\u2019s face flushed and for a moment she was at a loss for words. No, she hadn\u2019t expected Kylie to take it well at first, but she hadn\u2019t expected the outright accusation in her tone. That she would direct her anger at Joss. This wasn\u2019t her company or her choice. Yes, she owned a part of the business, but she had no power and no say in the decision making. That was all Dash\u2019s and now Jensen\u2019s. She and Kylie both benefited from the profits. Carson had made certain of that. But neither woman had a say in the running of the business. Carson had trusted that to Dash, and Joss agreed with that choice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would support his decision in this,\u201d Kylie said in a hoarse voice. \u201cHave you forgotten Carson already? Are you so wrapped up in a new relationship that you\u2019d turn your back on what your husband built?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Dash bit out, his jaw tight with anger. \u201cYou will not direct your ire at Joss. If you have something to say then you damn well say it to me. You will not make her feel badly over this. It wasn\u2019t her decision, but yes, she supports it and me. Deal with it. You can make this as easy or as difficult as you want, Kylie. That\u2019s your choice. Jensen is coming over tonight and you\u2019ll meet him then. I expect you to be professional and cordial.\u201d</p><p>Warmth spread through Joss\u2019s chest at Dash\u2019s instant defense of her. He was angry and it took a lot to make him so. But he was positively seething over Kylie\u2019s outburst and he\u2019d wrapped his arm protectively around Joss, silently and not so silently giving her his absolute support. Just as she\u2019d done for him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m not?\u201d Kylie challenged. \u201cAre you going to fire me if I don\u2019t like this person you\u2019ve brought in to replace Carson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it comes to that, yes,\u201d Dash said in a low voice. \u201cI hope it wouldn\u2019t come to that, Kylie. You are very good at what you do. This company needs you. I need you. I would hate to ever have to replace you, but if you make trouble for Jensen, you can and will be replaced.\u201d</p><p>Kylie paled, her eyes going stark with pain. Her gaze flitted over Joss with the same accusation she\u2019d voiced just moments before. Joss flinched at the look, knowing Kylie saw this as the ultimate betrayal. Not just by Dash but by Joss herself. She\u2019d expected Joss to side with her. To protest Carson\u2019s replacement.</p><p>It was evident in her every expression, her body language, that she was furious, not only with Dash but with Joss, and perhaps more so with Joss.</p><p>\u201cYou invite me over, dump this on me like this and then expect me to play nice with a man who is replacing my brother,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cHow did you expect me to react?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe invited you over because I would rather tell you in private and give you time to collect yourself before he arrives. The alternative was telling you in the office on Monday, and I thought we meant more to one another than for me to tell you in a business setting. Perhaps I was wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s voice was cold, anger radiating from him in waves. Kylie had pushed him too far and her attack on Joss had infuriated him all the more. Joss squeezed his hand again, a silent signal that it was all right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dash,\u201d Joss said softly, voicing her thoughts so he would know without question. \u201cI understand why she\u2019s upset. She doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d Dash bit out. \u201cShe has no right to treat you this way and I won\u2019t allow it in our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur home?\u201d Kylie asked incredulously. \u201cHave things progressed so far then, Joss? Have you already moved on and forgotten the man you were married to for three years? What exactly is going on here? Are we all supposed to just forget that Carson existed? Maybe you can, but I can\u2019t. He was my only family and he\u2019s not so easily replaced. Not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t apologize to Joss right this minute, I\u2019ll ask you to leave, and furthermore, you will come into the office on Monday only to clear out your desk and tender your resignation,\u201d Dash said in a frigid tone. \u201cWhat is between me and Joss is none of your business. She doesn\u2019t require your approval or blessing, though she\u2019d like to have both. She loves you and she\u2019d cut off her arm before ever purposely hurting you. But you\u2019re hurting her and that\u2019s bullshit. I won\u2019t have it and I damn sure won\u2019t allow you to come into our home. Yes, our home, Kylie. Joss is with me, and you have two choices. Accept it and be happy for her or get out. Which is it going to be?\u201d</p><p>Joss felt the color bleed from her own face, a match to Kylie\u2019s. She shook uncontrollably and it seemed to anger Dash all the more. His hold tightened around her to the point that she could barely breathe. No, she hadn\u2019t expected Kylie to take it well, but neither had she expected Kylie to lash out at her like this.</p><p>Was it what Chessy thought too? That she had so easily forgotten Carson and moved on at the first opportunity? Were neither of her friends truly happy for her? Would she lose their friendship because she wanted to be happy again? Why was being happy asking too much? Why couldn\u2019t Kylie accept that all Joss wanted was to not be so lonely any longer?</p><p>Tears burned her eyelids and Dash saw. His entire body tensed and fury fired through his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve upset Joss and that I won\u2019t accept,\u201d Dash said tightly. \u201cApologize or leave, and make it quick. I will not stand by and allow her to be abused in her own home.\u201d</p><p>Kylie looked shocked and pained at Dash\u2019s words. The word abuse struck a chord in Kylie and it obviously horrified her that she would be accused of abusing another person.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joss,\u201d Kylie said in a near sob. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt or upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done both,\u201d Dash said in a curt voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Joss said quietly. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it, Kylie. Give Jensen a chance. I\u2019ve met him and he seems like a good man. Carson liked and respected him. That should be enough for you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie briefly closed her eyes and then she hurried over, throwing her arms around Joss, knocking Dash away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I do. I\u2019m so sorry, Joss. What I said was awful. There\u2019s no excuse. I was just caught off guard. I wasn\u2019t expecting it. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Joss hugged her back, her heart still constricted at the things Kylie had said. She believed Kylie was genuinely sorry but her words still hurt. Like tiny darts finding their target. Was it what everyone would think? That she\u2019d so easily gotten over Carson and could so easily replace him? It had been three years! It wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d hopped into the sack with Dash a week, a month or even a year after Carson died.</p><p>Dash looked at Joss over Kylie\u2019s shoulder, his expression murderous. He knew Joss was hurt\u2014was still hurting\u2014over Kylie\u2019s outburst, and it was obvious he\u2019d do anything to spare her pain.</p><p>Joss shook her head at Dash, a signal to drop it. Kylie was emotional. She\u2019d always been so. And she often spoke without thinking. Joss knew Kylie loved her just as she also recognized Kylie\u2019s faults. And when you loved someone, you accepted every part of them. Even the not so perfect things.</p><p>Dash nodded grimly, accepting Joss\u2019s silent plea to let it go. When Kylie pulled away from Joss, she turned her troubled gaze to Dash.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dash. Please forgive me. I\u2019ll try to accept him. I won\u2019t do anything to embarrass you. And if I still have a position with you, I\u2019ll do my best. I\u2019ll do the job you\u2019ve come to expect from me.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s expression softened just a bit and he pulled Kylie into a firm hug.</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate that, Kylie. You\u2019re damn good at running my\u2014our\u2014office, and I fully expect you\u2019ll do the job going forward. But if I hear of you speaking to Joss the way you just spoke to her ever again, I won\u2019t be as understanding the next time.\u201d</p><p>The warning fell over the room. Kylie nodded her acceptance and glanced back at Joss, sorrow and regret brimming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you, Kylie,\u201d Joss said quietly and sincerely. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s just forget about it and enjoy the evening. Chessy and Tate will be here soon, as will Jensen. Please give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was pleading but she had always been the peacemaker. She hated dissension or strife of any kind. It was just her nature and Dash was well acquainted with that aspect of her personality. It was why he\u2019d shut Kylie down so quickly and fiercely. She loved that he was so protective of her. She felt safe with him. Not just physically but emotionally, and perhaps emotionally was the most important because she\u2019d already suffered so much in that area. She needed and wanted her feelings protected and cherished. If that made her weak, oh well. It was what she wanted\u2014needed\u2014and Dash seemed determined to provide it for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give him a chance. For you, Joss,\u201d Kylie said, making the distinction that she would do so for Joss and not necessarily Dash. Which was odd considering Dash was her boss and it was him she needed to be concerned with pissing off.</p><p>But Joss was her friend\u2014her sister\u2014and that bond was solid and unbreakable, or at least Joss hoped it was. She prayed this wouldn\u2019t be a strain they wouldn\u2019t recover from.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate your support,\u201d Dash said quietly. \u201cIt means a lot that you\u2019ll stand behind us, Kylie. You aren\u2019t just an employee. You\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s eyes watered and she quickly wiped the betraying moisture away. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting good wine,\u201d she said shakily, a tremulous smile on her lips. She was trying, making the effort, and Joss loved her for that.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come into the kitchen with me while I prepare the hors d\u2019oeuvres,\u201d Joss said, extending her hand to her sister-in-law. \u201cWe can wait for Chessy to get here and we\u2019ll drain a bottle of wine while the guys do their thing over the grill.\u201d</p><p>Kylie smiled genuinely this time and took Joss\u2019s hand, squeezing it in silent apology.</p><p>The two women entered the kitchen, awkward silence between them. Joss busied herself preparing the tray of appetizers and she turned the steaks in the marinade. She checked her watch, knowing the others would be arriving shortly. She was impatient for Chessy to get there so she could alleviate the tension between Joss and Kylie.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief when, a few moments later, Chessy sailed into the kitchen, a cheerful smile on her pretty face.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d she sang out.</p><p>She hugged Kylie and then went over to offer Joss a hug.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Kylie?\u201d Chessy whispered against Joss\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cTell you later,\u201d Joss murmured back.</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes narrowed as she pulled away but she quickly pasted her smile back on and went to plop onto the barstool next to Kylie.</p><p>Kylie was noticeably subdued even though Chessy chattered on, filling the awkward lapse between Joss and Kylie. But Chessy\u2019s sharp gaze didn\u2019t miss the discomfort that lay like a blanket over the other two women.</p><p>When the doorbell rang, Kylie paled and then immediately excused herself to go to the bathroom. The moment Kylie left, Chessy pounced on Joss, walking around the counter to stand beside Joss while Joss pulled the steaks from the marinade and patted them dry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Chessy demanded. \u201cKylie bolted like a bat out of hell the minute the doorbell rang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d Joss muttered. \u201cDash is bringing in Jensen Tucker as a partner, and Kylie didn\u2019t take the news well at all. That\u2019s him at the door. He\u2019s coming over to meet everyone. We invited Kylie earlier so Dash could tell her in private, and she freaked. Like really freaked. She said some pretty harsh things. To me.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Joss nodded. \u201cDash was pissed. Extremely pissed. He basically threatened to fire her if she didn\u2019t apologize and he told her if she ever came at me like that again he\u2019d fire her on the spot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Chessy breathed. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t agree with him protecting you, but wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My thoughts exactly.\u201d</p><p>Chessy grabbed the tray as Kylie reentered the kitchen, as though she\u2019d come over to help.</p><p>\u201cGrab the wine, Kylie,\u201d Chessy said cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll go serve up Joss\u2019s yum-yums to the menfolk.\u201d</p><p>Her pretend obliviousness to the entire situation almost fooled even Joss. Kylie looked like a deer in the headlights, but there was no way for her to object without making a scene. She sighed but took the wine bottle from the table and followed Chessy into the living room.</p> <p>Joss was only a few feet behind and she immediately went to greet Jensen, wanting to make him as comfortable as possible since it was obvious Kylie wasn\u2019t going to be as welcoming.</p><p>Jensen kissed her on both cheeks and smiled warmly at her.</p><p>\u201cHas Dash introduced you to everyone?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone but Kylie and Chessy.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, pulling him toward where the other two women stood. Jensen looked befuddled while Dash smiled at Joss taking charge.</p><p>\u201cLadies, I want you to meet Jensen Tucker, Dash\u2019s new partner. Jensen, these are my two best friends, Chessy and Kylie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m her sister-in-law,\u201d Kylie said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you both, but especially you, Kylie. I\u2019ve heard much about you. Dash says you\u2019re indispensable at the office. I\u2019m looking forward to working with you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie flushed at the praise and ducked her head, not meeting Jensen\u2019s gaze directly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>Chessy extended her hand to shake Jensen\u2019s and he pulled it up as he\u2019d done with Joss the night before and brushed a kiss over the back. Then he pointedly extended his hand to Kylie and when she reluctantly took it, he pulled hers up as well, but he was much slower to lower it once he\u2019d kissed hers.</p><p>Kylie snatched her hand away as though she\u2019d been burned and tucked it protectively behind her back. If Jensen noticed her reaction he didn\u2019t show it. His smile was bland and he didn\u2019t so much as blink.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known Dash?\u201d Chessy asked curiously.</p><p>Trust Chessy never to miss a beat. She was an absolute charmer, and it looked as though Jensen was enchanted with her. Who wouldn\u2019t be? Was it any wonder Tate was so forbiddingly possessive of her? But Dash had said he shared Chessy with other men. Joss still couldn\u2019t wrap her brain around it. Even now Tate was watching intently, taking in Jensen\u2019s reaction to his wife. Though he was across the room, his gaze never left Chessy, and he\u2019d frowned when Jensen had kissed her hand. He was broodingly watching the interaction between Jensen and all the women. Though Dash was conversing with Tate, Tate\u2019s focus wasn\u2019t on Dash. It was squarely on Chessy.</p> <p>Chessy was a born flirt. Vivacious. Beautiful. She never met a stranger, and her laughter was infectious. Joss had always been envious of Chessy\u2019s confidence and her outgoing personality. Joss was quieter and more reserved than Chessy. But Carson had never minded. He\u2019d adored Joss\u2019s shyness. Had been delighted that he was her first lover. He\u2019d told her how much it meant to him that she\u2019d waited. For him.</p><p>Joss shook her thoughts from Carson. She hadn\u2019t thought of him all day. Not until Kylie had thrown her dead husband in her face. And now he dominated her thoughts and it was the last thing she wanted. Not when she was in Dash\u2019s home acting as his hostess. Something she\u2019d done for Carson any number of times.</p><p>But these people were her friends. Yes, she\u2019d only just met Jensen, but she\u2019d warmed instantly to him. He was quiet and brooding. He\u2019d intimidated her at first glance, but he\u2019d quickly made her feel at ease, and he\u2019d been understanding of Kylie\u2019s feelings. Even now he didn\u2019t seem to take her reaction to him personally. He stood there conversing politely, seemingly oblivious to Kylie\u2019s obvious discomfort.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Joss said.</p><p>She walked over to where Dash stood with Tate, and Tate smiled warmly at her, pulling her into a quick hug and pressing an affectionate kiss to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, darlin\u2019. Long time no see.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him. \u201cYou need to stop being such a stranger, Tate. Work keeping you busy these days? I swear it\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve seen you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes twinkled. \u201cI\u2019d hardly think you\u2019d notice my absence. It appears Dash has been keeping you pretty occupied lately.\u201d</p><p>She blushed to the roots of her hair as both men laughed. Tate reached for her hand and squeezed it warmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, sweetheart. You deserve happiness, and Dash is just the man to make it happen for you. I wish you both the best.\u201d</p><p>Her face still flaming, she glanced shyly at Dash before returning her attention to Tate. What had Dash told Tate about her? Or maybe Chessy had been the one to share the details of her relationship with Dash.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cDash makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s face softened at her words and Tate smiled gently.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be happy, darlin\u2019. And you won\u2019t find a better man than Dash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Then remembering why she\u2019d come over, she glanced back up at Dash. \u201cThe steaks are ready to go on the grill. Everything else is ready. Potatoes are in the oven, and they\u2019ll be ready by the time you take the steaks up. You guys can head back to the grill. I\u2019ll make drinks or there\u2019s beer and wine. Whatever y\u2019all want.\u201d</p><p>Dash leaned down to kiss her forehead and then cupped her face in a gentle caress. \u201cThanks, honey. I\u2019ll round up Tate and Jensen, and we\u2019ll go do our manly duty. Everything going okay with Kylie?\u201d</p><p>His gaze searched hers intently, looking for any signs of upset.</p><p>Joss nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s not very comfortable around Jensen, but we expected that. He can be very . . . intimidating. Just the type of man who\u2019d put Kylie on edge.\u201d</p><p>Tate grimaced. \u201cThis is going to be hard for her. I hate it but she has to put her past behind her at some point. She can\u2019t continue to let it rule her present and future. I\u2019m glad you stuck to your guns, Dash. She needs that.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded his agreement as his expression darkened. He glanced in Kylie\u2019s direction, his frown deepening. \u201cShe was out of line for lashing out at Joss the way she did. That I won\u2019t allow. She can say whatever she wants to me, but I\u2019ll be damned if she pulls that shit with Joss.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s heart warmed all over again. She pressed into Dash\u2019s side and tipped her head up to kiss him on the mouth. He seemed surprised and then delighted at her spontaneous show of affection.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt means a lot that you\u2019d stick up for me the way you did.\u201d</p><p>He put a finger underneath her chin, tipping it upward to meet his steady gaze. \u201cAlways, honey. I\u2019ll never allow anyone to hurt you. Count on that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then shooed him toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIf y\u2019all don\u2019t get the meat on, we\u2019ll never eat. We\u2019re hungry!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Dash headed in Jensen\u2019s direction, Tate following behind. After a moment the three men disappeared into the kitchen, and Joss heard the door to the patio open and then shut as they went out to tend the grill.</p><p>Noticing Kylie\u2019s and Chessy\u2019s wineglasses were nearly empty, she went to fetch a bottle and refilled theirs as well as hers.</p><p>She motioned for them to sit and get comfortable, knowing they had half an hour before the steaks were ready.</p><p>It was just like old times, only Carson wasn\u2019t there. He was the only missing component, and now there was Jensen, filling that void. It would never be the same, and for the first time Joss felt optimistic about that fact. No, nothing would ever be the same, but it was certainly possible that it would be better.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>AS if knowing how trying the evening had been for Joss and how emotionally fragile she was, Dash made love to her so tenderly that she was overcome. Afterward, he pulled her to him, binding their wrists as he\u2019d done previously and then cradled her in his arms, her head pillowed on his shoulder.</p><p>She loved the intimacy of the act. Of being bound to him. It was more than just a physical binding. She felt connected to him on a much deeper level. One she welcomed and savored with her entire heart.</p><p>She fell into a deep sleep, contented and sated, and yet when her dreams came, they were disturbing. Carson was there, smiling at her, holding out his hand. Dash was on the other side, standing with his heart in his eyes. The voice inside her head told her to choose. That if she had the choice of having Carson back or remaining with Dash, which would she pick?</p><p>She frowned even in sleep, her forehead creasing in pain. How could she make such a choice? She\u2019d always said she\u2019d do anything to have Carson back. Anything at all. But now it wasn\u2019t so simple. Now she had Dash.</p><p>She was caught in the middle of two men she cared about, each pulling her in a different direction. The dream didn\u2019t make sense. She couldn\u2019t have Carson back, so why was she being tormented with the choice?</p><p>And yet each man was demanding she decide. Carson\u2019s smile faltered and sadness entered his eyes. His hand dropped, his shoulders sagging in defeat. But Dash didn\u2019t look triumphant. He looked tortured, as though he\u2019d do anything in the world to spare Joss the pain she faced.</p><p>Dash turned away from her, making her decision for her, but that wasn\u2019t what she wanted. Still, she didn\u2019t reach for Carson. She remained standing, frozen with the impossibility of the task before her.</p><p>How could she choose? Her past or her present? Her future? Carson was dead. She couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014betray Dash\u2019s faith in her. Even in her dreams, she wouldn\u2019t allow such a thing to happen.</p><p>Her heart in pieces, she watched helplessly as Carson turned, slowly fading away, becoming transparent, the look on his face slashing her open, leaving her bleeding on the inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carson. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Tears slipped down her cheeks, warm against the coolness of her skin.</p><p>Dash watched her in the darkness, helplessness gripping him. She was fighting her demons even in sleep and he was powerless to do anything about it. Worse, she was crying for her dead husband, apologizing to him. For what? For cheating on him? For betraying his memory as Kylie had accused her of? Did Dash ever have a hope of winning her heart or would a dead man forever own it?</p><p>He silently untied the sash binding their wrists together and this time it was he who turned away, putting his back to Joss. And again, sleep eluded him. He lay there, fighting his own demons while Joss battled hers, just inches away and a world apart all at the same time.</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>JOSS awakened the next morning feeling emotionally wrung out from her troubled, upsetting dreams. She automatically reached for Dash, needing the comfort he offered, a shelter from the emotional turmoil of her dreams.</p><p>To her surprise not only was her wrist no longer bound to his, but he wasn\u2019t in bed. She struggled to sit up, brushing back her hair so she could see. Across the room Dash stood in front of the dresser buttoning the sleeves to his dress shirt. His expression was solemn, as if he were deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cDash?\u201d</p><p>His name came out shaky and soft, but he heard her and turned immediately, his expression indecipherable.</p><p>\u201cI have to be in early this morning,\u201d he said in a neutral tone. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do before Jensen\u2019s partnership is announced. I\u2019m not sure how late I\u2019ll be but I\u2019ll call to let you know when I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. His mood was the same as it had been the previous morning when she hadn\u2019t been able to discern what was bothering him. And it was evident that something was. She may be an open book when it came to her emotions, but Dash was similar in that she only had to look into his eyes to know if something was off. And for the second morning, he wasn\u2019t his usual, loving self.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even come to the bed to kiss her, and she felt too self-conscious to get out of bed to go to him. She was too afraid he\u2019d reject her and so she remained where she was, studying him from underneath her lashes.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to you coming home. Shall I cook dinner for us tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you like,\u201d he said indifferently. \u201cWe can eat out if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cook,\u201d she said firmly, wanting to do something to please him.</p><p>He nodded and then turned back, collecting his watch and wallet and car keys.</p><p>She waited for him to kiss her. For him to offer a sweet word. For him to tell her he\u2019d miss her. Anything. Something. But he simply collected his belongings and strode toward the door, leaving her in bed, her lips parted in surprise.</p><p>She flopped back onto the pillow, staring up at the ceiling. What the hell was going on? What was with his Jekyll and Hyde act? It was exhausting trying to keep up with his mood swings. She\u2019d been nothing but honest and open with him at every turn, and yet he was holding back from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Supposedly women were the moody, emotional creatures. According to men. But men were far more guilty of being volatile. Up and down. One minute he was sweet, tender and absolutely adoring. The next? Silent and brooding over God only knew what.</p><p>Maybe he just wasn\u2019t a morning person. Admittedly, until recently, she had zero experience with him in the mornings. She\u2019d never had cause to see him or interact with him in the early hours of the day. Her exposure to him had been limited to afternoons and evenings, and he\u2019d been nothing but charming on those occasions.</p><p>Oh well, she\u2019d have to have enough morning cheer for both of them apparently. She\u2019s always been an early riser and what she considered a morning person. Carson had teased her about being disgustingly cheerful the moment she rose from bed.</p><p>Thoughts of Carson brought back the disturbing dreams from the night before. Her lips turned down into an unhappy frown. What did they mean? Dreams were inexplicable, a manifestation of the subconscious. Who the hell knew what they really meant? Maybe they meant nothing at all. Maybe it was just a battle between her past and present, colliding at night when her thoughts were unguarded.</p> <p>At any rate, she wished they\u2019d go away. Carson was gone. He wasn\u2019t coming back. Last night\u2019s dream had bothered her immensely. The heaviness followed her into the waking hours, weighing on her as she remembered the impossible choice she\u2019d faced in the dream.</p><p>It was silly because she\u2019d never face that choice. It was pointless to even dwell on it and think about which way she\u2019d go because it was never going to happen. The choice had been made for her.</p><p>Would she choose Carson if she could have him back? Would she turn her back on Dash and everything he offered? She shook her head, refusing to go there. It would only lead to guilty feelings on her part because in her dream she hadn\u2019t chosen him.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about it, Joss. You\u2019re only upsetting yourself and feeling unnecessary guilt. Carson would want you to be happy. He wouldn\u2019t want you to mourn him forever. Get over it and move on.\u201d</p><p>She briefly wondered if she should see a doctor. Not a shrink. God, anything but that. But perhaps her doctor could give her something to make her sleep more soundly so she wasn\u2019t tormented by dreams of her husband and her current lover.</p> <p>Filing that away and making a mental note to place a call to her physician, she forced herself out of bed, wondering what she\u2019d do the entire day while Dash was at work.</p><p>What had she done before she\u2019d moved into his house?</p><p>More and more she considered going back to work as a nurse. She needed a purpose. Something to occupy her time so she wasn\u2019t doing nothing day in, day out. Her CEUs were current. She had her license. She could go back to work at any time.</p><p>What would Dash think? He\u2019d made it clear that he wanted her time to be his own, but he had to work. He couldn\u2019t just drop everything to be with her twenty-four-seven, and she wouldn\u2019t expect him to.</p><p>She didn\u2019t necessarily want to go back to shift work, and it wasn\u2019t probable that she\u2019d score a day shift job, coming in as low man on the totem pole. Yes, the swing and night shift made more per hour, but she didn\u2019t need the money. She was financially secure thanks to Carson. What she needed was something to occupy her time.</p><p>Maybe she could seek employment at a doctor\u2019s office. At least then her hours would be normal and she\u2019d have weekends off.</p> <p>And there was the fact that she\u2019d planned to go back to school to become a nurse practitioner. She had classes and credits toward that goal, but she\u2019d quit when she\u2019d quit her job. She only lacked a year and she could have her license and go to work under a doctor in private practice.</p><p>It was something she was going to give serious thought to. She was tired of being at loose ends and it was time for her to take charge of her life once more. She was young. She\u2019d already taken charge of her sexuality and taken the plunge with Dash. All that remained was for her to decide on going back to work.</p><p>She would discuss it with Dash and get his thoughts when he was in a better mood. Not that she needed his approval. She was perfectly capable of making her own decisions. Yes, she\u2019d given him her submission, had wanted him to have absolute control over her. But she still retained the option of making the important decisions that affected her happiness. And if Dash truly cared for her, he wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of her happiness.</p><p>Feeling marginally better about her future, she went through the motions of the day. She spent half an hour on the Internet looking up recipes. She wanted to make Dash something special. Finding a yummy-looking chicken and cheese casserole dish that would be simple to prepare, she then took stock of Dash\u2019s pantry and fridge and realized she\u2019d have to go out to pick up the necessary ingredients.</p><p>For that matter his pantry was pretty empty and his fridge wasn\u2019t much better. Happy to have something to do, she made a list and planned a series of meals, making sure she wrote down the necessary ingredients for all the recipes. When her list was completed, she then took stock of the bathroom and toiletries.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t brought all of her girly stuff, though she\u2019d gotten most of it from home. She\u2019d run by her house and pack more of her things to bring over to Dash\u2019s since it appeared he had no intention of her spending the night anywhere but in his home.</p><p>By the time she was on her way, her mood had lightened and some of the heaviness had lifted away. She was nearly to the grocery store when she realized she hadn\u2019t let Dash know where she\u2019d be. She wasn\u2019t used to having to answer to anyone, but it was common courtesy now that she was living with Dash to at least let him know her whereabouts.</p><p>She sent him a quick text letting him know what she was doing and that she was cooking a special dinner for him, adding a smiley face and a heart at the end of the text.</p> <p>She cringed, wondering if he\u2019d find the emoticons annoying. Carson had found them endearing and cute. They were \u201cso her,\u201d as Carson had put it. She sighed, catching herself in mental comparison yet again. She had to quit it. Carson was gone, as she reminded herself on a daily basis now. The endless thinking back to what he liked and didn\u2019t like was getting old. And it would most certainly get old with Dash. Thank God she hadn\u2019t voiced her thoughts aloud to him and only went through them mentally.</p><p>Her phone went off and she smiled at Dash\u2019s response. And to think she\u2019d worried that he\u2019d find her text annoying.</p><p>Thanks, honey. Looking forward to it. xoxo</p><p>It had been a long time since she\u2019d cooked for someone else. Oh, she\u2019d fixed lunch and dinner a few times for the girls, but she hadn\u2019t prepared an intimate meal for a lover since . . . No, she wasn\u2019t going there, damn it.</p><p>She enjoyed her trip to the grocery store and realized halfway through that she should have stopped by her house first because she\u2019d have perishable items waiting in her car and the temps were well into the upper eighties today.</p><p>Oh well, she\u2019d just have to make her stopover at her house quick.</p><p>She cranked up the radio on the way to her house, singing along as she rolled up in her driveway. With a smile, she hopped out and hurried inside to collect the things she needed.</p><p>Five minutes later she shoved an extra suitcase into the minuscule backseat\u2014if it even classified as a real backseat since a person certainly couldn\u2019t fit\u2014because her tiny trunk was filled to bursting with the groceries she\u2019d purchased, and she headed back in the direction of Dash\u2019s house. Her home now.</p><p>It would take time for her to consider it hers. She still very much considered it Dash\u2019s house. But if things worked out long term . . .</p><p>She stopped, realizing this was the first time she was thinking long term. She\u2019d been hesitant to put her hopes into it becoming more. Permanent. But things were off to a very solid start if she didn\u2019t count his morning moodiness. But she could deal with that. She could be cheerful enough for them both.</p><p>It took her five trips into the house to get all the bags out of her trunk and one last one to collect her bulging suitcase. Dash would laugh at all the stuff she considered essential.</p><p>After putting away all the groceries, she laid out the ingredients for tonight\u2019s dinner and wondered if she should start it now or wait until he got home.</p><p>Her forehead wrinkled as she pondered her options. Dash had been clear on how he wanted her to be waiting when he got home each day, but she hadn\u2019t heard from him on when he would arrive. She glanced at her watch. It was only four thirty. A typical day was five o\u2019clock, and he\u2019d said he might be later today.</p><p>She\u2019d decided to go ahead and get a start on supper when her phone rang. Glancing at the screen, she saw Dash\u2019s name and smiled, reaching eagerly for the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, honey. I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d</p><p>A light shiver worked over her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he said in a low voice that matched hers.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, honey.\u201d</p><p>She punched the button to end the call and then hurriedly put away the stuff for supper. It wouldn\u2019t take much time to prepare at all and she could do it after he got home. For now she wanted to focus on being exactly as he wanted her. On her knees, na**d, waiting in the living room so she was the first thing he saw when he walked through the door.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>DASH pulled into his driveway and saw Joss\u2019s car parked there in the space next to his. He sat for a moment, hands clenched tight around the steering wheel. He had no idea what to expect when he walked into his house. He\u2019d been a jerk this morning. He knew that. But he hadn\u2019t been able to summon his usual tenderness when his mind was eaten alive by Joss crying over Carson after making love to Dash.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t slept, and the result had been him acting like a grumpy bear with a sore paw.</p><p>With a sigh he kicked open his car door and got out, determined to see this through.</p><p>He opened his front door and walked inside, moving automatically to the living room.</p><p>The sight that awaited him took his breath away. Joss was kneeling on the rug in front of the fireplace, na**d, her beautiful hair streaming over her shoulders, her ni**les playing an erotic game of peekaboo through the tendrils.</p><p>He was being the worst sort of ass and yet she waited, just as she\u2019d agreed, na**d and kneeling. For him.</p><p>She was making the effort. No matter what was going on in her head, she was trying. She was trying to make this work between them. How could he do anything less?</p><p>Forgotten was the previous night as he absorbed the image of her, transfixed by the sight of her kneeling in submission.</p><p>\u201cAh honey,\u201d he whispered as he crossed the room to her.</p><p>All thoughts of dominance fled. He only wanted to hold her, to apologize for the way he\u2019d treated her this morning. He wanted her in his arms, soft and precious. He looped his hands underneath her armpits and lifted, her startled gaze fixed on his face as he hauled her up and into his arms.</p><p>He wrapped himself around her, kissing her until they were both breathless, their chests heaving for air. He delved his hands into her hair, wrapping the silken mass around his fingers only wanting to touch her. To surround himself with her.</p><p>Again, he kissed her, devouring her lips, tasting and licking. His body surged to life, hard and aching against her belly. He had to have her now. Right now.</p><p>He walked her back to the couch and settled her on the cushions before hurriedly freeing himself from his pants. His dick jutted forward, straining, so hard his balls hurt.</p><p>When she leaned forward to take him in her mouth, he took a step back and placed his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. You aren\u2019t pleasuring me right now. I was an ass this morning and I have a lot to make up for. Let me pleasure you. Let me make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes warmed, instant forgiveness in her gaze. But that was Joss. Never one to hold a grudge. He felt infinitely unworthy of her in this moment. Unconditional and unwavering. This was the woman he loved and adored, and he was doing his best to f**k up everything before they even had a shot.</p><p>He stood back and stripped his clothing off, barely able to control his urge to take her hard and deep. But he\u2019d promised her the ultimate pleasure and he\u2019d do it even if the waiting killed him.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs and lean back against the back of the couch,\u201d he said in a husky voice.</p><p>Desire made her eyelids heavy and she looked up at him with drugged, intoxicated eyes. He knelt in front of her, running his fingers lightly down the insides of her thighs.</p><p>Her pu**y was open and bared to him, perfect pink folds, delicate and feminine just like her. He traced a line over the hood, brushing her cl*tand continuing down to circle her opening before pushing in the barest of inches.</p><p>She moaned softly and went wet around his finger. So responsive and receptive. Her body clutched at his finger as he withdrew as if it didn\u2019t want to let go. Then he lowered his head, his tongue lapping at her sweet moisture.</p><p>\u201cDash!\u201d</p><p>His name came out, explosive in the silence. His name. Not Carson\u2019s. That fact gratified him immensely. Her husband may occupy her dreams, but Dash had her in the present. For now he\u2019d take that and hold on for all he was worth. Sooner or later he\u2019d have her dreams as well as her in the waking.</p><p>He nibbled lightly and then sucked, rolling his tongue over her clit, exerting just enough pressure to make her wild beneath him. Her fingers thrust into his short-cut hair and then dug into his scalp, encouraging him, holding him in place.</p><p>She was in control, and he found he didn\u2019t mind at all. For this moment, she was calling the shots and he\u2019d allow it. Whatever she wanted. He was hers to command.</p><p>A soft hum blew from her lips. Satisfaction and desire all rolled into one. She arched upward, moving him to the places that brought her greater pleasure. He was an apt student, taking in her body\u2019s response when he hit a particularly sweet spot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was a quick study and soon she didn\u2019t have to direct him. He learned her body, absorbing the knowledge of what made her crazy with want.</p><p>He placed an openmouthed kiss to her pu**y entrance and then thrust his tongue as deep as he could get into her liquid warmth.</p><p>He wanted her to come in his mouth, an instant hot rush of release. He maneuvered his fingers, two of them below his mouth, and plunged them inside, caressing the silken walls of her vagina.</p><p>He probed gently, seeking the spot where the texture was more plush and different, slightly rougher. He pressed upward, eliciting an instant cry from her. She grew wetter and panted, the sounds an aphrodisiac to his ears.</p><p>His c**k was flat against his belly, so hard and pulsing that he was nearly out of his mind with the need to claim her. But he\u2019d deny himself that ultimate satisfaction. For her. This was all about her. Only for her. His silent apology for being a bastard and taking out his black mood on her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like feeling jealous. Especially of a dead man. A man who\u2019d been his best friend. But there it was. He was insanely jealous of Carson\u2019s hold on her even from the grave.</p><p>\u201cAre you close, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Please don\u2019t stop, Dash. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The heartfelt plea seized his very soul, warming him from the inside out. Liquid sunshine. He basked in her radiance, her pleasure and need.</p><p>He thrust with his fingers, exerting firmer pressure on her pleasure spot as his tongue circled her cl*tand sucked gently. She quivered uncontrollably underneath him, her thighs shaking, her knees knocking against his sides.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d he rasped. \u201cGive it to me now, Joss. Everything. Let go.\u201d</p><p>She arched upward, her cry endless and pained. He quickly covered the mouth of her pu**y with his own and sucked hard as she pulsed and vibrated in her orgasm. Her honey coated his tongue, spurring his need even higher.</p><p>His thumb moved up to her cl*tto replace his tongue and he rubbed gently, coaxing wave after wave of release from her.</p><p>Finally she sagged onto the couch, her body going limp. He glanced up to see her half-lidded eyes lazily surveying him, glowing with contentment. She reminded him of a satisfied cat and she was all but purring.</p><p>When he would have stood to replace his clothing, she quickly sat forward, her hands going to his h*ps to stop him. Then without a word, she grasped his c**k and guided it toward her mouth, slipping the head between her lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t deny me the same chance to pleasure you,\u201d she said, her voice laced with the husky remnants of her orgasm. She sounded hoarse and needy, as though she still had a ways to go to complete her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cJust stand there, Dash. Let me love you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, a wave of contentment rolling over him with the power to bring him to his knees. God yes, he\u2019d allow her to love him. It was everything he\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>His hands tangled in her hair, lifting it and pulling it away so he could see her face, could see her lips wrapped around his dick. She sucked him deep, holding him at the back of her throat and then swallowing around it, milking him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t last long, honey.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved into a smile around his cock.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And then she began to pump her fist around his dick, sucking him hard and deep. It was a pace destined to drive him over the edge within seconds. And it did. Before she\u2019d sucked him deep the fourth time, he was already coming, jetting and pulsing deep into her throat.</p> <p>She swallowed greedily, sucking, demanding more. Not a single drop spilled from her lips. Her fingers gently lowered to his balls, caressing and rolling them in her palm. He was up on tiptoe, straining forward, his body so tight that he felt he was coming apart at the seams.</p><p>The last of his s**en erupted and still she sucked and licked gently, bringing him down until he was simply too sensitive to bear her tender ministrations any longer.</p><p>He caught her hand, forcing her to still her motions, and then he carefully withdrew from her mouth, her tongue running along the back of the length as he pulled away.</p><p>He pulled her to stand in front of him and caught her in his arms, hugging her tightly to him. He buried his face in her hair and pressed gentle kisses to her head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cBut I won\u2019t turn it down. Ever. Thank you, honey. Thank you for forgiving me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, a gentle smile curving her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, Dash.\u201d</p><p>His feeling of unworthiness skyrocketed. God, but she was perfect. And he was an as**ole taking out his frustration on her two mornings in a row, and yet she forgave him as sweetly as a woman ever forgave a man.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll fix you a drink and you can come sit in the kitchen and keep me company while I prepare dinner,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. I\u2019d like that a lot.\u201d</p><p>The idea of them being so domestic. Of him sitting and watching as she cooked for him. The image was powerful and brought him immeasurable joy.</p><p>He quickly dressed and then she held out her hand to his.</p><p>\u201cCome on then. I\u2019ll fix your drink and then if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll get dressed. I don\u2019t want to be near a hot stove or oven na**d,\u201d she said ruefully.</p><p>\u201cUse my robe,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>There was nothing he\u2019d like more than to see her wrapped in his robe while she puttered around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll get your robe just as soon as I\u2019ve fixed your drink.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>THE last two weeks had been a dream. Dash couldn\u2019t be happier. Joss glowed with contentment. She\u2019d fallen into her role as a submissive, submissive to him, as though she\u2019d been born to it. And maybe she had.</p><p>Maybe it was what she had always craved\u2014needed\u2014and Dash was supremely arrogant and pleased that he was the man who\u2019d provided it for her. There had been no reoccurrence of her saying Carson\u2019s name in her sleep. No upsetting dreams. She was, he was beginning to have confidence, his. Completely and utterly his.</p><p>He drove faster than normal, eager to get home. Tonight he\u2019d broach the subject of taking Joss to The House for the first time as a couple. He hadn\u2019t wanted to rush into it, especially after Joss\u2019s first experience at The House. He hadn\u2019t wanted to take her there until things were perfect between them. Until that first encounter was wiped firmly from her mind and no embarrassment or shame lingered.</p><p>She was ready. He was certainly ready. Ready to take things to the next level. He wanted to publicly claim Joss, but he also wanted to give her what she\u2019d been looking for that very first night.</p><p>He was confident that she\u2019d agree, that she\u2019d even be eager to experiment with all of the pleasures The House provided.</p><p>Before he\u2019d decided on the night, he\u2019d made damn certain that neither Tate nor Jensen would be there. He wouldn\u2019t cause Joss even a moment\u2019s discomfort. Jensen had joined and gone through the vetting process and had received his membership just days before.</p><p>According to Tate, he and Chessy hadn\u2019t been in a long while. Dash had frowned over that fact, remembering his conversation with Joss about Chessy and Tate and her concerns over Chessy\u2019s happiness. Tate had seemed awfully preoccupied with work lately. His company was growing by leaps and bounds and the demands on his time had increased.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t broached the subject with his friend because it wasn\u2019t his business. And he had no way of knowing if the couple was having problems anyway. No need to plant the seed of doubt in Tate\u2019s mind if there was no cause for concern. Tate adored Chessy. Dash knew that much. And it would likely make Tate crazy if he even suspected Chessy wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>The couple would work it out in their own time. Dash was confident of that. Tate was over the moon in love with his wife. He\u2019d give her the world\u2014had always given her the world. He treasured Chessy\u2019s gift of submission. He was damn lucky.</p><p>But no, Dash was every bit as fortunate now. He had Joss. Perfect, submissive, loving Joss. She\u2019d gone to great lengths to please him, worrying endlessly that she\u2019d disappoint him. As if.</p><p>Dash now knew that even if Joss weren\u2019t able to give him what he needed\u2014desired\u2014by being submissive, Dash would forgo that aspect of his personality for her. There was no sacrifice too great to make in order to have his heart\u2019s desire.</p><p>Joss was enough. She would always be enough.</p><p>He pulled into his drive, parking beside Joss\u2019s car, and he idly wondered if he should buy her a new car. Something that was from him. A clean break from her past. She\u2019d already moved out of her house, though she hadn\u2019t yet put it on the market. They hadn\u2019t even discussed it. But it was a subject he\u2019d bring up soon. He wanted Joss here, permanently. He didn\u2019t want her to have her own home to go back to. A house she shared with Carson. A home purchased by Carson just as the car she drove had been purchased by her husband.</p><p>She could sell the house and bank the money for her own use. She\u2019d never want for anything Dash could provide. He wanted no penny of the money given to her by her husband. It and the income generated by her part of the business would be hers alone. And any children they had in the future.</p><p>A goofy grin spread across his face as he got out and headed for the door. The idea of giving Joss the children she so wanted\u2014his children\u2014filled him with absolute happiness. Little girls that looked just like their mother. Boys with his arrogance and her gentle spirit.</p><p>Damn, but life was good. And it would only get better.</p><p>He knew there were two things Joss dearly wanted that Carson had been unable to provide. One, Dash had already provided. Dominance. The other? Children. Carson had been reluctant to have children, but Dash had no such reservations.</p><p>As soon as he convinced her to make their relationship permanent and legal, as soon as he got his ring on her finger, they\u2019d discuss her becoming pregnant. There was no need to wait. Joss had already waited long enough. He wanted nothing more than to make all her dreams come true.</p><p>He walked inside and as he\u2019d come to expect, Joss was waiting, on her knees, na**d, her eyes welcoming as he strode into the living room.</p><p>He went to her instantly, picking her up and cradling her in his arms. He kissed her lovingly, allowing all the love he felt for her to show. He hadn\u2019t given her the words, but his actions told her on a daily basis. Surely she knew. And soon he\u2019d give her those words. When he felt the time was right.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said breathlessly, her lips swollen from his passionate kiss. \u201cGood day I take it?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNot until now, no. But coming home to you is the very best part of my day. Every day.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and cupped his jaw with her hand, lightly caressing. He savored her touch, craved it with everything he had inside him. He hadn\u2019t lied. He looked forward to the end of every day, merely going through the motions at work. He hadn\u2019t been late a single day because it would mean missing out on this time with her.</p><p>The evening was now theirs. No interruptions. No outside world to interfere. Only their world behind the closed doors of their home. Their home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite part of the day too,\u201d she said in an adorably shy voice. \u201cWhen you call me and I come into the living room to wait, it seems interminable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey. Is it uncomfortable for you to kneel that long?\u201d</p><p>He wanted her to suffer no discomfort. Not on his account. Yes, he wanted her waiting, kneeling, na**d and utterly submissive. But not if it caused her an ounce of discomfort.</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, darling. I love the moment you walk into the living room and I love how your eyes light up when you see me. I wouldn\u2019t trade that moment for anything.\u201d</p><p>He was absolutely and absurdly delighted over the endearment she used. She\u2019d never used one, never called him anything but Dash. He was a grown man and nearly taken to his knees over the sweetness of her calling him darling.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Dash?\u201d she asked, worry furrowing her brow. \u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the lines away from her brow. \u201cNot at all, honey. You said something very right. You called me darling. I like it.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and ducked her gaze, but he forced her back, cupping her chin so he could kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cI like it, Joss,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cI like it a damn lot. It makes me feel special. Like I\u2019m special to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are special, Dash,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI hope I\u2019ve shown you that in our time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have, but it\u2019s still nice to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and kissed him, wrapping her arms around his neck as he stood holding her, cradling her in his arms. He never wanted to let her go.</p><p>He walked to the sofa and eased down, still holding her firmly in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have something I wanted to mention to you. I wanted it to be a surprise, but I thought it might be better if you\u2019re prepared for it. And if it\u2019s not something you want to do, then just say so. I won\u2019t be angry. I don\u2019t want to do anything you aren\u2019t comfortable with.\u201d</p><p>There was confusion in her eyes, but she remained silent, waiting for him to continue. He loved that about her. That she didn\u2019t immediately panic or protest. She trusted him and he savored that trust.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could go to The House tomorrow. As a couple. It\u2019s a place you were interested in, and I can make the experience special for you, Joss. Trust me to know what will please you.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, no doubt marred her expression. Just trust, shining in her eyes as she stared up at him. She didn\u2019t even appear to be nervous or apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cI do trust you, Dash. If you want to go, then I\u2019ll be happy to go with you. Just tell me what I should wear. I don\u2019t want to disappoint or shame you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou will never shame me,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cThere is nothing you could ever do that would bring me shame. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him, her eyes warm and full of . . . love? Dare he hope for that so soon? He pulled back from that thought, not wanting to set himself up for disappointment, no matter that he\u2019d just told her he could never be disappointed in her. That was the one thing that could shatter him. Her not returning or being able to return his love.</p><p>\u201cWhat time would you like to go? And what shall I wear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>There was excitement and anticipation in her eyes. She was looking forward to their excursion. Already his mind was alive with the possibilities. He would be very exacting in his plans for her. He wanted this to be perfect.</p><p>\u201cSomething sexy,\u201d he murmured. \u201cA short cocktail dress that shows off your gorgeous legs. And heels. Definitely heels. I want to f**k you in them in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went cloudy with answering lust. She shivered delicately in his embrace as if the image appealed to her every bit as much as it did him. He hoped to hell it did.</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause shortly after we arrive, I\u2019ll have you na**d and bound.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath and he studied her closely, searching for any sign that she wouldn\u2019t be up for what he had planned. But there was no resistance that he could see. Just intrigue and arousal.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat time will I need to be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner out. Be ready when I get home. We\u2019ll eat and take our time and arrive at The House around nine. Things don\u2019t really kick off there until later in the evening. And I want the whole damn world to see what is mine. I want every man there eaten alive with jealousy over what is mine and will never be theirs. They can look but they damn well can\u2019t touch.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, pleasure shining in her eyes. \u201cI like that you\u2019re so possessive of me, Dash. It makes me feel . . . safe. And so very cherished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBecause you are.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes suddenly widened and panic flared in their depths.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, dinner! I completely forgot dinner, Dash. I got sidetracked when you came in. Damn it, I hope it\u2019s not burned!\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she scrambled out of his lap, and laughing, he let her go, watching as she fled toward the kitchen.</p><p>He followed behind and his heart clenched when she turned from the open oven, her look utterly crestfallen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ruined. I\u2019m so sorry, Dash. I had planned a special dinner for us and timed it so when you got home we\u2019d eat immediately.\u201d</p><p>She looked so adorable that he could only cross the room and pull her into his arms, shutting the oven with one hand and reaching up to turn it off.</p><p>\u201cLet it burn,\u201d he murmured. \u201cGet dressed and I\u2019ll take you out to eat. I don\u2019t give a damn what I eat as long as I get to be with you.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>JOSS was nervous, excited and extremely aroused, all rolled into a bundle of nerves. She knew, without arrogance, that she looked her best. She\u2019d been very careful with her appearance, no matter that Dash had told her she\u2019d be na**d in short order.</p><p>But she wanted to look good, not only for her own confidence, but for Dash. She wanted him to be proud of her. To be proud to have her at his side and on his arm when they walked into The House.</p><p>Dash helped her from his car and tucked her arm underneath his as they walked toward the entrance.</p> <p>How different this trip was compared with her last, when she\u2019d been terrified and so nervous her stomach had been one gigantic ball of nausea. At least this time she didn\u2019t have to go through the motions of the social rooms downstairs where people gathered to hook up for the night. No worry over picking the wrong man or someone who would hurt her.</p><p>Dash was with her, his possession evident in his every expression and movement. There would be no choosing another man tonight. Her choice was made. Dash and only Dash would take her through the paces of whatever he planned.</p><p>Not knowing exactly what it was he planned for her added an element of intrigue and only heightened her arousal. Her ni**les were taut and aching. Her pu**y was clenched tight and she knew she was wet already.</p><p>Dash escorted her through the social rooms where he got her a glass of wine. But she knew that the biggest reason he made an appearance here was because he wanted to show her off and that gave her ego a huge, much-needed boost.</p><p>He was proud of her. It was evident in his gaze. It never left her, scorching a path over her skin every time it raked over her. He barely left her side even to get the wine. He was always within touching distance, his hand on her, his arm wrapped around her.</p><p>But when Craig, the man Joss had been with that first night, entered the room, his gaze sweeping over the women with a predatory gleam, Dash immediately stiffened and drew Joss farther into his side.</p><p>His hold on her screamed possessiveness and he met Craig\u2019s mocking gaze with a frigid look of his own.</p><p>\u201cCorbin,\u201d Craig said curtly, nodding in Dash\u2019s direction. Then his gaze swept appreciatively over Joss. \u201cYou\u2019re looking beautiful, Mrs. Breckenridge.\u201d</p><p>Dash stiffened at the manner of address, and Joss\u2019s hand went to his arm, squeezing lightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Joss said politely. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse us, we\u2019ll be moving on.\u201d</p><p>But Dash didn\u2019t immediately move away. He pushed into Craig\u2019s space so they were nose to nose. Well, almost nose to nose since Dash had a good three inches in height over Craig.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you in the common room,\u201d Dash bit out. \u201cI\u2019ll throw you out myself. You don\u2019t so much as look at Joss. Got me?\u201d</p><p>Craig chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t control my comings and goings, Corbin. I have a right to be here, same as you. So go f**k yourself. I\u2019ll look all I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t come up those stairs,\u201d Dash said menacingly. \u201cI will take you apart and I don\u2019t give a shit if I get barred from the premises from now on. It would be worth it to take you down a few notches. Try me. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>Craig paled and backed down, fear evident in his eyes. Dash had been coldly serious. Joss absolutely believed that he\u2019d rearrange Craig\u2019s face and it was evident that Craig held that same belief.</p><p>Without a word, Craig backed away and turned to leave the room, casting a disgusted look in Dash\u2019s direction.</p><p>Dash curled his arm around Joss and guided her out of the room and toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey. I won\u2019t let him ruin our night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have ruined it anyway,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he was here. I\u2019m here with you, Dash. Only you. It doesn\u2019t matter to me who sees me because I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>He paused at the bottom of the stairs and pulled her into a breathtaking kiss.</p><p>\u201cThanks for that, honey. I just don\u2019t like the guy and I like it less that he\u2019s had his hands on you once. That he touched what I consider mine and have considered mine since before we ever got together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and wiped the lipstick off his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve messed up my makeup.\u201d</p><p>He growled, the sound rumbling from his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get a lot more messed up before I\u2019m finished. Your hair\u2019s beautiful, sweetheart, but I\u2019m afraid that delicate updo is just going to end up destroyed.\u201d</p><p>She shivered and smiled in delight. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get to it,\u201d he murmured, pushing her up the stairs.</p><p>When they entered the common room it was alive with activity. There was recognition on Dash\u2019s face as his gaze swept the occupants. Damon Roche saw them in the doorway and headed in their direction, a welcoming smile on his face.</p><p>A gorgeous dark-haired woman was glued to his side and she guessed that this must be his wife, Serena.</p><p>For a woman who\u2019d had a baby not so long ago, her figure was perfect, showing no signs of pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cDash, Joss, it\u2019s good to see you both,\u201d Damon said warmly.</p><p>It seemed the height of awkwardness to be exchanging pleasantries while everyone around them was indulging in hedonistic pleasures. Naked, moaning, f**king, sucking. The smack of a flogger against flesh. Cries and moans of pain and pleasure. The scent of sex and arousal was thick in the air. It brought a prickle of chill bumps to Joss\u2019s skin.</p><p>How could she casually undress in front of these people?</p><p>As if sensing her unease, Dash\u2019s arm tightened around her as they conversed with Damon and Serena.</p><p>A moment later, two men on either side of a striking Asian woman walked up to where she and Dash stood with Serena and Damon.</p><p>Dash\u2019s face lit up in recognition and genuine pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLucas, Cole, Ren,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s damn good to see the three of you. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>The men extended their hands to Dash, and Dash leaned in to kiss Ren on either cheek. It quickly became obvious to Joss that Ren was with both men. Her mind came alive with curiosity, imagining what it would be like to have two such strong, dominant men at the same time. Was it permanent or were they just seeking a night of pleasure in a haven that catered to every sexual whim?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been in Vegas quite a bit over the last few months,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIntroduce us to your lady friend, Dash. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her here before.\u201d</p><p>Dash pulled her forward, squeezing her hand.</p><p>\u201cHoney, this is Lucas Holt, Cole Madison and Ren Holt-Madison. Guys, this is Joss. She is mine.\u201d</p><p>The simple introduction sent warmth all the way to her toes. His matter-of-fact way of saying she was his. He was saying publicly that she belonged to him. That he was her Dominant and she his submissive. If she thought she would ever be embarrassed to be introduced this way, she now knew she was wrong.</p><p>She loved it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you, Joss,\u201d Cole said gently, brushing a kiss over her hand.</p><p>Lucas took her hand next, his dark gaze penetrating her until she felt bare. There was something about both men that made her feel . . . vulnerable. She glanced at Ren, who looked extremely content to be between them, and wondered at the strength the smaller woman must possess to be able to take on both of these obviously dominant men.</p><p>Cole pulled Ren closer into his side while Lucas kept hold of her hand, their fingers laced tightly together. They obviously had no reservations whatsoever about the world knowing of their unusual relationship. Dash had introduced Ren using both of the men\u2019s last names. Was she married to both? Bound to them both?</p><p>The situation intrigued and fascinated her. She\u2019d have to remember to ask Dash about them later.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you get to tonight\u2019s entertainment,\u201d Damon said politely as he gathered his wife to his side. \u201cIs there anything you need? You\u2019ve only to ask one of my men and they\u2019ll get whatever it is you require.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the bench unoccupied?\u201d Dash asked, a gleam entering his eye.</p><p>Both Serena and Ren glanced at Joss, and she could swear envy entered their gazes. Whatever the bench was, it must be pleasurable because both women looked as though they wanted to be in Joss\u2019s position.</p><p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019ll have it reserved for you for the night if you like,\u201d Damon said graciously.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. I\u2019ll need restraints and a flogger.\u201d</p><p>Damon nodded and then Dash said their farewells, Joss echoing them as well as expressing her happiness over having met them. Dash led her away from the group of people and farther into the room.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your friends?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cI met them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole, Ren and Lucas. They\u2019re together? The three of them?\u201d</p><p>Dash smiled. \u201cYes. A not so unusual situation for here. Though theirs is a permanent arrangement and not confined to nights of fun at The House. She belongs to them both, and they both adore the ground she walks on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lucky,\u201d Joss said wistfully.</p><p>Dash\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that your fantasy, Joss? To have two men making love to you? Cherishing you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head quickly. \u201cOne is quite enough for me,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cAll I need is you, Dash. You\u2019re all I can handle!\u201d</p><p>He looked smug. \u201cGlad to hear it, honey, because I have no intention of sharing you with any other man, at least not on a permanent basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s obvious after the way you threatened Craig,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>He guided her toward a padded bench that looked like a huge saddle. It was curved in the middle and had V legs extending out from the bottom. In front there were two posts and she wondered what they could possibly be used for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to undress you, Joss. Here and now in front of everyone. I don\u2019t want you to focus on anyone but me. Only me. Forget about everyone else. There is only me and you in this room and what we do together.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, swallowing back her nervousness.</p><p>He was slow and reverent as he gently divested her of her clothing. Each piece was carefully stripped away. He took his time as if savoring the process. Exposing her skin inch by inch.</p><p>When she was na**d, he stood to his full height, inhaling deeply as he stared over her nude body.</p><p>She felt . . . beautiful. Worthy. And proud.</p><p>Dash was a gorgeous, alpha dominant male and he wanted her.</p><p>Never had she felt so feminine and powerful. Yes, Dash held all the power. He had control over her. And yet she felt powerful in her own right. As though she held his pleasure and satisfaction in the palm of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI want you to bend over the bench, belly down on the padding. Make sure you\u2019re comfortable and tell me if you\u2019re not. Extend your arms outward toward the posts. I\u2019m going to secure your hands to those posts and then I\u2019m going to tie your ankles to the legs so you\u2019re incapable of movement.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart fluttered and her breaths sped up, puffing erratically over her lips. Now it became clear just what those posts were for. She would be spread and bound securely so he had access to every part of her body.</p><p>When she was positioned to his satisfaction, he began winding the satin-covered rope around her wrists. When they were firmly secured, he turned his attention to her ankles, tying them tightly to the legs of the bench.</p><p>Then he caressed her bottom, spreading and petting the globes. Would he f**k her ass? Her pussy? Both? Her mind was alive with the possibilities. Desire buzzed in her veins like a potent drug. She was sluggish and high, already well on her way into the dreamlike plane she entered every time Dash dominated her.</p><p>But then she remembered him asking for a flogger. She sucked in her breath, realizing that he intended to spank her. And she was in the perfect position, her ass, her back and the backs of her legs vulnerable to his strikes.</p><p>He walked around in front of her, ducking underneath one outstretched arm that was tied to the post, and then unzipped his slacks, pulling his erection from his underwear. It bobbed in front of her lips and then he palmed the top of her head, forcing it upward so her mouth was open to his advance.</p><p>He slid in roughly, plunging deep on the very first thrust. It was clear that he was as aroused as she was and that he wouldn\u2019t be gentle tonight. She didn\u2019t want him to be. She wanted his dominance. His strength. His absolute power over her. She liked how vulnerable she felt with him. Gloried in the fact that he could\u2014and would\u2014use her mercilessly. Rough. Hard. She wanted it all.</p><p>For several long moments he f**ked her mouth with ruthless, exacting precision. Precum leaked into her mouth and dribbled onto the floor before she could swallow it all. Then he pulled away, stiff and distended, and caressed her cheek in approval.</p><p>\u201cVery good, darling. You please me very much. Now I\u2019ll take you further. I\u2019m going to flog you, Joss. And I\u2019m not going to be easy. Remember your safe word. I won\u2019t gag you because I want you to be able to say that word if necessary.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding but she\u2019d already resolved that she wouldn\u2019t use the word no matter what. She\u2019d pass out before allowing her safe word to cross her lips. She wouldn\u2019t disappoint Dash or herself that way.</p><p>He picked up the crop and trailed it down her back, caressing the length of her spine with the leather tip. Then he smacked the fleshy part of her bottom, eliciting a gasp. She tightened her lips, determined that no further sound would escape. She would bear stoically everything he dished out.</p><p>Another blow fell and she bit into her lip to stanch the cry that threatened to burst free. He hadn\u2019t lied. He wasn\u2019t being the least bit gentle. His blows were harder than they\u2019d been before. Sharper, with a burn that faded and was replaced by glowing pleasure.</p><p>By the sixth lash, she\u2019d entered a dreamy state, sluggishly reacting to every strike. She tried to arch upward, seeking the sweet heat caused by the repeated blows.</p><p>He struck harder, as if sensing she\u2019d already slipped into drugged unawareness. The eighth broke through her reverie, bringing her sharply back into focus. He peppered her back, her behind, even the backs of her thighs until she was certain her entire body was ablaze with color, rosy from his marks.</p><p>She was gasping now, her breath hitching as he showed her no mercy. Up to her shoulders, the sensitive skin on fire as he covered her entire back. There wasn\u2019t a part of her body that wasn\u2019t tingling. She twitched, unable to keep still, trying anything to alleviate the exquisite burn.</p><p>Her head drooped lower, sagging when she could no longer hold herself up. But his hand twisted ruthlessly in her hair, yanking her head back up to slide his c**k into her mouth.</p><p>He f**ked her for several long moments, the sucking sounds she made the only noise she could hear. She had no awareness of what went on around her. Had no idea if others were watching, observing Dash\u2019s mastery over her body. She didn\u2019t care. For her there was only him and her. And this moment.</p><p>He slid in, pressing his groin to her chin, and remained there until she struggled for breath. But she forced herself not to panic. She trusted Dash. He knew her limits. He wouldn\u2019t go too far.</p><p>Then he eased out, pulling the rest of the way from her mouth, and the fire of the lash returned as his blows grew more intense. She was barely conscious, not because she was overcome with pain but because the world had ceased to exist around her. There was a heavy fog of pleasure surrounding her, invading her veins. She craved more. Begged for more. She could hear herself as though she were a distant voice through the heavy haze.</p><p>And then his body came down over her back, blanketing her with his warmth and strength. He whispered close to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDarling Joss. So very beautiful and submissive. You have no idea how precious you are to me, how beautiful you look with my marks raised on your skin. I\u2019m going to f**k you now and I\u2019m going to f**k you hard. Your pu**y first and then that sweet ass. And I\u2019m going to have another man flog you while I f**k you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open as her body came to life. She was violently aroused at the image he invoked. That she would be flogged by another man while Dash possessed her, claimed her, f**ked her.</p><p>How would she survive it? She was already so far gone that she could barely remember her own name. And now Dash was upping the ante and pushing her further than she\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>He grasped her h*ps roughly, pushing into her with a brutality that took her breath away. He was deep, wedging himself as far into her pu**y as he could go. She was ready, more than ready for him, and yet she was so tight around him. He was huge within her. So aroused that he was thicker, longer, broader than ever.</p> <p>He hammered into her, rocking her against the bench and stretching the restraints to the point of pain. And she took it all. Craved more. Wanted more. And more.</p><p>And then the lash fell as Dash pulled back. The two men worked in perfect rhythm. The flogger fell as Dash retreated and raised when he slammed back into her.</p><p>She was sobbing helplessly, so far gone in her pleasure that she wasn\u2019t even sure whether she\u2019d orgasmed yet or not. If she had, she was well on her way to another, her need building to a frightening intensity.</p><p>And then he pulled out, spread her ass cheeks and quickly smeared a generous amount of lubricant over the seam. He positioned himself at her tiny opening and hammered forward, giving her no time to adjust to his invasion.</p><p>She cried out despite her vow not to. She couldn\u2019t help it. His name was a litany on her lips as she sobbed it over and over, begging him for more, for mercy, though she wanted none.</p><p>Her safe word never even threatened to burst forth. It was the furthest thing from her mind. She couldn\u2019t even remember it, didn\u2019t want to remember it because she didn\u2019t want this to end.</p><p>Over and over he f**ked her ass and then the blows began to fall, peppering her back and ass when Dash pulled back each time.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come,\u201d Dash ordered. \u201cWith me, Joss. I want you with me. Tell me what you need to get there so I can make it happen.\u201d</p><p>Her brain was utterly scrambled. She didn\u2019t know what she needed when her entire body was on fire and aching with unfulfilled need.</p><p>A strange hand gently parted her folds underneath where Dash f**ked her hard and furious. It wasn\u2019t Dash\u2019s touch. She knew it intimately. This was the man who\u2019d flogged her. He was gently caressing her clit, trying to bring her fulfillment.</p><p>She trembled, turned on by the idea of two men touching her. Dash had said another man would never have her, and indeed, it was Dash possessing her, filling her while the other man merely touched, aided Dash.</p><p>Her legs began to shake. Her entire body trembled as her orgasm swelled to greater heights. The fingers became more forceful, circling and rubbing her cl*tand then down to her entrance, the fingers plunging inside as Dash f**ked her ass with all his strength.</p><p>She went off like a bomb, her cry loud in her ears. She screamed Dash\u2019s name, bucking wildly against him, nearly unseating him though her movements were confined by the ropes binding her hand and foot.</p><p>She felt the hot jets of s**en spurting onto her skin, lashing her buttocks and then filling her opening. Dash pushed into her again, still spilling inside her, thrusting and jetting until cum ran down her legs, dripping to the floor.</p><p>Then he blanketed her body, whispering soothing words close to her ear. But she couldn\u2019t make out what he said because of the roar still thudding in her veins. She was panting, her strength completely gone, wrung out from the most explosive experience of her life.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d been missing for so long. She didn\u2019t spare any guilt or self-consciousness over the fact that she\u2019d craved what others would find depraved. She was in a public setting where anyone at all could see her and Dash in the most intimate of acts. And yet even though it was indeed public, the intimacy was not broken because those other people didn\u2019t exist for her. Only Dash and the pleasure he gave her.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder and as he lifted himself off her, he trailed a line of kisses down her spine before finally easing himself from her still-quivering body. Then he and the other man carefully untied her and Dash pulled her into his arms, supporting her so her knees didn\u2019t give way.</p><p>The other man flashed in her vision for a brief moment before she fixed her unsteady stare on Dash. He looked at her so tenderly, his gaze filled with so much love, that if he hadn\u2019t held her so firmly she would have fallen down.</p><p>He kissed her, whispering his approval, pride and satisfaction. She soaked up those words like a rain-parched desert. She leaned into him, wanting and needing that closeness now that she was so vulnerable after her earth-shattering orgasm.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and thank the man who assisted me,\u201d Dash said gently. \u201cGive him your thanks and then return to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI mean what is expected of me? Am I supposed to p-pleasure him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. Not at all. He was more than satisfied to take part in seeing you come apart and react so beautifully under the kiss of leather. I\u2019ve said no man will have you but me, and that means your pleasure as well. He shared in yours, yes. But you will thank him and nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She turned, still wobbly as Dash supported her. She glanced up at the man, taking in his features. He was older than Dash, perhaps ten years or so. There was just a hint of silver at his temples but he was very handsome. He smiled gently at her as she murmured her thank-you. He took her hand, lifting it to his lips to press a tender kiss to her skin.</p><p>\u201cDash is a very lucky man,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful sight, Joss. There wasn\u2019t a man in this room who wasn\u2019t envying Dash with his every breath just now.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you. Thank you for your generosity. You brought me pleasure. You and Dash both. For that you have my thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s I who owe you my thanks for allowing me to have a small part in something so beautiful,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>He nodded his head at Dash and then turned away, melting into the crowd that Joss had just noticed gathered around her and Dash.</p><p>Her cheeks warmed as she took in the fact that she and Dash had been the focus of the entire room. Everyone had stopped what they were doing to watch her and Dash. His mastery of her. Women stared, jealousy evident in their gazes that drifted meaningfully over Dash. They wanted him. They made no effort to disguise it. And the men. She sucked in her breath, surprised by the na**d desire she saw reflected in their stares.</p><p>She glanced up at Dash, baffled by their reactions.</p><p>He smiled tenderly down at her, pulling her into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, perfectly submissive and you react to the whip like a dream. What man wouldn\u2019t look at you with lust in his eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only want you to look at me that way,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTake me home, Dash. I want to go home with you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead and then reached for her discarded clothing. He helped her dress after wiping the remnants of his release from her skin. The clothing was uncomfortable against her still-burning flesh and she flinched when Dash zipped up her dress.</p><p>He kissed her shoulder and grazed his teeth up her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get home, I\u2019ll take you out of your clothing and draw you a bath so you can have a nice long soak. And tomorrow you\u2019ll wear nothing the entire day. I don\u2019t want to cause you any discomfort.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>JOSS was at a booth at the Lux Caf\u00e9 waiting for Chessy and Kylie to arrive. For once, she was the first to arrive, but she was anxious to see her friends. She\u2019d shamelessly neglected them over the last few weeks and she felt guilty for not making the effort to see them more. Especially Kylie.</p><p>She\u2019d heard reports from Dash about how Kylie was taking Jensen\u2019s position in the company, and he\u2019d said things were noticeably strained at the office but that Kylie was handling it. Whatever that meant. He\u2019d only said that she was quiet but did her job without complaint.</p><p>Other than a few phone calls and exchanged e-mails or texts, she hadn\u2019t seen her friends alone at all since their lunch in this same place the day she\u2019d told them of her decision to go to The House.</p><p>How much had changed since then! She\u2019d been so utterly wrapped up in her budding relationship with Dash that everything else had faded into the background.</p><p>She looked up when Chessy and Kylie came in together and she rose, hugging them both in turn before they sat down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you both,\u201d Joss said sincerely. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cUh-huh. You expect us to believe that when you\u2019ve been wrapped up in that hunk of man of yours?\u201d</p><p>Joss laughed but she studied Kylie carefully. It was obvious that she was indeed under an enormous amount of strain. There were dark smudges underneath Kylie\u2019s eyes, which told Joss that her dreams were tormenting her again. Still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joss sighed, worried over her friend. She reached out to squeeze Kylie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cHow has work been? How is Jensen working out?\u201d</p><p>Kylie made a face. \u201cHe bugs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Chessy asked curiously. \u201cThat man is divine to look at. So dark and brooding. He makes me shiver, and I have my own very possessive dominant man to go home to.\u201d</p> <p>Joss laughed again but sobered at Kylie\u2019s haunted look.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. He\u2019s so quiet and intense. He just looks at me. Stares. Like he\u2019s trying to see into my mind or whatever. It bothers me, and what am I supposed to say? I can\u2019t very well tell him to stop looking at me. He and Dash both would think I was crazy. Maybe I am,\u201d she added with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Joss said, still holding on to her hand. \u201cHe seems very nice and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll warm up to him.\u201d</p><p>Kylie didn\u2019t look convinced. Instead she directed the conversation back at Joss.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things with you and Dash? I have to say, I\u2019ve never seen the man so happy. He\u2019s in a disgustingly good mood every day at work. And he all but races out the door every day between four thirty and five. I don\u2019t think a complete meltdown in the business would force him to stay after hours.\u201d</p> <p>Chessy giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s in looooove. It\u2019s obvious. The man is a complete goner. \u2018Stick a fork in him\u2019 done.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s cheeks colored as heat rose in her face.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, are you?\u201d Chessy asked pointedly.</p><p>Joss sighed and then rubbed her face with her hands. \u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s bothered me because I think of Carson less and less. I used to think about him all the time, and now? I\u2019ll go days without even bringing him to mind. Does that make me a terrible person?\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s face wrinkled in sympathy. Even Kylie\u2019s expression softened. Both women reached for one of Joss\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Chessy said gently. \u201cYou loved Carson and he loved you. But he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s been gone for three years. That\u2019s more than enough time for you to grieve. It\u2019s time to let go and move on with your life. With Dash if he\u2019s who you choose. You have no reason to suffer guilt over not thinking about Carson as much now. It\u2019s normal. You have a new love. Embrace it. Don\u2019t hold back. You can\u2019t live in the past forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know I said some horrible things to you, Joss, and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me. I want you to be happy. Truly, I do. As Chessy said, Carson is gone.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s voice broke and she visibly had to collect herself before she continued.</p><p>\u201cDash is a good man. The best. And it\u2019s so obvious he cares deeply for you. If he is who makes you happy, then go for it. Don\u2019t let what I or anyone else thinks hold you back.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned Joss\u2019s eyelids as she stared back at the sincerity in her friends\u2019 gazes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she choked out. \u201cIt\u2019s been weighing on me so heavily. I had dreams a few weeks ago. When things with Dash were just heating up. Right after I moved in with him. And in those dreams, I had the choice of whether to have Carson back or hold on to Dash. And I couldn\u2019t decide,\u201d she said, agony in her voice. \u201cI felt terrible because I\u2019d always dreamed of having Carson back. I would have done anything to make that happen. And yet in my dream, I didn\u2019t take that chance. I hesitated because Dash was there and I didn\u2019t want to lose him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck your dreams,\u201d Chessy said crudely. \u201cThey f**k with your mind, and here\u2019s the thing, Joss. You can\u2019t have Carson back, so it was a stupid dream and just your guilt manifesting itself in that dream. Carson is gone. So whether you would choose to have him back is a moot point. You can\u2019t have him back. You\u2019ll never get him back. So what you have to decide is if you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life grieving for him or if you\u2019re going to take control of your future and not let a man who adores you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust Chessy to open up the can of whoop-ass,\u201d Kylie said in amusement. \u201cBut I agree with her here. Carson loved you, Joss. He adored you. There was never any question of that. And I don\u2019t believe for one minute that he\u2019d like what you\u2019re doing to yourself. He\u2019d want you to be happy. I want you to be happy. But you have to want it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Joss nodded. \u201cI love you guys. I\u2019m so glad to see y\u2019all both. I swear I won\u2019t be so absent from now on. You\u2019re too important to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBet your ass you won\u2019t,\u201d Chessy muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll come to Dash\u2019s house and haul you out by the hair. I was close to doing just that when you called to invite us to lunch, so consider yourself warned, girlfriend. I won\u2019t be as patient in the future.\u201d</p><p>Joss and Kylie both burst into laughter. Joss\u2019s heart lightened as she stared at the women she loved so much. She\u2019d needed this. This time with them and their advice and support. She hadn\u2019t realized just how much the whole situation with Carson and Dash had weighed on her until she\u2019d voiced her issues.</p><p>They seemed silly now and maybe she\u2019d needed her friends\u2019 approval even as she cringed over the idea that she couldn\u2019t simply own her choices and move forward. It wasn\u2019t fair to Dash or herself.</p><p>\u201cSo when are you going to tell him you love him?\u201d Chessy asked curiously.</p><p>The question startled Joss because she hadn\u2019t fully admitted the depth of her feelings to herself, much less anyone else. But as she pondered Chessy\u2019s question, she realized that she did. It was there. Maybe it had been there from the start.</p><p>\u201cIt just seems so soon,\u201d Joss murmured.</p><p>Kylie snorted. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t fall for my brother just as quickly? Hell, Joss, you both fell head over heels. I think Carson was a goner before you were. And look how well that turned out. If you\u2019re concerned that falling in love so quickly is a bad thing, consider that you and Carson would still be together and in love if he hadn\u2019t died. Falling fast doesn\u2019t make it any less strong. If it\u2019s there, it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA timeline doesn\u2019t make love any less real or true,\u201d Chessy said gently. \u201cKylie\u2019s right. You and Carson both fell hard and fast, and it didn\u2019t make your love any less solid, just like it won\u2019t make your feelings for Dash any less strong just because you fell so quickly. Look at me and Tate. We were together, what, two weeks before he proposed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you still happy?\u201d Joss asked challengingly.</p><p>She and Kylie exchanged quick glances. It was obvious Kylie was as worried about Chessy\u2019s marriage as Joss was herself. It was equally evident, though Joss hadn\u2019t spent much time with Chessy over the last weeks, that something was off between her and Tate.</p><p>Chessy\u2019s smile faltered but she quickly recovered. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re fine,\u201d she amended. \u201cJust different now. But relationships are like that. We can\u2019t stay in the honeymoon stage forever. Our needs are different now. He\u2019s juggling a very difficult business and he\u2019s often called away with clients or has to travel. But we\u2019ll be okay. I still love him as much as I ever have and I know he loves me.\u201d</p><p>Somewhat reassured by her friend\u2019s fervent response, Joss nodded. Kylie still had a look of doubt on her face, but that was Kylie. Fiercely loyal and protective of her friends, even if her mouth got away from her at times. But Joss knew that Kylie had her\u2019s and Chessy\u2019s best interests at heart, and that her heart was as big as the state of Texas.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s order. I\u2019m starving,\u201d Chessy said, swiftly changing the topic.</p><p>Joss allowed her to redirect the focus from her and Tate\u2019s relationship, and Joss motioned for the waiter hovering nearby. The women ordered and then spent the rest of lunch laughing and catching up.</p><p>But Joss\u2019s thoughts drifted time and time again to Dash. And when she\u2019d fully cement their relationship by offering him the words. I love you. Such simple words, and yet they terrified her because it signaled a whole different level of vulnerability for her.</p><p>She thought Dash cared for her very deeply. Perhaps he had for a long time, judging by his past comments. But he hadn\u2019t told her he loved her. Perhaps he was merely waiting for her to say it first. He\u2019d already risked so much, and she could understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to put himself out there before knowing exactly where she stood.</p><p>If he could do so much for her and be so patient while she got her head together, the least she could do was take the first step and put everything on the line.</p><p>But what if he didn\u2019t believe her? What if it was too soon and too fast? Would he think she was so caught up in the moment that her emotions ruled all else?</p><p>Her brow furrowed in concentration. Chessy and Kylie both looked curiously at her but neither spoke, though question was obvious in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him when we aren\u2019t making love,\u201d Joss declared and then promptly blushed to the roots of her hair as she realized how far her outburst had carried.</p><p>Chessy and Kylie laughed and then Joss joined in, not caring who heard her.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Chessy drawled. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do for him to miss your declaration because he was too caught up in the moment when his dick is ruling his brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake, Chessy,\u201d Kylie muttered.</p><p>Chessy shrugged. \u201cNot saying it\u2019s a bad thing. Sometimes men are better off when they let their dicks do their thinking for them. You get better results that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him tonight,\u201d Joss said impulsively, suddenly eager to share her feelings with Dash.</p><p>She sobered momentarily as she silently regarded her two best friends. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find love again. I thought I\u2019d used my only shot at finding my soul mate with Carson. But Dash . . . I love him. Is it possible to find perfection twice in a lifetime?\u201d</p><p>Chessy and Kylie both smiled softly at her.</p><p>\u201cYou just answered your own question, girlfriend,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cYou love him. So I guess you did find your second soul mate.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>JOSS flew around the kitchen, making sure dinner was prepared at just the right moment. Dash had called a mere five minutes ago and he would be home in ten. Which meant she only had a few minutes to set the table, plate the steaks and sides, before hurrying into the living room to wait for him na**d and kneeling.</p><p>His welcome would be brief or dinner would be kept waiting and end up cold. But she had plans for tonight. She wanted it to be special even if they veered momentarily from him controlling all aspects of their relationship.</p><p>Tonight she wanted to be granted the opportunity to do for him. She wanted to direct the events. An intimate dinner. And then she wanted to tell him she loved him. Before they made love. She wanted him to be sure of her. To know she wasn\u2019t caught up in the moment and overcome and wouldn\u2019t be blurting out words she didn\u2019t mean.</p><p>How would he react? It was the question that had burned in her mind ever since lunch with Chessy and Kylie. And would he return the words? She knew in her heart that he loved her. Had likely loved her a long time. She hoped he\u2019d greet her declaration with joy and relief and they could move forward in a more solid, permanent relationship.</p><p>It befuddled her that just weeks earlier she\u2019d greeted the anniversary of her husband\u2019s death with sadness and resignation that she was doomed to a loveless existence and that she could only hope to fill the aching void with sex and dominance. But she hadn\u2019t expected . . . love.</p><p>And she certainly hadn\u2019t expected a longtime friend, her husband\u2019s best friend, to be the one whom she fell in love with.</p><p>A wide, goofy grin split her lips and she took the sizzling steaks off the stovetop grill and plated both. Next, she took out the potatoes and plated them while laying out all the condiments.</p><p>Checking her watch, she realized she had barely two minutes, perhaps less if there had been no traffic. She flew to the bedroom and quickly disrobed, taking a moment to straighten her hair. Then she went back into the living room and not a moment too soon because she heard Dash pull into the drive.</p><p>She sank to her knees, her entire body trembling. Her nerves were coiled tight and she was jittery with anticipation. This could be the best\u2014or worst\u2014night of her life. She was praying for the best.</p><p>The door opened and there he was, filling the living room with his larger-than-life presence. His smile was immediate when his gaze fell on her, and he strode toward her but then he stopped just in front of her and sniffed the air appreciatively.</p><p>Then he leaned down and pulled her up and into his arms. He kissed her long and leisurely, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s cooking, honey? It smells wonderful. I swear, every day coming home to you is better than the last. I don\u2019t know how you keep topping the day before, but somehow you manage it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled broadly, wrapping her arms around his neck to pull him down for another kiss.</p><p>\u201cSteaks and baked potatoes. I have something special planned for this evening. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cDo I get any hints?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNope. You\u2019ll just have to play along.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at her. \u201cIn that case, lead on. I\u2019m yours to command.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, lacing their fingers together in a familiar gesture. They often touched, even in not so intimate ways. She had gotten used to having him close at all times. His open affection. She loved it\u2014and him.</p><p>She led him into the dining room, where the places were set. Candles were lit and she left the overhead lights off, with just the light from the next room casting an intimate glow over the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was so natural for her to be wearing nothing now that she gave it no thought as she slid into the chair catty-corner to his at the head of the table. She was na**d and waiting every day that he came home, and more often than not, they had dinner together with her wearing nothing.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he murmured as she began to cut into her steak. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more I\u2019d like than to feed you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, allowing him to cut her steak into bite-size portions. He dressed her potato just like she liked it and then fed her the first bite of the tender meat.</p><p>He alternated feeding her a bite and taking one of his own. They didn\u2019t converse. Heavy silence had fallen over the couple, but they never once broke their gazes, never looked away. Dash seemed to sense the importance of tonight. There was an air of expectation, and he seemed eager to get through dinner and onto whatever it was she had planned.</p> <p>She smiled to herself. She wouldn\u2019t make him wait long. Normally they\u2019d watch television or a movie in the living room, she curled against him while he stroked her body or hair. He said he loved simply touching her, just being with her and sharing her company.</p><p>Other nights they\u2019d sit on his back porch with a bottle of wine and talk about his day. How Jensen was working out and Kylie was grudgingly accepting her new boss.</p><p>But tonight she planned an early bedtime. She wanted to be in his arms when she told him she loved him and then she wanted to make love to him. She wanted to be the bold one. She wanted to show him the depth of her feelings for him. She only hoped he allowed it.</p><p>\u201cJust leave the dishes,\u201d she said huskily when they\u2019d finished. \u201cI\u2019ll clear them away later. Right now I want us to go into the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Dash lifted one eyebrow, his eyes going dark and smoky with desire.</p> <p>\u201cNever let it be said I denied my darling anything.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, allowing her love to shine in her eyes. He may wonder, but tonight she\u2019d remove all doubt. It was time. Past time to take the next step. Hold her breath and take the leap.</p><p>She held out her hand, mimicking his actions of the past when he always held out his hand for her, usually to obey one of his commands. Tonight she was issuing the demands, however shyly done.</p><p>His hands roamed over her body as they walked side by side to the bedroom. It was as if he couldn\u2019t keep himself from touching her. Like he was as addicted to her as she was to him.</p><p>When they entered the bedroom, she led him to the bed and pushed him down until he was perched on the edge. He stared at her with blatant curiosity but remained silent, allowing her free rein.</p><p>Then she sank to her knees between his open thighs and gathered his hands in hers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to tell you, Dash. Something important. And I wanted it to be at the perfect moment. When we weren\u2019t making love. When we weren\u2019t so caught up in the moment because I wanted you to know how much I mean these words.\u201d</p><p>The hope and fear in his eyes was nearly her undoing. He looked as though he was torn between the two emotions and afraid to put his faith in the outcome.</p><p>She lifted his hands to her mouth, pressing a kiss to those gentle hands.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dash,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>The instant joy that flooded his eyes was all the response she needed. His shoulders sagged and he closed his eyes as if savoring the moment. When they opened, there was a sheen of moisture, shocking her with the intensity of his reaction, his emotions.</p><p>\u201cGod, Joss,\u201d he choked out. \u201cIf you only knew how long I\u2019ve dreamed of this moment.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her into his arms, lifting until she was in his lap, cradled against his chest. He held her tightly as if fearing she would slip away. He pressed kisses to her head, her temple, and then turned her face to kiss her eyes, her nose, her cheeks, every inch of her skin he could cover.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darling. God, I love you. I love you so much I ache with it. It\u2019s been killing me not knowing, hoping that you felt the same for me as I feel for you. Have felt for you for so very long. Are you certain, Joss? Are you ready for this?\u201d</p> <p>Anxiety crept into his gaze as he awaited her response. She smiled, allowing the full force of her own joy and relief to bleed into her expression.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cDo you really love me, Dash? Truly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, if I loved you any more, I\u2019d die with it. You have no idea how very long I\u2019ve loved you, ached for you, wanted you with my every breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen neither of us has to hurt any longer,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m yours, Dash. Completely and utterly yours. I always will be, if you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d he asked hoarsely, incredulously. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ll take you any damn way I can get you. But I want you to be sure that this is what you want. Not just me, but our relationship. My dominance. Your submission. Because if it\u2019s not what you want long term, then it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. There is no sacrifice too great to make for you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened and tears glittered in her own eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a single thing about you\u2014us. I want you just the way you are. I want us just the way we are right now. I want this, darling. I want us. I need your dominance. I want it with my every breath. It\u2019s a part of me now, the best part. Never change, Dash. Never feel that you have to change for me. Because I want you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her to him, his breaths coming raggedly, blowing over her hair. He trembled against her as if overcome with emotion. And then he kissed her again and again, like he was starved for her love. As though he needed it as desperately as she needed his love.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor the first time, truly make love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you never have to ask me for,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cBut honey, it\u2019s always been lovemaking from my point of view. No matter what we\u2019ve done and will do, it\u2019s always been with love. Always. That will never change.\u201d</p><p>He rolled with her, tumbling her to the bed even as he fumbled with his clothing, pulling and tearing at them impatiently as she lay on the bed waiting. His na**d body covered hers, their legs twining, his erection cradled in the apex of her thighs.</p><p>The words made a difference. She hadn\u2019t considered how much, but it made all the difference. Now that the words had been spoken, there was an urgency\u2014and tenderness\u2014that hadn\u2019t been there before. Not that Dash had ever been anything but wonderful with her, but now there was so much more.</p><p>He kissed her passionately, taking her breath away and then returning it as their breaths mingled. He murmured his love between each kiss, and she savored the exquisite sensation of feeling that all-consuming love again. She\u2019d never believed she could find it again, and she\u2019d been so very wrong.</p><p>Dash was all she could hope for. She\u2019d never want for anything else in her life. As long as she could have him. God forbid she ever lost him. She\u2019d never survive losing the love of her life twice.</p><p>And their love was still new, shiny, still so much more to grow and learn. Just as she and Carson had done in the beginning. Their love had happened quickly but it had grown stronger with time, not weaker. She believed with everything in her heart that it would be the same for her and Dash.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited so long for you, Joss,\u201d he whispered against her breasts. He lavished attention on each nipple, coaxing them to rigid peaks. \u201cI never imagined having this. You. Your love. It\u2019s more than I can take in. Swear to me you\u2019ll never leave me. That you\u2019ll be with me forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never leave,\u201d she vowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have me and my love, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her to him again, nudging impatiently between her thighs as he slid, warm and deep, into her welcoming body. His body arched over hers, driving deep. He raised her arms over her head, connecting their hands and holding hers down as he undulated over her again and again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the way you look tonight,\u201d he said in a tender voice. \u201cThe way you looked the first time you said you loved me. I\u2019ll remember this to my dying day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t die anytime soon,\u201d Joss said, pain filling her at the very thought.</p><p>His face was an instant wreath of regret. \u201cThat was thoughtless of me, honey. I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I\u2019ll never leave you willingly. Believe that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know, Dash. I\u2019ll try not to be so sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be any damn way you want to be. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about you, my love.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as he drove deeper still. But his movements were so very gentle and loving. He filled her, withdrew and then slowly and leisurely pressed forward again. Her orgasm, not as sharp as in the past, rose, mellow and smooth, spreading to the depths of her soul. It was a different kind of release. Emotional release and not just physical.</p><p>It was . . . love. And it made all the difference in the world.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Joss. Be with me. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back, Dash. Take us both over.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his forehead to hers, a gesture she loved. He lightly kissed her even as his body shuddered above her and her own release fluttered like the sweetest rain. He let go of her hands and she wrapped both arms around him, holding him close, and they fell over together, consumed by the fires of their love.</p><p>Though it was early, she had no desire to get up. To even move. She was content to remain right here, in his arms, replete. Confident in his love. The future had never looked so bright. She felt as though she could take on the world and that Dash had given her wings back so she could fly.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d she whispered as his body covered hers. \u201cJust like this. Stay inside me. Let me feel you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again and settled his weight more fully on top of her. She stroked her hands up and down his back as they both drifted off into sweet sleep.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>THE dream was even more vivid than before. In her sleep, Joss moaned quietly as she faced Carson and Dash standing side by side. Both men looked expectantly at her, each demanding she make her choice.</p><p>\u201cYou can have me back, baby,\u201d Carson said in the gentle, caring voice he always used with her. She couldn\u2019t remember a time he\u2019d ever raised his voice to her, even in anger.</p><p>They\u2019d had arguments. What married couple didn\u2019t? But he\u2019d never once lost his temper. He hadn\u2019t trusted himself not to lash out physically, as his father had done time and time again.</p><p>\u201cWe can be together again. Just like before. You just have to choose.\u201d</p><p>Dash stood silently to the side looking as though he\u2019d already lost. There was resignation in his eyes, and he began to turn away, much as Carson had done in her previous dream.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried. \u201cDon\u2019t go, Dash. I want . . . you.\u201d</p><p>Carson\u2019s look of shock ripped her heart in two. She could scarcely believe she\u2019d chosen Dash over her beloved husband. Then sadness gripped his features and he glanced over at Dash.</p><p>\u201cTake care of her,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cLove her as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I do,\u201d Dash said.</p><p>Then he reached for Joss and she took a hesitant step forward. Then another and another until she was in his arms. When she glanced in Carson\u2019s direction, he was gone, fading until it was as if he had never been there.</p><p>\u201cCarson,\u201d she whispered brokenly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Then she glanced up at Dash, offering him reassurance. That she\u2019d chosen him. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>DASH slowly came awake, the memory of the previous night fresh and vivid in his mind. He smiled, reaching for Joss, fully intending to make love to her all over again. But when he turned to her, he froze because she had a fretful look on her face and she was shaking her head, a low moan escaping her lips.</p><p>Her next words paralyzed him. Cut him to the core, slicing open his heart and draining away all the optimism he\u2019d awakened with.</p><p>\u201cCarson,\u201d she whispered in a tortured voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d There was a short pause and then, \u201cI love you. You.\u201d</p><p>Irrational anger seized him. Hurt and betrayal pounded through his veins. Goddamn it. Would Carson forever be between them? Would she never be able to let him go?</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open and she looked up at him in sleepy confusion. Then her brow furrowed as she saw the evidence of his fury.</p><p>\u201cDash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you realize who\u2019s in bed with you,\u201d he said in an icy tone.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d She pushed up to her elbow, her hair falling like a curtain over her shoulders. \u201cDash, why are you so angry?\u201d</p><p>The hurt confusion in her voice just pissed him off even more.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let him go,\u201d Dash said harshly. \u201cWithin hours of telling me you love me, you\u2019re dreaming of him. Telling him you love him in your dream and apologizing, for fuck\u2019s sake. For what? Cheating on him? Being disloyal to a dead man? Here\u2019s a piece of information for you, Joss. Carson is dead. He\u2019s not coming back. He left you and he\u2019s not coming back. Get over it and deal with it.\u201d</p><p>She went utterly pale, staring at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never measure up,\u201d he continued brutally, driven to make her hurt every bit as much as he was hurting. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being a poor substitute for the man you lost, the man you can\u2019t have. I\u2019ll be damned if I do it any longer. I\u2019ve been patient. I\u2019ve been understanding. I\u2019ve given you everything you\u2019ve asked for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were never a substitute,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to have a third person in our bed, Joss. A dead man at that. It\u2019s occurred to me that any man would have done for you. You don\u2019t want to move on. You just want someone to f**k you and play master to your submissive. Hell, it would have been just any man, or don\u2019t you remember that night at The House? It\u2019s obvious you weren\u2019t particular and any dick would have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she choked out, tears clouding her eyes and knotting her throat. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to lie here while you say things to purposely hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said savagely. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you hurt a tenth as much as I\u2019ve hurt over the last years. I\u2019m tired of trying to live up to a dead man\u2019s memory. When are you going to accept that he\u2019s gone? Jesus, Joss, even your safe word is a reminder of him. As if you need him to protect you from me. He\u2019s constantly between us because you put him there and I can\u2019t continue this lie any longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying we\u2019re over?\u201d she asked, her voice cracking, much like his own heart was shattering. \u201cAfter I told you I loved you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go on like this any longer, Joss. I\u2019ve wasted far too much time waiting for something that will evidently never happen. I can\u2019t continue putting my life on hold for a woman who will never truly be mine. I deserve better. You deserve better. And until you can put the past behind you for good and let go and move on, we don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand roughly through his hair, frustrated, heartbroken and pissed.</p><p>Joss pushed herself up and hugged her knees together protectively, and it killed him that she thought she needed protection against him. But then hadn\u2019t he just ripped her into the same shreds she\u2019d ripped him into?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would be so callous,\u201d she said, tears slipping down her cheeks. \u201cYou demanded my trust, expected it and would accept no less, but it\u2019s obvious you haven\u2019t given me that same trust you\u2019ve demanded. I can\u2019t be with a man who demands everything from me but gives nothing of himself in return. And certainly not his trust.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s that then,\u201d he said savagely, furious that she was making him feel guilt that he shouldn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t the one holding back. He wasn\u2019t the one refusing to let go of the past.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cJust get out. Go to work. Do whatever it is you do. But leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my house, goddamn it.\u201d</p><p>She went even paler and then rolled from the bed, scrambling for clothing. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Dash. This is your house. Your home. Not mine. It\u2019s never been mine. I haven\u2019t been allowed in. It\u2019s you putting barriers between us, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he bit out. \u201cDon\u2019t kill yourself getting your stuff. I\u2019m out of here. You\u2019ll have the day to do whatever the hell it is you want to do.\u201d</p><p>With that he strode to the closet, yanking out pants and a shirt, not bothering with a shower. He needed to get out before he said or did worse. Before he did something really stupid like get on his knees and beg her forgiveness. Like telling her it didn\u2019t matter if he could never have all of her, that he\u2019d take whatever she had to give. He\u2019d once thought that he could be satisfied with any part of her. Any part at all. He\u2019d thought that something was better than nothing.</p> <p>He was wrong.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014settle for anything less than one hundred percent of her.</p><p>Joss maintained her composure only until Dash slammed out of the house and then she fell to her knees, burying her face in her hands as sobs tore from her throat.</p><p>How could he love her and say all the horrible things he\u2019d said? She\u2019d been so careful not to put Carson between them. Since they\u2019d gotten together she\u2019d stopped mentioning Carson at all. When before they talked easily about a man they both loved. Now? It was as if Carson never existed because they never brought him up.</p><p>Dash didn\u2019t trust her. She\u2019d been right. For all he demanded of her, he hadn\u2019t given her the same in return. It wasn\u2019t fair. She\u2019d given him everything. Her trust. Her love. Her submission. And he\u2019d vowed to cherish that gift. To protect her. And yet he\u2019d torn her apart with bitter, careless words.</p><p>There was no going back. No undoing what had been said. His words rang in her ears, would always ring in her ears. No amount of wishing would make their memory go away.</p><p>She had to get out. Couldn\u2019t stay here a minute longer. She frantically began stuffing her belongings in her suitcases and went about systematically ridding the entire house of her presence.</p><p>But the things Dash had bought her, gifts, jewelry, clothing? She left it all neatly piled on his bed so he would see it when he returned and know she didn\u2019t take a damn thing with her. She didn\u2019t want it. She couldn\u2019t be bought. Not when she\u2019d been willing to give him everything freely and without conditions.</p> <p>She fumbled with her cell phone, punching Chessy\u2019s number in with shaking fingers. She needed a shoulder to cry on. Needed someone who would understand the turmoil she was going through.</p><p>\u201cHey, girlfriend. How\u2019s it going? Did you tell Dash the big news?\u201d</p><p>A low sob welled from her throat.</p><p>\u201cJoss? What the hell is wrong? Are you crying? What\u2019s happened? Where are you? Are you all right?\u201d Chessy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d Joss choked out. \u201cAre you home? Can I come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, honey. I\u2019m here. But you sound so upset. Where are you? I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joss said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ll come to you. I\u2019ll explain everything when I get there. Give me half an hour, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d Chessy said firmly. \u201cBe careful, Joss. And when you get here I want to know exactly what happened, and you don\u2019t leave a word out.\u201d</p><p>Joss agreed and then ended the call. She made another sweep of the house, making sure she hadn\u2019t overlooked anything. And then she made three trips, hauling her luggage out to her car.</p><p>When the last suitcase was stuffed into the passenger seat, she turned and stared back at Dash\u2019s house one last time. A house she\u2019d considered her home for a brief, beautiful period of time. Now? It represented hell.</p><p>She pulled out of Dash\u2019s neighborhood driving much too fast. She eased off the accelerator, not wanting to be reckless and take unnecessary risks. She pounded the wheel in frustration when an accident ahead backed traffic up. She turned onto another street, intending to cut over and drive around the park. It was longer, but with the slowdown in traffic, it would take her the same amount of time, and she wouldn\u2019t be stuck in stop-and-go traffic.</p><p>She just wanted to be at Chessy\u2019s, where she could pour out her grief to someone who loved her. It felt as if the rug had been yanked from underneath her and she supposed it had. After a night when the future had seemed so utterly perfect, it was now a gaping, yawning black hole stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see the child dart into the street chasing a ball until it was too late. Horrified that she could hurt or kill the little girl, she yanked the steering wheel as hard as she could, not even having time to slam on the brakes.</p><p>She hit the curb hard enough to blow out her front tire, and as she looked up, she saw the sprawling oak tree dead ahead. There was nothing she could do. Her tiny convertible hit the tree with a sickening crunch of metal and the sharp sound of shattering glass. Her head slammed forward as the air bags exploded in her face. Pain registered and as she blinked, blood slid down her forehead, clouding her vision.</p><p>She wondered if she\u2019d live just as she blacked out and floated away in a sea of nothingness.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>DASH stared broodingly out his office window and replayed the morning\u2019s events over and over. Had he overreacted? Part of him said yeah. The other part, the practical, unemotional part, said no, that he\u2019d been right to be angry. And certainly he had no right to lash out at her like that, to hurt her so badly.</p><p>But damn it, enough was enough. What should have been the best night of his entire life, the culmination of an impossible dream, had ended in his worst nightmare. Maybe it had always been an impossibility. Perhaps Joss wasn\u2019t ready\u2014would never be ready\u2014to let go.</p><p>So where did that leave him? A week ago he would have vowed that he would be satisfied with any part of her. That he would wait, be patient for her to come around and hope that eventually she would be in a place where she could give him back in full measure what he was willing to give her.</p><p>But when she\u2019d told him she loved him, and then wept for her husband the morning after, he\u2019d been seized by a fatalistic sensation that she would never truly be his. His hopes had been crushed in that one instant, and he\u2019d reacted much like a wounded animal. Hell, he was wounded. The kind of wound one never recovered from.</p><p>His office door burst open and he turned, irritated over the interruption. To his surprise Tate strode inside, his expression angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to Joss?\u201d Tate demanded.</p><p>Dash sighed. \u201cThat didn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is that supposed to mean? Chessy is worried out of her mind. Where is Joss? What happened between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Why are you asking me where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause apparently you were the last person who saw her,\u201d Tate said through gritted teeth. \u201cShe called Chessy in hysterics over two hours ago. She was upset and crying but she wouldn\u2019t tell Chessy what was wrong. She asked Chessy if she could come over, that she needed her, and that she would be there in half an hour. She didn\u2019t show and Chessy can\u2019t get an answer on her cell number, her home number or your home number for that matter. She sent me to drag your ass out of your cave since you aren\u2019t answering your cell either.\u201d</p><p>Dash paled, dread gripping his insides. \u201cI don\u2019t know where she is. She was at my house . . . in my bed when I left.\u201d He winced, closing his eyes. \u201cOr at least she was in my bed, but she would have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would she have left?\u201d Tate growled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your f**king business,\u201d Dash said icily.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not! Chessy is home worried sick about her. Hell, the only way I could get her to stay her ass at home and not run out to look for her is by promising to find her myself. Joss is not the hysterical or irresponsible type, so if she was that upset and she\u2019s missing, then something is damn well wrong.\u201d</p><p>The knot grew larger in Dash\u2019s throat. Panic slid down his spine, momentarily paralyzing him.</p><p>\u201cI said some pretty terrible things to her,\u201d Dash murmured. \u201cJesus. When I left, she was crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left her that upset?\u201d Tate asked in a disgusted voice.</p><p>Dash closed his eyes. \u201cI was pretty pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask because the only thing I give a f**k about is my wife worrying herself sick over Joss and whether Joss herself is all right. I take it you haven\u2019t heard from her.\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cShe pretty much told me to go to hell. But I\u2019m already there. I have been for years.\u201d</p><p>Tate\u2019s phone rang and he snatched it up. \u201cChessy?\u201d he said. \u201cIs she okay? Did you hear from her?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause and then Tate paled. Dash rushed to where Tate stood, trying to hear Chessy\u2019s voice, but Tate held it too close to his ear for Dash to tell anything.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it. No, you aren\u2019t going anywhere. No, Chessy! I\u2019ll be right over. Don\u2019t you dare leave the house. One accident is enough. I don\u2019t want you driving when you\u2019re this upset.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s knees buckled and he had to grab his desk to keep from hitting the floor.</p><p>Tate hung up and then fixed Dash with a cold stare.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital just called Chessy. Apparently they saw she was the last call on Joss\u2019s cell and they called her. Joss has been in a car accident. It appears to be serious. They wouldn\u2019t comment on her condition over the phone, but they asked that Chessy or her closest family member get to the hospital as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Dash bit out. \u201cWhat hospital? I can be there before you go home and get Chessy.\u201d</p><p>Tate looked at him, anger brewing in his eyes. Then he blew out his breath. \u201cHermann Memorial. The ER.\u201d</p><p>Dash didn\u2019t wait for anything more. He grabbed his keys and ran out the door to the bank of elevators. Kylie called out as he passed her office, but he didn\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t have time to explain, even if Kylie should know. Chessy would call her later. For now, his only purpose was to get to Joss and pray he wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>WHEN Dash strode into the emergency room, he immediately demanded to know Joss\u2019s condition and if he could see her. A police officer was standing close to the reception desk, and when he heard Dash say Joss\u2019s name, he motioned for Dash.</p><p>Frustrated by the delay, he stepped aside with the cop.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how she is?\u201d Dash asked bluntly. \u201cDid you work the scene? What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>The police officer sighed. \u201cCan I ask the nature of your relationship to Mrs. Breckenridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her fianc\u00e9,\u201d he lied. \u201cShe lives with me.\u201d Another lie. \u201cI saw her just this morning, not long before this apparently happened. I left for work and now this.\u201d At least that much was the truth.</p><p>\u201cWas she upset about anything? Under duress? Stressed?\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cDo you have any reason to believe that she\u2019s suicidal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dash asked incredulously. \u201cWhat the f**k are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>The cop looked uncomfortable. \u201cThere were no signs of tire marks to indicate she braked. She hit a tree dead-on. Going at least forty-five miles per hour in a residential zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think she tried to kill herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m examining all possible leads. Until I speak to Mrs. Breckenridge myself, there\u2019s no way to determine the cause of the accident. But you could help by letting me know her emotional state when you last saw her. I understand she\u2019s widowed. Could she be depressed over the loss of her husband?\u201d</p> <p>Dash was at a loss for words. Her emotional state? She was upset. Extremely so. Hell, he\u2019d all but kicked her out of his house. And then she\u2019d wrecked. Good God. Could she have done it purposely? How the hell else would she hit a tree dead-on going that fast and no signs of braking?</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Dash said numbly. He\u2019d like to be able to defend Joss, but who the hell knew what was going on in her head?</p><p>Guilt clutched him like a fist. He should have never left her this morning. He\u2019d been angry, absolutely. But he should have calmed down, and they should have discussed it like two rational adults. Only he hadn\u2019t been rational. Whether or not she\u2019d tried to take her own life, the entire thing was Dash\u2019s fault.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t contain his fury that she would have given up. Have been so weak. That wasn\u2019t the Joss he knew. Or thought he knew.</p><p>He turned from the police officer and strode back to the desk, planting his hands down on the surface.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see Joss Breckenridge. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, the doctors are working on her now. If you\u2019ll wait in the waiting area, I\u2019ll call you back the minute you\u2019re allowed to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018working on her\u2019?\u201d Dash demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her? How badly is she injured? Is she going to live?\u201d</p><p>The clerk\u2019s face shone with sympathy. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard waiting and not knowing, but I assure you, our physicians are doing their absolute best, and as I said, the moment I know anything I\u2019ll inform you at once.\u201d</p><p>Dash threw up his hands and paced back into the waiting area, but he couldn\u2019t sit. How could he? It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Another day. Three years ago. Same hospital. Same horrible wait only for the worst news. Carson dead. They\u2019d been unable to save him. His injuries had been too extensive.</p><p>Only his wreck had been an accident. There\u2019d been nothing he could have done to avoid it. Could Joss say the same? Had she been so upset and distraught that she\u2019d driven her car into a tree hoping for death?</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around it. Couldn\u2019t fathom it. But it was what the police suspected. Why else would they want to know if she was suicidal? What if Dash had pushed her to it?</p><p>He finally sat and buried his face in his hands. What seemed an eternity later, a nurse poked her head out the door and called for Joss Breckenridge\u2019s family. As he was the only one there at the moment, he hurried forward.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The nurse smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019s pretty banged up, but you can see her. She\u2019s a little woozy from the pain medication we gave her, but we couldn\u2019t medicate her until all the X-rays and CT scan results came back.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give a f**k what condition she was in as long as she was alive.</p><p>The nurse led him back to one of the exam rooms and then opened the door, allowing him entrance. He sucked in his breath when he saw Joss lying on the stretcher, pale and bruised. There was dried blood at her hairline and at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>She looked so damn fragile that he was afraid to touch her.</p><p>He went to her bedside and fury gripped him all over again. She blinked drowsily and then focused her gaze on him. Instant hurt crowded the silky depths and she turned away. It only pissed him off all the more.</p> <p>\u201cYou little fool,\u201d he hissed. \u201cDid you try to kill yourself, Joss? Was life without Carson so unbearable that you tried to join him?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze yanked back to him, fury replacing the hurt of just moments ago.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t want you here. I don\u2019t want you anywhere near me. Go to hell, Dash. That\u2019s apparently where you\u2019re most comfortable. God knows, I\u2019ve only kept you there and nothing I do changes that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I have a damn answer,\u201d he seethed. \u201cYou scared ten years off my life, Joss. What the f**k did you think you were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I was doing was avoiding a child,\u201d she said in a frigid tone. \u201cShe ran into the street, and I knew I\u2019d hit her if I didn\u2019t swerve. I never saw the tree. Didn\u2019t care about the tree. All I cared about was missing her. I could have never lived with myself if I\u2019d chosen my life over hers. I was upset and wasn\u2019t paying attention. I should have seen her earlier. I didn\u2019t. But I\u2019ll be damned if she was going to pay for my mistake with her life.\u201d</p><p>All the breath left him in a rush. He sagged precariously and gripped the bed rail for support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your apology,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cI want you out. I don\u2019t want to see you again, Dash. You said all you needed to say this morning. And you know what? It was all bullshit. But you wouldn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she spat. \u201cDon\u2019t call me anything at all. I\u2019ve been feeling so guilty because I\u2019ve all but forgotten Carson. A man who meant everything to me. A man I loved with all my heart and who loved me every bit as much. I was married to him, Dash, and you resent that. You\u2019ve always resented that. You accuse me of continually putting him between us, but I never have. You did. You. Not me. You, damn it. You couldn\u2019t let go because of your own insecurities.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago I had a dream. One that upset me greatly. Because in that dream, I had a choice. I could have Carson back or I could stay with you. And I couldn\u2019t choose. God, I felt so guilty because I\u2019d always said I\u2019d do anything at all for just one more day with Carson. If I could have him back, I\u2019d never ask for anything more. But I didn\u2019t choose him. I hesitated. And he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Dash felt like throwing up. He gripped the bed rail even tighter as he listened to the words that would damn him forever. He\u2019d jumped to conclusions. Horrible conclusions. And Joss had paid a heavy price. Hell, he\u2019d paid the heaviest price of all because he\u2019d lost her when he\u2019d finally had her. And he\u2019d thrown it all away in a moment\u2019s time when he could have simply asked her what she\u2019d been thinking, dreaming.</p><p>\u201cAnd then last night, I had the same dream. Carson spoke to me. He said we could be together. But I chose this time,\u201d she choked out. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t choose him. I chose you.\u201d</p><p>Dash closed his eyes, tears burning the lids. What could he possibly say to any of that? How could he ever make up for the terrible things he\u2019d said to her? The things he\u2019d accused her of.</p><p>\u201cI gave you everything, Dash,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cMy love. My submission. My trust. What did you give me? You may have given me sex, but you didn\u2019t give me love or trust. Because you can\u2019t love someone you don\u2019t trust. Not truly. And you haven\u2019t trusted me from the start. You\u2019ve continually put Carson between us. Do you know that I wouldn\u2019t even bring him up in conversation? Before we were together I never thought twice about it. He was my husband and your best friend. It\u2019s only natural that you were the one person I could speak with about him. But you took even that away because I knew you didn\u2019t like it. So you tell me, Dash. What the hell did you sacrifice for me? Because the way I see it, I\u2019m the one who made all the compromises and sacrifices.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, flinching in pain that the movement caused.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t even get into the horrid accusation you just launched at me. You obviously don\u2019t think much of me at all or you would have never thought, even for a moment, that I\u2019d purposely crash my car. Especially when that\u2019s how Carson died. Even if I were that bent on self-destruction, I\u2019d never cause my loved ones the kind of pain I went through when I lost Carson.\u201d</p><p>Each word was a tiny dart that directly hit his heart. She was right. Every word the absolute truth. It shamed him to realize just how wrong he\u2019d been. From the very start. She was right. He hadn\u2019t trusted her. He\u2019d been so insecure, so worried that he could never have her that when she\u2019d given herself to him he hadn\u2019t trusted in that gift because he\u2019d been too afraid of losing it. Of losing her. He\u2019d been so damn wrapped up in his fears that he hadn\u2019t recognized the beautiful gift he\u2019d been given until it was too late. God, it couldn\u2019t be too late. He wouldn\u2019t allow it to be. Whatever he had to do to make it right, he\u2019d do.</p><p>He opened his mouth to apologize. To get down on his knees if necessary. Anything to gain her forgiveness and another chance at her love. But the door burst open and Chessy and Tate hurried in.</p><p>Tate took one look at Joss\u2019s face and turned his black scowl on Dash.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Tate demanded.</p><p>Chessy rushed to Joss\u2019s bedside and Tate pushed in front of Dash, effectively barring him from Joss\u2019s sight. Chessy grabbed Joss\u2019s hand, the one that wasn\u2019t bandaged. Dash only now noticed the cast on her left arm and his insides froze. He hadn\u2019t even asked her condition. How seriously she was injured. He was just so goddamn relieved that she was alive that nothing else had mattered.</p><p>Tate bent over, pulling her into a gentle hug. Joss buried her face in Tate\u2019s neck and gripped Chessy\u2019s hand for dear life.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Joss choked out, her voice aching with tears. \u201cJust make him go. I don\u2019t want to see him now. Just make him leave. Please. I can\u2019t bear it any longer.\u201d</p><p>The fact she was begging, something Dash had sworn she\u2019d never have to do, flayed him open until he was bleeding on the inside.</p><p>Tate carefully let her go and then rounded on Dash, fury glinting in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet the f**k away from her. You\u2019re only hurting her more. I swear to God, Dash. I don\u2019t know what the f**k your problem is or why you insist on kicking her when she\u2019s down, but that shit is going to stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving her,\u201d Dash said emphatically. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want me in her room, fine. But I\u2019m not leaving this hospital until I know exactly what\u2019s wrong with her and how long it\u2019ll take for her to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll recover a hell of a lot quicker without you upsetting her,\u201d Chessy said in a furious voice. \u201cGet out or I swear I\u2019ll make Tate throw you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim and what goddamn army?\u201d Dash said frigidly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call security if I have to,\u201d Tate said in a low voice. \u201cYou aren\u2019t helping, Dash. Look at her. Take a good look at what you\u2019ve done. She\u2019s in tears and she\u2019s hurting. Stop being such a selfish bastard and for once do the right thing and leave.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s face was turned away as though she didn\u2019t want Dash to see her tears. But how could he miss them? Trailing down her cheeks in silent, silver trails. His gut clenched and grief overwhelmed him. Not even Carson\u2019s death had devastated him as much as Joss lying there, hurt, grieving. Because of him.</p><p>He\u2019d sworn never to be a source of pain or anguish to her. And yet he\u2019d done just that. He was the reason she was lying in a hospital bed, bloody, with broken bones and bruises. And he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever get over that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said, barely able to keep his own tears at bay. \u201cBut I\u2019m not giving up, Joss. You may have thought I did, but I didn\u2019t. I was an ass. I was a complete bastard to you, but I swear if you\u2019ll give me the chance, I\u2019ll make it up to you. I\u2019ll make it right between us, honey.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t acknowledge his heartfelt declaration. She kept her eyes tightly shut as Chessy hugged and soothed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Kylie,\u201d Dash murmured. \u201cShe\u2019ll want to be here. She loves you. I love you, Joss.\u201d</p><p>At that, Joss turned, fire in her eyes. \u201cNever say that again,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you to lie, Dash. You\u2019ve always been honest. Painfully so. So don\u2019t change now.\u201d</p><p>Dash pushed past a protesting Tate and leaned in so he could look Joss in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI have never lied to you, darling. And I don\u2019t intend to start now. I said and did some horrible things. I hurt you and I\u2019ll never forgive myself for that. But I love you. I\u2019ve loved you for f**king ever. That will never change. I\u2019ll go because it\u2019s what you want. And I\u2019ll give you time to recover. But goddamn it, Joss, I\u2019m not giving up on us. And I won\u2019t let you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never gave us a chance,\u201d she said in an achingly sad, forlorn voice.</p><p>It cut him to the quick and left him without a response. He stepped back from her bed and slowly, painfully turned to walk out the door.</p><p>She was wrong. She was right and she was wrong. He may not have given them a chance before, but he wasn\u2019t giving up. He\u2019d move heaven and earth and go to hell and back if that\u2019s what it took to make her his forever.</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>JOSS stared sightlessly from the window of the guest bedroom where she was staying\u2014and recovering\u2014at Chessy\u2019s house. Kylie was by every day after work, worried about her. Both her friends were concerned, as was Tate. Not about her injuries. They were minor and would mend with time. Her heart was another matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pain was back, throbbing in the background, but she lacked the energy to get up to down one of the painkillers the doctor had prescribed. She\u2019d fractured two ribs and her left arm. Her arm had only suffered a hairline fracture, not a complete break. She\u2019d be out of the cast in four weeks.</p><p>Her head had struck something\u2014she still wasn\u2019t sure what\u2014and she had several stitches for a laceration on her scalp. She had facial bruising, and the rest of her body was sore from the impact. Her neck was stiff, a mild case of whiplash, but the doctor had cheerfully informed her she was a very lucky woman.</p><p>So why didn\u2019t she feel lucky? Why hadn\u2019t Carson been as fortunate as she? Why was fate such a fickle bitch as Dash had once described it? Why was she alive and Carson dead?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d wanted to die. No matter what Dash may have originally thought. Yes, it was certainly her fault, and she thanked God on a daily basis that her carelessness hadn\u2019t cost a child her life. But she hadn\u2019t intentionally driven into that tree.</p> <p>She should have let Chessy come and get her like she\u2019d offered. She should have never been behind the wheel of a car in the emotional state she\u2019d been in. Live and learn. At least she had lived to learn that particular lesson.</p><p>\u201cJoss?\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s soft voice came from behind her but Joss couldn\u2019t turn. She still hurt too much so she waited for Chessy to enter.</p><p>Her friend\u2019s concerned face appeared a moment later and she saw that Chessy was holding a glass of water and the bottle of painkillers. It shamed her that she was relieved she didn\u2019t have to get up to get them.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting?\u201d Chessy asked in concern.</p> <p>Joss nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t muster the energy to get up and get them. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Chessy frowned and shook out two of the pills, dropping them into Joss\u2019s right hand. After giving her the glass of water to swallow them, she sat down on the ottoman at Joss\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you, sweetie. Tate and I both are. Hell, so is Kylie. She\u2019s on her way over, by the way. I thought I\u2019d warn you. She sounds . . . determined. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t plan to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Joss smiled. \u201cI love you both. Tate too. You\u2019ve been so good to me. I\u2019m being a complete baby. There\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t go back to my own house, but I appreciate you letting me stay here. I just haven\u2019t wanted to be . . . alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I understand.\u201d Sympathy shone brightly in Chessy\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd you can stay here as long as you like. Tate\u2019s been so busy with work that he hasn\u2019t been home much in the last weeks. Is it horrible of me that I\u2019ve been happy that since your accident he\u2019s been around more? Oh God, don\u2019t answer that. It is horrible of me to think, much less say.\u201d</p><p>Joss laughed. \u201cNo, not at all. I know you\u2019ve been missing him. Is that the reason you\u2019ve been so unhappy, Chessy? Is it work that\u2019s been keeping him so preoccupied?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s only work,\u201d Chessy said in a low voice.</p><p>She looked as though she regretted the words the moment she spoke them. She looked away, as if avoiding the inevitable question in Joss\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s cheating?\u201d Joss whispered. \u201cTalk to me, Chessy. You know you\u2019d never let me get away with not telling you something so important. Hell, you pulled every last detail about what happened between me and Dash from me.\u201d</p><p>Chessy\u2019s smile was rueful. \u201cNo. Yes. I don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s eating me alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to him about it?\u201d</p><p>Chessy slowly shook her head. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s not? Do you know how hurt he\u2019d be if I questioned him? If I displayed a lack of faith in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start with why you think he\u2019d be cheating,\u201d Joss said, glad to have something other than her own failed relationship to discuss. And if she could help her friend, then at least one of them would be happy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any solid evidence that says he is,\u201d Chessy admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he\u2019s been so . . . distant. You know we have a Dominant/submissive relationship, but lately I\u2019m lucky if we manage to have vanilla sex, much less delve into the normal course of our relationship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it possible that he\u2019s just under a lot of stress at work? Ever since he struck out on his own and quit working for Manning-Brown Financial, he\u2019s been crazy busy. Even I can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Chessy muttered. \u201cThe guy he partnered with, the one he left Manning-Brown to form a partnership with, decided to retire. This was only a few months after he and Tate started working together.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know about this? When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>Chessy squeezed Joss\u2019s uninjured hand. \u201cYou were busy with your own stuff. You and Dash. Besides it wasn\u2019t anything worth burdening you over. Nothing has changed really. Tate had always done the bulk of the work anyway, but Mark had brought a lot of affluent clients over to the partnership when they both broke off from their respective firms. So Tate\u2019s been scrambling to keep them all happy because he doesn\u2019t want to lose any of them. So far, only one has left, and he wants to keep it that way. Which means him being at their beck and call all hours of the day, seven days a week.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought a financial planner would be so . . . busy. I mean I know he does a lot, but what could there possibly be for him to do during nonbusiness hours? It\u2019s not as though banks or the stock market are open after hours during the week or on weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cThey call him at all times of the day, sometimes with legitimate concerns, sometimes with the absurd. But it\u2019s Tate\u2019s job to pacify them and reassure them or arrange their finances. He has to walk a very fine line because as I said, he doesn\u2019t want to lose the clients he\u2019s worked so hard to gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to take on another partner to lighten his load?\u201d</p><p>Chessy shrugged. \u201cThat I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t discuss it much with me. He doesn\u2019t want to worry me. I used to love that about him. How he always sheltered me from anything he thought would hurt or worry me. Now? I\u2019d take any form of communication because I feel this gap opening and widening between us and I hate it. I hate it, Joss,\u201d she said, anguish filling her voice.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m probably being silly and I\u2019m overreacting, but I hate this uncertainty. I hate feeling like I don\u2019t matter any longer. And I know that\u2019s not true. I know he loves me. But he doesn\u2019t show me like he used to. I\u2019ve known from the day we met that I was his priority, and it makes me sound self-centered but I love being first and foremost in his mind. I loved that he always made me feel . . . special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t feel special now,\u201d Joss murmured.</p><p>Chessy slowly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy but I\u2019m not happy either. And it\u2019s eating me up on the inside. I keep wondering if this is as good as it gets and if I should be grateful he\u2019s still with me. I don\u2019t like how selfish I feel for wanting more.\u201d</p><p>Joss leaned forward, ignoring the discomfort in her ribs. \u201cYou aren\u2019t selfish,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cSweetie, you are the most unselfish, loving, giving person I know. Why don\u2019t you talk to him about it? Lay it out just like you laid it out to me. I can\u2019t imagine that he wouldn\u2019t listen. That it wouldn\u2019t horrify him to know you feel this way. He loves you so much. I can see it in the way he looks at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I saw the same as you saw,\u201d Chessy said wistfully. \u201cI just want to go back to the way it was when we first met, and maybe that\u2019s not possible. Maybe when you\u2019re with someone as long as we\u2019ve been together, when the newness wears off, you settle into tolerance.\u201d</p><p>Joss shook her head adamantly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a minute. I know Carson and I were only married for three years, but we were as in love at the three-year mark as we were the first year, and you and Tate have only been married a little less than five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Chessy said with a sigh. \u201cMaybe I should just talk to him. But I freeze every time I think I\u2019m going to ask. The words just stay locked in my throat because I know it will hurt him if I ask him if there\u2019s someone else. And the thing is, if nothing is wrong except that he\u2019s occupied with work, my doubt will cause a rift in our relationship that I\u2019m not sure will ever mend.\u201d</p><p>Joss grimaced, knowing Chessy could very well be right. Tate would be horrified if he knew Chessy thought he was having an affair. He might not forgive her doubting him even for a moment. Tate was rigid that way. He was an extremely honorable man and he was utterly protective of Chessy. If someone else was hurting her, Tate would do whatever was necessary to make it end. But what if he was the one hurting her? What then?</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just give it a while. Be patient and understanding. Love him. Show him your love and support and perhaps when things die down a bit at work and he\u2019s more confident that he has everything under control, things will get better,\u201d Joss quietly advised.</p><p>Chessy squeezed her hand again. \u201cThank you. I came up here to check on you and to cheer you up. Not to dump all my woes on you.\u201d</p><p>Joss smiled. \u201cI love you and I\u2019d kick your ass if you ever didn\u2019t come to me with whatever is bothering you. You and Kylie are my best friends. That won\u2019t ever change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Kylie, there she is,\u201d Chessy said brightly, looking beyond Joss to the doorway. Then she cast Joss a quick pleading look not to bring up the subject in front of Kylie.</p><p>Kylie was more of a direct, confrontational person, and if she even thought Tate was cheating on Chessy, she\u2019d go straight to the source and kick his ass.</p><p>Joss squeezed Chessy\u2019s hand back, a silent promise to keep their conversation secret.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joss,\u201d Kylie said, coming over to hug her, though she was careful not to hug too tight. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter now that my personal nurse brought me the pain medication I was too lazy to get up and get for myself,\u201d Joss said dryly.</p><p>Kylie smiled and plopped down on the ottoman beside Chessy. Her gaze swept over Joss as if judging for herself how her sister-in-law fared.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d Joss asked brightly, and then fearing it would be an invitation for Kylie to talk about Dash, she quickly amended her statement. \u201cHow are things with Jensen? Are you two getting along okay now?\u201d</p><p>Kylie made a face. \u201cHe\u2019s an overbearing, rigid ass.\u201d</p><p>Chessy laughed. \u201cSweetie, you just described half the male population, Tate and Dash included.\u201d</p><p>Joss flinched but refused to show any outward emotion over the mention of Dash\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cDash is a walking corpse,\u201d Kylie said bluntly. \u201cThe man hasn\u2019t slept since your accident. I don\u2019t even know why he bothers coming in and going through the motions. Jensen\u2019s had to pick up all the slack, as have I, because he\u2019s worthless.\u201d</p><p>Joss closed her eyes, pain swamping through her that even the strongest medication couldn\u2019t ease. He\u2019d called her a dozen times a day and each time she\u2019d let it go to voice mail. It made her a coward, but she wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with him now. Maybe ever.</p><p>He texted her, e-mailed her and he came to Chessy\u2019s at least once a day, asking to see her. Each time either Tate or Chessy had told him that she was in her room sleeping. A lie. One he\u2019d easily see through but she didn\u2019t want to see him. Maybe ever.</p><p>He was absolutely relentless but then she knew that about him. But he\u2019d gotten what he\u2019d said he most wanted. She\u2019d given him everything. She hadn\u2019t asked him to change who and what he was because he was what she wanted. She\u2019d wanted his dominance, his control, but more than that, she wanted his love and his trust.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t wanted that in the beginning. She hadn\u2019t believed she could ever find a love to match what she\u2019d had with Carson. But Dash had fulfilled her in a way she\u2019d never been fulfilled with Carson, and that hurt to admit. It hurt even more that she\u2019d lost that.</p><p>She\u2019d found perfection twice in a lifetime, and both times she\u2019d lost it all. How was she supposed to recover from that again?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered, pain evident in her voice. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t trust me. How can he say he loves me when he doesn\u2019t trust me? Do you know what he accused me of?\u201d</p><p>Both women shook their heads. Joss hadn\u2019t told them what Dash had said to her in the hospital. The pain from that accusation had yet to fade in the four days she\u2019d been at Chessy\u2019s house. Hiding.</p><p>\u201cHe accused me of trying to kill myself. He asked if I\u2019d purposely driven my car into that tree hoping to die.\u201d</p><p>Chessy and Kylie both sucked in their breaths but thankfully neither held question in their eyes. They didn\u2019t believe it. Thank God. She couldn\u2019t bear it if her dearest friends also harbored doubts as to her mental stability.</p><p>\u201cHe thought that life without Carson was so unbearable that I chose to join him in death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d Chessy said, her voice aching with sympathy and pain. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean it. You scared him. And after your argument he likely felt horribly guilty. He felt responsible for your accident because he upset you so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lashed out at you because the alternative was accepting the blame for what happened,\u201d Kylie said quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a lot of thinking to do,\u201d Joss murmured. \u201cAbout my future. And whether or not it will involve Dash. He says . . . He says he loves me and he wants another chance. He\u2019s called, texted, e-mailed, come by here every single day. He swears he\u2019s not giving up. But I don\u2019t know if I can give him another chance. Without his trust, what do we have? A one-sided relationship, where I give all and he gives nothing in return, is not what I want. Yes, I wanted a dominant man. I wanted to give up power and control. But in return for that, I want his love and his trust. And you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you there,\u201d Chessy said carefully. \u201cBut the question you have to ask yourself is if you can forgive him his mistake. It was an emotional situation all around. You told me what happened that morning, and, sweetie, I am not taking his side, but I can understand why he would have reacted to what he thought you were feeling when you murmured Carson\u2019s name and seemed so heartbroken the morning after you told Dash you loved him.\u201d</p><p>Joss glanced at Kylie, gauging her reaction to Chessy\u2019s statement.</p><p>Kylie sighed. \u201cI admit I had reservations at the start. About all of it. What you wanted, what you said you needed. But I felt a hell of a lot better about it when you ended up with Dash, someone I knew would treat you well and I didn\u2019t have to worry about a total stranger abusing you. But you\u2019re good together, Joss. I never imagined you with anyone other than Carson. You two just fit. But you and Dash are . . . perfect. When he\u2019s not being a total dickhead, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Chessy laughed and Joss smiled, some of the horrible darkness lifting away from her soul.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I knew what to do,\u201d Joss said, rubbing at her aching temples. \u201cI\u2019ve gone over it in my head until I\u2019m dizzy with it. I\u2019m so scared of handing complete control back to him and him hurting me again. I\u2019m tired of hurting. I just want to be . . . happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I once told you, life is about risk,\u201d Chessy said gently. \u201cYou just have to decide which risks are worth it. You\u2019re miserable now. So what\u2019s the difference if you go back to Dash and things don\u2019t work out and you end up miserable then? Either way you\u2019re miserable. But if things work out? You have a shot at bliss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe certainly has a point,\u201d Kylie pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re as much a corpse as Dash is, only he\u2019s walking and you aren\u2019t. How long has it been since you were out of this room, Joss? Have you gotten up even once except to go to the bathroom? You can\u2019t continue like this. Neither of you can. Either make a clean break and end it so you both can move on, or take a chance and put it on the line. You\u2019ll never know until you give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>Joss grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re both right.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere right now. I just took those damn pain pills.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can drive you,\u201d Chessy offered. \u201cJust tell me where you want to go and I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>Joss sucked in a deep breath. Never had she faced such an important decision. It was simple and yet so very complicated. But her friends were right. She was miserable now. She had a shot at happiness. All she had to do was reach out and take it. Risk it all. Prove to Dash that she had let go of the past. That he was the one who couldn\u2019t let go of it.</p><p>Resolve settled over her, removing the blanket of despair that had clung so stubbornly for the last several days. She was not a coward and she wasn\u2019t weak. She\u2019d faced utter devastation twice and she\u2019d survived. She\u2019d survive this, whatever this turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cLet me get dressed and then take me to Dash\u2019s,\u201d Joss said, finally making her decision.</p><p>It scared the holy hell out of her, but she had to try.</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p> <p>\u201cYOU don\u2019t have to do this, darlin\u2019,\u201d Tate said, glancing into his rearview mirror at Joss, who sat in the backseat as he and Chessy drove her to Dash\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Joss said quietly. \u201cThis has to be resolved, Tate. I have to know if we have a chance. If Dash can trust me. If he loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t speak on the trust issue but I know the bastard loves you,\u201d Tate said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man so wasted over a woman. If I wasn\u2019t so pissed at him for hurting you the way he did, I could almost pity the man.\u201d</p><p>Joss smiled faintly.</p><p>As they neared Dash\u2019s house, Chessy turned in her seat and fixed her stare on Joss. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you there with no way home. I don\u2019t want you to have to depend on Dash. I\u2019ll have my phone on me. You call me the minute you\u2019re ready to leave. If I don\u2019t hear from you in an hour, I\u2019m coming back. An hour is long enough to hear him grovel.\u201d</p><p>Joss laughed. \u201cYou seem so certain he\u2019s going to grovel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll grovel,\u201d Tate muttered. \u201cA man as desperate as he is will do anything to get back in your good graces. And that\u2019s the way it should be. When a man f**ks up as badly as he has, he needs to humble himself.\u201d</p><p>Chessy glanced sideways at her husband, a look Joss didn\u2019t miss. There was pain in her eyes and it hurt Joss to see her friend hurting. She shook away thoughts of Chessy and Tate. They\u2019d work things out. Tate seemed oblivious to there even being a problem. Once Chessy got the courage to confront him and work it out, all would be well. Joss was confident of that. She didn\u2019t believe for a minute that Tate was having an affair. Why would he when he had Chessy?</p> <p>Chessy was beautiful, smart. She had a smile that would light up an entire city block. And she was utterly submissive, entrusting her entire well-being to her husband\u2019s hands. He\u2019d be a fool to ever risk that for a piece of ass on the side.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re here,\u201d Chessy said. \u201cAre you sure this is what you want, Joss? It\u2019s not too late to change your mind. We can take you back right now. Just say the word.\u201d</p><p>Joss sucked in a deep breath. \u201cNo. I\u2019m ready. One way or another, I need this to be over. Either we\u2019ll have a new beginning or I\u2019ll have closure, but either way, it ends tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>DASH paced the floor of his living room, agitation gripping him by the balls. Four days. Four goddamn days Joss had been out of the hospital and he hadn\u2019t so much as laid eyes on her. He\u2019d gone to the hospital on the day she was going to be released, only to find she\u2019d already been discharged into Tate and Chessy\u2019s care. He\u2019d been fully prepared to sweep in, take over and not back down. He had every intention of taking her back to their home, where he\u2019d take absolute care of her until she was fully recovered. But Chessy and Tate had taken her to their house, an impenetrable f**king fortress for all the luck Dash had had getting in.</p><p>His calls, texts and e-mails had gotten no response from Joss. Silence lay as heavy as concrete between them and with each passing day, with each failed attempt to reach her, he\u2019d felt her slipping further and further away.</p><p>What the hell was he supposed to do? How could he lay his heart at her feet if he couldn\u2019t get to her in order to do it? He reached for his phone, wanting to call her again, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t answer. Just as she hadn\u2019t answered the dozen other times he\u2019d called her today.</p><p>Despair was his constant companion and he cursed his wayward tongue. If only he hadn\u2019t let his anger\u2014and paralyzing fear\u2014control his thoughts and words that fateful morning. He was to blame. Not Joss. Him. He\u2019d done this to her. To them. And to any chance he had of having forever with her.</p><p>He bowed his head, regret burning a hole in his gut.</p><p>He was so absorbed in his grief that he didn\u2019t hear the car in the drive. Never knew anyone was there until a soft knock sounded at his door.</p><p>His head jerked in the direction of the sound, in no mood to deal with whoever had encroached on his private hell. When a knock sounded again, firmer and louder than before, he swore and strode angrily to answer, fully intending to bite off the head of the unfortunate idiot disturbing his self-recrimination.</p><p>But when he yanked open the door, his heart stopped because it was Joss standing there, looking pale and fragile, the bruises from her accident still vivid against her skin. Her broken arm was in a sling, hugged protectively against her chest. And there was resolve in her eyes that gutted him.</p><p>Her lips were pressed into a thin line and he wanted to yell no! His heart told him that she was here to tell him to go to hell. To stop calling, texting, e-mailing and coming by Chessy and Tate\u2019s house every day. It was no more than he deserved, but he couldn\u2019t bear to hear those words from her lips.</p><p>But she was here! Not locked behind the walls of Tate\u2019s house with Tate and Chessy acting as her personal guard dogs. She was in front of him, and here was his chance to humble himself before her and beg her forgiveness.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d she asked softly when he continued to stand there, stunned, his mind an utter mess of all the things he wanted to say but couldn\u2019t summon.</p><p>She looked suddenly vulnerable and doubt crept into those beautiful eyes. Fear. That he\u2019d reject her? That he wouldn\u2019t allow her to come inside her home?</p><p>He threw open the door and very nearly swept her into his arms. Only the memory of how fragile she was, how injured she still was and how much pain she still had to be in stopped him. And yet she was here. When she should be in bed. Resting. Getting better.</p><p>\u201cJoss,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cGod yes, honey. Please. Come in. Let me help you. You shouldn\u2019t be up. You should be in bed. Are you hurting?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted into a wry smile as she walked into his house. He slammed the door quickly behind her, afraid she\u2019d change her mind, or that she was a manifestation of all his dreams and that she\u2019d disappear as soon as he awakened.</p><p>\u201cI took pain medicine half an hour ago,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s why Tate drove me. I didn\u2019t want to risk another accident, and I\u2019m not supposed to drive for a few weeks anyway.\u201d</p><p>Guilt slammed into him all over again. He touched her uninjured arm, savoring that brief moment of contact. He wanted to do so much more. He wanted to hold her, comfort her, just be with her, close enough to smell, to touch.</p><p>\u201cCome into the living room,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThe couch should be comfortable. I can get the ottoman or you can sit and lean back against the side so you can put your feet up. Are your ribs okay? Is the pain medicine working?\u201d</p><p>He was a babbling idiot, but the flood of questions simply wouldn\u2019t stop. He\u2019d never felt so unsure of himself in his life and he hated that she was so quiet.</p><p>He took her hand, rejoicing when she didn\u2019t yank it away. He led her to the couch and eased her down, hovering, looking for any sign she was in pain.</p><p>She let out a sigh, briefly closing her eyes as she leaned back against the sofa.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, you are hurting,\u201d he swore. \u201cDid you bring your pain medicine with you? Should you take another dose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome hurts can\u2019t be eased with medicine,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI needed to talk to you, Dash. I need this to be . . . resolved. I can\u2019t go on like this. It\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>He sank to his knees, gutted by the sadness in her eyes. Gathering her free hand in his, remaining in a position of vulnerability, he stared intently at her.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re over, honey. Anything but that. Curse at me. Yell at me. Call me names. You have every right. But please, I\u2019m begging you. Don\u2019t give up on me\u2014us. I love you, Joss. I love you so damn much I can\u2019t sleep at night. I can\u2019t eat. I can\u2019t function. I can\u2019t work. There\u2019s a gaping hole in my heart only you can fill.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth quirked up in a half smile. \u201cKylie says you\u2019re useless at work. She doesn\u2019t even know why you go in because nothing gets done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI need you, Joss. You\u2019re my other half. I\u2019m only whole when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Dash.\u201d</p><p>Relief made him weak. He was so wobbly he could barely maintain his position on his knees. And he\u2019d stay on his knees, begging her forgiveness for as long as it took. He was the Dominant and she was the submissive but right now she held all the power and he held none. Because without her, his strength meant nothing. Without her precious gift of submission, his dominance didn\u2019t mean a damn thing. His life had no meaning.</p><p>But something in her gaze stopped him from saying anything in response.</p><p>\u201cBut that isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she added softly. \u201cYou say you love me, but you don\u2019t trust me. And without trust, love isn\u2019t enough. Without trust, we have nothing but lust and sex between us.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head, his eyes and nose burning. The knot in his throat was so huge he could barely breathe around it. He glanced up again to see answering sadness in her eyes. Eyes that screamed defeat. She was giving up. On him. On them.</p><p>\u201cYou are the one who keeps putting Carson between us,\u201d she said gently. \u201cNot me. I moved on, Dash. I let him go. I did that when I went to his grave so many weeks ago. I knew it bothered you for me to talk about him once we entered a relationship even though you appeared to be fine with it before. I even understood why you wouldn\u2019t want to be reminded of a man I once loved when I was in your bed. But your own insecurities are what kept him between us. I was honest with you. The entire time I was nothing but honest. And I gave you everything you asked\u2014demanded\u2014of me, and yet you didn\u2019t offer me those things in return. Not your respect. Not your trust. You say you loved me, but I don\u2019t believe love can exist without trust and respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t say another word,\u201d Dash begged. \u201cLet me apologize. Let me beg your forgiveness, Joss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sent him another sad look that flayed his heart open. There was so much resignation in her gaze. As if she had no hope for their future. He\u2019d have to have hope enough for them both.</p><p>He brought her hand to his mouth and tenderly pressed kisses to her open palm. \u201cMy darling Joss. How I love you. I love you so much it\u2019s killing me. Being without you is killing me. I can\u2019t survive without your love. I don\u2019t want to live without it. Please give me\u2014us\u2014another chance. I\u2019m on my knees before you, honey, and I\u2019ll stay on them the rest of my life if that\u2019s what it takes. Just stay and give me a chance to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>He took in another deep breath, plunging recklessly ahead before she could respond. So she listened to everything he had to say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I was deeply insecure. You caught me unaware that night in The House. I hadn\u2019t planned to make my move so soon and maybe it was me who wasn\u2019t ready yet. I was forced to act or risk losing you, and that wasn\u2019t an option for me. I was . . . afraid. So afraid of losing you. Of not being what you needed. Of not being able to compete with Carson\u2019s memory. I overreacted. I admit that. It was the worst mistake of my life and I almost lost you because of my stupidity and irrational jealousy. It won\u2019t happen again, Joss. You are my life. I trust you. You say I don\u2019t, but I do. It wasn\u2019t you I didn\u2019t trust. It was me. I didn\u2019t trust that I would ever be enough for you. Didn\u2019t trust that I could make you happy. That you\u2019d be as happy as you were with Carson, and that ate at me, chipping away at my confidence until all that was left was an angry shell of the man I needed to be for you. You did everything right and I did everything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze softened and her eyes glittered brightly with unshed tears. She lifted her hand from his grasp and gently stroked his cheek. He was shocked by the moisture on her fingers when she pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThe morning of your car accident was the worst day of my life. I was so scared I\u2019d lost you and, worse, that I had caused it. I lashed out at you, accused you of terrible things, because I was so f**king scared that I had done this to you. I knew I had done it and yet I made that terrible accusation. I implied that you were weak, Joss, and God, you\u2019re anything but. You\u2019re the strongest woman I know. I hope you can be strong enough for both of us, because it\u2019s me who is weak. Not you. Never you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, darling,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It will be okay. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her love echoed in each of the words, a soothing balm to the ache in his soul. Tears ran freely down his cheeks and then she leaned forward, wrapping her arm around him, holding him against her breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t, Joss,\u201d he protested. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt. I don\u2019t want to cause you further pain.\u201d</p> <p>And still, she hung on, refusing to let him pry her gently away from his body.</p><p>\u201cThe only way you\u2019ll cause me more pain is if you refuse me,\u201d she said tenderly.</p><p>He lifted his head and rested his forehead against hers, their breaths mingling, as did their tears.</p><p>\u201cNever that, honey. I\u2019ll never refuse you anything. I\u2019ll give you the world on a silver platter. Whatever you want, you\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want is you,\u201d she said simply. \u201cYou. Your love. Your trust. And your dominance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have all of me,\u201d he vowed. \u201cBut, Joss, do you trust me with your submission? Your heart? After all I\u2019ve done to hurt you? You must know I\u2019d never force you into a lifestyle you don\u2019t want. I\u2019ll make any sacrifice to have you. There is nothing more important to me than you. Just you. In my arms, in my bed, in my heart. Every day. No matter how I have you. It\u2019s enough. It\u2019ll always be enough.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, her breath hitching over a low sob. She closed her eyes as more tears squeezed from the corners.</p><p>\u201cI want you as you are, Dash. Warts and all. I suppose it won\u2019t always be easy, but if you\u2019ll give me your love and your trust, I\u2019ll never ask for more. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have them. Always, Joss. I\u2019ll never give you reason to doubt my trust in you again.\u201d</p><p>She emitted a sigh, one that sounded painful, and he immediately picked up on it.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDamn it, Joss. You should be in bed resting. Not sitting here holding me in a position you can\u2019t be comfortable in.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, radiant and beautiful, lighting up his entire heart. \u201cThere\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be than here with you. Pain be damned. For the first time in a week, I don\u2019t hurt. Not the way I did. The rest is just physical pain, and it will pass. But a broken heart can only be mended with love. And you\u2019ve given me that. I\u2019ll be all right, Dash. I can take anything as long as I have you.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her beautiful face in his hands, framing it as he leaned in to kiss her reverently on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cBut I need to call Chessy and let her know she doesn\u2019t have to pick me up. She didn\u2019t want me to be stranded here without a way to leave, so she said if she hadn\u2019t heard from me in an hour, she was coming over to get me.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and reached for his phone and then handed it to her after punching in Chessy\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cLet her know that I\u2019ll be over to get your things as well as your pain medication,\u201d Dash directed. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re off the phone with her, I\u2019m putting you to bed. Our bed. And then I\u2019m going to take care of you until you\u2019re completely recovered.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then spoke a few words to Chessy, assuring her that everything was okay and that Dash would be over to collect her belongings. When she hung up, Dash stood up and then eased onto the couch next to her, careful not to jar her.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her, hugging her against his side, his face buried in her sweet-smelling hair.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, honey. If there was ever a doubt that I needed you, there\u2019s not one now. I haven\u2019t been worth killing the last week. It\u2019s been the longest week of my life and one I never want to experience again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me too,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s put it behind us, Dash. We have so much to look forward to. The past only hurts us. It\u2019s time to let go and move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it any better myself,\u201d he said, tipping her chin up so he could claim her mouth. \u201cBut one thing I\u2019ll never let go of, Joss, is you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, warming him from the inside out. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>And then he gently pushed her upward and once more slid to his knees in front of her. She looked puzzled when he took her hand and then reached into his pocket. He pulled out the ring he\u2019d bought a mere day after she\u2019d moved in with him. A ring that had waited for just the right time to be presented. Dash could think of no better moment than now.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Joss? Grow old with me and love me? Have the children we both want so badly?\u201d</p><p>Her intake of breath was swift, the sound sharp in the ensuring silence.</p><p>\u201cWould you want them right away?\u201d she whispered, her tone so hopeful that it nearly undid him.</p><p>He slid the ring onto her bare finger, a finger that had been bare since she\u2019d moved in with him. He\u2019d noticed the day she\u2019d taken Carson\u2019s ring off her finger. It was a significant moment and one that should have told him that she was ready to move on. But he\u2019d been stupid and insecure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you all the babies you want just as soon as you want them,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cIn fact, I propose that the minute you recover sufficiently, we get in lots and lots of practice.\u201d</p><p>Her smile would have brought him to his knees if he wasn\u2019t already on them.</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps we should think about getting married soon,\u201d she said teasingly. \u201cI\u2019d hate to be an out-of-wedlock mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re able to travel, we\u2019ll fly out to Vegas and get married immediately,\u201d he declared. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any time to change your mind, so the sooner the better. And if you hold out on me, I\u2019ll just be sure to knock you up so you have to marry me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and the sound filled the last remaining hole in his heart. He was a lucky son of a bitch. The woman he loved\u2014had loved forever\u2014was giving him another chance to prove his love to her. He\u2019d never give her another reason to doubt him, and he\u2019d love her and the children they had until the day he died.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>DASH stood at Carson\u2019s grave site. The first time he\u2019d come alone since the day he\u2019d been buried. All his other trips had always been with Joss. But he hadn\u2019t wanted her to come. For one, she\u2019d promised herself that she wouldn\u2019t come back, that this wasn\u2019t the way she wanted to remember her husband.</p><p>And this would be the last time he came here himself. But he needed closure. Joss wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d needed to let go. So now he stood at his best friend\u2019s grave, prepared to confess everything and assure Carson that Joss was loved and would always be taken care of.</p><p>\u201cI f**ked up, man,\u201d Dash said bluntly. \u201cYou already know that. You\u2019re likely up there wanting to kick my ass for all the pain I\u2019ve put Joss through. The pain I\u2019ve caused her. I deserve it. I\u2019ve certainly kicked my own ass over it all.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a steadying breath, caught unaware by the emotion that overwhelmed him, tightening his chest as long-held grief came rushing out.</p><p>\u201cI made you a promise and it was a promise I didn\u2019t keep. I\u2019m sorry for that. You gave me an extraordinary gift and I\u2019ll always be grateful for that gift. For understanding and never judging me.\u201d</p><p>He paused another long moment, getting his emotions under control.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s happy now. We\u2019re happy. I made things right. We\u2019re married now. I know you know that. But I just had to come and tell you. To reaffirm the promise I gave you before you died. I love her, man. With all my heart. Thank God, she didn\u2019t give up on me, that she gave me another chance.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let her down again. I won\u2019t let you down. I\u2019ll love her and protect her always. With my life. There is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do to make her happy, just like you always did whatever was necessary to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re at peace now, Carson. Joss and I both loved you. Will always love you. But she has a huge heart and an endless capacity to love. She loves me now, but she\u2019ll always love you too, and I\u2019m okay with that because I realize there\u2019s room in her heart for both of us. Loving you doesn\u2019t take away from her love for me, and I can accept that now. I didn\u2019t before.\u201d</p><p>He drifted off, watching a cloud blow by, beaming sunshine down on the grave. He was instantly filled with a warmth so beautiful that it could only be Carson\u2019s presence. Loving and forgiving, just as he\u2019d been in life.</p><p>\u201cI came to say good-bye, just like Joss said her good-byes all those weeks ago. I won\u2019t be back. It\u2019s a choice Joss and I have both made because this isn\u2019t the way we want to remember you. We have too many other good memories and those are the ones we want to cherish.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. You\u2019ll never know how grateful I am for you trusting her to me. We\u2019re happy. She makes me so damn happy that I can\u2019t even look at her at times without going to my knees. I know you\u2019re familiar with that feeling. It\u2019s how you reacted around her too. She\u2019s a very special woman and we\u2019re both lucky bastards to have won her love. Her warmth and generous spirit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning to have children. Right away if I have any say in it. It\u2019s what she\u2019s always wanted and I understand why you couldn\u2019t give them to her, even though Joss and I both know you would have loved them, protected them and never ever hurt them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to name our first son for you. It\u2019s fitting since you brought us together. Your memory will live on through him, and Joss and I will keep your memory alive between us. No pushing it away. You were important to us both, an essential part of our past. But now we\u2019re looking ahead and we\u2019re both ready to let go and move forward with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Dash briefly ran his hand over the headstone and then straightened to his full height.</p><p>\u201cThank you for loving Joss. And me,\u201d Dash whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to worry anymore. She\u2019s in good hands, and I\u2019ll die before ever hurting her again. You have my word. Good-bye, my friend. May you rest with the angels until we all meet again.\u201d</p><p>His heart lighter, a great weight lifted from his shoulders, he turned and hurried back to the car, where his wife waited for him. As he neared his car, she opened the door and stepped out, her smile beautiful and breathtaking. So warm that even the sun couldn\u2019t compete with her radiance.</p><p>Her eyes softened and she extended her hand to him as he approached. She said nothing, simply squeezed, offering her silent support. Never once did she look back at Carson\u2019s grave as he ushered her back inside the car before walking around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>When he slid in, he didn\u2019t immediately start the ignition. Instead he turned sideways so he could see his wife. His beautiful, loving, generous wife.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, his throat still knotted with emotion.</p><p>She leaned over the seat and palmed his cheek as she kissed him.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darling. Now let\u2019s go home and start practicing making those babies you promised me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, suddenly feeling he could take on the world. Get her pregnant? Hell yeah. She\u2019d been off birth control an entire month, and the timing in her cycle was right. If he had his way, they\u2019d spend the next two days in bed, and he\u2019d do everything in his power to start the family they both so desperately wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>But more important was the fact that Joss was his. His wife. His lover. His best friend. His cherished submissive. What she didn\u2019t know, however, was that while he was the Dominant, he was absolutely at her feet, humbled by her unconditional love.</p><p>She may have submitted to him, but he would forever be her slave.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go start making those babies,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you swollen with my child. As beautiful as you are to me right now, I can only imagine you\u2019ll grow even more beautiful when you\u2019re heavy with our baby.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
