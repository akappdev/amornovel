She\u2019d dreaded this since she\u2019d arrived at work, seven hours ago. Suspension would normally have been the first step with any disciplinary action, but she couldn\u2019t suspend a pharmacy tech who reported to work drunk. That was dangerous, and she didn\u2019t allow dangerous people to work in her pharmacy.</p><p>\u201cTerry\u2019s here,\u201d Maria said, peeking into the office.</p><p>\u201cThanks, can you send him back?</p> <p>He slunk into the office, the dark circles under his eyes made all the more apparent by his too-pale skin. \u201cYou called?\u201d he asked, but his voice was hollow. He already knew the answer to his question.</p><p>She slipped behind him and shut the door. It wouldn\u2019t surprise Maria or any of the pharmacy techs she was letting him go, but adding public humiliation to his day wasn\u2019t something she could stomach. The office was small, so he waited to sit down until after she took her seat behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to let you go,\u201d she said without preamble.</p><p>He cursed and stared at his hands, not meeting her eyes. \u201cLook, I know I had some troubles this weekend. Christine dumped me last week, and I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Terry,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cBut you came in here stinking of alcohol, when you bothered to come in at all.\u201d</p> <p>He looked up, tears building in the corners of his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. I screwed up. Royally. But it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Brenda frowned. The man had messed up. But he was young, just old enough to buy the alcohol he\u2019d used to drown his sorrows. And he loved his long-time girlfriend. Enough, apparently, to lose his job mourning the relationship.</p><p>\u201cI have to let you go,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI can\u2019t risk you\u2019ll come in here drunk after the next fight.\u201d</p><p>The haggard breath he took made her chest hurt, but she couldn\u2019t give in, not on something this important. As tears started rolling down his face, she said, \u201cIf you get into an alcohol program, prove to me you\u2019re sticking with it, we\u2019ll see how things are going in a few months. Maybe try again, under a probationary period until I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh thank you, Brenda!\u201d he said, choking out the words between sobs.</p><p>\u201cI said maybe, and remember, this is going to require some serious work on your part.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and promised he\u2019d check out what the hospital offered that very day.</p><p>Brenda waited for him to pull himself together before escorting him out. She returned to her office and rubbed her eyes. Had she made a mistake? Should she have given him that small way for him to redeem himself, or would it have been better to make it a clean break?</p><p>She sighed and turned back to her computer, but the sound of a message arriving on her phone stopped her. The chirp was distinctive, and specific to a very special kind of message. Hitting shutdown on the computer, she didn\u2019t glance at the cell\u2019s screen. Instead she called out to Maria, \u201cI have to leave early today, family emergency.\u201d Only an hour remained until six, when she was scheduled to leave anyway, but she still felt a twinge of guilt.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Maria asked when Brenda emerged from the office.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. My brother\u2019s in town so just a little drama.\u201d The lie made her mouth dry and her stomach flip-flop, but she could hardly tell her the truth.</p><p>Maria\u2019s posture relaxed and she nodded. \u201cFamily drama, fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Brenda tugged on the spandex in a vain attempt to get the fabric to cover just a bit more of her cleavage. Damn it, she\u2019d definitely shrunk the undershirt. She knew it was tight as she raced out the door, but she hadn\u2019t realized the severity of the shrinkage.</p> <p>And why had she bothered to rush? Not like anyone would have missed her if she hadn\u2019t shown. Suppressing a sigh she knew would prompt concern from her companion, Char, she glanced around the room, taking in the motley group.</p><p>\u201cMotley\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be the word most people would use to describe the gathering of superheroes. Granted, their disguises were all the more bright and noticeable with so many of them in one place\u2014thirty or so, Brenda figured\u2014but most still would have described the gathering with a much kinder word. Striking or spectacular, perhaps, especially when compared to the stark room they stood in. Gray carpet washed out by white walls. Folding chairs lined one side of the room, propped against the wall. Next to the other wall, a ten-foot by ten-foot section of the floor was elevated six inches higher than the rest of the space. The darker gray carpet that lined its surface kept it from being quite the tripping hazard it might have been otherwise. In the center of the dais a metal podium stood empty.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Char asked, not fooled by Brenda\u2019s blank expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just feeling a bit squished. I left my top in the dryer a little too long.\u201d</p><p>She grinned down at Brenda\u2019s cleavage. \u201cWell, luckily, just the undershirt is spandex. Can you imagine if you were wearing Violet\u2019s outfit?\u201d</p><p>Brenda snorted and glanced at the woman. She covered her body, wrist to knee, in purple spandex already stretched so tight it left not a single one of her curves or lumps a mystery. Black leather gloves and boots completed her outfit, along with a mask that hid her hair and half of her face. Brenda had never seen the older woman without her mask, but with the unmarred way the spandex sat against her scalp and neck she imagined Violet had short hair.</p><p>Even if she had been a teenager instead of the forty-something Brenda guessed she must be, that much spandex wouldn\u2019t have been appealing. Thank goodness most heroes chose modern and attractive outfits. Of course there was a handful who, like Violet, stuck with tradition.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think this is about?\u201d Char asked, keeping her voice low. She wore spandex today, too, though the material was much more flattering on her. Her small red dress with matching boots, gloves, and top hat complimented her athletic curves.</p><p>Brenda shrugged. Whatever it was, she was unlikely to be involved in any meaningful way, but she could understand the curiosity. Her friend had a useful power, albeit one that made her personal life a living hell. She reduced everything she touched with her fingers or toes for more than a few seconds to ash, burning it from the inside out. Sadly, her touch worked without conscious effort, and she couldn\u2019t turn it off. Brenda found herself jealous of her superhero brethren often enough, but never of Char. That wasn\u2019t to say the stunning superhero didn\u2019t date, she just had to keep her gloves and socks on at all times. But she\u2019d never had a long-term relationship, not since Brenda had known her anyway, maybe because her power was difficult to explain to a normal person without compromising her secret identity\u2014something most superheroes were loathe to do until a relationship was firmly established.</p><p>\u201cI heard Justice is coming to this meeting.\u201d Char tossed her long, auburn hair behind her shoulder and grinned.</p><p>Cheeks burning, Brenda muttered, \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Char smirked. \u201cGood thing you shrunk that spandex, huh?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and then giggled at her friend\u2019s waggling eyebrows. \u201cYeah, like he\u2019s going to start noticing me all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>Justice was, much to Brenda\u2019s annoyance, one of the few males who didn\u2019t appreciate her and her costumes. She might be a second-rate superhero, but she filled her carefully chosen outfits quite nicely.</p><p>Her second-class status and Char\u2019s generally sarcastic attitude placed them firmly outside of the cliques formed by the others surrounding them. In rare moments of honesty, she could admit her power\u2014or lack thereof\u2014had little to do with her outcast status. Like Char, she was in the out group because that\u2019s where she felt comfortable.</p><p>As if summoned by their discussion, Justice strode into the room. He also filled his outfit to Brenda\u2019s satisfaction. Like most of the male superheroes, he chose to wear leather and other less formfitting materials. Black was his color of choice, with deep red accents to give him a badass appearance, though not a particularly stylish one.</p><p>He towered over his brethren like a king over his subjects. Handsome and broad in the shoulder, he looked like a superhero should. She took an involuntary step forward and then stopped in her tracks, face warming. It\u2019s his reputation, Brenda told herself. That was what made him appear so strong, what made her reaction to him so overwhelming.</p><p>He walked up to the wrought iron podium and held up a hand to silence the room. Her pulse quickened and for a moment, she forgot to breathe. His face was partially covered with a mask tied over his eyes, but it did nothing to hide his chiseled features. He had a square jaw and just a touch of stubble that ran down his cheeks and onto his neck. Probably only a day of growth, but with his dark hair it was already noticeable. She imagined for a brief moment what the rough stubble of his beard, followed by the softness of his full lips would feel like, gliding down the tender skin of her neck.</p><p>Brenda swallowed and forced herself to breathe. His had the face of a hero, one who certainly wasn\u2019t interested in a second-tier champion such as herself, no matter how well she filled out her uniform.</p><p>Tension hung in the air, but no one spoke while they waited for Justice to break the silence. His gaze moved across the group, and as his eyes raked across her, it was as if she could feel his hands caressing her body. Her nipples tightened beneath her uniform, and she glanced away from him. He was out of her league. She needed to remember that.</p><p>Justice surveyed the room, taking in the group of heroes before him with a calculating eye. Some were more useful than others, but most weren\u2019t valuable in a plethora of situations. Few circumstances arose where his powers didn\u2019t come in handy. His gaze paused on Silencer\u2014Brenda\u2014for a brief moment, and he struggled to pull his eyes to the next hero before lingering long enough that she might notice.</p><p>She wore one of her skimpier outfits, definitely not one made for working. Spandex clung to her breasts, and the material threatened to push them right out of the laced-up silver bustier she wore over it. A short silver skirt clung to her ass and revealed long, toned legs. Elbow-length silver gloves and tall, silver, high-heeled boots\u2014also lace-up\u2014accessorized the outfit, which was completed with a silver mask that covered only her eyes and a cape that draped to the small of her back. The top was sleeveless, and the cape covered half of her neck and hung over her collarbone. While most superheroes generally stuck with one uniform, or a series of similar ones, Silencer believed in no such consistency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that he normally minded what she wore\u2014quite the contrary. But today, her clothes were hardly reassuring.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for coming together on such short notice. You may have seen the attack on a local bank last night on the news. I\u2019m here to confirm what most of you have probably already guessed: We have a new super villain on our hands.\u201d</p><p>He waited for the buzz to die down, giving them a moment for the idea to settle in before he continued. \u201cHis name is Howler. This one is going to require a small team with specialized skills. As for those of you not on the team, The Council is going to ask that you do whatever you can to avoid him. He\u2019s dangerous. Instead, keep your ears open and if you hear anything let me know.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd murmured at the order, but this time he didn\u2019t wait for the noise to die down before raising an arm, palm out, to silence them.</p><p>\u201cTrust me when I say this Howler isn\u2019t something most of us are equipped to deal with. He was in the New York City area for two weeks, hitting several banks during that time. Supers in the area weren\u2019t able to bring him in.\u201d The crowd went completely silent for a moment, and then exploded.</p><p>\u201cNew York couldn\u2019t take him down?\u201d The Panther called, his voice a growl that made it unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of New York not being able to take down a villain,\u201d Speed said.</p><p>\u201cIf New York wasn\u2019t able to take him down, how can we?\u201d Violet\u2019s voice carried an edge of panic. He had to stifle that emotion before it spread.</p> <p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Justice said, voice set loud to carry over the din, \u201cwe have the only superhero in the country with the unique ability needed to defeat Howler. Our very own Silencer.\u201d</p><p>Justice waved her over as the calm broke and a slew of voices overran the room. Not bothering to make sure she followed, he walked through a doorway that led to the back offices of the Superhero League building.</p><p>Brenda gave Char an apologetic grin over her shoulder. She acknowledged her friend\u2019s phone-to-ear motion with a quick nod, and then hurried after Justice. Doing her best to ignore the assessing glances of the other superheroes, she made her way to the door he had disappeared through. The looks she caught out of the corner of her eye were mostly surprised, and a few were openly derisive.</p><p>Violet stood near the doorway and stepped in front of her as she approached, forcing Brenda to meet her gaze. The purple-adorned woman\u2019s arms were crossed in front of her body, and her expression was the one Brenda had hoped to avoid. If her face had been covered with doubt, even scorn, Brenda could have handled it\u2014treated her with the same sarcastic sharp tongue she held at the ready ever since she could remember. But Violet\u2019s brows drew together with worry, her thin lips turned down in a mournful expression.</p><p>\u201cDear,\u201d she began, voice dripping with sympathy, \u201cdon\u2019t you let them force you into anything. There\u2019s no shame in admitting you aren\u2019t strong enough to face this villain.\u201d</p><p>Not strong enough? How dare this woman look at her with pity in her eyes, assuming she had already failed before she\u2019d been given the chance to try. What did she know, anyway? If Justice thought she would be able to handle the guy, she could, right?</p> <p>The knowledge that he indeed trusted her to help take out this super villain hit her, and a weight lifted from her chest. She could do this. She would do this. She\u2019d show Violet and every other superhero out there who doubted her that she was as capable as they were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, struggling to keep her voice even. She stepped around the older woman and strode down the hallway.</p><p>Brenda made her way past a drinking fountain and almost passed the small office where Justice leaned against a heavy oak desk in the middle of the room. The room itself was tastefully decorated, much nicer than the common area where the general meetings were held. Was this his office? The unevenly stacked papers seemed random in their placement, and the chair behind the desk was oversized.</p><p>His hard expression met hers when she turned her gaze away from the decor. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not allowed to look around?\u201d Yes. Definitely his office.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get started hunting this guy, but your attire is....\u201d He trailed off, but he might as well have said what he meant. She recognized that cool look of dismissal. The same expression was often carried in the eyes of other superheroes, women mostly. One glance at her stylish outfit and people decided she was nothing but fluff\u2014all boobs and no brains.</p><p>\u201cMy attire is just fine for my normal superhero duties,\u201d she replied, unable to keep the anger out of her voice. \u201cAre you going to tell me what I need to know about this case, or give me fashion advice? And let\u2019s be honest, you\u2019re not exactly qualified for the latter, are you?\u201d She eyed his clothing as she spoke. His outfit wasn\u2019t bad; in fact, it looked quite perfect on him, but she wasn\u2019t about to let him know that. And he was no fashionista; she didn\u2019t like him judging what she wore. So what if she usually dressed for fashion instead of necessity? It wasn\u2019t like the Superhero League ever gave her jobs that required real uniforms. She waved at parades. Talked to kids about a superhero\u2019s life. Volunteered at community blood drives.</p><p>How was she to know they\u2019d assign her an important case tonight?</p><p>\u201cLike I said, he calls himself Howler. His powers seem to operate in a straightforward but effective manner.\u201d Justice pushed off the desk and moved around to grab a folder off the top. Flipping it open, he read aloud, \u201cHe emits a scream that strikes a unique decibel and tone, one which almost instantaneously knocks out anyone within a long range\u2014several hundred yards if there aren\u2019t any barriers between him and his target.\u201d</p> <p>Brenda\u2019s mouth went dry, and she swallowed a couple of times before she spoke. \u201cI take it superheroes are not immune.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, not really. But Justice responded like it was. \u201cNo, but The Council is hoping that your ability to block sound waves means you are.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never heard her ability to turn her hearing off described quite like that. If she\u2019d thought her mouth dry before, it was like a desert now. She raised her hand, index finger extended, and then turned and walked back down the hall where she\u2019d come in. She could still hear a quiet rumble from the conference room, but guessed that most of the superheroes had left. The water from the fountain was cold on her tongue, and as it slid down her throat, her pulse slowed.</p><p>Ever since her abilities began to reveal themselves when she was thirteen years old, she\u2019d hoped for something amazing. Her thirteen-year-old self had been convinced that if she showed a useful talent, it would gain the attention of her parents, pull them from their busy superhero schedules to focus on her. But hers had proved to be nearly useless, like powers were more often than not. And four years later when her brother\u2019s power showed itself, she was almost beyond caring that his capacity to fly exceeded even the usefulness of their parents\u2019 abilities. Almost.</p><p>When she rounded the corner back into the office, Justice again leaned against the desk. Did he never use the expensive-looking office chair behind it? Somehow she doubted it, and the vision of his constant leaning on the desk while trying to do paperwork or research on the Internet flashed in her mind.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny?\u201d he asked. Without waiting for a response he added, \u201cIf you\u2019ve assuaged your thirst, we need to get on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, but she knew the pleased expression wasn\u2019t for her. \u201cTo get the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The bank\u2019s orderly and clean appearance would have led Brenda to doubt that it had been recently robbed by a super villain, but then this wasn\u2019t a typical bad guy they were dealing with. He used the power of his voice to incapacitate the people around him, thereby making it easy enough to walk in and take what he wanted without much damage to the structures he robbed. A far cry from the super villain norm, since they generally smashed their way into wherever they wanted to be.</p><p>The vault door stood ajar, and though no people milled around, she was willing to bet that there had been when he\u2019d robbed it. No wonder they had such a difficult time catching him. He didn\u2019t even need the cooperation of the bank personnel if he came during the daytime. Many banks kept their vaults unlocked during business hours, only setting timed locks at night when the employees were no longer there to watch the money.</p><p>She walked to the vault and peeked in. A smaller safe sat inside. It held the cash and was accessible with a key. Howler had probably grabbed it from a teller or bank manager\u2019s neck or belt after he knocked them out. Simple.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d she asked Justice.</p><p>\u201cTonight, right before closing.\u201d He walked around from the customer area behind the counter so he could check the vault, too. Hard lines cut into his face as the slight frown he\u2019d been wearing since they left the League\u2019s headquarters deepened. \u201cWe would have been here sooner, but I didn\u2019t have my cell on me during the meeting.\u201d</p><p>That was probably on purpose. Tracking via cell phone wasn\u2019t something she worried about, as no reporters stalked unimportant superheroes, but for someone like Justice, it might lead them right to his secret identity. Although unlikely he gave out the number to just anyone, he was the type to always take precautions regardless. Which was why they\u2019d hiked several blocks to where he had concealed his Porsche.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? Doubt we could have moved fast enough to catch him here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council didn\u2019t decide to have me work this case for my super strength, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The derision in his voice made her face burn, and she had the sudden urge to wipe the condescension out of his tone.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here to track him so I can take him down, huh? Try not to get in my way then.\u201d Without waiting for his reply, she turned, careful to keep her weight on her toe as she swiveled, and left.</p><p>She paused outside of the door, and then leaned against the cool brick. She was tired, and her feet were killing her. Damn these boots anyway. She\u2019d toss them out, but they were too cute. She should have realized why he was with her maybe, but he didn\u2019t have to point it out the way he did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Justice, in addition to having superior strength, which was helpful if not entirely uncommon, had the ability to track supers. A rare ability, enough so his decision to become a superhero instead of a super villain was almost miraculous. Many of the strong ones went the other way. Little reward waited in the hero business other than the appreciation of the general public, which could be fleeting and could quickly turn to outrage and anger. Villains, on the other hand, found their chosen professions quite profitable.</p><p>Until a superhero caught them.</p><p>After what seemed like hours, Justice emerged from the bank. His hard expression wasn\u2019t the least bit contrite, but he didn\u2019t make any biting follow-up comments either.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re too late. I can\u2019t track him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what happens now? We go home and wait for him to rob another bank?\u201d</p><p>Justice grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s not all we do. We\u2019ve got people on it. But I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>That was it, wasn\u2019t it? We had people on it, but she wasn\u2019t part of the we. She was the you. Not powerful enough to really be part of the Superhero League in anything but name, but not normal enough to fit in among humans.</p><p>But that was why she\u2019d worked so hard, wasn\u2019t it? Why she\u2019d pushed herself through pharmacy school and worked her butt off to become not just good at her job, but excellent. And in that, she\u2019d succeeded.</p> <p>He started walking back to the car, and she followed him automatically. He\u2019d send her home and then do his superhero thing. Figured.</p><p>Silence overtook the car, thick in the air, until he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. \u201cSo what did you think of your first super villain scene?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my first scene,\u201d she said, but didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>Fine. If she didn\u2019t want to talk, they didn\u2019t have to talk. He didn\u2019t realize how hard he gripped the steering wheel until he felt the material start to bend in his hands. Biting back a curse, he relaxed his hold. What was it about this woman? She\u2019d driven him nuts from afar with her eyes and smile since he\u2019d transferred to the Chicago league two years before, and now that she was close, she still drove him crazy\u2014in a different way\u2014with her scathing tongue and contrary attitude.</p><p>\u201cIt was weird to see the scene like that,\u201d she said, interrupting his thoughts. \u201cSo...\u201d she waved her hand in the air, searching for the right word, \u201c...clean.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe least-destroyed crime scene I\u2019ve seen in a while. Definitely the cleanest I\u2019ve seen by a super villain.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to him, and the weight of her gaze made his pulse quicken. \u201cDo you see a lot of non-super villain crime scenes?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He\u2019d slipped up. He was so careful; he never slipped up. It was her fault. Damn woman, she wrecked his concentration.</p><p>\u201cYou know, on television.\u201d He shrugged, trying to keep his voice light and airy.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>Desperate to change the subject, he asked, \u201cSo how long have you been with the Chicago league?\u201d</p><p>He saw her frown deepen and her eyes narrow with his peripheral vision, but she answered his question. \u201cSince forever. I\u2019m from here. My parents are superheroes. They used to be on The Council, but they\u2019re retired now.\u201d</p><p>Her parents had been Council members; no wonder she had such a chip on her shoulder. All people born with abilities, whether it was something useful and impressive like super speed, or as useless as making grass grow from your skull, were permitted to join their local Superhero League. After all, even abilities that seemed useless could come in handy, and they always needed volunteers to speak at schools and oversee charity work. But Council members were different. Only the most powerful superheroes were found on the councils of their area chapters. If both of her parents had been Council members, she\u2019d had a lot to live up to.</p> <p>\u201cMust have been hard,\u201d he said finally. \u201cTwo parents on The Council and you being....\u201d He stopped talking, trying frantically to think of a way to finish the sentence without sounding condescending.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Disabled by my crappy superpower? There are a lot of paths to success, Justice. Superpowers are just the easiest way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not like good superpowers are a surefire way to success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Well it\u2019s the nearest thing to the easy street that exists. Most of us have to work a little harder than being born special to succeed in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re jealous\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cI\u2019m not jealous!\u201d Her head whipped around to look out her window. \u201cHey, stop the car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d rather walk home than face an argument you can\u2019t win? Some superhero you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou passed my apartment half a block ago, genius.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth but no words came out. As they slid to the side of the road Silencer jumped out before he brought them to a complete stop, slamming the car door behind her.</p><p>Work seemed a little drabber than normal after spending the night arguing with a superhero and investigating a crime scene, and for some reason Justice\u2019s face\u2014the part not hidden by his mask, anyway\u2014kept flitting to the top of her thoughts. Not that it hadn\u2019t in the past, but things were different now. He\u2019d proved himself to be a jerk, just as she\u2019d figured he would. He was a powerful superhero after all, and that kind of thing tended to go to a man\u2019s head.</p><p>So why was it she couldn\u2019t think about anything but how strong his hands looked? How they\u2019d feel, rough against her skin.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bren, we\u2019re running a bit behind out here,\u201d Maria said, nodding toward the pharmacy as she peeked into Brenda\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cSure, no problem. I\u2019ll be out in just a minute,\u201d she said, face burning as if the woman could read her thoughts.</p><p>Maria nodded and turned back to her work.</p><p>What she should be worried about was Howler. What did Justice expect her to do if she blocked his powers? Run up and kick him? Self-defense and karate classes she\u2019d taken over the years had been purely for fitness\u2019s sake, and she wasn\u2019t prepared for a real fight. Oh, there was the standard training regiment all superheroes went through, but it was just practice, not real experience. Not that she hadn\u2019t imagined being in a real fight more than once while she practiced. She\u2019d meant to ask Justice more questions, sort out the specifics of The Council\u2019s plan, but he\u2019d touched on her sore spot. Made her angry. Accused her of being jealous. As if he knew what it was like to be in her shoes.</p><p>Brenda shook her head to clear her thoughts. She had to focus. An administrator filling out a bit of paperwork could afford a distracted brain to a certain extent; a pharmacist couldn\u2019t.</p><p>So for the next two hours she kept her attention on work. Thoughts of superheroes and villains and Justice moved to the back of her brain, and she focused on filling the prescriptions that might very well mean life or death to the people they\u2019d been ordered for. Requiring superpowers or no, it was a hefty responsibility.</p><p>Superheroes weren\u2019t the only ones who saved lives.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ms., not Miss,\u201d an icy voice said from the counter. The voice was familiar enough to pull her from double-checking the information sheet she was stapling to a prescription bag, but she couldn\u2019t quite place it.</p><p>The woman who corrected Maria\u2019s use of her name didn\u2019t look familiar. Short, brown hair, graying at her temples, did nothing to cover an ordinary fortyish face that sat on top of a body that wasn\u2019t exactly overweight but didn\u2019t appear to get a lot of gym time, either. Her too-tight T-shirt that proclaimed she was a fan of the local high school football team didn\u2019t ring any bells.</p><p>Brenda moved closer to the counter to get a better look. She still couldn\u2019t place her, and it felt important she did. The woman noticed Brenda\u2019s stare, and returned it with one of her own.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, dear?\u201d she asked, voice only slightly more kind than the one she\u2019d used to correct Maria.</p><p>Recognition hit Brenda. Maybe it was the \u201cdear\u201d that did it; most people didn\u2019t call strangers dear\u2014not in Chicago. Or maybe the slightly condescending motherly tone triggered her recall. Whatever the cause, she knew without a doubt that the woman standing at her counter was Violet. Violet in her normal clothes.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry. I thought you were someone else,\u201d Brenda stammered, and a flush crept up her cheeks for the lie.</p><p>She pursed her lips and looked Brenda up and down thoughtfully but didn\u2019t say anything else. Instead, she snatched the prescription bag from Maria\u2019s hand and turned to leave. She stopped after a couple of steps and pivoted back around, just enough to give Brenda one last considering glance before she walked out the door.</p><p>A loud chirp made Brenda jump. She glared at her cell phone and then grabbed it to silence the noise.</p><p>\u201cAnother emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, I know.\u201d Maria grinned and waved her away.</p><p>Operating on little sleep, Brenda had left the house without packing a superhero outfit with her. Luckily, she had the extra mask she always carried in her car\u2014it was regulation, after all. So after parking, she tied the mask on and tried to look as official as she could while wearing a superhero mask with a pair of slacks and a button-up blouse. She had half convinced herself it was working until she met up with Justice at the crime scene.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d he asked, after taking in her outfit and shiny red mask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s regulation,\u201d she snapped back.</p><p>He frowned at that, but didn\u2019t argue with her. He of course wore his normal gear, and she wondered if he ever took it off. An image of him showering in all that black leather flashed in her mind, and it was all she could do to suppress a giggle.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny?\u201d</p><p>One of the bank\u2019s double doors hung from a single heavy hinge, and the other was nowhere in sight. Rubble decorated the once-professional lobby, and peeking inside revealed that much of the debris came from the second story, which had half collapsed on the floor below it. Brenda backed up, not eager to test the stability of what remained of the two-story building. \u201cThis...doesn\u2019t look like our guy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI agree, but we\u2019re checking anything and everything that could be Howler. I\u2019ll get another team going on this, and we\u2019ll get back to work on ours.\u201d</p><p>Justice didn\u2019t wait for her reply; instead he stalked off to meet a group of heroes who gathered at a slightly safer distance away from the scene. She recognized them; The Jumper, StrongArm, and Char. Moving back, Brenda gave her friend a small smile and wave. She grinned back openly but didn\u2019t move to meet her. Instead, she nodded at something Justice told the group, and then followed StrongArm as he and Jumper jogged down the street away from the bank.</p><p>Justice met her with serious eyes as she approached.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we stick together,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s best we arrive on scene together, just in case. Until then,\u201d his gaze moved up and down her body, eyes seeming to slow down over her chest and legs, \u201clet\u2019s go get you a real uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have real uniforms, thank you very much,\u201d she replied, more irritated with herself for forgetting her uniform after wearing one he deemed so inappropriate the night before than she was with him. She was a professional, damn it. Even if she wasn\u2019t usually required to be a professional superhero, she was a professional and that extended to every part of her life. Forgetting something so important riled her.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014\u201d she began, but the ringing from her cell phone stopped her explanation, and she was grateful for the interruption because she hadn\u2019t been entirely certain what she was going to say.</p><p>\u201cThis is Brenda,\u201d she said, raising a finger at Justice. His lip drew back in a grimace, but her attention stayed focused on Maria.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brenda, I know you\u2019ve got some family stuff going on this week, but I can\u2019t get hold of Rachel and Ben\u2019s school just called. He\u2019s sick, and I need to pick him up.\u201d Maria\u2019s tone was pleading.</p><p>Brenda glanced at her watch. Only two hours until closing time. What was the likelihood Howler would strike again in the next couple of hours? And if he did, well, the pharmacy would just have to close early.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Brenda said, and then clicked her phone shut.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your way? Where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Justice growled.</p><p>\u201cI have a job. A real job. One that needs me to be there for a couple of hours.\u201d She took a deep breath and met his gaze. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>His eyes didn\u2019t leave hers for a few moments, and he stared at her as if searching for some hidden meaning in her words. Finally, he nodded. \u201cFine. But I\u2019m going with you.\u201d He raised a hand at her before she could argue. \u201cAs a member of The Council, I already know your secret identity.\u201d</p> <p>Of course he did. But that didn\u2019t mean she wanted him traipsing around her work. But he was probably right\u2014they should stick together. No matter how much the man irked her. \u201cOkay then, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He kept his face carefully blank as he pulled his Porsche into a parking spot next to Silencer\u2019s red Lexus IS350 at Pranier Medical. One of the nicest hospitals in the city, it wasn\u2019t one he frequented. His jobs\u2014both human and superhero\u2014took him to county hospitals and city morgues, rarely to private facilities like Pranier.</p><p>Silencer met him at his Porsche and raised an eyebrow at his expression. She reached up to her face and with a quick flick of her wrist, removed her mask. Her simple action forced his breath from his lungs.</p><p>Taking off a mask, especially a small one like she\u2019d been wearing, shouldn\u2019t have made such a difference in her face. But as his gaze traced the fine line of her jaw, the soft sweep of the blonde hair across her brow, the contrast between her pale skin and dark eyes, for a moment he imagined superhero masks were magic. A relic that could so change a person\u2019s facade that when one\u2019s true face was revealed, the effect was shocking.</p><p>She was breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cYou got that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She\u2019d been talking, but he\u2019d missed it. What had she said? It had been important. \u201cUm....\u201d he said, brilliantly.</p><p>\u201cB-R-E-N-D-A.\u201d she said, punctuating every letter as clearly as if she\u2019d written the word down for him. \u201cBrenda. That\u2019s my name. Don\u2019t slip up and call me anything else. Not like anyone has heard of Silencer anyway, but I don\u2019t want them to know anything about my other...pseudo life. Got it?\u201d</p> <p>Something had changed. The woman standing in front of him with one hand settled on her hip while the other waved at him seemed like a stranger. But her direct gaze was the same, as was her matter-of-fact speech. He couldn\u2019t put his finger on the change. But he would. He was Justice after all, the hero of the Millennium Park attack, the man who tracked down and defeated the super villain IronClaw, not to mention the people he helped during his day job.</p><p>His mind settled by his thoughts, he said, \u201cHow are you going to explain me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry your pretty head about that.\u201d She grinned, and his feeling of being off-balance about her grew. But before he was able to think too far into it, she strode toward the hospital, leaving him to follow in her wake.</p><p>He expected her to head for the elevator, so when she swung toward the pharmacy door, he changed direction awkwardly.</p><p>The woman behind the counter smiled at Silencer in obvious relief before disappearing to let them into the pharmacy area.</p><p>As they slipped through the doorway, the woman said, \u201cThank you so much, Brenda. I\u2019m sorry about this, but he\u2014\u201d She stopped talking abruptly as she took in Justice, frowning at the reassuring smile he shot her.</p><p>\u201cThis is Justice. He\u2019s doing some surveillance of the hospital, and we\u2019re letting him use the pharmacy as his base. Justice, this is Maria, she\u2019s one of our pharmacists.\u201d</p><p>Maria took the hand he held out and shook it gingerly. \u201cOne of the local superheroes?\u201d She didn\u2019t sound overly impressed.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d was Maria\u2019s only response as she pulled off her lab coat. She grabbed a purse from the small office set in one corner of the pharmacy. \u201cThanks again, boss,\u201d she called over her shoulder as she let herself out.</p><p>\u201cYou, wait there,\u201d Brenda said, pointing to the office.</p><p>Justice followed her instructions; he seated himself and then peeked out to watch her deal with customers.</p><p>She was efficient, not brisk, but quick in the way of a person completely comfortable in her job. Questions from customers were met with compassion and direct answers, and it was obvious she knew several by name. After the first hour rolled around, realization hit him.</p><p>She\u2019d changed when she took off her mask, changed in the way a superhero usually did when donning her uniform. For Silencer\u2014Brenda\u2014it was like putting on the uniform reduced her, removed a bit of confidence that, for some reason, a blouse and white medical coat granted her.</p><p>Suddenly, a blouse and slacks looked sexier than anything he\u2019d seen in a while.</p><p>\u201cSo Maria didn\u2019t seem exactly impressed to meet a superhero,\u201d he said when the steady line of customers disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWell, she wouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Brenda muttered, more to herself than to him. Shooting him a sharp glance, she explained, \u201cHer ex was a superhero. Some hotshot out of Denver. I think he\u2019s a big part of the reason she moved here.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of what to say to that, he just nodded.</p><p>\u201cFigures, though.\u201d She tucked a chunk of blonde hair behind her ear and turned away to sort through a small stack of paperwork.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a normal human, of course. What kind of a chance did she have to hold onto a superhero?\u201d She glanced at him before returning to her sorting. \u201cA real one, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think only some superheroes are real?\u201d he asked, shock rushing through him.</p><p>\u201cJustice,\u201d she said, after glancing around to make sure they were alone. \u201cThere is a difference between real superheroes like you who have the power to save people from villains on a regular basis and people like me. My powers, such as they are, don\u2019t make me any different from Maria and other normal people. Yours do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s the powers that separate us?\u201d Before he realized what he was doing, he was up from his chair and standing only inches from her. Her face was turned away, and she had to look at him so he could make her understand. He touched her soft skin with his fingertips, tipping her chin up. A scowl cut across her full mouth at his touch, but she didn\u2019t move away.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Her voice was soft, caressing.</p><p>It took a moment for him to remember what they were talking about.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our powers that separate us\u2014make us heroes. Yes, us,\u201d he added as she started to shake her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the willingness to put on the uniform. To face things that might be stronger than ourselves in order to save other people. And the lack of power you\u2019re talking about?\u201d Her skin brushed against his as he leaned in to whisper. \u201cThat lack of power is what makes you a real superhero, Brenda, because you\u2019re willing to fight in spite of that fact.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, mouth parted to argue with him, to deny what he could so clearly see. Bringing his face down inches from hers, he grazed her jawline with his knuckles. She swayed toward him, gaze fixed on his mouth. She licked her lips, and the last bit of control he\u2019d clung to broke.</p><p>Her lips were soft\u2014so soft\u2014and after a moment\u2019s hesitation she kissed him back with a zeal he hadn\u2019t expected. The sweet smell of strawberries filled his nose, and it occurred to him on some level that the intoxicating scent was probably her shampoo. He reached for her, touching her back with his hand, needing to get closer, to feel her body on his. She pressed against him eagerly, and her mouth opened. Soft and wet, her tongue caressed his.</p><p>Suddenly he couldn\u2019t think about anything but her. The way she\u2019d filled out her tight, little uniform. And the sexy confidence she donned with her conservative blouse and slacks. He hardened painfully in his uniform, and she moaned. The small sound made every muscle in his body tighten. He didn\u2019t care that they were practically in public. He had to have her. Now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhem,\u201d a voice said, and Brenda jumped from him, gone so fast it was as if she had super speed. She left a cold emptiness in his arms when she fled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but I\u2019m in a bit of a rush today. Bingo starts in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mrs. Johns. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Brenda\u2019s face was so red that for a moment he thought there might be something really wrong with her, but as she helped the short, elderly woman behind the counter, her color returned to normal, and she slid into her professional visage. By the time she passed the receipt to the customer, her expression was hard.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to go,\u201d Brenda said, as Mrs. Johns disappeared around the corner.</p><p>\u201cBrenda\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Her expression was still hard but her eyes were wide, panicked. \u201cI need to close up here and fill a few prescriptions. I can\u2019t do that with you distracting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Howler\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessage me if you hear something.\u201d She turned away and pulled the bars down over the front window, and then placed a paper \u201cClosed\u201d sign behind it.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, so he let himself out.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Brenda kicked the covers off her feet and sighed. What a night. Thanks to Justice, sleep had been impossible. Why did he have to kiss her? Even worse, why had he told her those things? She was comfortable with the way she saw herself. She was good at her job, willing to help out when her minimal superpowers would suffice, and that was good enough. She had a better chance than most to be born with a great power, but instead...instead she was only good for filling out a uniform. She didn\u2019t need delusions of grandeur put in her head by a man who had no idea what it was like to roam the world without powers.</p><p>What did he think he was doing? Zipping into her life and twisting her into a pretzel before leaving just as quickly, no doubt. And the kiss...God, the man could kiss. She could feel him now, lips soft on hers, testing, waiting for her to respond. And she\u2019d responded all right.</p><p>Muttering an expletive, she smashed her fist into her pillow and reformed it into a slightly more comfortable lump.</p> <p>She had just drifted off into a doze when her cell phone chirped. Not bothering to look at the number, she threw off the covers and grabbed what she\u2019d mentally named her \u201cpractical\u201d superhero outfit. Black pants and a matching jacket, she\u2019d blend perfectly with Justice and his dark ensemble. The outfit was made with leather, along with something that felt similar to canvas, and lined in cotton. It was comfortable, thoroughly practical, and in her opinion, pretty damn boring, which is why she\u2019d never worn it other than to try it on in the store. Even now it was difficult to admit to herself that she\u2019d bought it just in case she ever needed to actually run around like a real superhero.</p><p>Lame.</p><p>Ignoring her thudding heart, Brenda moved to answer the pounding at her front door. Justice stood, framed perfectly in the doorway with the low lighting of the hallway hiding his expression, as enigmatic as only a superhero could be.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, and though she couldn\u2019t see his face, shadowed as it was, she felt his gaze moving up and down her body, burning her as they took her in.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, and then without waiting for her, he pushed from the doorway and headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cNo need to wait,\u201d she muttered, giving the empty doorway an exasperated glare. She grabbed a hair tie from the coffee table, pulled her hair back into a quick ponytail and jogged to catch up. \u201cNice to see you were actually able to find my apartment tonight,\u201d she called after him.</p><p>He ignored her comment, if he\u2019d even heard her. By the time she\u2019d caught up to him, he was at the top of the stairwell, at the opposite end of the hall from her door.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going exactly? Another bank?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not a bank this time. He hit a store.\u201d Justice didn\u2019t slow his pace as he spoke, if anything, he seemed to speed up.</p><p>\u201cA store? Why would he hit a store? I can\u2019t think of a store that would have enough money in it to justify going there instead of a bank. What store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small mom-and-pop operation. But it\u2019s not the store he was after, it was the mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mayor,\u201d she echoed. She didn\u2019t need him to explain why, but he did anyway.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asking the city of Chicago to cough up ten million dollars or he\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen million seems...low.\u201d</p><p>Justice stopped at that and gaped at her. \u201cIt seems low? This misfit has kidnapped the damn mayor and that\u2019s all you have to say about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not all I have to say about it.\u201d She glared back at him and crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this isn\u2019t a big deal or anything, I was just wondering why he didn\u2019t ask for more.\u201d</p><p>Justice opened his mouth, and then snapped it shut. He turned and headed down the stairs at an even faster pace than before. They hit the lobby before he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, and the words came out like they were dragged out with a winch. \u201cIt does seem low. But he\u2019s new\u2014Howler, I mean. Maybe he doesn\u2019t realize how much he could have asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d</p><p>Justice grunted</p><p>The button on his key ring clicked as he unlocked the Porsche. Somewhere between the lobby and where he\u2019d parked just down the street from her entrance\u2014illegally, she noticed\u2014Justice had hit an all-out run, and Brenda muttered a quick thanks to her treadmill for keeping her in shape so she wasn\u2019t out of breath from the short jaunt. Just being around Justice after the kiss was awkward enough, huffing and gasping for breath while he stood there stoically would have made it worse.</p><p>As she slid into the seat, Justice slammed his door and then started talking. \u201cOkay here\u2019s the plan. We\u2019ve got other heroes moving in to distract him while we get you into position. You\u2019re to move in, block his power when he uses it on you. Get his attention\u2014keep his eyes on you\u2014and I\u2019ll move in behind him.\u201d He slid the Porsche into gear and pulled out into the street fast enough to knock her back in her seat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s your plan? Justice, that isn\u2019t a plan,\u201d Brenda said, and then grabbed the door to keep from flying into the middle of the car during a sharp turn that he took at what felt like a hundred miles per hour. \u201cDo you know the layout of the building? Is he armed?\u201d</p><p>Justice glanced at her. \u201cArmed? No, he\u2019s not armed from what we can tell. What self-respecting super villain would run around armed? Might as well admit your power sucks if you do that.\u201d</p><p>Brenda pursed her lips. She\u2019d considered picking up a gun that very afternoon. Something small she could fit into her purse unnoticed. Backup, just in case. \u201cOkay, so he\u2019s not armed. Have you thought about paying the guy? I mean, ten mil probably doesn\u2019t even touch what the mayor is insured for against for something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but he\u2019s not going to stop with the mayor. If he gets money this way, he\u2019ll just move onto bigger and richer prey.\u201d His eye met hers for a brief second before he turned back to the road, but a second was long enough. He was worried.</p><p>She swallowed. If a hero like Justice was worried\u2014no, she couldn\u2019t think like that. She had to stay focused. \u201cOkay.\u201d Blinking lights came into view, police cars. They were getting close.</p><p>\u201cI know the plan isn\u2019t the best, but we\u2019re working with what we have. You won\u2019t be alone in there. Other superheroes are en route, some probably already around. I\u2019ll be with you, too.\u201d He slid to a stop behind a couple of police cars blocking the road. He slipped the transmission out of gear and cut the engine then turned to face her. \u201cI won\u2019t let him hurt you, Brenda.\u201d</p><p>With those words vibrating in her head, she leaned forward as he bent and kissed her. It was quick, over in a flash, but shook her more than the idea of taking on a super villain.</p><p>Justice jumped out of the car and greeted the policeman guarding the scene before she wrangled her door open. The officer was in his forties and had sweat beading on his forehead visible through his military-short hair. He ran a hand through his almost-nonexistent hair and then waved them through.</p><p>Justice strode down the street, moving quickly, before he turned back and motioned her over. He hit a button on his cell phone as she shifted her weight, shooting glances up the street and back down the way they\u2019d come. The way they were headed seemed darker. Shadows stretched so far they seemed to all coalesce into inky, impenetrable darkness.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Justice said into the phone. \u201cGot it.\u201d He clicked it shut and turned to face her. His brows were drawn together, but his voice was clear of worry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going in the front,\u201d he began, and then held up a hand to stop her interruption. \u201cI know, it sounds nuts but your power is your element of surprise, not your presence. You go in with a briefcase they\u2019ve placed near the door for you. Act like you\u2019re paying the man. When he comes for it, be ready to power on. The other team members and I will be coming in behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know when to use my power?\u201d she asked, wishing her voice wasn\u2019t so frantic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know.\u201d He gripped her shoulder in support. \u201cKeep him distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to distract him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow your instincts, Bren. If they say to fight him, fight him. If you think he\u2019ll be receptive to conversation, talk to him. Don\u2019t let yourself get hurt. If you feel like it\u2019s not going your way, run. That in itself might be just the distraction we need.\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou are trained to fight, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she said. All superheroes were. Just because she didn\u2019t have the most impressive power in the world didn\u2019t make her a slacker. She\u2019d trained her butt off. Except, the instructors in pads and gloves hadn\u2019t really wanted to hurt her, and who knew what this Howler was capable of? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, okay. Sorry.\u201d He pulled her into a quick hug and she stiffened, surprised at how much she longed to melt against him. This wasn\u2019t her; she was stronger than this. She didn\u2019t need to snuggle up to him and for even a moment feel like he was going to make everything okay. This was her day. Her job. Her villain.</p><p>After a few seconds he released her and nodded toward the dark street in front of them. \u201cCouple blocks down, you\u2019ll see the store. Lights will be on inside, briefcase is to the right. Pick it up before you let him see you.\u201d Justice gave her one last smile and then jogged down the way they\u2019d come, turning into an alley half a block away.</p><p>And she stood alone.</p> <p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d she whispered to herself, and then grimaced. Talking to herself now? Nice.</p><p>With a quick glance over her shoulder at the alley Justice had disappeared down, she shifted her focus to the task at hand. One step after another, she forced herself forward.</p><p>Lights pierced the darkness around a building that was, as Justice said, only two blocks from where he\u2019d left her. The store sold antiques according to the sign in the window. Clear glass, uncovered by the gates that had been pulled down over neighboring buildings\u2019 windows, was all that stood between her and the villain. How long had they been in there? Had the Howler kidnapped the mayor before the store closed for the day?</p><p>The briefcase sat near the front entrance, only feet away and drenched in shadows. Brenda grabbed it, almost dropping the metallic case as she pulled it from the ground, startled by the weight. Money didn\u2019t fill it\u2014she\u2019d gathered that much from Justice\u2014but something did. Yet another trick, an added bonus to make the briefcase a better decoy.</p><p>Here goes nothing, she thought to herself, and then stepped forward to face the Howler.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>A bell dinged as she pushed the door open, announcing her presence as clearly as it had signaled customers entering over the years. Startled by the sound, she paused and glanced around. No one was there, not in this room anyway. A door leading to a back room\u2014an office maybe, or storage\u2014sat clearly visible from the entryway. How did the superheroes expect to sneak up on anyone in here? If they came through the back, Howler would have them even more quickly than he\u2019d pick her off in the front.</p><p>The door slipped from her grip and shut firmly behind her.</p><p>The super villain didn\u2019t spring from the shadows, didn\u2019t appear so fast her eyes couldn\u2019t follow him, didn\u2019t teleport from parts unknown. He opened the backdoor and walked into view. Though his entrance struck her as anticlimactic, her breath came faster and her heart threatened to beat itself from her chest.</p><p>Howler stood around five feet seven inches tall, and had gone old school with his outfit. Tan and brown spandex covered his body from head to toe, and for a moment images of Violet flashed in her mind. The cut of his uniform was similar, spandex from neck to calf in a light tan color, with darker brown boots, briefs, and gloves. A mask hid his head and the top of his round face. An image of what appeared to be a wolf head was emblazoned in the middle of his chest, mouth open and looking almost straight up. It was howling. Funny.</p><p>His body was as ill-suited to wearing spandex as Violet\u2019s, but for a different reason. Where hers was a touch too round, Howler was more than a touch too scrawny. No one would mistake him for a villain with super strength. Oh there were a few of those who didn\u2019t appear strong, but she\u2019d never heard of one who looked weak. And that was exactly how Howler looked: weak.</p> <p>\u201cLet me guess? Shadow Woman? Dark Mistress?\u201d he said, lip curling up in obvious disdain.</p><p>She glanced down at her outfit. Dark Mistress indeed. \u201cI have your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you now? Well, let\u2019s see it.\u201d</p><p>She froze. See it? What if they\u2019d put newspaper in the briefcase? One thing was guaranteed; the briefcase didn\u2019t contain cash. The lump refused to move from her throat as she swallowed hard. Distract him, Justice had said, keep him busy.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast.\u201d Her voice came out steadier than she\u2019d thought it would be, smooth and normal, as if she wasn\u2019t facing down a super villain. \u201cYou need to show me the mayor first, so I can make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I\u2019d like to see the money first, honey.\u201d</p><p>Her reaction came just half a second too slow. She watched him fill his lungs with air, taking it in until his chest expanded to fill his ill-fitting suit. Her mind processed the scene in slow motion, and as realization hit that something was wrong, he screamed.</p><p>Too late, she touched the part of her mind that switched on her power with her consciousness. The sonic wave hit, and she fell to the floor.</p> <p>Everything went black for what must have only been a few seconds, because when her eyes fluttered open she saw him moving toward her\u2014what she could see of him from her vantage point on the floor anyway. Tan legs and dark boots moved to her, and she could hear them scuff the floor as he moved. She grasped at her power with her mind, but it slipped away, out of her reach. The boots paused when they got only a couple of feet away.</p><p>Where was Justice? Where were the other superheroes? She hoped they were getting the mayor and the shopkeepers out.</p><p>\u201cStill awake?\u201d Surprise coated the villain\u2019s voice, and he knelt down and peered at her face.</p><p>She stared back at him, and tried to keep her expression neutral.</p><p>A great laugh boomed from Howler\u2019s chest, seeming too loud to have come from such a slight person. \u201cOh, it\u2019s like that, is it? Don\u2019t worry, I know how you superheroes feel about me.\u201d He reached out and poked her shoulder, and she lost the battle to keep her face blank.</p><p>Whatever crossed her face, it made Howler\u2019s grin widen. \u201cBarely awake though, huh? Guess my shot wasn\u2019t as direct as I thought. Unless....\u201d A full smile broke out on his face, revealing slightly stained, but straight, teeth. \u201cYou must be her. Silencer.\u201d</p><p>His voice took on the booming quality of an announcer. \u201cThe one with the power to defeat the Howler.\u201d He laughed again and grabbed the briefcase, which had fallen next to her, and then pushed himself up from the ground awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, hon, guess you weren\u2019t a match for me after all.\u201d Using his foot, he pushed her over onto her back. Her body wouldn\u2019t obey her, and moved as easily as if she\u2019d been unconscious. \u201cNice rack, though. You can call me anytime.\u201d With one last snicker at his own joke, Howler strode toward the back room.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move for minutes after, and the ruckus happening just out of her eyesight made her want to move more than anything. Shouts from several people could be heard through the wall that separated her from the action. She shoved herself up from the floor, halfway into sitting position. Glass shattered somewhere out of sight, and she collapsed back onto the floor. Then, just before silence fell, Howler screamed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you up,\u201d Justice said, and then before she could argue, he was out of the car.</p><p>Damn man anyway, he moved like he had super speed. The weight of what had happened suffocated her. She\u2019d failed. There had been one thing she was supposed to do\u2014use her useless power\u2014and she hadn\u2019t. Not fast enough anyway.</p><p>She followed Justice woodenly toward her building door. When he held it open for her, she glanced at him but didn\u2019t comment. Her head hurt and her ears still felt stuffed with cotton. She imagined Justice felt even worse, but he didn\u2019t show it if he did.</p><p>They reached her apartment and she opened her mouth to thank him and tell him good-bye, but he pushed past her into the apartment.</p><p>\u201cPlease, come in,\u201d she said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d His voice was too loud, but short of a yell that would bother the neighbors. She\u2019d be spared that humiliation, at least.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d Her inner hostess kicked in, and despite her intention to get him out of the apartment as quickly as possible, she ended up sitting across from him at her small kitchen table. A turkey sandwich sat in front of both of them, along with a glass of orange juice by her plate and a soda next to his.</p><p>\u201cYou did good tonight.\u201d His voice had come down a decibel or two, and she was relieved as the cotton slowly faded from her ears, but her head still beat like a drum on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do what I was supposed to. I wasn\u2019t fast enough to get my power up in time to stop him from taking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou distracted him, Brenda. That was your job. You kept him busy while we got the mayor and the shop owners out. No one was killed. No one was seriously hurt. That\u2019s a win.\u201d He took a big bite out of his sandwich and studied her.</p><p>She glanced away, suddenly uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t do much of anything, not really. Certainly nothing worthy of getting congratulations from the real superhero sitting across the table from her. But all\u2019s well that ends well, right? Everyone was okay.</p><p>For the moment.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get Howler.\u201d</p><p>Justice swallowed his mouthful of sandwich and took a drink from his soda before answering her. \u201cNot yet. But we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a secret weapon anymore.\u201d A thought popped in her head, and she spoke without thinking. \u201cIf I ever was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Justice took another bite and, to her amazement, Brenda realized that more than half of his sandwich had disappeared. The man ate as quickly as her brother had in high school.</p><p>\u201cHe asked if I was \u2018her,\u2019 if I was Silencer.\u201d She scooted her chair back from the table and walked to the counter. \u201cHe knew who I was, Justice. He was expecting me. How is that possible? It\u2019s not like our members and their abilities are public knowledge, and I\u2019ve never made the news.\u201d She grabbed a knife from the wooden stand on the counter and walked back to the table. The knife easily cut through her sandwich and she offered Justice half.</p><p>He took the food with a grateful smile, but his frown returned quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he could have found out about you. Unless...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start making guesses yet, not until I\u2019ve looked into it.\u201d Two bites later, the sandwich half she\u2019d given him was gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me know if I can help. With whatever you\u2019re looking into, I mean.\u201d She shifted in her seat. Should she ask him why he\u2019d kissed her? The timing seemed so inappropriate and the question so inane. No, it didn\u2019t matter how much she wanted to know. She couldn\u2019t talk about it. Not right now.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, and then pushed back from the table and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch. In the meantime, try to keep a low profile.\u201d He bent to kiss her cheek before she realized his intent. Hand on her shoulder, his lips were hot against her skin. \u201cStay out of trouble,\u201d he whispered into her ear.</p><p>Before she could think of a suitable reply, he was gone.</p> <p>The scratching woke her, like nails on a chalkboard. The sound grated at her and drew her from a troubled sleep. Confused, she rolled around on the bed to glance at her alarm clock. It read three o\u2019clock, but outside it was still dark, as dark as it ever was in the city, anyway. She rubbed her eyes and sat up, mind still muddled. What was that? It was the middle of the night.</p><p>Light from the streetlamps shone through the curtains, seeming bright to her well-adjusted eyes. But the light was wrong somehow. As she stared at it she saw the shadow; it stretched across her room from the sliding glass door that led to her balcony.</p><p>The sheer curtains weren\u2019t easy to see through when she changed, and a person would have to be clinging to the windowless side of the building next door to have a chance at a look, but they did allow enough light through to get around, if her eyes were dilated from the darkness. They weren\u2019t shadowed; on the second floor there were no trees to block the light.</p><p>So what was that?</p><p>Brenda jumped up from the bed and grabbed her cell phone from the nightstand. She hit Justice\u2019s name, but her finger paused over the send button. What was she going to tell him? That a scraping sound woke her up? That there was a new shadow in her window? What if he showed up and there was nothing outside?</p> <p>She swallowed and shut her phone, and then gripped it tightly in her palm. As she edged toward the window, the shadow stayed put.</p><p>It\u2019s probably nothing, she reassured herself. But when she got close to the window, the scraping sound stopped. Hand shaking, she pushed the curtain aside.</p><p>Howler.</p><p>A knife scraped on the glass as she watched, and he stared up at her with a strange expression on his face. Fascination, like she was a bug under his microscope. His other hand pressed against the door as if he could push it open.</p><p>She let out a scream and jumped back, touching the place in her mind that turned on her power as she moved. What was he doing here?</p><p>Frantically she looked for Justice on her phone and hit send. She didn\u2019t bother putting it to her ear, but turned her attention back to Howler.</p> <p>He smiled at her, mouth wide and teeth glinting garishly in the yellows and oranges and blues of the city lights. And he spoke, but she couldn\u2019t hear him. Turning off her power would be suicide, but she was tempted, if only to reassure herself that he wasn\u2019t talking about murdering her or wearing around her skin.</p><p>She shuddered. No more horror films for her.</p><p>Backing up, she kept her eyes firmly affixed on Howler until she cleared her bedroom doorway, and then she turned and ran to the front door. The knob was solid in her hand, real. And she clutched that piece of metal like it was the only real thing in the nightmare she\u2019d become lost in. She wanted to turn it, unlock the deadbolt, run across the hall to her neighbor\u2019s.</p><p>But what if he was out there? What if he\u2019d driven her to the door for this very reason, to get her to open it?</p><p>No, that was silly, wasn\u2019t it? If he wanted in, it would be easier for him to break the glass on the sliding door that led to the balcony he squatted on. Wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>With her hearing shut down, she couldn\u2019t tell if he\u2019d already broken the window, if he was sneaking up behind her as she struggled to make the right decision. She shouldn\u2019t be running, she should be turning around, fighting him. But she\u2019d never really fought anyone before. And he had that knife.</p><p>She shot a glance over her shoulder. No one crept through the shadows. She muttered a curse under her breath, turned the deadbolt and then threw open the door.</p><p>Running for her neighbor\u2019s apartment, she crashed headlong into Justice\u2019s chest.</p> <p>The second he\u2019d seen her number, he\u2019d been out of bed and on the phone with Porter. The silence on the line was deafening, and he hadn\u2019t been able to hang up or drop it from his ear. Instead, he grabbed the landline off the wall and called in a favor. He hadn\u2019t even considered the Porsche, fast as it was.</p><p>Porter was faster.</p><p>A minute to wake him up, thirty seconds for Porter to dress. Another half a second and he was at Justice\u2019s door. A second to grab his hand. Less than a second later and he was at her door. The whole process had taken less than two minutes.</p><p>It was the longest two minutes of his life.</p><p>Just as he approached her door, ready to kick it down, she burst out. Straight into his arms. She wore an old T-shirt that was several sizes too big, and flannel pajama pants. Not what he\u2019d imagined her sleeping in, but still pretty damn sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She mumbled something. He couldn\u2019t make out the words.</p><p>\u201cBren? Brenda?\u201d He forced her face up so he could look at her. She didn\u2019t appear injured, but tears streaked down her skin and her eyes were bright. \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, brow furrowing, before she muttered something that sounded suspiciously like one of his favorite four-letter words.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot.\u201d She waved a finger at her ear. \u201cI still had my power on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at the apartment, face suddenly serious. \u201cHe was here, Justice. Howler was here. Out on my balcony...with a big-ass knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he said, and then stepped past her to scan the apartment. More than anything, he wanted to stride in and beat the hell out of Howler. Not on general principle because he was a super villain. Not for robbing banks or kidnapping mayors. But because he\u2019d scared her. Because he\u2019d put that look on her face.</p><p>But if he went in there\u2014no. Then she\u2019d be here alone, unprotected the second Howler used his power. Porter was already gone and wouldn\u2019t go for help, wouldn\u2019t call anyone. He wasn\u2019t a superhero. He was a mercenary, barely living on the right side of the line.</p><p>Justice flipped his cell phone open and pressed the number one until it dialed. StrongArm\u2019s voice came on the line, clear, like he\u2019d been awake. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilencer\u2019s apartment has been compromised.\u201d He hesitated before giving the building address to StrongArm. Giving out any superhero\u2019s address was serious. But StrongArm led the superhero council in the Chicago area, which meant he could pull her address anytime he wanted. He ran his hand through his hair, rattled off the address, and then snapped his phone shut.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ve got people moving in.\u201d</p><p>Brenda nodded and let him lead her to the stairwell with his hand gripping her upper arm. She was surprisingly obedient, but he guessed she had every right to be shaken up. The idea of that freak hanging out on her balcony while she slept....</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked when they reached the lobby.</p><p>He grunted, hoping she\u2019d take it for assent. He was far from okay. \u201cI should be asking you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. He just startled me. I shouldn\u2019t have run out of there like a damn chicken.\u201d Disgust laced her voice.</p><p>Unable to help himself, he reached out and tucked a wayward piece of her hair behind her ear. \u201cYou did the exact right thing.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>The image of that creep peeking through her window with a damn butcher knife hit him, and he took a deep breath to calm the sudden rage rolling through his body. Brenda could have been hurt. And it would have been his fault for dragging her into this fight.</p><p>He pushed the thoughts to the back of his mind. He had to deal with the situation they were in right now. Make sure she was safe. That\u2019s what mattered.</p><p>\u201cDo you have keys?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cCar keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Not my main set, but I have a spare in one of those hide-a-key things.\u201d</p><p>He grunted again. After all of this was over, he\u2019d talk to her about how she was inviting thieves to take her car off her hands with that thing, but for now it was damn convenient so he wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking your car.\u201d</p><p>She crinkled her brows and shot him a glance but didn\u2019t ask him how he got there. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cMy place.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Justice lived in a house so close to the \u2019burbs she figured it barely counted as the city. But the home was cute, brick, and one-story, a ranch style typical of the seventies. It stood proudly between two McMansions that had replaced the older houses on either side of it. It didn\u2019t look like the house of someone who drove a Porsche, and she wondered for a moment if he spent more money on the car than the house, and then dismissed the idea. A home in a nice neighborhood at a convenient location near\u2014but not too close\u2014to Metra and redline access didn\u2019t come cheap.</p><p>He came around and opened her door and she realized she\u2019d just been sitting like a dope, staring at his house through the window. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered and looked away from him to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>Justice strode up to a door on the side of the house and unlocked it, letting them in to a small kitchen, not much bigger than the one in her apartment.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting company,\u201d he explained as she glanced around. The sink had his dishes from the night before, maybe from a couple of nights before, by the size of the stack. Or perhaps he hadn\u2019t eaten alone.</p><p>She frowned and turned her attention back to Justice. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you the guest room.\u201d</p><p>He led her to a small room off a narrow hallway that sported a twin bed and a small dresser. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBathroom is the next door on the right,\u201d he said, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cMy room is on the left if you need anything.\u201d He paused and glanced around the room, before settling his gaze on her. \u201cDo you? Need anything, I mean.\u201d</p><p>The intensity behind his eyes burned into her and her mouth went dry. She licked her lips, and he took a step toward her, hands fisted tightly at his side.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She searched her mind for something snazzy or sexy to say. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped and didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds. Then he nodded and shot her a reassuring smile, but the look didn\u2019t negate the fire in his eyes. \u201cHe won\u2019t find you here.\u201d</p><p>Forcing a smile, she gave a quick jerk of her head.</p><p>Awkward silence hung in the air for a few seconds, and then Justice turned and walked into the hall. She shut the door behind him.</p><p>Staring at the window until the sun came up was not going on Brenda\u2019s list of favorite ways to spend the night. But she\u2019d slept after that, clear until noon. Groggy, she wandered to the bathroom, found a toothbrush on the counter still in the plastic container and used it.</p><p>Justice sat at the dining room table hunched over a laptop computer screen. His superhero outfit was back on, but he wasn\u2019t wearing his mask.</p> <p>She stopped at the end of the hallway and studied him. He was handsome, as she\u2019d known he would be\u2014he couldn\u2019t hide that under a mask that only covered a small part of his skin. Chocolate brown eyes were set into perpetually tanned skin. His hair, which she\u2019d thought black until she saw him up close, was darker brown than his eyes. If he\u2019d been any paler, it would have looked too dark, but against his skin the dark brown looked perfect.</p><p>\u201cHow was your night?\u201d he asked, not raising his eyes from the computer screen.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAs good as you might expect, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are doughnuts and bagels on the counter. Coffee\u2019s fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>After checking the bagels, all plain or non-fruity flavors, she settled on a doughnut covered in chocolate sauce. For good measure and because she\u2019d had a bad night, she added a glazed doughnut to her plate before pouring a cup of coffee and heading back to the dining room.</p> <p>Justice shut the computer when she walked in and gave her a quick once-over.</p><p>\u201cDid you get any sleep?\u201d</p><p>If the expression on his face was any indication, she must look like she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSome. Did they find anything at my apartment?\u201d She sat at the table and took a sip of coffee. Maybe two doughnuts were too many. Some of the outfits in her closet might not fit after two.</p><p>\u201cNo. Bastard was gone by the time they got there.\u201d He crossed his arms.</p><p>Of course he was. Screw it. She took a bite out of the chocolate doughnut. The night ran through her mind, and though she wanted to shy from it, she knew thinking about what happened was important.</p><p>Justice nodded and tapped on the computer; his eyes were affixed to a spot on his wall, and she didn\u2019t have to turn around to know there was nothing of interest on the spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know is how he got on the balcony,\u201d she said, the thought bothered her the night before, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to think about what had happened, or what could have happened if Justice hadn\u2019t gotten there so fast. \u201cAnd I want to know how he got down so fast and out of the area. I mean The Council probably had people there what...two, maybe three minutes after you?\u201d She took another bite out of her chocolate-covered doughnut and reveled in the taste.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Three minutes tops.\u201d As he leaned forward, the laptop moved a couple of inches toward the middle of the table, too.</p><p>\u201cSo...I guess he could have brought a ladder.\u201d She frowned. That didn\u2019t fit the super villain ideal, but that didn\u2019t make it impossible. \u201cBut to get down, load a ladder and get out of there before the League arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve checked and double-checked into his powers. I spent the morning talking to New York. He doesn\u2019t have any powers outside sonic waves that anyone has ever seen.\u201d</p><p>No wonder the undersides of his eyes were just a bit darker than she imagined they should be. He probably hadn\u2019t gotten any rest at all.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d She stuffed the final bite of the chocolate-covered doughnut between her lips and eyed the glazed.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing anything. I\u2019m going to go talk to the League, see if I can come up with any leads.\u201d He stood up.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to be doing?\u201d she asked, or tried to. The large chunk of doughnut lodged itself to the roof of her mouth, so the words came out muffled.</p><p>Justice crossed his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here.\u201d He raised a hand when she started to object. \u201cSpare my table the chunk of pastry you\u2019re about to spit on it, please. This isn\u2019t up for discussion. This guy wants you. You, personally. He knows your power, knows your name, where you live.\u201d</p><p>She frantically choked down coffee to force the doughnut down. Some of the dark liquid dribbled onto her chin, and she wiped at it with her hand. So attractive. \u201cSo I\u2019m just supposed to sit here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe views you as a threat, Brenda. We can\u2019t risk you wandering out there where he can find you easily. You\u2019ll be putting yourself and the people around you in danger.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and thought of Maria and all of the other people she worked with. She couldn\u2019t go to work, not with him knowing her name. It would be all too easy for him to figure out where she was employed if he hadn\u2019t already. Her blood ran cold. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re already in danger? He\u2019s taken hostages before, Justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name, it\u2019s Justin. With everything I know about you, you have a right to know that much. Well,\u201d he waved his hand, gesturing at the room around them, \u201cand where I live, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour real name is Justin...and your superhero name is Justice?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cSeemed...right.\u201d</p><p>His disappointment at her reaction made her grin, but it faded as the distraction of his name wore off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We should be worried about hostages. With this guy\u2019s track record, it\u2019s more than possible,\u201d he said, and ran his hand through his hair. She wondered if it felt as soft as it appeared. \u201cWe\u2019ll put a flyer on it, someone who can keep an eye out and report back if he shows. Violet maybe.\u201d</p><p>She thought back to when Violet\u2014out of uniform\u2014had shown up at her pharmacy and the grin crept back onto her face. \u201cGood idea. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll have a problem finding the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Brenda wandered around Justice\u2019s house after he left. The television offered a poor distraction and she diligently ignored her desire to snoop. She showered and put on a pair of sweat pants and a T-shirt he\u2019d dug out for her and felt even worse. Nothing like a set of old, too-large sweats and T-shirt to make a person feel really unattractive.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t done the dishes, so she loaded them into his dishwasher and tried not to wonder if they had come from more than one person, or just more than one meal. It seemed the least she could do after he let her stay at his home.</p><p>A couple of hours of daytime television later, she was about to go insane when she heard his car pull into the driveway. With its low and mean-sounding engine, the Porsche was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, shutting the television off as he walked into the living room. His mask was back in place, but he pulled it off as soon as he reached the couch.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d He took in her outfit, and a wide smile broke out on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re all rumpled.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m going crazy here. I can\u2019t watch daytime television and stay sane.\u201d</p><p>He barked out a laugh and continued to study her clothes with interest.</p><p>Crossing her arms, she glared at him. \u201cSeriously, I need to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you even supposed to work today? It\u2019s Saturday.\u201d He sat down next to her on the sofa, and she scooted a couple of inches away to give him room. The smell of his aftershave, spicy and fresh, hit her and she closed her eyes. A man should not be allowed to smell that good.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not supposed to be working today, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell....\u201d She\u2019d been planning on cleaning her house, running some errands. But saying that aloud would make her list sound so...unimportant. Just being out of her element, forced to stay in a strange house where she had to constantly fight the urge to search through the underwear drawer of a man she barely knew, that\u2019s what bothered her. But she couldn\u2019t say that out loud.</p><p>The sound of her cell phone saved her from having to answer him, and she jumped up from the sofa to retrieve it from the dining room table. The table was only a couple of short steps from the couch, so she reached the phone on the second ring and flipped it open without looking at the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda, how are you?\u201d The voice on the other end of the line sounded worried.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine, Mom. How are you?\u201d she said, airily. Crap. She should have checked before she answered. The worry in her mom\u2019s voice meant she knew about Howler. Although her parents were retired, they still kept in contact with the Superhero League and its council.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019d been assigned to a dangerous case? Or at least call me last night?\u201d her mother said, voice rising a few octaves. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried sick about you, but I didn\u2019t want to call since you probably didn\u2019t get any sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>Brenda\u2019s mother, Mabel Booth, had two great concerns in life: that her kids might get hurt in their superhero duties, and that they might not be getting enough sleep and eating enough vegetables. The first was usually reserved for her brother, Paul. The second was divided equally between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call you. I didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fine, Mom, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d her mom said, and some of the strain disappeared from her voice. \u201cWell, anyway, that\u2019s not the only reason I called. I wanted to make sure you remembered to bring peach cobbler tonight. Your brother loves it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, tonight. Your brother is in town. Don\u2019t tell me you forgot?\u201d</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t forget something as exciting as dinner with Paul while being involved with something as banal as being stalked by a super villain. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t forget. But honestly, with everything going on I\u2019m not sure dinner is the best idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, your brother doesn\u2019t come into town every day.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not hunting super villains everyday either, Mom, was on the tip of her tongue. But upsetting her mother would just mean more questions and more worry. If her mom thought things were bad enough, she\u2019d be on Justice\u2019s doorstep before Brenda could stop her. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m kind of busy with this Howler thing\u2014\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there after dinner, too,\u201d her mom said, and her tone allowed for no argument. \u201cBring your friend, the one you\u2019re staying with. Justice, right?\u201d</p> <p>The man himself had moved from the couch to stand across the table from her, and he watched her squirm on the phone with an eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be interested, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be? Bring him. Seven o\u2019clock, and don\u2019t forget the cobbler.\u201d Before Brenda could say another word, her mom hung up. She wasn\u2019t one for good-byes.</p><p>\u201cYour mom?\u201d Justice asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The cell phone clunked as it hit the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you certain \u2018he\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be interested in?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up from where she\u2019d tossed the phone, right into Justice\u2019s slight smile and raised eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s rather presumptuous of you. What makes you think you\u2019re the \u2018he\u2019 she was referring to?\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019d hoped, his amusement disappeared. \u201cIs there another \u2018he,\u2019 Brenda?\u201d</p><p>She considered teasing him, but his tone was serious, and there was a hint of something else, too. \u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, and her face heated. \u201cDinner tonight at my parents\u2019 house. My brother\u2019s in town.\u201d</p><p>The smile returned to his face and the edge of teasing was back in his voice when he spoke. \u201cWell, then, guess I don\u2019t have to order in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with cooking?\u201d</p><p>A touch of pink crept up his neck. \u201cI hate doing dishes. You can eat pizza on a paper plate.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled out of her throat. \u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to my parents\u2019 tonight, we\u2019ll have to get some supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupplies?\u201d</p> <p>She tugged on the T-shirt hanging limply from her body. \u201cClothes for me to start with. And a baking pan. Something tells me you don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do with one if I did.\u201d</p><p>Justice parked in her parents\u2019 driveway in Naperville at five minutes before seven while she clutched the aluminum foil-covered cobbler on her lap. He\u2019d watched her with what she could only describe as fascination as she made it, handing her ingredients and utensils when she asked for them, but otherwise staying at a safe distance.</p><p>They\u2019d visited her apartment, electing to grab her actual clothes and take one of her baking dishes and some key items like a hand mixer, rather than spend all day shopping. The apartment had been checked, repeatedly, and had been under constant surveillance since she\u2019d made a run for it in the night. Howler hadn\u2019t made an appearance, and the preparations for going to her parents\u2019 house had gone more smoothly than she\u2019d dared hope.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d She turned to Justice, who was unfastening his seat belt. He wore his regular superhero outfit, mask included, something she\u2019d almost protested. But he had every right to protect his identity.</p><p>\u201cAre your parents that scary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can be.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed and took the cobbler from her lap. She tensed as his hand grazed hers, heart suddenly thumping faster in her chest.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s treat this situation like a bandage.\u201d The handle clicked as he opened the door. \u201cRip it off quick.\u201d</p><p>Suppressing a sigh, she pulled herself out of the car. Justice waited for her before he headed toward the house.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s a little overwhelming,\u201d she warned him when he reached the concrete walkway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamous last words.\u201d She rapped on the door then turned the knob and pushed it open. \u201cAnybody home?\u201d she called, and heard her mom\u2019s voice, muffled from the wall separating the kitchen from the living room and foyer. She held the door and then shut it behind him. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>The house was lined in walls colored in various natural tones, the living room a taupe color that somehow worked well with beige-and-red striped furniture and lighter taupe pillows. Her mother had taken a home design class at a community college after she\u2019d officially retired from the local league council and had promptly put her education to use throughout the home she\u2019d lived in for thirty years.</p><p>They made their way to the kitchen, passing the large formal dining area, which had also felt the touch of her mom\u2019s design class, before walking through the entryway into chaos.</p><p>Her mother stood at the gas stove, apron covering a pair of slacks and a blouse. Brenda\u2019s father, Walter, peered into the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cNo, not the margarine,\u201d her mom exclaimed as he pulled a yellow tub from the depths of the fridge. \u201cThe real butter. It\u2019s on the top shelf.\u201d</p><p>Her dad muttered something and stuck his head back in the refrigerator, and her mom turned her attention to her guests. \u201cBrenda! Oh good, set the cobbler on the island.\u201d She waved toward an empty section of the counter, and Justice obediently set the dish down.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, this is Justice. Justice, these are my parents, Walter and Mabel Booth.\u201d They shook hands and her mother returned to the stove while her father went back to search for the butter. \u201cYour brother\u2019s in the backyard; why don\u2019t you take Justice out there and introduce him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to help?\u201d</p><p>Brenda must have sounded as incredulous as she felt, because Mable laughed and said, \u201cOh, after dinner for sure, but show your guest around for now.\u201d</p><p>Plush with thick grass, the backyard was so long it appeared too thin, but it was wider than the house it hid behind. It was the backyard she\u2019d grown up in, practicing soccer and watching over her younger brother.</p><p>Paul stood there now, bottle of beer in hand, back set to the house as he surveyed the yard. He turned when they opened the French doors that led onto the deck, face breaking into what Brenda mentally termed his professional smile.</p><p>He was dressed casually, in cargo shorts and a polo shirt. He\u2019d long since stopped being Brenda\u2019s \u201clittle\u201d brother in anything except age, towering over her at only an inch or two shy of Justice\u2019s six-foot two-inch frame. Paul held out a hand, smile firmly affixed to his face.</p><p>\u201cThis is my brother. Paul, this is Justice.\u201d</p><p>The men exchanged a quick handshake and polite greeting, and then Paul grabbed Brenda in a big hug.</p><p>\u201cSis! It\u2019s been way too long.\u201d He released her and gave her a pat on the back that almost made her stumble before turning his attention back to the tall man behind her.</p><p>Before Paul could start the small talk, their mom stuck her head out the French doors. \u201cBrenda, I do need your help after all. Your father is hopeless.\u201d</p><p>Brenda laughed. \u201cBe right in, Mom.\u201d Her mom disappeared back into the house.</p><p>The guys were already talking about baseball, and Justice shot her a quick smile without interrupting his conversation. She smiled back and headed for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSo I guess I should be asking the inevitable question; what are your intentions toward my sister?\u201d Paul asked, as soon as the door shut behind Brenda.</p><p>Justice raised an eyebrow at him. Paul\u2019s expression was still friendly, but the edge to his tone made Justice\u2019s muscles tense.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019d say my intentions, such as they are, are none of your business.\u201d Like Brenda\u2019s brother, he kept his smile firmly set.</p><p>Paul handed him a beer from the cooler sitting next to a large table on the deck. \u201cOh? Would you be satisfied with that answer if she were your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working together,\u201d he said finally. Blonde hair and Brenda\u2019s bright smile flashed in his mind, and he fought to maintain his polite expression. He could hardly blame the man for being protective about his sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her look at any of her coworkers like that.\u201d Paul\u2019s expression grew grim, and he looked Justice up and down. \u201cI don\u2019t want her getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou meet a lot of your sister\u2019s coworkers?\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned and Justice took a swig of his beer. He\u2019d thought not. He understood the concern, but it was misplaced. A kiss or two did not make him a threat to her. Hell, she didn\u2019t care about him, not really. She seemed to enjoy his company, liked to tease him, but hadn\u2019t acted like she cared much past that. And that was okay with him. He didn\u2019t need a woman in his life; he was better off alone, with no one to worry about but himself. They would catch Howler, solve this case, and things would go back to normal. His throat tightened and he took another sip of his beer.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s great. But I know how A-lister heroes like yourself are with normal women like her. I\u2019m not gonna let you\u2014\u201d Paul stopped talking as Justice took a step toward him.</p><p>Blood rushed to his ears. Paul expected him to treat Brenda badly just because she didn\u2019t have an impressive superpower. Did he really think so little of his sister? That she needed a superpower to make her memorable? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door opened and Brenda peeked out. \u201cDinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Justice,\u201d her mom said, as soon as they sat at the table, which was heaped full of roast beef with potatoes and carrots, a large salad, and her mom\u2019s homemade bread. \u201cWhat brought you to the Chicago area?\u201d</p><p>Brenda dragged her attention away from the mouth-watering scent of the roast filling the room to listen to his response.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cDay job, actually. Coming here was a kind of promotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d her mom said carefully. Asking questions of superheroes about their secret identities or day-lives as most people called them was usually a no-no. Mabel Booth was a superhero herself, and had a deep respect for keeping one\u2019s super and normal lives separate.</p><p>\u201cTell us about your case, dear,\u201d Brenda\u2019s father said, after Justice\u2019s silence made it apparent he wasn\u2019t going to offer up any more information.</p><p>She poked at her potatoes with her fork and tried to think of the best way to describe Howler. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing big, really. The villain\u2014Howler\u2014can knock people out with sonic waves. Makes my power useful for once.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have super strength or anything, he\u2019s kind of a skinny guy. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Justice frowned at her, but didn\u2019t contradict her story.</p> <p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s gotta be nice for you to get in the field for once.\u201d Paul shoved a big bite of roast in his mouth. \u201cNot like your power\u2019s usually good for a whole lot except getting in some quiet time,\u201d he said around the food.</p><p>Brenda stiffened in her seat but didn\u2019t argue. He was right; it was good to get out in the field, frightening as it was much of the time. And she couldn\u2019t argue with his opinion about her powers, though she was tempted to throw a chunk of roast at him for his lack of tact.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t take a powerful ability to be useful.\u201d Justice\u2019s voice was lower than usual, and when she glanced at him it surprised her to see his clenched jaw and the red color rising up his neck onto his face.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Paul said, apparently oblivious to the signs of Justice\u2019s anger. \u201cBut I mean, not as if our Bren\u2019s usually useful in a superhero capacity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d her mother said, voice full of warning. But Brenda noticed that her father\u2019s attention was all on Justice. Her father was a quiet man, not given to talking about much outside of football except on rare occasions, but he watched Justice like he\u2019d done something very interesting.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not an insult; it\u2019s just the way things are. Jeez, I didn\u2019t say she was useless or anything. Just her power.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer power saved the mayor of Chicago last night.\u201d Justice stood up from the table and leaned over to stare at Paul while he spoke. \u201cHer power saved an innocent elderly couple whose only crime was minding their store.\u201d He raised a hand from the table and pointed at Brenda. \u201cHer power is the only chance we have of catching a dangerous super villain.\u201d He tossed his napkin next to his plate. \u201cI\u2019d hardly call that useless, and you should have a little more respect.\u201d</p><p>Brenda gaped as he sat back down. Unable to take her eyes off him, she struggled to speak, to find something to say. But her mom was faster.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Paul,\u201d her mom said simply. \u201cWho\u2019s ready for cobbler?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Silence radiated from her during the drive home, and tension twined around her crossed arms, her clenched jaw, her fixed stare out the window. Whatever her problem was, it wasn\u2019t his fault. He defended her from that tactless jerk of a brother. She could stew about it or yell at him, but that was her call. Not his problem, not his conversation to start. But when they entered the house, his determination cracked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d he asked when she plopped her purse on the coffee table just a little too loudly.</p><p>She turned to face him, hands on her hips. \u201cWhat\u2019s my problem? What\u2019s your problem? I mean, I invite you to dinner with my family and you start a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother started it. I just finished it.\u201d His voice rose, and he made his way across the room so he stood only a few feet in front of her. \u201cHow could you expect me to just sit there when he was talking about you like that?\u201d</p> <p>Face flushed, she raised her chin and glared at him. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t talking about me, just my power. Look, I know he can be a jerk, but he\u2019s still my brother. And he\u2019s right, my power isn\u2019t exactly the most useful one around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Your power is as useful as you make it. You\u2019ve proven that to the Superhero League this week, why can\u2019t you believe it yourself?\u201d</p><p>She spluttered, \u201cI, that\u2019s not...this Howler thing is a unique situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, regardless of how you view it, I\u2019m not going to sit at a table\u2014your parents\u2019 or anyone else\u2019s\u2014and let someone degrade it\u2014and by extension, you\u2014without saying something.\u201d</p><p>Her bright eyes glinted with unshed tears, seeming even darker than normal, and her brows drew together in confusion. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>Simple words, but he struggled to answer her question. Why did he care so much? Why had he had to force himself not to jump across the table and knock that condescending grin off her brother\u2019s face? He looked down at his fists clenched against his sides. Because he cared, that\u2019s why. He gave a damn, even though it was stupid and dangerous and likely to get him hurt.</p><p>A soft touch on his shoulder brought his gaze back to her. Eyes wide with confusion and wonder stared back at him. She looked so goddamn beautiful and vulnerable, he ached to pull her into his arms. But she gripped his shoulder to balance with one hand and caressed the side of his face with the other. Rising onto her tiptoes, she drew him closer so she could kiss him.</p><p>Soft lips met his, and he wrapped his arm around her to settle his hand in the small of her back, the other he used to stroke her hip. The scent of his own shampoo surrounded him, blending with her lotion in a way that smelled better than anything. She smelled like his.</p><p>One of her hands brushed the back of his neck, and the other gripped his shoulder, like she feared falling if she let go. He deepened the kiss, lightly grazing her tongue with his, and she writhed against him.</p><p>He growled and pulled her closer, and the softness of her breasts pressed against his chest. God he wanted\u2014needed\u2014to see her, to touch that softness. To feel all of her under his hands, his body.</p><p>He pulled back for a moment and the sight of her knocked the air from his lungs. Lips swollen, her chest heaved as though she had to fight for air. She wanted him too, and that knowledge made him harden painfully.</p><p>She slid her hand from behind his neck to rest on his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing in the world,\u201d he murmured and then bent to take her mouth with his again.</p><p>She\u2019d been waiting for him to kiss her again, and could admit it to herself, if not to him. And seeing him defend her had only worsened her attraction, which had made her angrier, and hotter. It was a vicious cycle. Finally, she couldn\u2019t wait for him to make a move anymore. She had to kiss him.</p><p>Mouth hot against hers, he took her lips a second time, and she molded her body to his, feeling his heat through her clothes, and how much he wanted her pressed against her stomach. He was so hard, and she ached to touch all of him. To feel his hands all over her. To feel him inside her.</p><p>She touched the side of his face, and his skin was rough even though he\u2019d shaved before they left for her parents\u2019 house. Then she slid her hand through his hair to the back of his neck.</p><p>His tongue touched hers, testing. The moan escaped her before she realized it was coming, and he gripped her even more tightly to him.</p><p>The ache screaming from her chest and between her legs blossomed. But she wanted him too much. What would happen when this was all over? When he no longer needed to hide her in his home? He was a first rate superhero. She knew exactly what would happen.</p><p>But she still didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p><p>His mouth moved from hers and she made a noise in protest. But he didn\u2019t step away from her body, instead he traced small kisses and nibbles down her neck until he reached her collarbone. The smell of soap and fabric softener intermingled with the slight scent of sweat and an underlying smell of him. It overpowered her, took away her ability to think, to consider what they were doing and what it might mean.</p><p>His hand moved up her side, slipping under her shirt to graze her flesh with the rougher skin of his palm. But it wasn\u2019t enough; she needed to feel more of him, to have him naked against her.</p><p>Justice tugged at the buttons on her shirt, face intent with desire. Freeing her from it at last, he made a triumphant noise. He took one of her still-confined breasts in his hand, palming her before undoing her bra clasp.</p><p>He hissed at the sight of her naked breasts. Then he took her in his hand again. Massaging. Caressing. Loving. Raw jolts thrummed from where he ran his thumb over her nipple and it hardened into a small nub. She gasped as he took her other breast into his mouth. Licking and sucking and nibbling her to the brink.</p><p>She\u2019d imagined his mouth on her, more times than she cared to admit, but the fantasies fell far short of the reality. Every inch of her skin ached to be touched by his callused hands and soft mouth. Licked by his clever tongue.</p><p>He played with her, moving between her breasts with his hands and mouth. Each touch sent a jolt to her core. Giving them both equal attention until she cried out and squirmed in his arms. Thoughts flew from her head as he slipped her jeans off and she yanked at his shirt. He stepped back and pulled it off himself. But his eyes never left her.</p><p>He took her all in, her legs, her breasts, and her expression. The intensity in his gaze was almost frightening in its power. But it didn\u2019t scare her. His hungry eyes made her shiver with need. To be the target of such desire was overwhelming.</p><p>He slipped out of the rest of his clothes and she only had a moment to take in his sculpted body before he picked her up. She kissed his neck and chest while he carried her, tasting just a touch of salt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laid her carefully on the bed and she stared at him openly. A small smile on his face, he moved to cover her body with his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for so long,\u201d he whispered, his mouth so close to her, warmth touched her ear when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou never seemed to. I mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He cut off her argument by taking her mouth with his. His hands were everywhere, caressing her breasts, her stomach, her thighs. And when he slipped between her legs and touched her in her most sensitive place, her body arched toward him, almost out of her control.</p><p>\u201cAlways in those sexy little outfits. With your snappy comebacks and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin, I\u2014\u201d Words escaped her as his mouth was back on her skin, moving quickly down her body. Then his insistent tongue joined his hand between her thighs, stroking her to new heights. Within seconds, an explosion rocked her body. If he hadn\u2019t held her down, she would have flown off the bed, out of his room, into the sky. But he held her, whispering sweet words in her ear that she couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>His mouth was back on hers when she came back to herself. But she still couldn\u2019t think right, couldn\u2019t get enough air. And he moved against her in such a way she needed him even more desperately than she had before.</p><p>She reached between them, and gripped his arousal. He moaned against her neck, and she stroked him until he pulled her hand away.</p> <p>\u201cVixen,\u201d he muttered, and she let out a breathy laugh.</p><p>Then he was gone. She heard the snick of a condom wrapper, and his weight settled over her again before she could tell him to hurry. Propping himself on his elbows, he held her gaze, his dark eyes so intense with emotion her mouth went dry. Slowly, as if he was afraid to hurt her, he pushed himself into her heat.</p><p>Sweat touched his brow from the effort of moving slowly. But she didn\u2019t want slow. She needed him to take her with the same intensity she saw in his eyes.</p><p>She gripped his butt hard and writhed against him, her body aching and trembling with need. Groaning against her mouth, he moved. Thrusting and sliding in a delicious rhythm that she could barely keep up with. She flew again. This time, with Justice at her side.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The smell of bacon woke her, and she sat up in the bed, confused until the night\u2019s memories came rushing back to her. Justice, defending her against her brother\u2019s matter-of-fact insults. Justice, loving her with his hands, his mouth, his body. And Justice, who now seemed to be making her breakfast. She lay back down for a moment, reveling in the pleasantly warm afterglow that remained after an almost-sleepless, but entirely wonderful, night.</p> <p>After a few minutes of fighting the urge to slip back into sleep, Brenda forced herself out of bed. She grabbed a T-shirt from a clean pile that had yet to be put away from the top of his dresser and pulled it over her head. None of her clothing seemed to have made the trip with her, so she padded down to her room and grabbed underwear and a pair of cotton shorts she normally slept in.</p><p>The woman who greeted her in the bathroom mirror looked like she\u2019d spent the night being ravaged and doing a bit of ravaging herself. Brenda grinned stupidly and tried to get her hair into some semblance of order. When she was as good as she was going to get without a shower, she walked out to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMorning, beautiful,\u201d Justice\u2019s face lit with a masculine smile, and he pulled her into his arms for a kiss that made her heart race. \u201cI hope you like bacon,\u201d he said, giving her a wicked grin as he returned to the stove.</p><p>\u201cI love bacon,\u201d she replied, and the smell of it filled her nose as it sizzled on the stove, making her mouth water. She hoped cooking was a domestic skill he actually excelled at. It would be the only one she had seen evidence of since her arrival at his home.</p><p>He sent her from the kitchen and a few minutes later appeared in the dining room with two plates full of bacon, eggs, fried potatoes, and toast. Her arteries and waistline protested, but she dug into the food vigorously.</p><p>\u201cWow, you can cook,\u201d she said, after swallowing a perfectly fried potato.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d He grinned at her, almost halfway through with his plate. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t like to clean up\u2014and can\u2019t bake\u2014doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like to eat well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s on our agenda today,\u201d she asked, wondering how on earth he could eat so fast.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check in with the League, see what progress they\u2019ve made since yesterday. We need to find this guy soon, before he moves on.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. If they didn\u2019t get Howler, she would need to follow him wherever he moved on to. She was the only one with her particular power that she knew of, and she wouldn\u2019t feel right leaving some other group of superheroes to deal with what she was now thinking of as her mess. That would be tough to do; getting out of work now and then was okay, but she\u2019d feel like an irresponsible jerk if she had to just take off for weeks to find the guy. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you should stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She bristled at his tone. She didn\u2019t care how good the man was in bed, he couldn\u2019t give her orders. Well, technically being a League council member to her normal membership he could, but she wasn\u2019t about to let him get by on a technicality.</p><p>\u201cLook, Bren, I know you want to get this guy, but he wants to get you, too. I think it\u2019s best if you stay here where it\u2019s safe. I\u2019ll let you know if we need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf? Don\u2019t you mean when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He got up from the table and grabbed her plate along with his own, stopping to plant a kiss on the top of her head, and then headed for the kitchen.</p><p>A few minutes later he reappeared from the bedroom, wearing his uniform, with a long coat over it, probably to hide his appearance from his neighbors. He carried his mask in one hand, and his keys in the other. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch. Stay out of sight, and call me if you see any sign of him, okay?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a short nod and stiffened when he pulled her close for a kiss good-bye. As his Porsche roared out of the driveway, she muttered a curse under her breath. Who did he think she was? She wouldn\u2019t sit on the sidelines while other people got hurt hunting her villain. But he said he would call, and she trusted him, didn\u2019t she? He\u2019d call her if they found Howler, and she just have to keep from going crazy until then.</p><p>After washing the dishes, which Justice had conveniently left piled in the sink, Brenda took a shower and donned her practical superhero outfit, minus the mask, and then wandered around the house. She didn\u2019t mean to pry, but couldn\u2019t help herself from straightening up his room. She made the bed, and then glanced through the collection of books that lined his wall, most of which revolved around police procedures and evidence collection, with a few mystery novels thrown in, as well.</p><p>A quick peek into his nightstand drawers turned into a full-fledged search. The one on the side of the bed she\u2019d woken up on was nearly empty, save for some loose change and a long-forgotten travel-size bottle of aspirin. But the drawer on his side of the bed had a far more interesting stash.</p><p>Her face burned when she picked up the box of condoms and set them on top of the nightstand. He\u2019d torn them open with such haste that the top and half of one side was ripped away and was sitting in the drawer next to the box. Under that, she found a small container of mints and a half-empty wrapper of antacids.</p><p>Beneath those and still more change and an extra set of Porsche keys on a ring with other keys she couldn\u2019t so easily identify, was a small stack of photographs.</p><p>The pictures, nine in all, showed the smiling faces of an obviously happy family. The man in the picture sported the same hair, skin, and facial features as Justice, though his clothes placed him in an era before Justice was a man. The little boy in the photos had to be Justice. He wore the smile she\u2019d glimpsed only a few times since meeting him, wide and open, like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>The other two in the pictures could only be his mother and younger sister. The woman was blonde like Brenda, but her hair was a few shades darker. The little girl\u2019s long, blonde pigtails were much lighter than her mother\u2019s hair, at a young age anyway. After leafing through photographs of the family picnicking, boating, and sitting around a gorgeously decorated Christmas tree, Brenda placed the pictures and other items back into the drawer.</p><p>Guilt tugged at her, but she couldn\u2019t help feeling happy after glimpsing that cheerful family. Justice had never mentioned them. It was probably a sore subject since he\u2019d moved to Chicago and likely didn\u2019t get to see them as much as he wanted to anymore, but it surprised her he hadn\u2019t at least said something about them in passing.</p><p>The sound of her cell phone interrupted her thoughts, and she shut the drawer and sprinted down the hall to grab it off the coffee table. She frowned at her work number, but flipped the phone open.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda?\u201d Maria\u2019s voice sounded frantic.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Maria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get in touch with that superhero you were with the other day? Something\u2019s happening here at the hospital; we\u2019ve called the police but\u2014\u201d Abruptly, all sound on the line stopped.</p><p>\u201cMaria? Maria what\u2019s going on?\u201d Brenda pulled the cell phone away from her ear and looked at it. The screen read: Call Failed.</p><p>She grabbed her purse from the coffee table and tossed her phone in. She would call Justice on her way. After making a quick stop in the spare bedroom to grab her mask, she hit the road.</p><p>Justice hadn\u2019t even arrived at the Chicago League\u2019s headquarters when his cell phone rang. He flipped his phone open.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have an address for you.\u201d StrongArm\u2019s voice was calm, like always, but the hint of worry in his tone that made Justice\u2019s stomach clench.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He arrived at Pranier Medical less than ten minutes after hanging up, a new record of breaking traffic laws left in his wake. He made his way through the police barricade just forming around the hospital. StrongArm, Char, and Violet stood in the parking lot, around a hundred yards from the front entrance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do we have?\u201d he asked. His phone rang and he glanced down at the number. Brenda. He hit the button to silence the ringer.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Silencer?\u201d Violet looked behind him, as if Brenda would suddenly appear from thin air.</p><p>\u201cHowler\u2019s taken the hospital; a large section of it, anyway. We\u2019re not sure what his game is yet. He hasn\u2019t released a list of demands.\u201d StrongArm\u2019s voice had calmed again to near perfect.</p> <p>\u201cHow many hostages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many directly with him, less than a dozen we think. But there are patients and personnel on other levels who haven\u2019t been able to evacuate yet. We\u2019re getting them out the back, but who knows if he\u2019ll continue to let us.\u201d StrongArm\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cWe need to get in there. Where is Silencer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, call her in.\u201d StrongArm wasn\u2019t asking.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think about this, Strong. He\u2019s got a history of stalking her, and now he\u2019s attacking here, her workplace. He has it out for her or something. We can\u2019t bring her here where he can get to her.\u201d</p> <p>StrongArm frowned and ran a hand over his full mustache, only a slight expression touched his face, but it was the most expressive Justice had ever seen him. \u201cSilencer works here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d Violet said, and her exasperated tone grated on his ears. \u201cSo what if he has it out for her or has a thing for her? That\u2019s good for us. We can use it against him. She can get close, take him out easier that way. Call her in, Justice.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a level stare. \u201cDid you get promoted to The Council while I wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d</p><p>She glared back at him, eyes full of venom, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not arguing among ourselves,\u201d StrongArm began.</p><p>\u201cThis is a pointless conversation,\u201d Char said, cutting in. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of bringing her in any more than you do. But the fact of the matter is, we need her. We stand a much better chance of taking Howler out with her help, and she would want to be called in. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re trying to change the plan now.\u201d Her eyebrows drew together in confusion, but her voice and expression lacked the anger radiating from Violet.</p> <p>Justice opened his mouth to argue, but no one was looking at him. Something had caught their attention behind him.</p><p>Brenda met his gaze as she rushed from her car. She wore her black uniform and it fit her like a tight leather glove. He licked his lips. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here? Why didn\u2019t you call me, that\u2019s the question that needs to be answered, Justice.\u201d Her eyes lit up with anger, and her hands clenched tightly at her sides.</p><p>StrongArm spoke before Justice could pull together an answer in his mind. \u201cHowler has taken over much of the first floor, Silencer. He has hostages, we think around a dozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he at on the first floor?\u201d she asked, skin paling around her mask.</p><p>\u201cNear the front doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she said, \u201cyou mean near the pharmacy.\u201d She closed her eyes for a few moments, seeming to gather her thoughts. When she opened them, her attention was focused on StrongArm. \u201cI got a call from a coworker inside the hospital pharmacy. We were disconnected before she could tell me anything, but I think he\u2019s targeted her\u2014targeting them\u2014because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustice told us about your relationship with the hospital. Are you sure you\u2019re okay to go in?\u201d StrongArm asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d He nodded at her, only the slight smile on his face revealed how much he approved of her decision, her courage. \u201cYou and Justice will go in the front. If he knows you work here, he\u2019ll be expecting you regardless; might as well send you in where he can see you. Char, Violet and I will come in through the back. We\u2019ll try to get the drop on him if you can keep him busy, but if you see an opening, Silencer, you take it. Backup is en route, they\u2019ll move in if we fail, but they\u2019ll concentrate on getting patients and hospital personnel out when they get here.\u201d</p><p>Brenda nodded, her skin seeming to pale even further, and her lips stood out even darker against it. More than anything, Justice wanted to take those lips with his own, kiss her\u2014distract her\u2014and take her away to somewhere safe. But he couldn\u2019t, and she wouldn\u2019t thank him for trying, so he simply nodded at StrongArm and followed Brenda toward the front door of the hospital.</p><p>He touched her shoulder when he got close and she shrugged off his hand, and then stopped and turned to face him. \u201cYou should have called me or come back to the house and picked me up the second you found out he was at my hospital, Justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t want you anywhere near the guy, okay? He\u2019s fixated on you, and he\u2019s dangerous. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s capable of, and I didn\u2019t want you getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but the expression didn\u2019t touch her eyes. \u201cFunny thing is, I was actually starting to buy that crap line you were giving me about me being just as good a superhero as the next guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a line, you are just as good\u2014better\u2014than most heroes, Brenda. I just....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, unable to put how he felt into words. The fear that gripped him at the idea of her facing off with Howler, the unbearable pressure in his chest at the thought of her getting hurt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d she said, and then turned and stomped up to the front entrance of Pranier Medical.</p><p>Justice barely suppressed a growl and followed her through the doors.</p><p>The second they entered, Howler stepped out from the door that led into the pharmacy. Justice yelled and ran for the villain, but as he reached Brenda, the sound wave hit. The dark gray-and-maroon commercial-grade carpet rose toward his face, and then everything went dark.</p><p>Brenda pulled her power up the second she saw Howler. Elation rushed through her when she realized she got it up in time. Then she watched, aghast, as Justice fell like a puppet whose strings were cut. She stared at him for a few precious moments before remembering the threat wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>Howler appeared to be laughing, so hard that he doubled over for a few seconds before righting himself. Tears ran down his face, and he did a little dance around Justice, surveying his handiwork with glee.</p><p>Brenda\u2019s mind worked in slow motion, her thoughts were scattered, and she couldn\u2019t seem to bring them into focus. What was she supposed to do now? Try to take the villain, hand to hand? He might be a small man, but he still outweighed her. If he had her training in martial arts, he\u2019d likely win if she attacked. But what else could she do?</p><p>Steeling herself for her first real fight, Brenda put her arms up and forced her shaking hands into fists. She took a determined step forward toward Howler.</p><p>He stopped laughing when he saw her, expression turning thoughtful, and then he held out a hand like a police officer stopping cars so kids could cross the street.</p><p>Brenda paused, confused. Howler pulled a piece of paper from the utility belt of his uniform. After unfolding the note, he held it out in front of him. It read: Let\u2019s talk.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and studied him. He wanted to talk? His face was open, eager and he looked like he was on the edge of jumping around again; twitchy little man. But she needed to distract him and keep him that way until StrongArm, Char, and Violet showed up to help her. Talking seemed like a better way to do that than trying to beat on him until they arrived.</p><p>Tentatively, she turned off her power. \u201cOkay, what do you want to talk about?\u201d She braced herself and watched him for the quick intake of air that would reveal his intent to use his power, but he only smiled at her and clapped his hands quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Silencer, you don\u2019t know how badly I\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d She moved in a little closer; if she had to try to take him down, she would have a better chance of surprising him if she was close.</p><p>\u201cI think you would make the perfect newest member of my gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d She stopped in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cMy gang,\u201d he said, carefully enunciating the last word so she could be sure to understand. \u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t think I was working alone, did you?\u201d He laughed, a wheezing sound that hurt her ears, and she decided he\u2019d probably been practicing his super villain laugh for far too long.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen you work with anyone else.\u201d Keep him talking, Brenda, she told herself.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I was alone until I got here,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t long after that my gang really got off the ground.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and he looked at her quizzically, her reaction clearly not what he expected. Then his face lit up as if he\u2019d finally solved a puzzle. \u201cYou\u2019ll be my second in command, of course. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to report to anyone except me.\u201d He took a long step toward her, and she tensed her muscles, ready for an attack.</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d she said, and he stopped only a couple of feet from her.</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Silencer. I want you to be my number one sidekick. And if you\u2019re uncomfortable going out in the field, don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019d much rather have you around my lair to...keep me company.\u201d He raked his gaze down the length of her body, and she suddenly felt filthy and in desperate need of a shower.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said, trying to keep her voice free of the disgust she felt.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d he crooned, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to play hard to get with me.\u201d</p><p>With effort, Brenda kept her eyes fixed on Howler as StrongArm rounded the corner. Char stalked behind him and Violet brought up the rear. Howler started to turn, but StrongArm was on him, holding the man in a giant bear hug, he clasped his hand over Howler\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Brenda whooped and jumped in the air, unable to maintain her stoicism in the face of catching the man who\u2019d stalked her. Char grinned and walked over to her, giving her a solid high-five with her gloved hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, a loud thump sounded and StrongArm stiffened; then his eyes rolled back and he fell to the floor with a thud. Howler twisted out of his grip at the last moment and avoided being squashed under the large man\u2019s heavy frame. Violet stood behind them, a triumphant smile on her face. She held a piece of hospital equipment in her hands that Brenda didn\u2019t recognize, some kind of metal box, and she tossed it to the side where it crashed into a wall.</p><p>Char froze for a moment, and then lunged for Violet. Howler filled his lungs, and Brenda used her power even as she called to her friend to watch out. Char went down, falling on top of StrongArm. Violet, face twisting into a snarl, also fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cChar!\u201d Brenda screamed, but her power drowned out the sound of her voice.</p> <p>Howler\u2019s mouth was open, and his eyes widened as she watched. At first she thought he was screaming, but quickly realized he was laughing, though it was silent to her ears.</p><p>She bared her teeth and lunged at Howler. Pain shot down her arm as her fist slammed into his nose. A whiff of cologne hit her, pungent and foul. Had he bathed in the stuff?</p><p>Howler stumbled back, both hands covering his face. Blood dribbled down his chin, marring the front of his uniform. He screamed something and dove at her.</p><p>Stars flew through Brenda\u2019s vision as her head slammed into the floor. Howler weighed her down after tackling her, and she blinked to try to clear her sight. He was all teeth, screaming at her. She couldn\u2019t hear the words, but it didn\u2019t take a lip-reader to make out the profanities he spewed.</p><p>How much time had passed? Could the other superheroes do anything if they walked in now? She struggled to think, to move. She wriggled under him trying to break free from his grip on her shoulders. He moved his hands and tried to grasp her neck, his face full of rage.</p> <p>Squirming out from under him, she slapped at him frantically. She gasped as she broke free and crawled away from the villain. Scanning the room, her eyes settled on the machine Violet had used to knock out StrongArm. Her knees protested as she wormed her way across the hard floor.</p><p>Howler\u2019s foot connected with her gut and her breath flew from her lungs. Air refused to fill her chest as she lay on her side, gasping. He kicked her again, almost losing his balance. The pain in her stomach was so severe she couldn\u2019t even flinch as he moved in for in for another kick.</p><p>Movement in her peripheral vision caught her attention. Something black advanced toward them, and Howler didn\u2019t attack again. She pulled her head from the ground and dragged herself toward the equipment. She didn\u2019t bother looking behind her; there was no time.</p><p>Still gasping for air, she pushed up to her knees when she reached the metal box. Wires stuck out of it from a couple of different points as if it had been ripped from the wall or a stand. It looked like something that might report vital signs.</p><p>The cold and heavy weight in her hands, she struggled up and turned to face Howler. Justice lay at his feet. Brenda hesitated, confused. Hadn\u2019t Justice been on the other side of the room?</p><p>Howler didn\u2019t seem to see her; he glared at Justice. Blood pouring from his nose intermingled with blood from a cut on his forehead and a fresh shiner on his eye that she was certain she hadn\u2019t caused. His uniform was ripped; one arm hung only loosely attached to the rest of suit.</p> <p>A surge of energy hit her and she ran at Howler. He saw her, eyes widening and mouth opening to lob more curses at her, but he didn\u2019t move. Not fast enough. When she got close, she swung the heavy metal box she carried at his face, catching him square in the jaw. He clutched at the wall behind him before melting to the floor.</p><p>Brenda watched as he fell, and then tossed her weapon to the side, taking care not to hit anyone. Justice was paler than usual, and blood marred one side of his head. His ear bled, but his chest moved up and down in a normal rhythm.</p><p>Shooting Howler a quick glance to reassure herself he was still not moving, Brenda touched her mind and turned off her power. Sounds came rushing back. People yelled. They were close, but their sounds were muffled behind a wall or two from where she knelt. Police sirens wailed.</p><p>\u201cJustice?\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cJustice, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Her legs didn\u2019t want to work, but she forced herself up and out the front door. She waved at the police officers on the line before collapsing onto the hard asphalt.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The next hour was a blur. Paramedics hauled her onto a stretcher, ignoring her protests and demands that they wheel her back into the hospital so she could check on Justice. StrongArm trudged out of the hospital. The first superhero to appear from inside, he stopped to talk to her. He ignored the paramedics who hung around him, fluttering.</p><p>\u201cSilencer, can you tell me what happened?\u201d He accepted an ice pack from an emergency worker with a nod of thanks.</p> <p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI was struggling with Howler when you guys got there. He\u2019d already knocked out Justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet hit you over the head with a metal box, some sort of medical equipment.\u201d She paused, her chest suddenly heavy with the weight of her words. \u201cGod, Violet. She was with him. She betrayed us.\u201d</p><p>StrongArm\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but he touched her lightly on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe struggled after he knocked out Char. He had me on the ground when Justice got him off me.\u201d She blinked back tears and tried to swallow the lump in her throat. \u201cIs he okay? The paramedics won\u2019t help me back in.\u201d Her voice grew frantic. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can walk that far yet on my own. Did you see him? Is he\u2014\u201d</p><p>StrongArm grasped both of her shoulders, and she bit back a moan, wincing. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered and let her go. \u201cThey\u2019re only bringing in patients that absolutely need to see a doctor now; that\u2019s why you\u2019re out here. Had to clear out Howler and Violet before they\u2019d open the place back up again. Justice is in with the doctor. They\u2019re having a hard time waking him. Since he got hit twice at such close proximity, they\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to her feet and StrongArm caught her just as her knees threatened to give out. \u201cI have to see him. Can you help me get in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tough. You need to worry about yourself right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Can you get me to him or not?\u201d She met his gaze and refused to look away.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cAll right. Wait here and I\u2019ll find a wheelchair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust help me!\u201d She glared at him. What kind of self-respecting superhero let herself be pushed around in a wheelchair when she was able to walk, albeit barely?</p><p>StrongArm raised an eyebrow at her order but offered her his arm. She limped up to the hospital, through the front doors, keeping her face as expressionless as she could manage. And she hoped that no one noticed how hard she clung to the man\u2019s muscled arm.</p><p>The trip to the emergency room area where the hospital housed Justice seemed to take forever. Each step reminded Brenda of how rough the fight had actually been, and the slowness of her progress did nothing to stymie her anxiousness.</p><p>They found him lying on a gurney behind a curtain. A nurse stood over him, clipboard in hand, and she offered them a professional smile when they approached.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d StrongArm asked as Brenda jogged\u2014the fastest gait she could manage\u2014to Justice\u2019s side.</p><p>She took his hand in her own, careful not to move or disturb any of the cords running from him to the machines that lined the wall behind his bed. He was so pale, but she didn\u2019t see any injuries save a small bruise forming under his right eye. They\u2019d cleaned the blood up that had drizzled from his ear down his neck. StrongArm and the nurse\u2019s voices faded into the background as she watched Justice\u2019s face, wishing she possessed the ability to make him well through the strength of her will alone.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d StrongArm touched her shoulder and she jumped.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look away from Justice. \u201cIs he going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tough.\u201d StrongArm didn\u2019t remove his hand from her shoulder, and moved to stand closer to her instead. \u201cHe has a blown eardrum in his left ear, and he\u2019s stunned from the repeated sonic screams. He has a goose egg on the back of his head, too, from one of the times he hit the ground, I guess.\u201d StrongArm squeezed her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s sedated right now, but he came to a while ago. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Brenda nodded, not trusting herself to speak. But when she brought a hand up and covered her mouth, she realized her cheeks were wet. She was crying, and she hadn\u2019t even noticed. What was wrong with her?</p><p>As she stared down at Justice, the man who\u2019d saved her more than once, and who, more than that, had made this week the most fulfilling of her life in every way possible, she knew.</p><p>She loved him.</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t entirely dark, and it took him a moment before the memories of the day came back to him. Brenda fighting Howler. Howler standing over her, kicking her repeatedly. Pain and rage and fear. Howler\u2019s neck under his hands. Then...nothing.</p><p>He tensed when something moved at his side, but relaxed when he saw StrongArm. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>StrongArm handed him a plastic pink cup with a straw peeking out from the top. Justice sipped the water and cleared his throat. \u201cWhere\u2019s Brenda?\u201d he asked, voice stronger.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She was here until they forced her into her own room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. Some cracked ribs, heavy bruising.\u201d StrongArm crossed his arms. \u201cHer hand is badly bruised from breaking Howler\u2019s nose.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. She got pretty beat-up, but she\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>Pain lanced through his head as he pushed himself up from the bed, holding a hand out in warning when the other man moved to stop him. \u201cI have to see her, Ben. I have to.\u201d</p><p>StrongArm\u2019s face broke out into a deep frown at the use of his real name, but he helped him up from the bed. \u201cYour headache should go away in the next day or two. The doctor said there\u2019s no permanent damage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Justice stood on his own when they reached the door. But he stopped in the doorway, a sudden thought snapping into place in his mind. \u201cWhat happened to Howler?\u201d he asked, turning to face his friend.</p><p>His expression turned smug. \u201cShe took him down. Knocked him out so the League could take him into custody. We have Violet, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet?\u201d he muttered, but he\u2019d already turned from his friend and headed down the hall.</p> <p>\u201cShe was in league with Howler,\u201d StrongArm explained. \u201cTruthSeer questioned her earlier. Guess she decided she could make some easy money after she figured out Silencer\u2019s identity. She saw her working in the pharmacy. Violet didn\u2019t count on Howler actually wanting her to help him. She couldn\u2019t figure a way out of it once she was roped in, so she went with it.\u201d</p><p>Justice grunted and shook his head.</p><p>They reached Brenda\u2019s room and though shadowed like every room in the hospital, it wasn\u2019t really dark. Her bruised face and neck stood out in stark contrast to her pale skin. One of her eyes was swollen and her lip was split.</p><p>Air escaped his chest in a haggard breath. It took every bit of his self-control to keep from groaning at the sight of her. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. And it wouldn\u2019t have, if only he\u2019d protected her like he should have.</p><p>He clenched his fists at his side to keep from hitting the hospital room wall. She wouldn\u2019t be hurt if he hadn\u2019t talked her into facing Howler in the first place. If he hadn\u2019t convinced her of her power.</p> <p>It was all his fault.</p><p>The sound of her mother\u2019s voice roused Brenda from her drug-induced sleep, and for a moment she considered pretending to still be asleep. But her mom\u2019s angry tone couldn\u2019t be ignored, so she suppressed a sigh and opened her eyes.</p><p>Sunlight streamed in through the hospital room window, illuminating her mother and a doctor in a white coat. Mabel Booth\u2019s finger was pointed squarely at the poor older gentleman\u2019s chest. Her lips were drawn into a firm line.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Brenda said, her voice hoarse, \u201cleave the doctor alone before you get yourself kicked out of the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda! Thank goodness you\u2019re awake.\u201d Her mom hurried the two feet to Brenda\u2019s bedside. Her swollen eyes lit up, and a stab of guilt ran through Brenda for making her worry enough to cry.</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d Brenda asked, and was rewarded with a sip from a hospital cup. Though lukewarm, it slid down her throat, delicious and wet.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d the doctor asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d Brenda moved a bit in the bed, testing her muscles. \u201cA little sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d her mother began, and Brenda braced herself for the lecture that would follow, for the warning that she needed to be more careful. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d Brenda asked, flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cYou took down a terrible villain. I\u2019m so sorry we haven\u2019t been more supportive. We should have known you had it in you, it\u2019s just...we worry.\u201d She smiled, practically glowing with pride.</p><p>Brenda stared at her, unable to form words. They were proud of her? Knew she had it in her? Since when?</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t ask that, not when her mother looked so content. So instead she muttered, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you woke up just in time. Your friend is giving a press conference about the whole thing.\u201d Her mom reached over and grabbed a remote from the stand next to the bed. Pointing it at a small television mounted on the wall, she pressed a button and the TV flared to life.</p> <p>A pretty brunette newswoman appeared on the screen with a perfect professional smile affixed to her face. She summarized the events of the day before, with a few key details left out. Details like Violet\u2019s involvement and specifics about Howler\u2019s apprehension. She also made no mention of why Howler had chosen Pranier Medical to hold hostage, other than to suppose it must have been because of the general high-class status of its patients. After a few minutes of discussion back and forth between her and the news anchor, the camera panned to a podium surrounded by reporters.</p><p>Justice\u2019s serious face took up much of the screen when he stepped up to talk about what the reporters had dubbed the \u201cPranier Medical Attack.\u201d Brenda grinned at the title and decided that creativity was perhaps not the first requirement of a reporter, for that particular network anyway. Face nearly untouched by the events of the previous day, save a small bruise that was mostly covered by his mask, he appeared every bit the heroic superhero Brenda knew him to be. But then Howler hadn\u2019t needed to hit him, and he\u2019d obviously avoided landing on his face.</p><p>After a few seconds the reporters quieted down and waited eagerly for Justice\u2019s statement.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming. As you know, Pranier Medical was subject to an attack yesterday. While his reason for targeting Pranier is unknown, we can make the assumption that he was likely targeting its patients in general. We do not believe he had a specific mark in mind, unlike when he took the mayor hostage earlier in the week.\u201d Justice\u2019s face was expressionless, the area around his eyes covered with his mask, and his voice was steady.</p><p>Brenda frowned at the screen. She hadn\u2019t really expected him to tell the press Howler targeted Pranier Medical to lure her in\u2014he was no doubt trying to protect her secret identity\u2014but she also hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d outright lie.</p><p>Justice\u2019s voice pulled her from her thoughts as he answered a question she missed from a reporter. \u201cA team of superheroes led by myself and StrongArm took down Howler late yesterday afternoon. A superhero named Silencer was key in the takedown, due to her unusual power to turn off her hearing and block sonic waves from affecting her person.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interview faded into a game of reporters posing questions, which Justice promptly danced around without actually answering. The press never mentioned Brenda\u2019s alter ego, and her stomach dropped. She shouldn\u2019t be disappointed. She wasn\u2019t a publicity-seeking lunkhead after all. But it hurt to not receive even a passing interest from the reporters after her first takedown.</p><p>\u201cCan you turn it off, please?\u201d Brenda said to her mom, who frowned at the screen.</p><p>Her mother clicked off the set and smiled at her daughter, though it didn\u2019t touch her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get you checked out of here, shall we?\u201d</p><p>After an hour of getting forms finalized and instructions from the doctor to stay off her feet for a few days, Brenda and her mother hit the road.</p><p>\u201cPaul and your dad are waiting for us at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I don\u2019t want or need to stay with you. I\u2019m fine,\u201d she protested. Her mom glanced at her and she glimpsed an extra brightness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Brenda said, unable to face the idea of her mother crying over her twice in one day. \u201cBut only until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her mom relaxed and nodded.</p><p>The look of worry on her father\u2019s face didn\u2019t surprise Brenda, but Paul\u2019s red-rimmed eyes did. Her brother pulled her into a tight, but careful, hug as soon as she cleared the doorway and held her until she hugged him back.</p><p>He loosened his grip and stepped away so he could see her face. \u201cBrenda, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t take this seriously before. I should have been out there with you, not sitting on my butt enjoying my vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Paul. We got the villain, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget I also kicked some ass.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be forgetting that anytime soon.\u201d He laughed and stepped aside so her father could give her a quick hug, too.</p><p>The newspaper sat on the kitchen table, so Brenda grabbed it to read while her mom warmed up some leftovers. Her stomach rumbled at the scent of roast and potatoes, and she smiled to herself. She would wait until tomorrow to talk to Justice. For now, being in her family\u2019s care felt pretty darn good.</p><p>Pictures of Howler, Justice, and StrongArm covered the front page of the newspaper. She read through the article, and got nearly to the end of the story before she realized she gripped the paper so tightly her hands hurt.</p><p>It was all Justice, all StrongArm. No mention of her, of Char. No hint in the whole damn thing that someone other than Justice might have helped save the day.</p><p>She found her purse where she\u2019d dropped it on the couch and yanked out her cell phone. No missed calls. No warnings or explanations from Justice. Nothing.</p><p>She flipped the phone open and found him in her contact lists, and then snapped it shut. No. This wasn\u2019t a conversation she could have over the phone.</p><p>Justice threw the newspaper onto the table and cursed. He\u2019d done his best to keep the reporters in the dark about Howler\u2019s obsession with Silencer, knowing she wouldn\u2019t like the speculation that might come with that information. But he had credited her as the main reason they\u2019d been able to take down Howler. He should have known when the reporter blinked in confusion when he\u2019d explained Silencer\u2019s power that she might not think it impressive enough to mention in the article.</p><p>As if they could have taken down Howler without it or her.</p><p>Banging at the front door pulled him from his thoughts. The figure framed through the glass was familiar, and his stomach dropped.</p><p>Brenda didn\u2019t say anything, but shoved past him to pace in the space between his dining room table and the back of the couch. He winced at the sight of her still-bruised face. The pink tinge to her skin and the hard line of her mouth made it clear she\u2019d seen the article.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he blurted out, unable to stand her angry silence any longer.</p><p>\u201cHow am I?\u201d she asked, voice tense. But she didn\u2019t answer the question. Instead, she glared at him, jaw muscles twitching.</p><p>\u201cLook, Brenda, I\u2019m sorry. I know the article\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t credit anyone except you for taking down Howler? Of course you know about it! You were the source of the damn story!\u201d She took a deep breath, closing her eyes. When she opened them again, some of the anger had drained from her expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know this isn\u2019t something you would do on purpose. I know that.\u201d She nodded as if convincing herself as she spoke. \u201cI should have given you a chance to explain. It\u2019s just, after everything....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opened his mouth to tell her the truth; that he hadn\u2019t left her out of the explanation. That the reporter had screwed the story up. But before the words left his mouth, he snapped it shut. He\u2019d already hurt her, even in the short time they\u2019d known each other well. She\u2019d hurt him, too. Nothing was irreversible\u2014yet. But if he explained and it worked out, he could lose her. Lose her to a super villain or in a less spectacular, but still permanent, way. He\u2019d learned that the hard way. Was it worth the potential pain?</p><p>He looked at her, taking in her wide eyes, her healing split lip, the obvious unhappiness on her face.</p><p>Because of him.</p> <p>If he told her, she\u2019d forgive him, and he\u2019d never get up the courage to leave. With her, he wouldn\u2019t be able to go halfway. He already cared too much.</p><p>Caring deeply always ended in pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThe reporter was hot.\u201d</p><p>The slap rang out, seeming to echo off the walls. He glimpsed her tear-filled eyes and reached out to her, but she dodged and ran out the door.</p><p>The weight on his chest threatened to suffocate him and he tried to breathe. He\u2019d known not telling Brenda the truth would hurt her, but he hadn\u2019t realized the hole it would leave in his own chest.</p> <p>He walked back to the bedroom and pulled the stack of pictures from his nightstand drawer, and pretended that the burning in his eyes wasn\u2019t tears.</p><p>Brenda clutched the steering wheel of her car so tightly her hands ached. The night spent at her parents\u2019 place was rough, even with their awkward sympathy. After rushing out of the house and taking her mother\u2019s car, she could hardly pretend nothing happened. Hiding her emotions had also proved difficult, but showing themselves beyond considerate, her family hadn\u2019t pressed her for information. Not that they needed to. All the particulars necessary to put it together were in that damn newspaper.</p><p>She parked in her usual spot and walked up to her apartment. Silence greeted her and she gritted her teeth. She could do this. She\u2019d managed fine on her own before Justice appeared in her life. And she was a hero. Oh, she\u2019d always had her superpower, but now she knew how strong she was. She\u2019d taken out a super villain.</p><p>If nothing else, Justice had given her that confidence.</p><p>The vacuum drowned out her thoughts as she started on cleaning her home. Cleaning, she\u2019d found, was a good distraction from almost any problem. She ran the machine through her room and back out into the living room, and then shut it off to scoot the coffee table out of the way. She took a step then stopped, staring dumbly at the man standing next to her couch.</p><p>Jeans and a T-shirt adorned his body. Her heart quickened, thumping against her chest. How could he be even sexier in casual clothes than he was in uniform? Life just wasn\u2019t fair.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the door was unlocked, and you didn\u2019t seem to hear me knocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She yanked on the vacuum cord and grimaced as it finally gave, whipping around the corner to smack into the hallway wall.</p><p>\u201cCan we sit?\u201d He shifted on his feet, and his lack of confidence suddenly made her think of the little boy in the pictures.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou can sit all you want. I have an apartment to clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenda,\u201d he said, and then reached out and grasped her lightly by her shoulders, \u201cplease, just hear me out.\u201d</p><p>She met his pleading eyes with a hard stare, but finally she gave a short nod. They sat on the couch, and she yanked her hands back when he tried to take them into his own. He winced, but didn\u2019t try again.</p><p>\u201cI lied to you.\u201d He reached out and placed a finger on her lips when she opened her mouth to interrupt. \u201cPlease, let me get this out, okay?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and stared at the coffee table. Fine. If he needed to assuage his guilt to move on and leave her alone, it would be better than dealing with him repeatedly as he tried to get whatever it was off his chest. She wasn\u2019t sure she could stand to see him all the time. Her heart couldn\u2019t take it.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday, when you came to talk to me about the article, I lied and let you think I was attracted to that reporter and left you out of the story purposefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what, you\u2019re telling me she wasn\u2019t your cup of tea now?\u201d She\u2019d seen the caption photo of the reporter. He had another think coming if he thought she was going to buy that.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cAnd tell you another lie? No, she was pretty enough, but I wasn\u2019t interested. I know it sounds like a clich\u00e9, but you\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve had eyes for since we started this investigation. Well, before that, really, if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d</p><p>She risked a quick glance at him, but he didn\u2019t seem to be joking. She held out a hand, gesturing for him to continue with his explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou saw the pictures, in my nightstand?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to deny it, and then shrugged. \u201cYeah, I saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. They weren\u2019t in the order I always keep them.\u201d</p><p>Brenda frowned and looked at his face. But he wasn\u2019t watching her anymore, his gaze had settled onto his hands sitting in his lap. Order? Nothing else in his house made her think he was neat enough to have an order to anything, let alone some old pictures.</p><p>\u201cThey were my family, as you\u2019ve probably guessed. They....\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cThey died. When I was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open, and before she could think, words tumbled from her mouth. \u201cOh God, Justice. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She pulled him close for a hug, but his arms stayed in his lap, so after a couple of seconds, she moved back. \u201cWas it a super villain?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a short sound filled with no amusement. \u201cNope. Drunk driver. Took all three of them out.\u201d He looked up at her, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears. \u201cThey were superheroes, Brenda, in every sense of the word. But their powers weren\u2019t anything flashy, nothing that was able to save them from something so...mundane. That\u2019s why I became a police officer, so I could help people hurt by non-supers, too.\u201d</p><p>Justice reached to the end table behind him and grabbed a tissue from the blue box. He handed it to her, and she realized her cheeks were wet. She dabbed at them and muttered a thank you.</p><p>\u201cI have other family\u2014cousins, aunts and uncles. But I\u2019ve never let myself get close to them. I always figured if I did, it would just hurt too damn badly when I lost one.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s why I pushed you away yesterday, Brenda. I love you. But I\u2019m scared to death I\u2019m going to lose you, too. When I saw you on that hospital bed....\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat was my fault. My fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault!\u201d she cried. \u201cThe only one responsible was Howler. You gave me the confidence to face him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! If I hadn\u2019t talked you into it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what, Justice? More people would have gotten hurt, that\u2019s what. You helped me get the confidence to save people; then you saved me when Howler was trying to beat me to death.\u201d She took in a ragged breath. \u201cYou were there when I needed you. If you hadn\u2019t been, I might be dead. Other people\u2014innocent people\u2014could have paid for it with their lives.\u201d</p><p>Some of the bleakness faded from his expression. \u201cWe did kick his ass, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled out of her. \u201cWe did.\u201d Tentatively, she took one of his hands and held it with both of her own. \u201cAnd I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Justice lifted her off the couch and kissed her, softly to avoid hurting her still-healing lip, until her head spun. When he finally set her down, her heart raced for a very different reason than when he\u2019d barged into her apartment.</p><p>His face close to hers, he leaned in and grazed her ear with his lips, and then whispered, \u201cSay you\u2019ll be with me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her head back and met his gaze with her own. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop being a superhero,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t give up part of myself so that you can be sure I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. You might just have to put up with me at your side from time to time.\u201d He grinned at her, and her heart warmed.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can handle that,\u201d she said, hope and love and other emotions she couldn\u2019t identify bubbling out of her chest.</p><p>Justice whooped and pulled her close. And she knew she was home. </p> </body></html>"]
