The more I tried to ignore it, the more unbearable it became: an itch that needed to be scratched, a scream bubbling to the surface. My father said that the urgent need to run when things were about to go wrong was a like a tic, a defense mechanism inherent in the Abernathys. I\u2019d felt it moments before the fire, and I was feeling it now.</p> <p>Sitting in Travis\u2019s bedroom, just hours after the fire, my heart raced and my muscles twitched. My gut pulled me toward the door. Told me to leave; to get away, anywhere but here. But for the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t want to go alone. I could barely focus on that voice I loved so much describing how afraid he was of losing me, and how he was close to escaping when he ran in the opposite direction, toward me. So many people died, some of them strangers from State but some were people I\u2019d seen in the cafeteria, in class, at other fights.</p><p>We somehow survived and were sitting alone in his apartment, trying to process it all. Feeling afraid, feeling guilty . . . about those who died, and that we had lived. My lungs felt like they were full of cobwebs and flames, and I couldn\u2019t get the rancid smell of charred skin out of my nose. It was overpowering, and even though I\u2019d taken a shower, it was still there, mixed in with the mint and lavender scent of the soap I used to scrub it away. Equally unforgettable were the sounds. The sirens, the wailing, the worried and panicked chatter, and the screams of people arriving on the scene to discover that a friend was still inside. Everyone looked the same, covered in soot, with identical expressions of bewilderment and despair. It was a nightmare.</p><p>Despite my struggle to focus, I did hear him say this: \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m afraid of is a life without you, Pigeon.\u201d</p><p>We had been too lucky. Even in a dark corner of Vegas, being attacked by Benny\u2019s goons, we somehow still had the advantage. Travis was invincible. But being a part of the Circle, and helping to organize a fight in unsafe conditions that resulted in the deaths of countless college kids . . . that was a fight not even Travis Maddox could win. Our relationship had withstood so many things, but Travis was in real danger of going to prison. Even if he didn\u2019t know it yet, it was the one obstacle that could keep us apart. The one obstacle that we had no control over.</p><p>\u201cThen you have nothing to be afraid of,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re forever.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, and then pressed his lips against my hair. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel so much for one person. He had protected me. It was my turn to protect him.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn\u2019t something about you at all. It was just you.\u201d</p><p>My insides melted. I loved him. I loved him, and I had to do whatever I could to keep him safe. Whatever it took\u2014no matter how crazy. All I had to do was talk him into it.</p><p>I leaned against him, pressing my cheek against his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s us, Trav. Nothing makes sense unless we\u2019re together. Have you noticed that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoticed? I\u2019ve been telling you that all year! It\u2019s official. Bimbos, fights, leaving, Parker, Vegas . . . even fires. Our relationship can withstand anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegas?\u201d I asked.</p><p>In that moment, the most insane plan formed in my mind, but the idea made sense as I stared into his warm, brown eyes. Those eyes made everything make sense. His face and neck were still covered in soot mixed with sweat, a reminder of how close we had come to losing everything.</p><p>My mind was racing. We would only need necessities and we could be out the door in five minutes. We could buy clothes there. The sooner we left the better. No one would believe two people would get on a plane right after such an enormous tragedy. It didn\u2019t make sense, which was exactly why we had to do it.</p><p>I had to take Travis far enough away, for a specific reason. Something believable, even if it was crazy. Luckily, crazy wasn\u2019t that far a leap for Travis and me, and it was possible the investigators would second-guess the dozens of witnesses who saw Travis fighting in the basement of Keaton Hall that night\u2014if they had proof that we were in Vegas hours later getting married. It was absolutely insane, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I didn\u2019t have time to come up with a better plan. We should already be gone.</p><p>Travis was staring back at me expectantly, waiting to unconditionally accept whatever came out of my crazy mouth. Goddammit, I couldn\u2019t lose him now, not after everything we\u2019d fought through to get to this moment. By anyone\u2019s standards, we were too young to get married, too unpredictable. How many times had we hurt one another along the way, screamed at each other one minute and fallen into bed together the next? But we\u2019d just seen how fragile life was. Who knew when the end would come along and sweep one of us away? I looked at him, resolute. He was mine, and I was his. If I knew anything at all, it was that only those two things mattered.</p><p>He furrowed his brow. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about going back?\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea for me.\u201d</p><p>Weeks ago, I\u2019d broken his heart. Travis chasing America\u2019s car when he realized it was over was still fresh in my mind. He was going to fight for Benny in Vegas, and I wouldn\u2019t go back there. Not even for him. He had gone through hell while we were apart. He\u2019d begged me back on his knees, and I was so set on never returning to my life in Nevada, I\u2019d walked away. I\u2019d be a complete asshole if I asked him to go back. I half expected him to tell me to get the hell out for even mentioning it, but this was the only plan I had, and I was desperate.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we just went for a night?\u201d A night was all I needed. We just needed to be somewhere else.</p><p>He looked around his bedroom, searching the darkness for what he thought I wanted to hear. I didn\u2019t want to be that girl, the one who wasn\u2019t forthcoming and caused a huge, stupid misunderstanding. But I couldn\u2019t tell Travis the truth about what I\u2019d just proposed to him. He would never agree to go.</p><p>\u201cA night?\u201d He clearly had no clue how to respond. He probably thought it was a test, but the only thing I wanted was for him to say yes.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>His mouth parted, forming a silent gasp. I waited lifetimes until his lips curved upward, and he sealed his mouth on mine. His kiss screamed a thousand different emotions. My brain felt swollen with warring thoughts of relief and panic. This was going to work. We would get married, Travis would have an alibi, and everything would be okay.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Damn. Shit. Fuck.</p><p>I was getting married.</p><p>Travis</p><p>Abby Abernathy was famous for one thing: having no Tell. She could commit a crime and smile like it was any other day, lie without a twitch in her eye. Only one person in the world had any chance of learning her Tell, and that one person had to figure it out if he wanted to have any chance with her.</p><p>Me.</p><p>Abby had lost her childhood, and I\u2019d lost my mom, so for two people who struggled to get on the same page, we were the same story. That gave me an edge, and after making this my goal over the past months, I\u2019d arrived at an answer:</p><p>Abby\u2019s Tell was not having one. It might not make sense to most people, but it made perfect sense to me. It was the absence of that Tell that gave her away. The peace in her eyes, the softness in her smile, the relaxation of her shoulders alerted me that something was wrong.</p><p>If I didn\u2019t know her better, I might have thought this was just our happy ending, but she was up to something. Sitting in the terminal, waiting to board a plane to Vegas, with Abby snuggled into the curve of my body, I knew it was easy to try to ignore. She kept lifting her hand, staring at the ring I\u2019d bought her, and sighing. The middle-aged woman across from us was watching my new fianc\u00e9e and smiled, probably fantasizing about a time when she had her whole life ahead of her. She didn\u2019t know what those sighs really meant, but I had an idea.</p><p>It was hard to be happy about what we were about to do with the cloud of so many deaths hanging above our heads. No, really, it was literally above our heads. A television on the wall displayed the local news. Footage of the fire and the latest updates scrolled across the screen. They interviewed Josh Farney. He was covered in soot and he looked horrible, but I was glad to see he\u2019d made it. He was fairly hammered when I saw him before the fight. Most of the people who came to the Circle either came drunk or worked their way up to a buzz while they waited for me and my opponent to trade blows. When the flames began to crawl across the room, adrenaline pumped into everyone\u2019s veins\u2014enough to sober up even the most intoxicated.</p><p>I wished it hadn\u2019t happened. We\u2019d lost so many, and this wasn\u2019t exactly something you\u2019d want your wedding to follow. From experience, I knew that the memory of a tragedy could be misplaced. Attaching this date to something we would celebrate year after year would keep it front and center in our minds. Damn, they were still bringing out bodies, and I was acting like this was an annoyance. There were parents out there who had no idea they\u2019d never see their kids again.</p><p>That selfish thought led to guilt, and that guilt led to a lie. It was a sheer miracle that we were getting married right now, anyway. But I didn\u2019t want Abby thinking I was anything but super fucking pumped about getting married. Knowing her, she\u2019d misread it and then change her mind. So I focused on her, and what we were about to do. I wanted to be a normal, so-excited-I-might-puke groom-to-be, and she deserved nothing less. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019d pretended not to care about something I couldn\u2019t get out of my head. The living proof was snuggled up next to me.</p><p>On the television screen, the anchorwoman standing outside Keaton Hall held the microphone with both hands, a frown line between her eyebrows. \u201c. . . what the families of the victims will be asking: who is to blame? Back to you, Kent.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the nausea became real. So many had died, of course they were going to hold someone accountable. Was it Adam\u2019s fault? Would he go to prison? Would I? I hugged Abby to me and kissed her hair. A woman behind a desk picked up a mic and began to speak, and my knee started to bounce uncontrollably. If we weren\u2019t going to board soon, I might pick up Abby and run to Vegas. I felt like I could have made it there before the plane. The airline agent instructed us about boarding the flight, her voice rising and falling with the scripted announcement she\u2019d probably read a million times. She sounded like the teacher in those Peanuts cartoons: bored, monotone, and impossible to understand.</p><p>The only thing that made sense were the thoughts on repeat inside my head: I was about to become the husband of the second woman I\u2019d ever loved.</p><p>It was almost time. Damn. Shit, yeah! Fuck, yes!</p><p>I was getting married!</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>The Way Back</p><p>Abby</p><p>I stared at the sparkling rock on my finger and sighed again. It wasn\u2019t the airy sigh a young, newly engaged girl might make while staring at her rather large diamond. It was full of thought. A heavy, thoughtful thought that made me think heavier, thoughtful thoughts. But not second thoughts. We couldn\u2019t stay away from each other. What we were about to do was inevitable, and Travis Maddox loved me in a way most people dreamed about. The sigh was filled with worry and hope for my stupid plan. I wanted Travis to be okay so much that it was nearly tangible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop that, Pidge,\u201d Travis said. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . too big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fits just fine,\u201d he said, sitting back. We were wedged between a businessman talking softly on his cell phone and an elderly couple. An airline employee was standing behind the gate desk, talking into what looked like a CB radio. I wondered why they didn\u2019t just use a regular microphone. She announced a few names, and then hooked the device somewhere on the back of her desk.</p><p>\u201cMust be a full flight,\u201d Travis said. His left arm was settled on the back of my chair, his thumb gently rubbing my shoulder. He was trying to pretend to be relaxed, but his bobbing knee gave him away.</p> <p>\u201cThe diamond is excessive. I feel like I\u2019m going to get mugged at any moment,\u201d I said.</p><p>Travis laughed. \u201cFirst of all, no one is going to fucking touch you. Second, that ring was made to be on your finger. I knew when I saw it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttention passengers of American flight 2477 to Las Vegas, we are looking for three volunteers to take a later flight. We\u2019re offering travel vouchers good for one year from your departure.\u201d</p><p>Travis looked at me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou in a hurry?\u201d he asked, a smug smile on his face.</p><p>I leaned in and kissed him. \u201cActually, I am.\u201d I reached up with my finger and wiped away the smudge of soot under his nose that he\u2019d missed in the shower.</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby,\u201d he said, squeezing me against his side. He looked around, his chin lifted, his eyes bright. He was in the best mood I\u2019d seen him in since the night he\u2019d won our bet. It made me smile. Sensible or not, it felt good to be loved so much, and I decided right then and there I would stop apologizing for it. There were worse things than finding your soul mate too early in life, and what was too early, anyway?</p><p>\u201cI had a discussion about you with my mom, once,\u201d Travis said, looking out the wall of windows to our left. It was still dark. Whatever he saw wasn\u2019t on the other side.</p><p>\u201cAbout me? Isn\u2019t that kind of . . . impossible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. It was the day she died.\u201d</p> <p>Adrenaline burst from where adrenaline bursts from and sped through my body, pooling in my fingers and toes. Travis had never spoken about his mother to me. I often wanted to ask him about her, but then I thought about the sickening feeling that came over me when someone asked me about my mother, so I never did.</p><p>He continued, \u201cShe told me to find a girl worth fighting for. The one that doesn\u2019t come easy.\u201d</p><p>I felt a little embarrassed, wondering if that meant I was a huge pain in the ass. Truthfully, I was, but that wasn\u2019t the point.</p><p>\u201cShe said to never stop fighting, and I didn\u2019t. She was right.\u201d He took a deep breath, seeming to let that thought settle into his bones.</p><p>The idea that Travis believed I was the woman who his mother was talking about, that she would approve of me, made me feel an acceptance I\u2019d never felt before. Diane, who had passed away almost seventeen years before, now made me feel more loved than my own mother.</p><p>\u201cI love your mom,\u201d I said, leaning against Travis\u2019s chest.</p><p>He looked down at me, and after a short pause, kissed my hair. I couldn\u2019t see his face, but I could hear in his voice how much he was affected. \u201cShe would have loved you, too. No doubt in my mind.\u201d</p><p>The woman spoke into her CB again. \u201cAttention passengers of American flight 2477 to Las Vegas: We will begin boarding soon. We\u2019ll start with anyone needing boarding assistance, and those with young children, and then we\u2019ll begin boarding first class and business class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about exceptionally tired?\u201d Travis said, standing. \u201cI need a fuckin\u2019 Red Bull. Maybe we should have kept our tickets for tomorrow like we\u2019d planned?\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou have a problem with me being in a hurry to be Mrs. Travis Maddox?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, helping me to my feet. \u201cHell no. I\u2019m still in shock, if you wanna know the truth. I just don\u2019t want you to be rushing because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Travis\u2019s eyebrows pulled in, and he wrapped his arms around me. \u201cYou can\u2019t really think that. You gotta know there\u2019s nothing I want more.\u201d</p><p>I rose up on the balls of my feet and pecked his lips. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting ready to board a plane for Vegas so we can get married, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d</p><p>Travis squeezed me against him, and then kissed me excitedly from cheek to collarbone. I giggled as he tickled my neck, and laughed even louder when he lifted me off the ground. He kissed me one last time before taking my bag off the floor, lowered me to the ground, and then led me by the hand to the line.</p><p>We showed our boarding passes and walked down the Jetway hand in hand. The flight attendants took one look at us and offered a knowing smile. Travis passed our seats to let me by, placed our carry-on bags in the overhead bin, and collapsed next to me. \u201cWe should probably try to sleep on the way, but I\u2019m not sure I can. I\u2019m too fucking amped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you needed a Red Bull.\u201d</p><p>His dimple caved as he smiled. \u201cStop listening to everything I say. I\u2019m probably not going to make sense for the next six months while I try to process the fact that I\u2019ve gotten everything I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back to meet his eyes. \u201cTrav, if you wonder why I\u2019m in such a hurry to marry you . . . what you just said is one of the many reasons why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He scooted down in his seat, and then laid his head on my shoulder, nuzzling my neck a few times before relaxing. I touched my lips to his forehead, and then looked out the window, waiting as the other passengers passed by and silently praying for the pilot to hurry the hell out of there. I\u2019d never been so thankful for my unrivaled poker face. I wanted to stand up and scream for everyone to sit down and for the pilot to get us off the ground, but I forbid myself to even fidget, and willed my muscles to relax.</p><p>Travis\u2019s fingers found their way to mine, and intertwined with them. His breath heated up the spot it touched on my shoulder, sending warmth throughout my body. Sometimes I just wanted to drown in him. I thought about what might happen if my plan didn\u2019t work. Travis being arrested, tried in court, and the worst case scenario: being sent to prison. Knowing it was possible to be separated from him for a very long time, I felt that a promise to be with him forever didn\u2019t seem like enough. My eyes filled with tears, and one escaped, falling down my cheek. I wiped it away quickly. Damn fatigue always made me more emotional.</p><p>The other passengers were stowing their bags and buckling their seat belts, going through the motions with no idea that our lives were about to change forever.</p><p>I turned to look out the window. Anything to get my mind off the urgency to get off the ground. \u201cHurry,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Travis</p><p>It was easy to relax when I rested my head in the crook of Abby\u2019s neck. Her hair still smelled a little bit like smoke, and her hands were still pink and swollen from trying to force the basement window open. I tried to push that image from my head: the soot smudges on her face, her frightened eyes red and irritated from the smoke, emphasized by the smeared black mascara surrounding them. If I hadn\u2019t stayed behind, she might not have made it. Life without Abby didn\u2019t sound like much of a life at all. I didn\u2019t want to even wonder what losing her would be like. Going from a nightmare situation to one I\u2019d dreamed about was a jarring experience, but lying there against Abby as the plane hummed and the flight attendant deadpanned the announcements over the PA system made for a somewhat easier transition.</p><p>I reached for Abby\u2019s fingers, lacing mine with hers. Her cheek pressed against the top of my head so subtly that if I\u2019d been paying attention to what string to pull to trigger the automatic inflation of my life vest, I might have missed her tiny display of affection.</p><p>In just a few months\u2019 time, the petite woman next to me had become my whole world. I fantasized about how beautiful she would be in her wedding dress, returning home to watch Abby make the apartment her own, buying our first car, and doing those everyday, boring things that married people did, like the dishes and grocery shopping\u2014together. I imagined watching her walk across the stage at her graduation. After we both found jobs, we would likely start a family. That was just three or four years away. We both had broken homes, but I knew Abby would be a damn good mother. I thought about how I would react when she broke the news to me of being pregnant, and I already felt a little emotional about it.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t all be sunshine and rainbows, but struggling through a rough patch was when we were at our best, and we\u2019d had enough rough patches to know we could get through them.</p><p>With thoughts of a future in which Abby was swollen with our first child running through my mind, my body relaxed against the itchy airplane seat, and I fell asleep.</p><p>What was I doing here? The smell of smoke burned my nose, and the cries and screaming in the distance made my blood turn to ice, even though sweat was pouring down my face. I was back in the bowels of Keaton Hall.</p><p>\u201cPigeon?\u201d I yelled. I coughed and squinted my eyes, as if that would help me see through the darkness. \u201cPigeon!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d felt this feeling before. The panic; the pure adrenaline of being truly afraid of dying. Death was just moments away, but I didn\u2019t think about what it would feel like to suffocate or burn alive. I only thought about Abby. Where was she? Was she okay? How would I save her?</p><p>A single door came into view, highlighted by the approaching flames. I turned the knob and pushed into the ten-by-ten room. It was just four walls of concrete blocks. One window. A small group of girls and a couple of guys were against the far wall, trying to reach for their only escape.</p><p>Derek, one of my frat brothers, was holding up one of the girls, and she was desperately reaching for the window. \u201cCan you get it, Lindsey?\u201d He grunted, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cNo! I can\u2019t reach it!\u201d she cried, clawing above her. She was wearing a pink Sigma Kappa T-shirt, damp from sweat.</p><p>Derek nodded to his friend. I didn\u2019t know his name, but he was in my humanities class. \u201cLift Emily, Todd! She\u2019s taller!\u201d</p><p>Todd bent over and laced his fingers together, but Emily had flattened herself against the wall, frozen with fear. \u201cEmily, get over here.\u201d</p><p>Her face compressed. She looked like a little girl. \u201cI want my mom,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cGet. The fuck. Over here!\u201d Todd commanded.</p><p>After taking a tiny moment to find her courage, Emily pushed away from the wall and climbed onto Todd. He pushed her up, but she couldn\u2019t reach it, either.</p><p>Lainey watched her friend reach for the window, noticed the approaching flames, and then balled her hands into fists at her chest. She squeezed them so tight, they shook. \u201cKeep trying, Emily!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try another way!\u201d I said, but they didn\u2019t hear me. Maybe they\u2019d already tried several routes, and this was the only window they could find. I ran into the dark hallway and looked around. This was the dead end. We had nowhere else to run. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I went back in, trying to think of something to save us. Dusty sheets covered stored furniture that lined the walls, and the fire was using them as a pathway. A pathway straight to the room we were in.</p><p>I backed up a few steps, and then turned to face the kids behind me. Their eyes widened, and they retreated against the wall. Lainey was trying to climb up the cement blocks out of pure terror.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Abby Abernathy?\u201d I said. They didn\u2019t hear me. \u201cHey!\u201d I yelled again. None of those kids acknowledged me. I walked up to Derek and screamed at him. \u201cHey!\u201d He looked right through me at the fire, a horrified look on his face. I looked at the others. They didn\u2019t see me, either.</p><p>Confused, I walked over to the wall, and jumped, trying to reach the window, and then I was kneeling on the ground outside, looking in. Derek, Todd, Lainey, Lindsey, and Emily were still inside. I tried to open the window, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. I kept trying, anyway, hoping at any moment it would pop open and I could pull them out.</p> <p>\u201cHold on!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHelp!\u201d I yelled again, hoping someone would hear.</p><p>The girls hugged, and Emily began to wail. \u201cThis is just a bad dream. This is just a bad dream. Wake up! Wake up!\u201d she said over and over.</p><p>\u201cGet one of the sheets, Lainey!\u201d Derek said. \u201cRoll it up and shove it under the door!\u201d</p><p>Lainey scrambled to pull a sheet off a desk. Lindsey helped her, and then watched Lainey shove it desperately under the door. They both backed away, watching the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trapped,\u201d Todd said to Derek.</p> <p>Derek\u2019s shoulders fell. Lainey walked over to him, and he touched her dirty cheeks with both hands. They stared into each other\u2019s eyes. Thick, black smoke snaked under the door and seeped into the room.</p><p>Emily jumped for the window. \u201cLift me up, Todd! I want out! I want out of here!\u201d</p><p>Todd watched her jump with a defeated expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Emily screamed. \u201cMommy help me!\u201d Her eyes were trained on the window, but still she looked past me.</p><p>Lindsey reached out for Emily, but she wouldn\u2019t be touched. \u201cSssh . . .\u201d she said, trying to comfort her from where she stood. She covered her mouth with her hands and began to cough. She looked at Todd, tears streaming down her face. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d Emily screamed, still jumping.</p> <p>As the smoke filled the room I punched the window, over and over. The adrenaline must have been unbelievable, because I couldn\u2019t feel my hand hitting the glass, even though I was using every bit of strength I had. \u201cHelp me! Help!\u201d I yelled, but no one came.</p><p>Smoke bumped and swirled against the window, and the coughs and crying silenced.</p><p>My eyes popped open, and I looked around. I was on the plane with Abby, my hands clenching the armrests, and every muscle in my body clenched.</p><p>\u201cTravis? You\u2019re sweating,\u201d Abby said. She touched my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I said, quickly unbuckling my seat belt. I rushed to the back of the plane and jerked open the lavatory door, and then locked it behind me. Flipping up the sink lever, I splashed water on my face, and then stared into the mirror, watching the drops of water slide off my face and onto the counter.</p><p>They were there because of me. I knew Keaton wasn\u2019t safe, and I knew too many people were in that basement, and I let it happen. I contributed to dozens of deaths, and now I was on a plane to Las Vegas. What the fuck was wrong with me?</p><p>I walked back to my seat and buckled in next to Abby.</p><p>She stared at me, noticing right away that something was wrong. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, and kept her voice low. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have said no. I should have insisted on a safer place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know that was going to happen.\u201d She glanced around, making sure no one was listening. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. It\u2019s horrific. But we couldn\u2019t stop it. We can\u2019t change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I get arrested, Abby? What if I go to jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d she said, reminding me of the way Lindsey tried to comfort Emily in my dream. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen,\u201d she whispered. Her eyes were focused; resolute.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it should.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Lucky One</p><p>Abby</p><p>When the wheels of the airplane touched down on the runway of McCarran International Airport, Travis was finally relaxed and leaning on my shoulder. The bright lights of Las Vegas had been visible for the past ten minutes, signaling us like a beacon toward everything I hated\u2014and everything I wanted.</p><p>Travis roused slowly, glancing out the window quickly before kissing the cusp of my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViva. I thought maybe you\u2019d go back to sleep. It\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way I was going back to sleep after that dream,\u201d he said, stretching. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to sleep again.\u201d</p><p>My fingers squeezed his. I hated to see him so shaken. He wouldn\u2019t talk about his dream, but it didn\u2019t take much to figure out where he was while he was sleeping. I wondered if anyone that had escaped from Keaton would be able to close their eyes without seeing the smoke and the panicked faces. The plane arrived at the gate, the SEAT BELT light dinged, and the cabin lights came on, signaling everyone to stand up and dig for their carry-on luggage. Everyone was in a hurry, even though no one was getting out of there before the people seated ahead of them.</p><p>I sat, feigning patience, watching Travis stand to pull out our luggage. His T-shirt rose when he reached up, revealing his abs shifting and then contracting when he pulled down the bags.</p><p>\u201cYou got a dress in here?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI thought I\u2019d find one here.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cYeah, I bet they have plenty to choose from. A better selection for a Vegas wedding than home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy line of thinking exactly.\u201d</p><p>Travis held out his hand and helped me take the two steps to the aisle. \u201cYou\u2019ll look great no matter what you put on.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his cheek and took my bag just as the line began to move. We followed the other passengers down the gateway and into the terminal.</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d Travis whispered.</p><p>I felt the same. The slot machines sung their siren\u2019s song and flashed brightly colored lights, falsely promising luck and big money. The last time Travis and I were here, it was easy to pick out the couples who were getting married, and I wondered if we were just as obvious.</p><p>Travis took my hand as we passed baggage claim, and then followed the sign marked TAXIS. The automatic doors parted and we walked into the desert night air. It was still stifling hot, and dry. I breathed in the heat, letting Las Vegas saturate every part of me.</p><p>Marrying Travis would be the hardest easiest thing I\u2019d ever done. I needed to awaken the parts of me that were molded in the darkest corners of this city to make my plan work. If Travis thought that I was doing this for any reason other than just wanting to commit to him, he would never let me go through with it, and Travis was not exactly gullible, and worse, he knew me better than anyone else; he knew what I was capable of. If I pulled the wedding off, and kept Travis out of prison without him knowing why, it would be my best bluff yet.</p><p>Even though we\u2019d bypassed the crowd waiting for baggage, there was a long line for taxis. I sighed. We should have been getting married by now. It was still dark, but it had been over five hours since the fire. We couldn\u2019t afford more lines.</p><p>\u201cPidge?\u201d Travis squeezed my hand. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, shaking my head and smiling. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem . . . a little tense.\u201d</p><p>I took stock of my body; how I was standing, my facial expression, anything that might tip him off. My shoulders were so tight they were hanging up around my ears, so I forced them to relax. \u201cI\u2019m just ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get it over with?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows pulling in infinitesimally. Had I not known better, I would have never caught it.</p><p>\u201cTrav,\u201d I said, wrapping my arms around his waist. \u201cThis was my idea, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was the last time we went to Vegas. You remember how that turned out?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and then I felt terrible. The vertical line his eyebrow formed when he pushed them together deepened. This was so important to him. How much he loved me was overwhelming most of the time, but tonight was different. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry, yes. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but something\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just nervous. Stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>His face smoothed, and he hugged me. \u201cOkay. If you say you\u2019re okay, then I believe you.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen long minutes later, and we were at the front of the line. A taxi pulled to the curb and stopped. Travis opened the door for me, and I ducked into the backseat and slid over, waiting for him to get in.</p><p>The cabdriver looked over his shoulder. \u201cShort trip?\u201d</p><p>Travis situated our single carry-on bag in front of him on the floorboard. \u201cWe travel light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBellagio, please,\u201d I said calmly, keeping the urgency out of my voice.</p><p>With lyrics I didn\u2019t understand, a cheery, circuslike melody hummed through the speakers as we drove from the airport to the strip. The lights were visible miles before we reached the hotel.</p><p>When we arrived at the Strip, I noticed a river of people trekking up and down the sides of the road. Even in the wee hours of the morning, the sidewalks were packed with bachelors, women pushing strollers with sleeping babies, people in costumes taking pictures for tips, and businessmen\u2014apparently looking to unwind.</p><p>Travis put his arm around my shoulders. I leaned against him, trying not to look at my watch for the tenth time.</p><p>The taxi pulled into the circle drive of the Bellagio, and Travis leaned forward with bills to pay the driver. He then pulled out our roller carry-on, and waited for me. I scooted out, taking his hand and stepping out onto the concrete. As if it weren\u2019t in the early AM, people were standing in the taxi line to go to a different casino, and others were returning, weaving and laughing after a long night of drinking.</p><p>Travis squeezed my hand. \u201cWe\u2019re really here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep!\u201d I said, pulling him inside. The ceiling was distractingly ornate. Everybody in the lobby was standing around with their noses in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d I said, turning to Travis. He was letting me pull him while he took in the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cLook, Pidge! It\u2019s . . . wow,\u201d he said, in awe of the huge, multicolored flowers kissing the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cYep!\u201d I said, tugging him to the front desk.</p><p>\u201cChecking in,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd we need to schedule a wedding at a local chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cAny one. A nice one. A twenty-four-hour one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can arrange that. I\u2019ll just get you checked in here, and then the concierge can help you with a wedding chapel, shows, anything you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said, turning to Travis with a triumphant grin. He was still staring at the ceiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTravis!\u201d I said, pulling on his arm.</p><p>He turned, snapping out of his hypnotic state. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you go over to the concierge and get the wedding scheduled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I mean yeah. I can do that. Which one?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed once. \u201cClose. Open all night. Classy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he said. He pecked my cheek before pulling the carry-on to the concierge desk.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re under Maddox,\u201d I said, pulling out a piece of paper. \u201cThis is our confirmation number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I have a honeymoon suite available if you\u2019d like to upgrade?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d Travis was across the room, talking with a man behind the desk. They were looking at a brochure together, and he had a huge smile on his face while the man pointed out the different venues.</p> <p>\u201cPlease let this work,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Nothing,\u201d I said as he returned to clicking away on his computer.</p><p>Travis</p><p>Abby leaned in with a smile when I kissed her cheek, and then continued with check-in while I popped over to the concierge to nail down a chapel. I glanced over at my soon-to-be wife, her long legs propped up by those wedge heel shoes that make a nice pair of legs look even nicer. Her flow-y, thin shirt was just see-through enough that I felt disappointed to see a tank top under it. Her favorite sunglasses were perched on the front of her favorite fedora, and just a few long locks of her caramel hair, a little wavy from drying naturally after her shower, were cascading out from under the hat. My God, that woman was fucking sexy. She didn\u2019t even have to try, and all I wanted was to be all up in her business. Now that we were engaged that didn\u2019t sound like such a bastard thing to think.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d the concierge said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. Hey,\u201d I said, taking a last glance at Abby before giving the guy my full attention. \u201cI need a chapel. Open all night. Classy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOf course, sir. We have several for you right here at the Bellagio. They are absolutely beautiful and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have Elvis at a chapel here, do you? I figure if we\u2019re going to get married in Vegas, we should either get married by Elvis, or at least invite him, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I apologize, the Bellagio chapels do not offer an Elvis impersonator. However, I can find a few numbers for you to call and request that one appear at your wedding. There is also, of course, the world famous Graceland Chapel, if you prefer. They have packages that include an Elvis impersonator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that one. As quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>The concierge smiled. \u201cIn a hurry, are we?\u201d</p> <p>I started to grin, but I realized I was already smiling, and probably had been, like an idiot, since I arrived at his desk. \u201cDo you see that girl over there?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. Quickly. Respectfully. I liked him. \u201cYes, sir. You\u2019re a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as shit am. Schedule the wedding for two . . . maybe three hours from now? She\u2019ll need time to pick up a few things and get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery thoughtful of you, sir.\u201d He clicked a few buttons on his keyboard and then grabbed the mouse, moving it around and clicking it a few times. His smile faded as he concentrated, and then it lit up his face again when he finished. The printer buzzed, and then he handed me a piece of paper. \u201cThere you are, sir. Congratulations.\u201d He held up his fist, and I bumped it, feeling like he\u2019d just handed me a winning lottery ticket.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Three Hours</p><p>Travis</p><p>Abby held my hand, pulling me along as we walked through the casino to the elevators. I was dragging my feet, trying to take a look around before we went upstairs. It had only been a few months since the last time we\u2019d been in Vegas, but this time was less stressful. We were here for a much better reason. Regardless, Abby was still all-business, refusing to pause long enough for me to get too comfortable around the tables. She hated Las Vegas and with good reason, which made me question even more why she chose to come here, but as long as she was on a mission to be my wife, I wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p><p>\u201cTrav,\u201d she said, huffing. \u201cThe elevators are right . . . there . . .\u201d She tugged on me a few times toward her final destination.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on vacation, Pidge. Cool your jets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re getting married, and we have less than twenty-four hours to get it done.\u201d</p><p>I pressed the button, pulling us both into an open space to the side of the crowd. It shouldn\u2019t have been surprising that there were so many people just ending their night this close to sunrise, but even a buck wild frat boy like myself could be impressed here.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d I said. I brought her fingers to my mouth and kissed them.</p><p>Abby was still looking above the elevator doors, watching the numbers descend. \u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned that.\u201d She looked over to me and one corner of her mouth turned up. \u201cBelieve it, baby. We\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>My chest rose while my lungs filled with air, preparing to let out a long sigh. In recent memory, or maybe ever, my bones and muscles had never been so relaxed. My mind was at ease. It felt strange to feel all of those things, knowing what we\u2019d just left behind back on campus, and at the same time feeling so responsible. It was disorienting, and unsettling, this feeling happy one minute, and like a criminal the next.</p><p>A slit formed between the elevator doors, and then they slowly slid away from each other, allowing the passengers to bleed out into the hallway. Abby and I stepped on together with our small roller duffle bag. One woman had a large purse, a large carry-on that was the size of two of ours, and a four-wheeled, vertical suitcase that could fit at least two small children.</p><p>\u201cMoving here?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d Abby jammed her elbow into my ribs.</p><p>She took a long look at me, and then Abby, and then spoke in a French accent. \u201cNo.\u201d She looked away, clearly unhappy I\u2019d spoken to her.</p><p>Abby and I traded glances, and then she widened her eyes, silently saying Wow, what a bitch. I tried not to laugh. Damn, I loved that woman, and I loved that I knew what she was thinking without her saying a word.</p><p>The French woman nodded. \u201cPress floor thirty-five, please.\u201d Almost the Penthouse. Of course.</p><p>When the doors opened on the twenty-fourth floor, Abby and I stepped out onto the ornate carpet, a bit lost, doing the search-walk that people always do when looking for their hotel room. Finally, at the end of the hall, Abby inserted her keycard and pulled it out quickly.</p><p>The door clicked. The light turned green. We were in.</p><p>Abby flipped on the light and pulled her purse over her head, tossing it on to the king-size bed. She smiled at me. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p><p>I let go of the bag handle, letting it topple over, and then took Abby into my arms. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We\u2019re here. When we sleep in that bed later, we\u2019re going to be husband and wife.\u201d</p><p>Abby looked into my eyes, deep and thoughtful, and then cupped one side of my face. A corner of her mouth turned up. \u201cWe sure will.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what thoughts were swirling behind her beautiful gray eyes, because almost immediately that thoughtful look disappeared.</p><p>She rose up on the balls of her feet and pecked me on the mouth. \u201cWhat time is the wedding?\u201d</p><p>Abby</p><p>\u201cThree hours?\u201d I kept my muscles relaxed even though my entire body wanted to tense up. We were wasting too much time, and I had no way to explain to Travis why I needed to get it over with.</p><p>Get it over with? Is that how I really felt about it? Maybe it wasn\u2019t just that Travis needed a plausible alibi. Maybe I was afraid I would chicken out if there was too much time to think about what we were doing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Travis said. \u201cI figured you\u2019d need time to get a dress and your hair done and all that girly shit. Was that . . . was I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s fine. I guess I was just thinking we\u2019d get here and just go. But, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to the Red, Pidge. We\u2019re gettin\u2019 married. I know it\u2019s not in a church, but I figured we\u2019d . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shook my head and closed my eyes for a second, and then looked at him. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll go downstairs, find something white, and then I\u2019ll come back here and get ready. If I can\u2019t find something here, I\u2019ll go to Crystals. There are more shops there.\u201d</p><p>Travis walked toward me, stopping just a few inches away. He watched me for several moments, long enough to make me squirm.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said softly. No matter how I tried to explain it away, he knew me well enough to know\u2014poker face or not\u2014that I was hiding something from him.</p><p>\u201cI think what you\u2019re reading is exhaustion. I haven\u2019t slept in almost twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, kissed my forehead, and then went to the mini fridge. He bent over, and then turned, holding up two small cans of Red Bull. \u201cProblem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9 is a genius.\u201d</p><p>He handed me a can, and then took me into his arms. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I think you\u2019re a genius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing your fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Don\u2019t get used to it. I\u2019ll be calling you something different in three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll like the new name even better.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, watching Travis open the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cWhile you find a dress, I\u2019m going to take another shower, shave, and then try to find something to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t be here when I get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to be? It\u2019s at the Graceland Chapel, right? I thought we\u2019d just meet there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be kind of cool to see each other at the chapel, just before, dressed and ready to walk down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to walk around Vegas by yourself for three hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up here, remember?\u201d</p><p>Travis thought for a moment. \u201cIsn\u2019t Jesse still working as a pit boss?\u201d</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t talked to him. But even if he was, the only casino I\u2019ll be anywhere near is the Bellagio\u2019s, and that\u2019s just long enough for me to walk through to our room.\u201d</p><p>Travis seemed satisfied with that, and then nodded. \u201cMeet you there.\u201d He winked at me, and then shut the bathroom door.</p><p>I grabbed my purse off the bed and the room keycard, and, after glancing at the bathroom door, picked up Travis\u2019s cell phone off the nightstand.</p><p>Opening his contacts, I pressed on the name I needed, sent the contact information to my phone via text, and then deleted the text message the second it went through. When I set his phone down, the bathroom door opened, and Travis appeared in just a towel.</p><p>\u201cMarriage license?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe chapel will take care of it for an extra fee.\u201d</p><p>Travis nodded, seeming relieved, and then shut the door again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I yanked the room door open and made my way to the elevator, inputting and then calling the new number.</p><p>\u201cPlease pick up,\u201d I whispered. The elevator opened, revealing a crowd of young women, probably just a little older than me. They were giggling and slurring their words, half of them discussing their night, the others deciding if they should go to bed or just stay up so they wouldn\u2019t miss their flight home.</p><p>\u201cPick up, damnit,\u201d I said after the first ring. Three rings later, voicemail chimed in.</p><p>You\u2019ve reached Trent. You know what to do.</p> <p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I huffed, letting my hand fall to my thigh. The door opened, and I walked with purpose to the Bellagio shops.</p><p>After searching through too fancy, too trashy, too much lace, too many beads, and too . . . much of everything, I finally found it: the dress I would wear when I became Mrs. Maddox. It was white, of course, and tea length. Fairly plain, really, except for the sheer bateau neckline and a white satin ribbon that tied around the waist. I stood in the mirror, letting my eyes study each line and detail. It was beautiful, and I felt beautiful in it. In just a couple of hours, I would be standing next to Travis Maddox, watching his eyes take in every curve of the fabric.</p><p>I walked along the wall, scanning the numerous veils. After trying on the fourth, I placed it back into its cubby, flustered. A veil was too proper. Too innocent. Another display caught my eye, and I walked toward it, letting my fingers run over the different beads, pearls, stones, and metals of various hairpins. They were less delicate, and more . . . me. There were so many on the table, but I kept coming back to one in particular. It had a small, silver comb, and the rest of it was just dozens of different-size rhinestones that somehow formed a butterfly. Without knowing why, I held it in my hand, sure it was perfect.</p><p>The shoes were in the back of the store. They didn\u2019t have a huge selection, but luckily I wasn\u2019t super picky and chose the first pair of silver strappy heels I saw. Two straps went over my toes, and two more around my ankle, with a group of pearls to camouflage the belt. Thankfully they had size six in stock, and I was on to the last thing on my list: jewelry.</p><p>I chose a simple but elegant pair of pearl earrings. At the top, where they fastened to my ear, was a small cubic zirconia, just flashy enough for a special occasion, and a matching necklace. Never in my life had I wanted to stand out. Apparently even my wedding wouldn\u2019t change that for me.</p> <p>I thought about the first time I stood in front of Travis. He was sweaty, shirtless, and panting, and I was covered in Marek Young\u2019s blood. That was just six months ago, and now we\u2019re getting married. And I\u2019m nineteen. I\u2019m only nineteen.</p><p>What the fuck am I doing?</p><p>I stood at the register, watching the receipt being printed out for the dress, shoes, hairpin, and jewelry, trying not to hyperventilate.</p><p>The redhead behind the counter tore off the receipt and handed it to me with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous dress. Nice choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t sure if I smiled back or not. Suddenly dazed, I walked away, holding the bag against my chest.</p><p>After a quick stop into the jewelry store for a black titanium wedding ring for Travis, I glanced at my phone and then tossed it back into my purse. I was making good time.</p> <p>When I walked into the casino, my purse began to vibrate. I placed the bag between my legs and reached for it. After two rings, my searching fingers grew desperate, clawing and shoving everything to the side to get to the phone in time.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I screeched. \u201cTrent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I breathed as I sat on the floor against the side of the closest slot machine. \u201cWe\u2019re fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sitting with Cami. She\u2019s pretty upset about the fire. She lost some of her regulars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Trent. I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t believe it. It doesn\u2019t seem real,\u201d I said, my throat feeling tight. \u201cThere were so many. Their parents probably don\u2019t even know, yet.\u201d I held my hand to my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sighed, sounding tired. \u201cIt\u2019s like a war zone down there. What\u2019s that noise? Are you in an arcade?\u201d He sounded disgusted, as if he already knew the answer, and he couldn\u2019t believe we were that insensitive. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cGod, no. We . . . we hopped on a flight to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, incensed. Or maybe just confused, I couldn\u2019t be sure. He was excitable.</p> <p>I cringed at the disapproval in his voice, knowing it was just the beginning. I had an objective. I had to set my feelings aside as best I could until I achieved what I came for. \u201cJust listen. It\u2019s important. I don\u2019t have a lot of time, and I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. With what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk. Just listen. Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, stop playin\u2019. Just fucking tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were a lot of people at the fight last night. A lot of people died. Someone has got to go to prison for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s gonna be Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim and Adam, yeah. Maybe John Savage, and anyone else they think coordinated it. Thank God Shepley wasn\u2019t in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Travis to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . okay. How the hell is that going to help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Vegas. Maybe if we can prove we were off getting married a few hours later, even if a few dozen drunken frat boys testify that he was at the fight, it will sound just crazy enough to create reasonable doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>A sob caught in my throat. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work, just don\u2019t tell me, okay? It was all I could think of, and if he finds out why I\u2019m doing this, he won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he won\u2019t. Abby, I know you\u2019re afraid, but this is crazy. You can\u2019t marry him to keep him out of trouble. This won\u2019t work, anyway. You didn\u2019t leave until after the fight. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI said not to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. He wouldn\u2019t want you to do this, either. He would want you to marry him because you want to. If he ever found out, it\u2019d break his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, Trent. It\u2019s going to work. At least it will give him a chance. It\u2019s a chance, right? Better odds than he had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d he said, sounding defeated.</p><p>I sighed and then nodded, covering my mouth with my free hand. Tears blurred my vision, making a kaleidoscope out of the casino floor. A chance was better than nothing.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCongrats!\u201d Cami said in the background. Her voice sounded tired and hoarse, even though I was sure she was sincere.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Keep me updated. Let me know if they come sniffing around the house, or if you hear anything about an investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do . . . and it\u2019s really fucking weird that our baby brother is the first to get married.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cGet over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. And, I love ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, Trent.\u201d</p><p>I held the phone in my lap with both hands, watching the people walking by stare at me. They were obviously wondering why I was sitting on the floor, but not enough to ask. I stood up, picked up my purse and bag, and inhaled a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cHere comes the bride,\u201d I said, taking my first steps.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Caught</p><p>Travis</p><p>I dried off, brushed my teeth, and slipped on a T-shirt and shorts, and then my Nikes. Ready. Damn, it was good to be a man. I couldn\u2019t imagine having to blow-dry my hair for half an hour, and then burn it with whatever handheld metal hot iron I could find, and then spend fifteen to twenty minutes getting my makeup just right before finally getting dressed. Key. Wallet. Phone. Out the door. Abby had said there were shops downstairs, but she hinted strongly that we shouldn\u2019t see each other until the wedding, so I headed for the Strip.</p><p>Even when in a hurry, if the Bellagio fountains are dancing to the music, it is un-American not to stop and stand in awe. I lit a cigarette and puffed on it, resting my arms on a large, concrete ledge that lined the viewing platform. Watching the water sway and spray to the music reminded me of the last time I was there, standing with Shepley while Abby efficiently kicked the asses of four or five poker veterans.</p><p>Shepley. Damn, I was so glad he wasn\u2019t at that fight. If I\u2019d have lost him, or if he\u2019d lost America, I\u2019m not sure Abby and I would have been here. A loss like that would change the whole dynamic of our friendships. Shepley couldn\u2019t be around Abby and me without America, and America couldn\u2019t be around us without Shepley. Abby couldn\u2019t not be around America. If they hadn\u2019t decided to stay with his parents over spring break, I could be suffering the loss of Shepley instead of preparing for our wedding. Thoughts of calling Uncle Jack and Aunt Deana with news of their only son\u2019s death made a cold shiver crawl down my spine.</p><p>I shook the thought away as I remembered the moment before I called my dad\u2019s phone, standing in front of Keaton, the smoke billowing out of the windows. Some of the firefighters were holding the hose to pour water inside, others were bringing out survivors. I remembered what it felt like: knowing that I was going to have to tell my dad that Trent was missing and probably dead. How my brother had run the wrong way in the confusion, and Abby and I were standing outside without him. Thoughts of what that would have done to my dad, to our entire family, made me feel sick to my stomach. Dad was the strongest man I knew, but he couldn\u2019t take losing anyone else.</p><p>My dad and Jack ran our town when they were in high school. They were the first generation of badass Maddox brothers. In college towns, the locals either started fights or were picked on. Jim and Jack Maddox never experienced the latter, and even met and married the only two girls at their college that could handle them: Deana and Diane Hempfling. Yes, sisters, making Shepley and me double cousins. It was probably just as well that Jack and Deana stopped at one, with Mom having five unruly boys. Statistically, our family was due for a girl, and I\u2019m not sure the world could handle a female Maddox. All the fight and anger, plus estrogen? Everyone would die.</p><p>When Shepley was born, Uncle Jack settled down. Shepley was a Maddox, but he had his mother\u2019s temperament. Thomas, Tyler, Taylor, Trenton, and I all had short fuses like our dad, but Shepley was calm. We were the best of friends. He was a brother who lived in a different house. He pretty much was, but he looked more like Thomas than the rest of us. We all shared the same DNA.</p><p>The fountain died down and I walked away, seeing the sign for Crystals. If I could get in and out of there quick, maybe Abby would still be in the Bellagio shops and wouldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>I picked up the pace, dodging the extremely drunk and tired tourists. One short escalator ride and a bridge later, I was inside the stories-tall shopping center. It had glass rectangles displaying colorful water tornados, high-end shops, and the same odd range of people. Families to strippers. Only in Vegas.</p><p>I popped in and out of one suit shop without any luck, and then walked until I hit a Tom Ford store. In ten minutes, I\u2019d found and tried on the perfect gray suit but had trouble finding a tie. \u201cFuck it,\u201d I said, taking the suit and a white button-up to the register. Who said a groom had to wear a tie? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walking out of the shopping center, I saw a pair of black Converse in the window. I went in, asked for my size, tried them on, and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d I said to the woman helping me. She smiled with a look in her eyes that would have turned me on just six months ago. A woman looking at me that way usually meant any attempts I made to get in her pants had just been made a thousand times easier. That look meant: take me home.</p><p>\u201cGreat choice,\u201d she said in a smooth, flirtatious voice. Her dark hair was long, thick, and shiny. Probably half of her five feet. She was a sophisticated, Asian beauty, wrapped in a tight dress and sky-high heels. Her eyes were sharp, calculating. She was exactly the kind of challenge my old self would have happily taken on. \u201cAre you staying in Vegas long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your first time here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSecond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I was going to offer to show you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting married in these shoes in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>My response snuffed out the desire in her eyes, and she smiled pleasantly, but she\u2019d clearly lost interest. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, taking my receipt and bag with the shoe box inside.</p> <p>I left, feeling much better about myself than I would have had I been here on a guys\u2019 trip and leading her back to my hotel room. I didn\u2019t know about love back then. It was fanfuckingtastic to go home to Abby every night, and see the welcoming, loving look in her eyes. Nothing was better than coming up with new ways to make her fall in love with me all over again. I lived for that shit now, and it was way more satisfying.</p><p>Within an hour of leaving the Bellagio, I had picked up a suit and a gold band for Abby, and was right back where I started: in our hotel room. I sat on the end of the bed and grabbed the remote, clicking on the power to the TV before bending over to untie my sneakers. A familiar scene lit up the screen. It was Keaton, quartered off with yellow tape, and still smoking. The brick around the windows were charred, and the ground surrounding was saturated with water.</p><p>The reporter was interviewing a tearful girl, describing how her roommate had never returned to the dorm, and she was still waiting to hear if she was among the dead. I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I covered my face with my hands and rested my elbows on my knees. My body shook as I mourned my friends and all the people I didn\u2019t know who\u2019d lost their lives, as I apologized over and over for being the reason why they were there, and being too much of a fucking bastard for choosing Abby over turning myself in. When I couldn\u2019t cry anymore, I retreated to the shower, standing under the steaming water until I got back into the frame of mind Abby needed me to be in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to see me until just before the wedding, so I got my shit straight in my head, got dressed, slapped on some cologne, tied my new kicks, and headed out. Before letting the door close, I took one long, last look at the room. The next time I came through this door, I\u2019d be Abby\u2019s husband. That was the only thing that made the guilt bearable. My heart began to pound. The rest of my life was just hours away.</p><p>The elevator opened, and I followed the loudly patterned carpet through the casino. The suit made me feel like a million bucks, and people were staring, wondering where the fine-looking asshole sporting Converse was off to. When I was about halfway through the casino, I noticed a woman sitting on the floor with shopping bags, crying into her cell phone. I stopped dead in my tracks. It was Abby.</p><p>Instinctively, I stepped to the side, partially hiding myself at the end of a row of slot machines. With the music, the beeping, and the chatter, I couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying, but my blood ran cold. Why was she crying? Who was she crying to? Didn\u2019t she want to marry me? Should I confront her? Should I just wait it out and hope to God she doesn\u2019t call it off?</p> <p>Abby picked herself off the floor, struggling with her bags. Everything in me wanted to run to her and help, but I was afraid. I was fucking terrified that if I approached her in that moment, she might tell me the truth, and I was afraid to hear it. The selfish bastard in me took over, and I let her walk away.</p><p>Once she was out of sight, I sat on an empty slot machine stool and pulled the pack of cigarettes out of my inside pocket. Flicking the lighter, the end of my cigarette sizzled before it glowed red while I pulled in a long drag of smoke. What was I going to do if Abby changed her mind? Could we come back from something like that? Regardless of the answer, I was going to have to figure out a way. Even if she couldn\u2019t go through with the wedding, I couldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>I sat there for a long time, smoking, slipping dollar bills into the slot machine while a waitress brought me free drinks. After four, I waved her away. Getting drunk before the wedding wouldn\u2019t solve a damn thing. Maybe that\u2019s why Abby was having second thoughts. Loving her wasn\u2019t enough. I needed to grow the fuck up, get a real job, quit drinking, fighting, and control my goddamn anger. I sat alone in the casino, silently vowing that I would make all of those changes, and they would start right then.</p><p>My phone chimed. Just an hour was left before the wedding. I texted Abby, worried how she might respond.</p><p>I miss u</p><p>Abby</p><p>I smiled at the phone display, seeing the text was from Travis. I clicked a response, knowing that words couldn\u2019t convey what I was feeling.</p><p>I miss u too</p> <p>T-minus one hour. U ready yet?</p><p>Not yet. U?</p><p>Hells yes. I look ducking amazing. When u c me u will want 2 marry me 4 sure.</p><p>Ducking?</p><p>Fucking* goddamn auto correct. Pic?</p><p>No! It\u2019s bad luck!</p><p>Ur lucky 13. You have good luck.</p><p>Ur marrying me. So clearly u don\u2019t. And don\u2019t call me that.</p><p>Love u baby.</p><p>Love u too. See u soon.</p><p>Nervous?</p><p>Of course. Aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Only about ur cold feet.</p><p>Feet r toasty warm.</p><p>I wish I could explain to u how happy I am right now.</p><p>U don\u2019t have to. I can relate.</p><p>&lt;3</p><p>I sat the phone on the bathroom counter and looked into the mirror, touching the end of the lip gloss wand to my bottom lip. After pinning one last piece of my hair back, I went over to the bed, where I\u2019d laid the dress. It wasn\u2019t what my ten-year-old self would have chosen, but it was beautiful, and what we were about to do was beautiful. Even why I was doing it was beautiful. I could think of much less noble reasons to get married. And, besides that, we loved each other. Was getting married this young so awful? People used to do this all the time.</p><p>I shook my head, trying to shake off the dozens of conflicting emotions swirling around my mind. Why go back and forth? This was happening, and we were in love. Crazy? Yes. Wrong? No.</p><p>I stepped into the dress and then pulled up the zipper, standing in front of the mirror. \u201cMuch better,\u201d I said. In the store, as lovely as the dress was, without hair and makeup done, the dress didn\u2019t look right. With my red lips and painted lashes, the look was complete.</p><p>I pinned the diamond butterfly into the base of the messy curls that made up my side bun, and slipped my feet into the new strappy pumps. Purse. Phone. Trav\u2019s ring. The chapel would have everything else. The taxi was waiting.</p><p>Even though thousands of women were married in Las Vegas every year, it didn\u2019t keep everyone from staring at me as I walked across the casino floor in my wedding dress. Some smiled, some just watched, but it all made me uncomfortable. When my father lost his last professional match after four in a row, and he announced publicly that it was my fault, I\u2019d received enough attention to last two lifetimes. Because of a few words spoken in frustration, he\u2019d created \u201cLucky Thirteen\u201d and given me an unbelievable burden to bear. Even when my mother finally decided to leave Mick and we moved to Wichita three years later, starting over seemed impossible. I enjoyed two whole weeks of being an unknown before the first local reporter figured out who I was and approached me on the front lawn of my high school. All it took was one hateful girl a single hour of Friday Night Googling to figure out why anyone in the press cared enough to try to get a \u201cWhere Is She Now?\u201d headline. The second half of my high school experience was ruined. Even with a mouthy, scrappy best friend.</p><p>When America and I left for college, I wanted to be invisible. Until the day I\u2019d met Travis, I was enjoying my newfound anonymity immensely.</p><p>I looked down from the hundredth pair of eyes watching me intently, and I wondered if being with Travis would always make me feel conspicuous.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Dead or Alive</p><p>Travis</p><p>The limo door slammed hard behind me. \u201cOh, shit. Sorry. I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>The driver waved me away. \u201cNo problem. Twenty-two dollars, please. I\u2019ll come back with the limo.\u201d</p><p>The limo was new. White. Abby would like it. I handed him thirty. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be right back here in an hour and a half, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir! Never late!\u201d</p><p>He drove away, and I turned around. The chapel was lit up, glowing against the early morning sky. It was maybe a half hour before sunrise. I smiled. Abby was going to love it.</p><p>The front door opened, and a couple came out. They were middle-aged, but he was in a tux, and she was in a huge wedding dress. A short woman in a light pink suit dress was waving them good-bye, and then she noticed me.</p><p>\u201cTravis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, buttoning my jacket.</p><p>\u201cI could just eat you up! I hope your bride appreciates what a looker you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s prettier than me.\u201d</p><p>The woman cackled. \u201cI\u2019m Chantilly. Pretty much run things around here.\u201d She put her fists at her side, somewhere in the area of her hips. She was as wide as she was tall, and her eyes were nearly hidden under thick, fake lashes. \u201cCome on in, sugar! Come in! Come in!\u201d she said, rushing me inside.</p><p>The receptionist at the desk offered a smile and a small stack of paperwork. Yes, we want a DVD. Yes, we want flowers. Yes, we want Elvis. I checked all of the appropriate boxes, filled in our names and information, and then handed the paper back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Maddox,\u201d the receptionist said.</p><p>My hands were sweating. I couldn\u2019t believe I was here.</p><p>Chantilly patted my arm, well, more like my wrist, because that\u2019s the highest she could reach. \u201cThis way, honey. You can freshen up and wait for your bride in here. What was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . Abby . . .\u201d I said, walking through the door Chantilly had opened. I looked around, noting the couch and mirror surrounded by a thousand huge lightbulbs. The wallpaper was busy but nice, and everything seemed clean and classy, just like Abby wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when she arrives,\u201d Chantilly said with a wink. \u201cYou need anything? A water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that would be great,\u201d I said, sitting down.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d she lilted as she backed out of the room and closed the door behind her. I could hear her humming down the hall.</p><p>I leaned back against the couch, trying to process what had just happened, and wondering if Chantilly had just chugged a 5-hour ENERGY, or if she was just naturally that chipper. Even though I was just sitting, my heart was pounding against my chest. This is why people had witnesses: to help them keep calm before the wedding. For the first time since we\u2019d landed, I wished Shepley and my brothers were there with me. They would have been giving me all kinds of shit, helping to keep my mind off the fact that my stomach was begging to throw up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door opened. \u201cHere you are!

I\u2019ll bring you some cheese and crackers, and maybe a little fruit plate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure, thanks,\u201d I said, still a little bewildered by Chantilly\u2019s enthusiasm.</p> <p>She backed out, shut the door, and I was alone again. My head fell back against the couch, my eyes picked out different shapes in the wall texture. I was grateful for anything that kept me from glancing down at my watch. Was she coming? I closed my eyes tight, refusing to go there. She loved me. I trusted her. She would be here. Goddammit, I wished my brothers were here. I was going to go out of my everlovin\u2019 mind.</p><p>Abby</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you look pretty,\u201d the driver said as I slid into the backseat of the taxi.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, feeling relieved to be out of the casino. \u201cGraceland Chapel, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to start out the day married, or what?\u201d the driver said, smiling back at me from the rearview mirror. She had short, gray hair, and her backside filled up all of the seat, and then some.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just the quickest we could get it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully young to be in such a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, watching Las Vegas pass by outside my window.</p><p>She clicked her tongue. \u201cYou look pretty nervous. If you\u2019re having second thoughts, just let me know. I don\u2019t mind turning around. It\u2019s okay, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous about getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we love each other. I\u2019m not nervous about that. I just want him to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s having second thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, laughing once. I met her eyes in the mirror. \u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice,\u201d she said, winking at me. \u201cI got married in the same chapel that you are the first time around. But so did Bon Jovi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Bon Jovi? Tommy used to work on the docks!\u201d she sang, very much to my surprise.</p><p>\u201cYep! Heard of him,\u201d I said, amused and grateful for the distraction.</p><p>\u201cI just love him. Here! I have the CD.\u201d She popped it in, and for the rest of the drive we listened to Jon\u2019s greatest hits. \u201cWanted Dead or Alive,\u201d \u201cAlways,\u201d \u201cBed of Roses\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ll Be There for You\u201d was just finishing up as we pulled over to the curb in front of the chapel.</p> <p>I pulled out a fifty. \u201cKeep the rest. Bon Jovi helped.\u201d</p><p>She gave me back the change. \u201cNo tip, honey. You let me sing.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and waved to her as she left. Was Travis already here? I walked up to the chapel and opened the door. An older woman with big hair and too much lip gloss greeted me. \u201cAbby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, fidgeting with my dress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stunning. My name is Chantilly, and I\u2019ll be one of your witnesses. Let me take your things. I\u2019ll put them away, and they\u2019ll be safe until you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, watching her take away my purse. Something swished when she walked, though I couldn\u2019t pinpoint what exactly. \u201cOh, wait! The . . .\u201d I said, watching as she walked toward me holding out my purse. \u201cTravis\u2019s ring is in there. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were barely slits when she smiled, making her fake lashes even more noticeable. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, honey. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember how,\u201d I said, sliding his ring over my thumb.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, holding out her hand. \u201cGive me your ring and his. I\u2019ll give them to each of you when it\u2019s time. Elvis will be by shortly to take you down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, blank faced. \u201cElvis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in The King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know who Elvis is, but . . .\u201d My words trailed away as I pulled off my ring with a small tug, and placed it in her palm next to Travis\u2019s ring.</p><p>Chantilly smiled. \u201cYou can use this room to freshen up. Travis is waiting, so Elvis will be knocking any minute. See you at the end of the aisle!\u201d</p><p>She watched me as she shut the door. I turned, startled by my own reflection in the huge mirror behind me. It was bordered by large, round lights like one an actress might use before a Broadway show. I sat down at the vanity, staring at myself in the mirror. Is that what I was? An actress?</p><p>He was waiting. Travis is at the end of the aisle, waiting for me to join him so we can promise the rest of our lives to each other.</p><p>What if my plan doesn\u2019t work? What if he goes to prison and this was all for nothing? What if they didn\u2019t so much as sniff in Travis\u2019s direction, and this was all pointless? I no longer had the excuse that I had gotten married, before I was even legal to drink, because I was saving him. Did I need an excuse if I loved him? Why did anyone get married? For love? We had that in spades. I was so sure of everything in the beginning. I used to be sure about a lot things. I didn\u2019t feel sure now. About anything.</p><p>I thought about the look on Travis\u2019s face if he found out the truth, and then I thought about what bailing would do to him. I never wanted him to hurt and I needed him as if he were a part of me. Of those two things I was sure.</p><p>Two knocks on the door nearly sent me into a panic attack. I turned, gripping the top of the chair back. It was white wire, swirls and curves formed a heart in the middle.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d Elvis said in a deep, southern voice. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said quietly. I don\u2019t know why. He couldn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>\u201cAbby? Your hunka hunka burnin\u2019 love is ready for ya.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cI just . . . need a minute.\u201d</p><p>The other side of the door was quiet. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cJust one minute, please.\u201d</p><p>After a few more minutes, there was another knock on the door. \u201cAbby?\u201d It was Chantilly. \u201cCan I come in, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, but no. I\u2019ll be okay. I just need a little more time, and I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>After another five minutes, three knocks on the door caused beads of sweat to form along my hairline. These knocks were familiar. Stronger. More confident.</p><p>\u201cPidge?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Cash</p><p>Travis</p><p>The door blew open. \u201cShe\u2019s here! I just showed her to a dressing room to freshen up. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d I said, jumping to my feet. I wiped my sweaty palms on my slacks and followed Chantilly out to the hallway, and into the lobby. I stopped.</p><p>\u201cThis way, honey,\u201d Chantilly said, encouraging me toward the double doors that led into the chapel.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Chantilly pointed. \u201cIn there. As soon as she\u2019s ready, we\u2019ll get started. But, you have to be at the other end of the aisle, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was sweet and patient. I imagined she dealt with all kinds of situations, from drunks to jitters. After one last look at the door to Abby\u2019s room, I followed Chantilly down the aisle and she gave me the rundown on where to stand. While she was talking, a man with thick chops and an Elvis costume pushed open the door in grandiose fashion, curling his lips and humming \u201cBlue Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I really like Vegas! You like Vegas?\u201d he said, his Elvis impression spot-on.</p><p>I grinned. \u201cToday I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t ask for better than that! Has Ms. Chantilly told you everything you need to know to be a mister this mornin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think.\u201d</p><p>He slapped my back. \u201cNo worries, fella, you\u2019re gonna do just fine. I\u2019ll go get your missus. Be back in a flash.\u201d</p><p>Chantilly giggled. \u201cOh, that Elvis.\u201d After a couple of minutes, Chantilly checked her watch, and then walked back down the aisle toward the double doors.</p><p>\u201cThis happens all the time,\u201d the officiant assured me.</p><p>After another five minutes, Chantilly popped her head through the doors. \u201cTravis? I think she\u2019s a little . . . nervous. Do you want to try to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said. The aisle seemed short before, but now it felt like a mile. I pushed through the doors, and raised my fist. I paused, took a breath, and then knocked a few times. \u201cPidge?\u201d</p><p>After what felt like two eternities, Abby finally spoke, her voice on the other side of the door. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Even though she was only inches away, she sounded miles away, just like the morning after I brought those two girls home from the bar. Just the thought of that night made me feel a burning sickness in my gut. I didn\u2019t even feel like the same person I was then.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I just . . . I was rushed. I need a moment to breathe.\u201d</p><p>She sounded anything but okay. I was determined to keep my head, to fight away the panic that used to cause me to do all kinds of stupid stuff. I needed to be the man Abby deserved. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Chantilly cleared her throat and wrung her hands, clearly trying to think of something encouraging to say.</p><p>I needed to be on the other side of that door.</p><p>\u201cPidge . . .\u201d I said, followed by a pause. What I would say next could change everything, but making everything all right for Abby trumped my own epically selfish needs. \u201cI know you know I love you. What you may not know is that there is nothing I want more than to be your husband. But if you\u2019re not ready, I\u2019ll wait for you, Pigeon. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I mean, yeah. I want this, but only if you do. I just . . . I need you to know that you can open this door and we can walk down the aisle, or we can get a taxi and go home. Either way, I love you.\u201d</p><p>After another long pause, I knew it was time. I pulled an old, worn envelope from my inside jacket pocket, and held it with both hands. The faded pen looped around, and I followed the lines with my index finger. My mother had written the words To the future Mrs. Travis Maddox. My dad had given it to me when he thought things between Abby and me were getting serious. I\u2019d only pulled this letter out once since then, wondering what she\u2019d written inside, but never betraying the seal. Those words weren\u2019t meant for me.</p><p>My hands were shaking. I had no clue what Mom had written, but I really needed her right now, and was hoping that this one time, she could somehow reach out from where she was and help me. I squatted down, sliding the envelope under the door.</p><p>Abby</p><p>Pidge. The word used to make my eyes roll. I didn\u2019t know why he started calling me that in the first place, and I didn\u2019t care. Now, Travis\u2019s weird little nickname for me spoken in his deep, gritty voice made my entire body relax. I stood and walked over to the door, holding my palm to the wood. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I could hear my breath; wheezing, slow, like I was sleeping. Every part of me was relaxed. His warm words fell slowly around me like a cozy blanket. It didn\u2019t matter what happened after we got home, as long as I was Travis\u2019s wife. It was then that I understood that whether I was doing this to help him or not, I was there to get married to the man who loved me more than any man loved any woman. And I loved him\u2014enough for three lifetimes. In the Graceland Chapel, in this dress was almost exactly where I wanted to be. The only place better would be next to him at the end of the aisle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just then, a small, white square appeared at my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I said, bending down to pick it up. The paper was old, yellow. It was addressed to the future Mrs. Travis Maddox.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from my mom,\u201d Travis said.</p><p>My breath caught. I almost didn\u2019t want to open it, it had obviously been sealed and kept safe for so long.</p> <p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Travis said, seeming to read my thoughts.</p><p>My finger carefully slid in between the opening, hoping to preserve it as best I could, but failing miserably. I pulled out the tri-folded paper, and the entire world stopped.</p><p>We don\u2019t know each other, but I know that you must be very special. I can\u2019t be there today, to watch my baby boy promise his love to you, but there are a few things that I think I might say to you if I were.</p><p>First, thank you for loving my son. Of all my boys, Travis is the most tender hearted. He is also the strongest. He will love you with everything he has for as long as you let him. Tragedies in life sometimes change us, but some things never change.</p><p>A boy without a mother is a very curious creature. If Travis is anything like his father, and I know that he is, he\u2019s a deep ocean of fragility, protected by a thick wall of swear words and feigned indifference. A Maddox boy will take you all the way to the edge, but if you go with him, he\u2019ll follow you anywhere.</p> <p>I wish more than anything that I could be there today. I wish I could see his face when he takes this step with you, and that I could stand there with my husband and experience this day with all of you. I think that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ll miss the most. But today isn\u2019t about me. You reading this letter means that my son loves you. And when a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever.</p><p>Please give my baby boy a kiss for me. My wish for both of you is that the biggest fight you have is over who is the most forgiving.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Diane</p><p>\u201cPigeon?\u201d</p><p>I held the letter to my chest with one hand, and opened the door with the other. Travis\u2019s face was tight with worry, but the second his eyes met mine, the worry fell away.</p> <p>He seemed stunned by the sight of me. \u201cYou\u2019re . . . I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a word for how beautiful you are.\u201d</p><p>His sweet, chestnut eyes, shadowed by his thick eyelashes, soothed my nerves. His tattoos were hidden under his gray suit and crisp, white button-up. My God, he was perfection. He was sexy, he was brave, he was tender, and Travis Maddox was mine. All I had to do was walk down the aisle. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>My throat tightened so a sob wouldn\u2019t escape. I kissed him on the cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he said, a sweet smile sweeping his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd she pretty much nailed everything wonderful about you, even though she didn\u2019t get to watch you grow up. She\u2019s so wonderful, Travis. I wish I could have known her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish she could have known you.\u201d He paused a moment in thought, and then held up his hands.</p><p>His sleeve inched back, revealing his PIGEON tattoo. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep on it. You don\u2019t have to decide right now. We\u2019ll go back to the hotel, think about it, and\u2014\u201d He sighed, letting his arms and shoulders fall. \u201cI know. This is crazy. I just wanted it so bad, Abby. This crazy is my sanity. We can . . .\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t stand watching him stumble and struggle any longer. \u201cBaby, stop,\u201d I said, touching his mouth with three of my fingertips. \u201cJust stop.\u201d</p><p>He watched me. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re straight, I\u2019m not leaving here until you\u2019re my husband.\u201d</p><p>At first his brows pulled in, dubious, and then he offered a cautious smile. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my bouquet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Chantilly said, distracted by the discussion. \u201cHere, honey.\u201d She handed me a perfectly round ball of red roses.</p><p>Elvis offered his arm, and I took it. \u201cSee you at the altar, Travis,\u201d he said.</p><p>Travis took my hand, kissed my fingers, and then jogged back the way he\u2019d come, followed by a giggly Chantilly.</p><p>That small touch wasn\u2019t enough. Suddenly I couldn\u2019t wait to get to him, and my feet quickly made their way to the chapel. The wedding march wasn\u2019t playing, instead \u201cThing for You,\u201d the song we danced to at my birthday party, came through the speakers.</p><p>I stopped and looked at Travis, finally getting a chance to take in his gray suit and black Converse sneakers. He smiled when he saw the recognition in my eyes. I took another step, and then another. The officiant gestured for me to slow down, but I couldn\u2019t. My entire body needed to be next to Travis more than it ever had been before. He must have felt the same way. Elvis hadn\u2019t made it halfway before Travis decided to stop waiting and walked toward us. I took his arm.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . I was gonna give \u2019er away.\u201d</p><p>Travis\u2019s mouth pulled to one side. \u201cShe was already mine.\u201d</p><p>I hugged his arm, and we walked the rest of the way together. The music quieted, and the officiant nodded to both of us.</p><p>\u201cTravis . . . Abby.\u201d</p><p>Chantilly took my rose bouquet, and then stood to the side.</p><p>Our trembling hands were knotted together. We were both so nervous and happy that it was almost impossible to stand still.</p><p>Even knowing how much I truly wanted to marry Travis, my hands were trembling. I\u2019m not sure what the officiant said exactly. I can\u2019t remember his face or what he wore, I can only recall his deep nasally voice, his northeastern accent, and Travis\u2019s hands holding mine.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Pidge,\u201d Travis said quietly.</p><p>I glanced up at my future husband, getting lost in the sincerity and adoration in his eyes. No one, not even America, had ever looked at me with that much love. The corners of Travis\u2019s mouth turned up, so I must have had the same expression.</p><p>As the officiant spoke, Travis\u2019s eyes poured over me, my face, my hair, my dress\u2014he even looked down at my shoes. Then, he leaned over until his lips were just a few inches from my neck, and inhaled.</p><p>The officiant paused.</p><p>\u201cI wanna remember everything,\u201d Travis said.</p><p>The officiant smiled, nodded, and continued.</p><p>A flash went off, startling us. Travis glanced behind him, acknowledged the photographer, and then looked at me. We mirrored each other\u2019s cheesy grins. I didn\u2019t care that we must have looked absolutely ridiculous. It was like we were getting ready to jump off the highest high dive into the deepest river that fed into the most magnificent, terrifying waterfall, right onto the best and most fantastic roller coaster in the universe. Times ten.</p><p>\u201cTrue marriage begins well before the wedding day,\u201d the officiant began. \u201cAnd the efforts of marriage continue well beyond the ceremony\u2019s end. A brief moment in time and the stroke of the pen are all that is needed to create the legal bond of marriage, but it takes a lifetime of love, commitment, forgiveness, and compromise to make marriage durable and everlasting. I think, Travis and Abby, you\u2019ve just shown us what your love is capable of in a tense moment. Your yesterdays were the path that led you to this chapel, and your journey to a future of togetherness becomes a little clearer with each new day.\u201d</p><p>Travis leaned his cheek to my temple. I was grateful he wanted to touch me where and whenever he could. If I could have hugged him to me and not disrupted the ceremony, I would have. The officiant\u2019s words began to blur together. A few times, Travis spoke, and I did, too. I slipped Travis\u2019s black ring onto his finger, and he beamed.</p><p>\u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d I said, repeating after the officiant.</p><p>\u201cNice choice,\u201d Travis said, admiring his ring.</p><p>When it was Travis\u2019s turn, he seemed to have trouble, and then slid two rings onto my finger: my engagement ring, and a simple, gold band.</p><p>I wanted to take a moment to appreciate that he\u2019d gotten me an official wedding band, maybe even say so, but I was having an out-of-body experience. The harder I tried to be present, the faster everything seemed to happen.</p><p>I thought maybe I should actually listen to the list of things I was promising, but the only voice that made sense was Travis\u2019s. \u201cI damn sure do,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cAnd I promise to never enter another fight, drink in excess, gamble, or throw a punch in anger . . . and I\u2019ll never, ever make you cry sad tears again.\u201d</p><p>When it was my turn again, I paused. \u201cI just want you to know, before I make my promises, that I\u2019m super stubborn. You already know I\u2019m hard to live with, and you\u2019ve made it clear on dozens of occasions that I drive you crazy. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve driven anyone who\u2019s watched these last few months crazy with my indecision and uncertainty. But I want you to know that whatever love is, this has got to be it. We were best friends first, and we tried not to fall in love, and we did anyway. If you\u2019re not with me, it\u2019s not where I want to be. I\u2019m in this. I\u2019m with you. We might be impulsive, and absolutely insane to be standing here at our age, six months after we met.</p><p>This whole thing might play out to be a completely wonderful, beautiful disaster, but I want that if it\u2019s with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Johnny and June,\u201d Travis said, his eyes a bit glossed over. \u201cIt\u2019s all uphill from here, and I\u2019m going to love every minute of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014\u201d the officiant began.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said with a chuckle, \u201cbut I have to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it once. I don\u2019t need to hear it again,\u201d I said, smiling, never taking my eyes from Travis. He squeezed my hands. We repeated more promises, and then the officiant paused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Travis asked.</p><p>The officiant smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, his eyebrows raised. He looked like a kid on Christmas morning.</p><p>\u201cYou may now kiss your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Travis took me in both arms and wrapped me tightly, kissing me, excitedly and passionate at first, and then his lips slowed, moving against mine more tenderly.</p><p>Chantilly clapped with her petite, chubby hands. \u201cThat was a good one! The best one I\u2019ve seen all week! I love it when they don\u2019t go as planned.\u201d</p><p>The officiant said, \u201cI present to you, Ms. Chantilly and Mr. King, Mr. and Mrs. Travis Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Elvis clapped, too, and Travis lifted me in his arms. I took each side of his face into my hands and leaned over to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying not to have a Tom Cruise moment,\u201d Travis said, beaming at everyone in the room. \u201cI now understand the whole jumping on the couch and punching the floor thing. I don\u2019t know how to express how I feel! Where\u2019s Oprah?\u201d</p><p>I let out an uncharacteristic cackle. He was grinning ear to ear, and I\u2019m sure I looked just as annoyingly happy. Travis set me down, and then glanced around at everyone in the room.</p><p>He seemed a little shocked. \u201cWoo!\u201d he yelled, his fists shaking in front of him. He was having a very Tom Cruise moment. He laughed, and then he kissed me again. \u201cWe did it!\u201d</p><p>I laughed with him. He took me into his arms, and I noticed that his eyes were a little glossy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe married me!\u201d he said to Elvis. \u201cI fucking love you, baby!\u201d he yelled again, hugging and kissing me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what I expected, but this definitely wasn\u2019t it. Chantilly, the officiant, and even Elvis were laughing, half in amusement, half in awe. The photographer\u2019s flash was going off like we were surrounded by paparazzi.</p><p>\u201cJust a few papers to sign, a few pictures, and then you can start your happily-ever-after,\u201d Chantilly said. She turned and then faced us again with a wide, toothy grin, holding up a piece of paper and a pen.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Chantilly said. \u201cYour bouquet. We\u2019re going to need that in the pictures.\u201d</p> <p>She handed me the flowers, and Travis and I posed. We stood together. We showed off our rings. Side by side, face-to-face, jumping in the air, hugging, kissing\u2014at one point Travis held me up in his arms. After a quick signing of the marriage certificate, Travis led me by the hand to the limo waiting for us outside.</p><p>\u201cDid that really just happen?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I see some misty eyes back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigeon, you are now Mrs. Travis Maddox. I\u2019ve never been this happy in my life!\u201d</p> <p>A smile burst across my face, and I laughed and shook my head. I\u2019d never seen a crazy person be so endearing. I lunged at him, pressing his lips against mine. Since his tongue had been in my mouth in the chapel, all I could think about was getting it back there.</p><p>Travis knotted his fingers in my hair as I climbed on top of him, and I dug my knees into the leather seat on each side of his hips. My fingers fumbled with his belt while he leaned over to press the button to lift the privacy window.</p><p>I cussed his shirt buttons for taking so long to undo, and then began working impatiently on his zipper. Travis\u2019s mouth was everywhere; kissing the tender parts of skin just behind my ear, running his tongue down the line of my neck, and nibbling my collarbone. With one motion, he turned me onto my back, immediately sliding his hand up my thigh and hooking my panties with his finger. Within moments, they were hanging off one of my ankles, and Travis\u2019s hand was moving up the inside of my leg until he paused at the tender skin between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d I whispered before he silenced me with his mouth. He was breathing hard through his nose, holding me against him like it was the first and the last time.</p><p>Travis pulled back onto his knees, his ripped abs and chest, and his tattoos on full display. My thighs instinctively tensed, but he took my right leg in both of his hands, gently moving them apart. I watched as his mouth hungrily worked from my toes, to my heel, my calf, my knee, and then to my inner thigh. I lifted my hips to his mouth, but he lingered on my upper legs for several moments, far more patient than I was.</p><p>Once his tongue touched the most sensitive parts of me, his fingers slid between my dress and the seat, gripping my ass, lightly tugging me toward him. Every nerve melted and tensed at the same time. Travis had been in that position before, but he had clearly been holding back; saving his best work for our wedding night. My knees bent, shook, and I grabbed at his ears.</p> <p>He paused once, only to whisper my name against my wet skin, and I faltered, closing my eyes and feeling as if they were rolling to the back of my head in pure ecstasy. I moaned, making his kisses more eager, and then he tensed, lifting my body closer to his mouth.</p><p>Every passing second became more intense, a brick wall between wanting to let go and needing to stay in that moment. Finally, when I couldn\u2019t wait any longer, I reached up and buried Travis\u2019s face into me. I cried out, feeling him smiling, overcome by the intense jolts of electricity bolting throughout my body.</p><p>With all of Travis\u2019s distractions, I didn\u2019t realize we were at the Bellagio until I heard the driver\u2019s voice over the speaker. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Maddox, but we\u2019ve arrived at your hotel. Would you like me to take another drive down the Strip?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Finally</p><p>Travis</p><p>\u201cNo, just give us a minute,\u201d I said.</p><p>Abby was half-lying, half sitting on the black leather seat of the limo, her cheeks flushed, breathing hard. I kissed her ankle, and then pulled her panties off the toe of her high heel, handing them to her.</p> <p>God damn, she was a beautiful sight. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of her while I buttoned up my shirt. Abby flashed me a huge grin while she shimmied her panties back over her hips. The limo driver knocked on the door. Abby nodded and I gave him the green light to open it. I handed him a large bill, and then lifted my wife into my arms. We made it through the lobby and then the casino in just a few minutes. You might say I was a little motivated to get back to the room\u2014luckily having Abby in my arms provided cover for my bulging dick.</p><p>She ignored the dozens of people staring at us while we entered the elevator, and then planted her mouth on mine. The floor number was muffled when I tried to say it to the amused couple closest to the buttons, but I saw out of the corner of my eye that they\u2019d pushed the right one.</p><p>As soon as we stepped into the hall, my heart began to pound. When we reached the door, I struggled with keeping Abby in my arms and getting the keycard out of my pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it, baby,\u201d she said, pulling it out and then kissing me while she unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Abby smiled against my mouth. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I carried her into the room and lowered her down to stand at the foot of the bed. Abby watched me for a moment while she kicked off her heels. \u201cLet\u2019s get this out of the way, Mrs. Maddox. This is one article of clothing of yours that I don\u2019t want to ruin.\u201d</p><p>I turned her around and then slowly unzipped her dress, kissing each piece of skin as it was exposed. Every inch of Abby was already ingrained in my mind, but touching and tasting the skin of the woman that was now my wife made it new all over again. I felt an excitement I\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>The dress fell to the floor, and I picked it up, tossing it over the back of a chair. Abby unsnapped the back of her bra, letting it fall to the floor, and I tucked my thumbs between her skin and the lacey fabric of her panties. I grinned. I\u2019d already had them off once.</p><p>I leaned down to kiss the skin behind her ear. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d I whispered, slowly pushing her panties down her thighs. They fell to her ankles, and she kicked them away with her bare feet. I wrapped my arms around her, taking a deep breath in through my nose, pulling her bare back against my chest. I needed to be inside her, my dick was practically reaching out for her, but it was important to take our time. We only got one shot at a wedding night, and I wanted it to be perfect.</p><p>Abby</p><p>Goose bumps formed all over my body. Four months earlier, Travis had taken something from me I\u2019d never given to any other man. I was so hell-bent on giving it to him, I didn\u2019t have time to be nervous. Now, on our wedding night, knowing what to expect and knowing how much he loved me, I was more nervous than I had been that first night.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this out of the way, Mrs. Maddox. This is one article of clothing of yours that I don\u2019t want to ruin,\u201d he said.</p><p>I breathed out a small laugh, remembering my buttoned-up, pink cardigan, and the pattern of blood spatters down the middle of it. Then I thought about seeing Travis in the cafeteria the first time.</p><p>\u201cI ruin a lot of sweaters,\u201d he\u2019d said with his killer smile and dimples. The same smile I wanted to hate; the same lips that were making their way down my back right now.</p><p>Travis moved me forward, and I crawled onto the bed, looking behind me, waiting, hoping he would climb on. He was watching me, pulling off his shirt, kicking off his shoes, and dropping his slacks to the floor. He shook his head, turned me onto my back, and then settled on top of me.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather look into my wife\u2019s eyes than be creative . . . at least for tonight.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a loose hair from my face, and then kissed my nose. It was a little amusing watching Travis take his time, pondering how and what he wanted to do to me. Once we were naked and settled under the sheets, he took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Maddox?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just wanted to call you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I kind of like it.\u201d</p><p>Travis\u2019s eyes scanned my face. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a real question? Because it\u2019s kind of hard to show it more than taking vows to be with you forever.\u201d</p><p>Travis paused, confliction darkening his expression. \u201cI saw you,\u201d he said, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cIn the casino.\u201d</p><p>My memory instantly went into rewind, already sure he had crossed paths with Jesse, and he\u2019d possibly seen a woman with him who resembled me. Jealous eyes play tricks on people. Just when I was ready to argue that I hadn\u2019t seen my ex, Travis began again.</p><p>\u201cOn the floor. I saw you, Pidge.\u201d</p><p>My stomach sank. He\u2019d seen me crying. How would I possibly explain that away? I couldn\u2019t. The only way was to create a diversion.</p><p>I pushed my head back into the pillow, looking straight into the eyes. \u201cWhy do you call me Pigeon? I mean really?\u201d</p><p>My question seemed to take him off guard. I waited, hoping he would forget all about the previous topic. I didn\u2019t want to lie to his face, or admit what I\u2019d done. Not tonight. Not ever.</p><p>His choice to allow me to change the subject was clear in his eyes. He knew what I was doing, and he was going to let me do it. \u201cYou know what a pigeon is?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in a tiny movement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dove. They\u2019re really fucking smart. They\u2019re loyal, and they mate for life. That first time I saw you, in the Circle, I knew what you were. Under the buttoned-up cardigan and the blood, you weren\u2019t going to fall for my shit. You were going to make me earn it. You would require a reason to trust me. I saw it in your eyes, and I couldn\u2019t shake it until I saw you that day in the cafeteria. Even though I tried to ignore it, I knew it even then. Every fuckup, every bad choice, were bread crumbs, so that we found our way to each other. So that we found our way to this moment.\u201d</p><p>My breath faltered. \u201cI am so in love with you.\u201d</p><p>His body was lying between my open legs, and I could feel him against my thighs, only a couple of inches from where I wanted him to be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife.\u201d When he said the words, a peace filled his eyes. It reminded me of the night he won the bet for me to stay at his apartment.</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re stuck with me, now.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my chin. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>He took his time as he gently slid inside of me, closing his eyes for only a second before gazing into mine again. He rocked against me slowly, rhythmically, kissing my mouth intermittently. Even though Travis had always been careful and gentle with me, the first few moments were a little uncomfortable. He must have known that I was new to this, even though I\u2019d never mentioned it. The whole campus knew about Travis\u2019s conquests, but my experiences with him were never the wild romps everyone talked about. Travis was always soft and tender with me; patient. Tonight was no exception. Maybe even more so.</p><p>Once I relaxed, and moved back against him, Travis reached down. He hooked his hand behind my knee and pulled up gently, stopping at his hip. He slid into me again, this time deeper. I sighed, and lifted my hip to him. There were much worse things in life than promising to feel Travis Maddox\u2019s naked body against and inside of mine for the rest of my life. Much, much worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed me, and tasted me, and hummed against my mouth. Rocking against me, craving me, pulling at my skin as he lifted my other leg and pushed my knees against my chest so he could press himself into me even deeper. I moaned and shifted, unable to keep quiet while he positioned himself so he was entering me at different angles, working his hips until my nails were digging into the skin of his back. My fingertips were buried deep into his sweaty skin, but I could still feel his muscles bulging and sliding beneath them.</p><p>Travis\u2019s thighs were rubbing and bumping against my backside. He held himself up on one elbow, and then sat up, pulling my legs with him until my ankles were resting on his shoulders. He made love to me harder, then, and even though it was a little painful, that pain shot sparks of adrenaline all over my body. It took every bit of pleasure I was already feeling to a new level.</p><p>\u201cOh, God . . . Travis,\u201d I said, breathing his name. I needed to say something, anything to let go of the intensity building up inside me.</p><p>My words made his body tense, and the rhythm of his movements became faster, more rigid, until beads of sweat formed on our skin, making it easier to slide against each other.</p> <p>He let my legs fall back to the bed as he positioned himself directly over me again. He shook his head. \u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he moaned. \u201cI wanna make this last all night, but I . . .\u201d</p><p>I touched my lips to his ear. \u201cI want you to come,\u201d I said, ending the simple sentence with a soft, small kiss.</p><p>I relaxed my hips, letting my knees fall even farther apart and closer to the bed. Travis pressed deep inside me, over and over, his movements building as he groaned. I gripped my knee, pulling it toward my chest. The pain felt so good it was addictive, and I felt it build until my whole body tensed in short but strong bursts. I moaned loudly, not caring who might hear.</p><p>Travis groaned in reaction. Finally, his movements slowed, but they were stronger, until he finally called out. \u201cOh, fuck! Damn! Agh!\u201d he yelled. His body twitched and trembled as he pressed his forehead hard against my cheek.</p><p>Both out of breath, we didn\u2019t speak. Travis kept his cheek against mine, twitching one more time before burying his face in the pillow under my head.</p> <p>I kissed his neck, tasting the salt on his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d I said.</p><p>Travis pulled back to look at me, curious.</p><p>\u201cYou were my last first kiss.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, pressed his lips against me hard, and then buried his face against my neck. He was breathing heavily but still managed to sweetly whisper, \u201cI fucking love you, Pigeon.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p> <p>Before</p><p>Abby</p><p>A buzzing pulled me out of a deep sleep. The curtains kept out all but the slivers of sun bordering them. The blanket and sheets were hanging halfway off our king-size bed. My dress had fallen off the chair onto the floor, joining Travis\u2019s suit that was scattered all over the room, and I could only see one of my high heels.</p><p>My naked body was tangled with Travis\u2019s, after the third time we consummated our marriage we passed out from sheer exhaustion.</p><p>Again with the buzzing. It was my phone on the nightstand. I reached over Travis and flipped it over, seeing Trent\u2019s name.</p><p>Adam arrested.</p><p>John Savage on the list of dead.</p><p>That was all he said. I felt sick as I deleted the messages, worried that maybe Trent didn\u2019t offer more because the police were at Jim\u2019s now, maybe even telling their dad that Travis might be involved. I glanced at the time on my phone. It was ten o\u2019clock.</p> <p>John Savage was one less person to investigate. One more death for Travis to feel guilty about. I tried to remember if I\u2019d seen John after the fire broke out. He was knocked out. Maybe he\u2019d never gotten up. I thought of those frightened girls Trent and I saw in the hall of the basement. I thought about Hilary Short, who I knew from calc class, and was smiling as she stood next to her new boyfriend near the opposite wall of Keaton Hall five minutes before the fire. How long the list of the dead really was and who was on it was something I\u2019d tried not to think about.</p><p>Maybe we should all be punished. The truth was, we were all responsible, because we were all irresponsible. There is a reason why fire marshals clear these kinds of events and safety precautions are taken. We ignored all of that. Turning on a radio or the television without seeing the images on the news was impossible, so Travis and I avoided them when possible. But all this media attention meant investigators would be all the more motivated to find someone to blame. I wondered if their hunt would stop with Adam, or if they were out for blood. If I were a parent of one of those dead students, I might be.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to see Travis go to jail for everyone\u2019s irresponsible behavior, and right or wrong, that wouldn\u2019t bring anyone back. I had done everything I could think of to keep him out of trouble, and I would deny his presence in Keaton Hall that night to my dying breath.</p><p>People had done worse for those they loved.</p><p>\u201cTravis,\u201d I said, nudging him. He was facedown with his head buried under a pillow.</p><p>Uggggghhhhh, he groaned. \u201cYou want me to make breakfast? You want eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just after ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill qualifies as brunch.\u201d When I didn\u2019t respond, he offered again. \u201cOkay, an egg sandwich?\u201d</p><p>I paused, and then looked over at him with a smile. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Travis\u2019s head popped up and he flipped on the lamp. Once the last twenty-four hours finally set in, his hand emerged from under his pillow and he hooked his arm around me, pulling me beneath him. He nestled his hips between my thighs, and then bent his head down to kiss me; softly, tenderly, letting his lips linger on mine until they were warm and tingly</p><p>\u201cI can still get you eggs. Want me to call room service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually have a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>His face fell. \u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur flight is at four. Checkout is at eleven.\u201d</p><p>Travis frowned, and looked over at the window. \u201cI should have booked an extra day. We should be lying in bed or by the pool.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his cheek. \u201cWe have classes tomorrow. We\u2019ll save up and go somewhere later. I don\u2019t want to spend our honeymoon in Vegas, anyway.\u201d</p><p>His face screwed into disgust. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t wanna spend it in Illinois.\u201d</p><p>I conceded with a nod. Couldn\u2019t exactly argue that. Illinois wasn\u2019t the first place that came to mind when I thought honeymoon. \u201cSt. Thomas is beautiful. We don\u2019t even need passports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Since I\u2019m not fighting anymore, we\u2019ll need to save where we can.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Pidge. I don\u2019t need all that when I have you. You\u2019ve changed everything. You\u2019re tomorrow. You\u2019re the apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>My nose wrinkled. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like that word.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and rolled onto the bed, just a few inches from my left side. Lying on his stomach, he pulled his hands under him, settling them under his chest, and he lay his cheek against the mattress, watching me for a moment, his eyes staring into mine.</p><p>\u201cYou said something at the wedding . . . that we were like Johnny and June. I didn\u2019t quite get the reference.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about Johnny Cash and June Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fought him tooth and nail, too. They fought, and he was stupid about a lot of stuff. They worked it out and spent the rest of their lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? I bet she didn\u2019t have Mick for a dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never hurt you again, Pigeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t promise that. Just when I start settling in somewhere, he shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have regular jobs, broke like every other college student, so he won\u2019t have a reason to sniff around us for money. We\u2019ll need every dime. Good thing I still have a little left in savings to carry us through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny ideas where you\u2019ll apply for a job? I thought about tutoring. Math.\u201d</p><p>Travis smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be good at that. Maybe I\u2019ll tutor science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good at that. I can be a reference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll count coming from my wife.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cOh my God. That just sounds crazy.\u201d</p><p>Travis laughed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it? I fucking love it. I\u2019m going to take care of you, Pidge. I can\u2019t promise that Mick will never hurt you again, but I can promise that I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep that from happening. And if it does, I\u2019ll love you through it.\u201d</p><p>I offered a small smile, and then reached up to touch his cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said right back. \u201cWas he a good dad . . . before all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, looking up at the ceiling. \u201cI guess I thought he was. But what does a kid know about being a good parent? I have good memories of him. He drank for as long as I can remember, and gambled, but when his luck was up, he was kind. Generous. A lot of his friends were family men . . . they also worked for the mob, but they had kids. They were nice and didn\u2019t mind Mick bringing me around. I spent a lot of time behind the scenes, seeing things most kids don\u2019t get to see because he took me everywhere then.\u201d I felt a smile creep up, and then a tear fell. \u201cYeah, I guess he was, in his own way. I loved him. To me, he was perfect.\u201d</p><p>Travis touched his fingertip to my temple, tenderly wiping the moisture away. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Pidge.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, trying to play it off. \u201cSee? He can still hurt me, even when he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, taking my hand in his. He was still staring at me, his cheek against the sheets. \u201cYou turned my world upside down, and I got a brand-new beginning . . . like an apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI still don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>He pushed off the bed, wrapping the sheet around his waist. \u201cIt depends on how you look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really,\u201d I said, watching him walk to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in five.\u201d</p><p>I stretched, letting all of my limbs spread in every direction on the bed, and then I sat up, combing my hair out with my fingers. The toilet flushed, and then the faucet turned on. He wasn\u2019t kidding. He would be ready in a few minutes and I was still naked in bed.</p><p>Fitting my dress and his suit in the carry-on proved to be a challenge, but I finally made it work. Travis emerged from the bathroom and brushed his fingers across mine as we passed.</p><p>Teeth brushed, hair combed, I changed and we were checking out by eleven.</p><p>Travis took pictures of the lobby ceiling with his phone, and then we took one last look around before leaving for the long taxi line.

The airport?\u201d Travis asked, holding his hand out for mine.</p><p>I took it, turning it enough so that I could see my nickname on his wrist. \u201cNo, I\u2019m thinking we need to make a pit stop first.\u201d</p><p>One of his eyebrows pulled up. \u201cTo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p> <p>Inked</p><p>Abby</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Travis said, blanching. \u201cWe\u2019re not here for me?\u201d</p><p>The tattoo artist stared at us both, a little surprised at Travis\u2019s surprise.</p><p>The entire taxi ride over, Travis assumed I was buying him a new tattoo as a wedding present. When I told the driver our destination, it never occurred to Travis that I would be the one getting inked. He talked about tattooing ABBY somewhere on him, but since he already had PIGEON on his wrist, I thought it would be redundant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn,\u201d I said, turning to the tattoo artist. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGriffin,\u201d he said in a monotone.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cI want MRS. MADDOX here.\u201d I touched my finger to my jeans on the right side of my lower abdomen, just low enough not to be seen, even in a bikini. I wanted Travis to be the only one privy to my ink, a nice surprise every time he undressed me.</p><p>Travis beamed. \u201cMrs. Maddox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in this font,\u201d I said, pointing to a laminated poster on the wall featuring sample tattoos.</p><p>Travis smiled. \u201cThat fits you. It\u2019s elegant, but not fussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. It\u2019ll be about an hour. We have a couple people ahead of you. It\u2019ll be two fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo fifty? For a few scribbles?\u201d Travis said, his mouth falling open. \u201cWhat the fuck, chuck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Griffin,\u201d he said, unaffected.</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything is more in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait until we get home, Pidge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPidge?\u201d Griffin said.</p><p>Travis sent him a death glare. \u201cShut up,\u201d he warned, looking back at me. \u201cThis\u2019ll be two hundred bucks cheaper back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wait, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Griffin shrugged. \u201cThen maybe you should wait.\u201d</p><p>I glared at Travis and Griffin. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting. I\u2019m doing this.\u201d I pulled out my wallet and shoved three bills at Griffin. \u201cSo you take my money\u201d\u2014I frowned at Travis\u2014\u201cand you hush. It\u2019s my money, my body, and this is what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>Travis seemed to weigh what he was about to say. \u201cBut . . . it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cMe? Or you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Griffin took my money and then disappeared. Travis paced the floor like a nervous expectant father. He peeked down the hall, and then paced some more. It was as cute as it was annoying. At one point he begged me not to do it, and then became impressed and touched that I was so hell-bent on going through with it.</p><p>\u201cPull down your jeans,\u201d Griffin said, getting his equipment ready.</p><p>Travis shot a piercing look at the short, muscular man from under his brow, but Griffin was too busy to notice Travis\u2019s most frightening expression.</p><p>I sat on the chair, and Griffin pushed buttons. As the chair reclined, Travis sat on a stool on the other side of me. He was fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cTrav,\u201d I said in a soft voice. \u201cSit down.\u201d I held out my hand and he took it, also taking a seat. He kissed my fingers, and offered a sweet but nervous smile.</p><p>Just when I thought he couldn\u2019t take the waiting anymore, my cell phone buzzed in my purse.</p><p>Oh, God. What if it was a text message from Trent? Travis was already digging for it, grateful for the distraction.</p><p>\u201cLeave it, Trav.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the display and frowned. My breath caught. He held out the phone for me to take. \u201cIt\u2019s Mare.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed it from him and would\u2019ve felt relief if it weren\u2019t for the cold cotton swab running over my hip bone. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby?\u201d America said. \u201cWhere are you? Shepley and I just got home. The car is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, my voice an octave higher. I hadn\u2019t planned on telling her yet. I wasn\u2019t sure how to break the news, but I was sure she was going to hate me. At least for a little while.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re . . . in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>America laughed. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally serious.\u201d</p><p>America grew quiet, and then her voice was so loud, I flinched. \u201cWHY are you in Vegas? It\u2019s not like you had a good time when you were there last!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravis and I decided to . . . we kind of got married, Mare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! This isn\u2019t funny, Abby! You better be fucking joking!\u201d</p><p>Griffin placed the transfer onto my skin and pressed. Travis looked like he wanted to kill him for touching me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re silly,\u201d I said, but when the tattoo machine began to hum my entire body tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d America said, steaming.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the tattoo parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Travis getting branded with your real name this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly . . .\u201d</p><p>Travis was sweating. \u201cBaby . . .\u201d he said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d I said, focusing on spots on the ceiling. I jumped when Griffin\u2019s fingertip\u2019s touched my skin, but I tried not to tense.</p><p>\u201cPigeon,\u201d Travis said, his voice tinged with desperation.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, shaking my head dismissively. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d I held the phone away from my ear, wincing from both the pain, and the inevitable lecture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Abby Abernathy!\u201d America cried. \u201cKill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s Abby Maddox, now,\u201d I said, smiling at Travis.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d she whined. \u201cI was supposed to be your maid of honor! I was supposed to go dress shopping with you and throw a bachelorette party and hold your bouquet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, watching Travis\u2019s smile fade as I winced again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, you know,\u201d he said, his eyebrow pulling together.</p><p>I squeezed his fingers. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that already!\u201d America snapped.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re talking to me,\u201d she fumed. \u201cYou are soooo talking to me. You are never going to hear the end of this, do you hear me? I will never, ever forgive you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou! You\u2019re a . . . ! You\u2019re just plain mean, Abby! You\u2019re a horrible best friend!\u201d</p><p>I laughed, causing Griffin to pull back. He breathed through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d America snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat was Griffin,\u201d I answered matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cIs she done?\u201d he asked Travis, annoyed.</p><p>Travis nodded once. \u201cKeep it up.\u201d</p><p>Griffin just smiled, and continued. My whole body tensed again.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Griffin? Let me guess: you invited a total stranger to your wedding and not your best friend?\u201d</p><p>I cringed, from both her shrill voice and the needle stabbing into my skin. \u201cNo. He didn\u2019t go to the wedding,\u201d I said, sucking in a breath of air.</p><p>Travis sighed and shifted nervously in his chair, squeezing my hand. He looked miserable. I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be squeezing your hand, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, his voice thick with distress. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can take this.\u201d He opened his hand a bit and looked to Griffin.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, would ya?\u201d</p><p>Griffin shook his head. \u201cCovered in tats and can\u2019t take your girlfriend getting a simple script. I\u2019ll be finished in a minute, mate.\u201d</p><p>Travis\u2019s expression turned severe. \u201cWife. She\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>America gasped, the sound as high-pitched as her tone. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a tattoo? What is going on with you, Abby? Did you breathe toxic fumes in that fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravis has my name on his wrist,\u201d I said, looking down at the smeared, black mess on my stomach. Griffin pressed the tip of the needle against my skin, and I clenched my teeth together. \u201cWe\u2019re married,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cI wanted something, too.\u201d</p><p>Travis shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t start with me.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth turned up, and he gazed at me with the sweetest adoration I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>America laughed, sounding a bit insane. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone crazy.\u201d She should talk. \u201cI\u2019m committing you to the asylum when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that crazy. We love each other. We have been practically living together on and off all year.\u201d Okay, not quite all year . . . not that it matters now. Not enough to mention it and give America more ammunition.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re nineteen, you idiot! Because you ran off and didn\u2019t tell anyone, and because I\u2019m not there!\u201d she cried.</p><p>For one second, guilt and second thoughts crept in. For one second, I let the tiniest bit of panic that I\u2019d just made a huge mistake simmer to the surface, but the moment I looked up at Travis and saw the incredible amount of love in his eyes, it all went away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mare, I have to go. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to see you tomorrow! I don\u2019t think I want to see Travis ever again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Mare. I know you want to see my ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your tat,\u201d she said, a smile in her voice.</p><p>I handed the phone to Travis. Griffin ran his thousand tiny knives of pain and anguish across my angry skin again. Travis shoved my phone in his pocket, gripping my hand with both of his, leaning down to touch his forehead to mine.</p><p>Not knowing what to expect helped, but the pain was a slow burn. As Griffin filled in the thicker parts of the letters I winced, and every time he pulled away to wipe the excess ink away with a cloth, I relaxed.</p><p>After a few more complaints from Travis, Griffin made us jump with a loud proclamation. \u201cDONE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d I said, letting my head fall back against the chair.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Travis cried, and then sighed in relief. He patted my hand, smiling.</p><p>I looked down, admiring the beautiful black lines hiding under the smeared black mess.</p><p>Mrs. Maddox</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, rising up on my elbows.</p><p>Travis\u2019s frown instantly turned into a triumphant smile. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Griffin shook his head. \u201cIf I had a dollar for every inked-up new husband who brought his wife in here and took it worse than she did\u2014well, I wouldn\u2019t have to tat anyone ever again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Travis\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cJust give her the postcare instructions, smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a printout of instructions and some A and D ointment at the counter,\u201d Griffin said, amused by Travis.</p><p>My stare kept returning to the elegant script on my skin. We were married. I was a Maddox, just like all of those wonderful men I had grown to love. I had a family, albeit full of angry, crazy, lovable men, but they were mine. I belonged to them, as they belonged to me.</p><p>Travis held out his hand, peering down at his ring finger. \u201cWe did it, baby. I still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve it.\u201d I beamed.</p><p>I reached out to Travis, pointed to his pocket, and then turned my hand over, opening my palm. He handed me my phone, and I pulled up the camera to snap a picture of my fresh ink. Travis helped me from the chair, careful to avoid my right side. I was sensitive to every movement that caused my jeans to rub against my raw skin.</p><p>After a short stop at the front counter, Travis let go of me long enough to push the door open for me, and then we walked outside to a waiting cab. My cell phone rang again. America.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to lay on the guilt trip thick, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Travis said, watching me silence my phone. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to endure another tongue-lashing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll pout for twenty-four hours after she sees the pictures\u2014then she\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure about that, Mrs. Maddox?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cAre you ever going to stop calling me that? You\u2019ve said it a hundred times since we left the chapel.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he held the cab door open for me. \u201cI\u2019ll quit calling you that when it sinks in that this is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s real all right. I have wedding night memories to prove it.\u201d I slid to the middle and then watched as he slid in next to me.</p><p>He leaned against me, running his nose up the sensitive skin of my neck until he reached my ear. \u201cWe sure do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p> <p>The Road Home</p><p>Travis</p><p>Abby watched Las Vegas pass by her window. Just the sight of her made me want to touch her, and now that she was my wife, that feeling was amplified. But I was trying very hard not to make her regret her decision. Playing it cool used to be my superpower. Now I was dangerously close to being Shepley.</p><p>Unable to stop myself, I slid my hand over and barely touched her pinky finger. \u201cI saw pictures of my parents\u2019 wedding. I thought Mom was the most beautiful bride I\u2019d ever see. Then I saw you at the chapel, and I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at our fingers touching, intertwined her fingers in mine, and then looked up at me. \u201cWhen you say things like that, Travis, it makes me fall in love with you all over again.\u201d She nuzzled up against me, and then kissed my cheek. \u201cI wish I could have known her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I paused, wondering if I should say the thought that was in my head. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d</p><p>Abby shook her head, leaning into my arms. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t all that great before we moved to Wichita. After we got there, her depression got worse. She just checked out. If I hadn\u2019t met America, I would have been alone.\u201d</p><p>She was already in my arms, but I wanted to hug my wife\u2019s sixteen-year-old self, too. And her childhood self, for that matter. There was so much that had happened to her that I couldn\u2019t protect her from.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I know it\u2019s not true, but Mick told me so many times that I ruined him. Both of them. I have this irrational fear that I\u2019ll do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigeon,\u201d I scolded, kissing her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird though, right? That when I started playing, his luck went south. He said I took his luck. Like I had that power over him. It made for some seriously conflicting emotions for a teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>The hurt in her eyes caused a familiar fire to come over me, but I quickly doused the flames with a deep breath. I wasn\u2019t sure if seeing Abby hurt would ever make me feel anything less than a little crazy, but she didn\u2019t need a hotheaded boyfriend. She needed an understanding husband. \u201cIf he had any fucking sense, he would have made you his lucky charm instead of his enemy. It really is his loss, Pidge. You\u2019re the most amazing woman I know.\u201d</p><p>She picked at her nails. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want me to be his luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be my luck. I\u2019m feeling pretty fucking lucky right now.\u201d</p><p>She playfully elbowed me in the ribs. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not a single doubt that we will. You don\u2019t know it yet, but you just saved me.\u201d</p><p>Something sparked in Abby\u2019s eyes, and she pressed her cheek against my shoulder. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>Abby</p><p>Travis hugged me to his side, letting go just long enough for us to move forward. We weren\u2019t the only overly affectionate couple waiting in line at the check-in counter. It was the end of spring break, and the airport was packed.</p><p>Once we got our boarding passes, we made our way slowly through security. When we finally reached the front of the line, Travis kept setting off the detector, so the TSA agent made him take off his ring.</p><p>Travis grudgingly complied, but once we passed through security and sat on a nearby bench to put on our shoes, Travis grumbled a few inaudible swear words, and then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. It\u2019s back on your finger,\u201d I said, giggling at his overreaction.</p><p>Travis didn\u2019t speak, only kissed my forehead before we left security for our gate. The other spring breakers appeared just as exhausted and happy as we were. And I spotted other arriving couples holding hands who looked just as nervous and excited as Travis and I were when we arrived in Vegas.</p><p>I grazed Travis\u2019s fingertips with mine.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>His response caught me off guard. It was heavy, and full of stress. The closer we got to the gate, the slower he walked. I worried about the reaction we\u2019d face at home, too, but I was more worried about the investigation. Maybe he was thinking the same thing and didn\u2019t want to talk to me about it.</p><p>At Gate Eleven, Travis sat next to me, keeping his hand in mine. His knee was bouncing, and he kept touching and tugging at his lips with his free hand. His three-day scruff twitched every time he moved his mouth. He was either freaking out on the inside, or he\u2019d drunk a pot of coffee without me knowing.</p><p>\u201cPigeon?\u201d he said finally.</p><p>Oh thank God. He\u2019s going to talk to me about it.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He thought about what he might say, and then sighed again. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, I wanted to fix it. But if he wasn\u2019t thinking about the investigation or facing the aftermath of the fire, I didn\u2019t want to bring it up. Not long after we took our seat, first class was being called to board. Travis and I stood with everyone else to get in line for economy.</p><p>Travis shifted from one foot to the other, rubbing the back of his neck and squeezing my hand. He so obviously wanted to tell me something. It was eating at him, and I didn\u2019t know what else to do but squeeze his hand back.</p><p>When our boarding group began to form a line, Travis hesitated. \u201cI can\u2019t shake this feeling,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Like a bad feeling?\u201d I said, suddenly very nervous. I didn\u2019t know if he meant the plane, or Vegas, or going home. Everything that could go wrong between our next step and our arrival back on campus flashed through my mind.</p><p>\u201cI have this crazy feeling that once we get home, I\u2019m going to wake up. Like none of this was real.\u201d Concern shone in his eyes, making them glassy.</p><p>Of all the things to worry about, and he was worried about losing me, just as I worried about losing him. It was then, in that moment, that I knew we\u2019d done the right thing. That yes, we were young, and yes, we were crazy, but we were as much in love as anyone. We were older than Romeo and Juliet. Older than my grandparents. It might not have been that long ago since we were children, but there were people with ten or more years of experience who still didn\u2019t have it together. We didn\u2019t have it all together, but we had each other, and that was more than enough.</p><p>When we returned, it was likely that everyone would be waiting for the breakdown, waiting for the deterioration of a couple married too young. Just imagining the stares and stories and whispers made my skin crawl. It might take a lifetime to prove to everyone that this works. We\u2019d made so many mistakes, and undoubtedly we would make thousands more, but the odds were in our favor. We\u2019d proven them all wrong before.</p><p>After a tennis match of worries and reassurances, I finally wrapped my arms around my husband\u2019s neck, touching my lips ever so slightly to his. \u201cI\u2019d bet my firstborn. That\u2019s how sure I am.\u201d This was a wager I wouldn\u2019t lose.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be that sure,\u201d he said.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, my mouth pulling to the side. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Travis relaxed, taking his boarding pass from my fingers, and handing it to the attendant.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, scanning it and then handing it back. She did the same to mine, and just as we had little more than twenty-four hours before, we walked hand in hand down the Jetway.</p><p>\u201cAre you hinting at something?\u201d Travis asked. He stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . is that why you wanted to get married?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, shook my head, and pulled him along. \u201cGod, no. I think we\u2019ve taken a big enough step to last us a while.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cFair enough, Mrs. Maddox.\u201d He squeezed my hand, and we boarded the plane for home.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Anniversary</p><p>Abby</p><p>Water beaded on my skin, mixing with the sunscreen and magnifying the texture of my tanned stomach. The sun beat down on us, and everyone else on the beach, making the heat dance in waves on top of the sand between the patches of brightly colored beach towels.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d the waiter said, leaning down with two drinks. Sweat dripped off his dark skin, but he was smiling. \u201cCharging to the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I said, taking my frozen strawberry margarita and signing the check.</p><p>America took hers and stirred the ice with her tiny straw. \u201cThis. Is. Heaven.\u201d</p><p>We all deserved a little Heaven to recover from the last year. After attending dozens of funerals, and helping Travis deal with his guilt, we fielded more questions from investigators. The students who were at the fight kept Travis\u2019s name out of it when speaking with the authorities, but rumors spread, and it took a long time for Adam\u2019s arrest to be enough for the families.</p><p>It took a lot of convincing for Travis not to turn himself in. The only thing that seemed to hold him back was my begging for him not to leave me alone, and knowing Trent would be charged with misleading an investigation. The first six months of our marriage was far from easy, and we spent a lot of long nights arguing about what was the right thing to do. Maybe it was wrong for me to keep Travis from prison, but I didn\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t believe he was any more at fault than anyone who had chosen to be in that basement that night. I would never regret my decision, just like I would never regret looking straight into that detective\u2019s eyes and lying my ass off to save my husband. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, watching the water climb up the sand and then recede. \u201cWe have Travis to thank. He was at the gym with as many clients as he could fit around his classes six days a week from five in the morning to ten o\u2019clock at night. This was all him. It sure wasn\u2019t my tutoring money that got us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank him? When he promised me a real wedding, I didn\u2019t know he meant a year later!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica,\u201d I scolded, turning to her. \u201cCould you be more spoiled? We\u2019re on a beach, drinking frozen margaritas in St. Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it gave me some time to plan your bachelorette party and the renewal of your vows,\u201d she said, taking a sip.</p> <p>I smiled, turning to her. \u201cThank you. I mean it. And this is the best bachelorette party in the history of bachelorette parties.\u201d</p><p>Harmony walked over and sat down in the lounge chair on the other side of me, her pixie short chestnut hair glistened in the sun. She shook the salt water out of it, making it feather out. \u201cThe water is so warm!\u201d she said, pushing up her oversize sunglasses. \u201cThere is a guy over there teaching kids how to windsurf. He\u2019s stupid hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can talk him into being our stripper later?\u201d America said, straight-faced.</p><p>Kara frowned. \u201cAmerica, no. Travis would be livid. Abby isn\u2019t actually a bachelorette, remember?\u201d</p><p>America shrugged, letting her eyes close behind her sunglasses. Although Kara and I had grown very close since I moved out, she and America still weren\u2019t on the best of terms. Probably because both of them said exactly what they thought.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll blame it on Harmony,\u201d America said. \u201cTravis can\u2019t get mad at her. He\u2019s forever indebted to her for letting him into Morgan Hall that night you were fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I want to be on the wrong end of a Maddox rage,\u201d Harmony said, shuddering.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cYou know he hasn\u2019t lashed out in a long time. He\u2019s got a handle on his anger now.\u201d</p><p>Harmony and I had shared two classes that semester, and when I invited her to the apartment to study, Travis recognized her as the girl who\u2019d let him into our dorm. Like Travis, her brother was also a member of Sigma Tau fraternity, so she was one of the few pretty girls on campus that Travis hadn\u2019t slept with.</p><p>\u201cTravis and Shepley will be here tomorrow afternoon,\u201d America said. \u201cWe have to get our partying in tonight. You don\u2019t think Travis is sitting at home doing nothing, do you? We\u2019re going out and we\u2019re going to have a damn good time whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cJust no strippers. And not too late. This wedding will actually have an audience. I don\u2019t want to look hungover.\u201d</p> <p>Harmony lifted the flag next to her chair, and almost immediately a waiter came over.</p><p>\u201cHow may I help you, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pi\u00f1a colada, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, backing away.</p><p>\u201cThis place is swank,\u201d America said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why it took us a year to save up for this. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. Trav wanted you to have the best. I get it. And it was nice of Mom and Dad to pay my way. I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have been able to come otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I giggled.</p> <p>\u201cYou promised me I could be a bridesmaid and do everything you made me miss last year. I see them paying as a wedding present and an anniversary present to you, and a birthday present to me all rolled into one. If you ask me, they got off cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby, they love you like a daughter. Daddy is very excited about walking you down the aisle. Let them do this without ruining the spirit of it,\u201d America said.</p><p>I smiled. Mark and Pam treated me like family. After my father landed me in a dangerous situation last year, Mark decided that I needed a new father\u2014and nominated himself. If I needed help with tuition or books or a new vacuum cleaner, Mark and Pam showed up at my door. Helping me also gave them an excuse to visit America and me, and it was obvious that they enjoyed that the most.</p><p>Not only did I now have the unruly Maddox clan as family, but I had Mark and Pam as well. I\u2019d gone from belonging to no one, to being a part of two amazing families that were incredibly important to me. At first, it made me feel anxious. I\u2019d never had so much to lose before. But over time, I realized that my new family wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and I learned how much good could come from misfortune.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019ll try to just accept this graciously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Harmony said, taking her drink from the tray. She signed the bill and began sipping the fruity concoction. \u201cI\u2019m just so excited to be going to this one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d America said, glaring in my direction. She had barely forgiven me for getting married without her. And, honestly, I hoped she\u2019d never try to pull the same move on me. But marriage was still a long way off for her.</p><p>She and Shepley were going to get their own apartment, but both decided that even though they were always around each other, America would stay in Morgan, and Shepley would move into Helms, a men\u2019s dorm. Mark and Pam were happier about this arrangement. They loved Shepley but were worried that the stress of real-world bills and jobs would affect Shepley\u2019s and America\u2019s focus on school. America was struggling, even at the dorms.</p><p>\u201cI just hope it goes smoothly. I hate the thought of standing in front of all those people staring at us.\u201d</p><p>America breathed out a laugh. \u201cElvis wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019m sure it will still be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe Elvis was at your wedding,\u201d Harmony said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cNot the dead one,\u201d Kara deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t invited this time,\u201d I said, watching the children taking lessons celebrate windsurfing on their own.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like? Getting married in Vegas?\u201d Harmony asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was . . .\u201d I said, thinking about the moment we left, almost exactly a year earlier. \u201cStressful and frightening. I was worried. I cried. It was pretty much perfect.\u201d</p><p>Harmony\u2019s expression was one of combined disgust and surprise. \u201cSounds like it.\u201d</p><p>Travis</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I said, not amused.</p><p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon!\u201d Shepley said, shaking with laughter. \u201cYou used to say I was the whipped one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you again.\u201d</p><p>Shepley turned off the ignition. He had parked the Charger on the far side of Cherry Papa\u2019s parking lot. Home of the fattest, dirtiest strippers in town. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to take one of them home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised Pidge. No strippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised you a bachelor party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, let\u2019s just go home. I\u2019m full, tired, and we\u2019ve got a plane to catch in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Shepley frowned. \u201cThe girls have been lying on a beach in St. Thomas all day, and now they\u2019re probably partying it up in a club.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe don\u2019t go to clubs without each other. She wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would if America planned it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again. \u201cNo, she fucking wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not going into the strip club. Either pick something else, or take me home.\u201d</p><p>Shepley sighed, and squinted his eyes. \u201cWhat about that?\u201d</p><p>I followed his line of sight to the next block over. \u201cA hotel? Shep, I love ya, man, but it\u2019s not a real bachelor party. I\u2019m married. And even if I weren\u2019t, I still wouldn\u2019t have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>Shepley shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a bar in there. It\u2019s not a club. Is that permitted on your long list of marriage rules?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI just respect my wife. And yes, douche bag, we can go in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together.</p><p>We walked across the street, and Shepley opened the door. It was pitch-black.</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d I began.</p><p>Suddenly the lights turned on. The twins, Taylor and Tyler, threw confetti in my face, music began to blare, and then I saw the worst thing I\u2019d ever seen in my life: Trenton in a man thong, covered in about ten pounds of body glitter. He had on a cheap, yellow wig, and Cami was laughing her head off, cheering him on.</p><p>Shepley pushed me in the rest of the way. My dad was on one side of the room, standing next to Thomas. They were both shaking their heads. My uncle Jack was on the other side of Thomas, and then the rest of the room was filled with Sigma Tau brothers and football players.</p><p>\u201cI said no strippers,\u201d I said, watching dumbfounded as Trenton danced around the room to Britney Spears.</p><p>Shepley burst into laughter. \u201cI know, brother, but looks like the stripping happened before we got here.\u201d</p><p>It was a train wreck. My face screwed into disgust as I watched Trenton bump and grind his way across the room\u2014even though I didn\u2019t want to. Everyone in the room was cheering him on. Cardboard cutouts of tits were hanging from the ceiling, and there was even a booby cake on a table next to my dad. I\u2019d been to several bachelor parties before, and this one had to win some sort of a freak prize.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Trenton said, breathless and sweaty. He pulled a few yellow strands of fake hair from his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose a bet?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did.\u201d</p><p>Taylor and Tyler were across the room, slapping their knees and laughing so hard they could barely breathe.</p><p>I slapped Trenton\u2019s ass. \u201cYou look hot, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. The music started and he shook his hips at me. I pushed him away, and, undeterred, he danced across the room to entertain the crowd.</p><p>I looked at Shepley. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to watch you explain this to Abby.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s your wife. You do it.\u201d</p><p>For the next four hours, we drank, and talked, and watched Trenton make a complete ass out of himself. My dad, as expected, cut out early. He, along with my other brothers, had a plane to catch. We were all flying to St. Thomas in the morning for the renewal of my vows.</p><p>For the last year, Abby tutored, and I did some personal training at the local gym. We\u2019d managed to save a little after school costs, rent, and the car payment to fly to St. Thomas and stay a few days in a nice hotel. We had plenty of things the money could have gone to, but America kept talking about it and wouldn\u2019t let us drop the idea. Then when America\u2019s parents presented us with the wedding gift/America\u2019s birthday present/anniversary gift, we tried to say no, but America was insistent.</p><p>\u201cAll right, boys. I\u2019m going to be hurtin\u2019 in the morning if I don\u2019t call it a night.\u201d</p><p>Everyone groaned and taunted me with words like whipped and pussy, but the truth was they were all used to the new, tamer Travis Maddox. I hadn\u2019t put my fist to someone\u2019s face in almost a year.</p><p>I yawned, and Shepley punched me in the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We drove in silence. I wasn\u2019t sure what Shepley was thinking about, but I couldn\u2019t fucking wait to see my wife. She\u2019d left the day before, and that was the first time we\u2019d been apart since we\u2019d been married. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shepley pulled up to the apartment and shut off the car. \u201cFront door service, loser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it. You miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe apartment? Yeah, a little. But I miss you fighting and us making shit tons of money more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I do sometimes, too. See you in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPick you up right back here at six thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Shepley drove away while I slowly climbed the steps, searching for the apartment key. I hated coming home when Abby wasn\u2019t here. There was nothing worse after we met, and it was the same now. Maybe even more miserable because Shepley and America weren\u2019t even there to annoy me.</p><p>I pushed in the key and opened the door, locking it behind me and tossing my wallet onto the breakfast bar. I had already taken Toto to the pet hotel to be boarded while we were gone. It was too fucking quiet. I sighed. The apartment had changed a lot in the last year. The posters and bar signs had come down, and pictures of us and paintings went up. It was no longer a bachelor pad, but it was a good trade.</p><p>I went into my bedroom, stripped down to my Calvin Klein boxer briefs, and climbed into the bed, burying myself under the blue and green floral comforter\u2014something else that would have never seen the inside of this apartment had Abby not had a hand in it. I pulled her pillow over and rested my head on it. It smelled like her.</p> <p>The clock read 2:00 AM. I would be with her in twelve hours.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN FOURTEEN</p><p>Bachelorette</p><p>Abby</p><p>Those seated on the far edge of the restaurant began to scream, nearly pushing over tables and children to get away. Wineglasses broke and silverware clanged on the floor. A pineapple-shaped hurricane was knocked over, rolled off a table, and broke. America rolled her eyes at the twenty or so people gathered a few tables over. \u201cChrist on the cross, people! It\u2019s just a little rain!\u201d</p><p>The waitstaff and hostesses scrambled to release the rolled-up walls of the outdoor restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you were grumbling because we didn\u2019t have an ocean view,\u201d Harmony teased.</p><p>\u201cYeah, those snobby bitches aren\u2019t smirking now, are they?\u201d America said, nodded and smiling to the six-pack of blondes now huddling and wet.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Mare. You\u2019ve had one too many glasses of wine,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on vacation, and it\u2019s a bachelorette party. I\u2019m supposed to be drunk.\u201d</p><p>I patted her hand. \u201cThat would be fine if you weren\u2019t a mean drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, whore, I am not a mean drunk.\u201d I glared at her, and she winked at me and smiled. \u201cJust kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Harmony let her fork fall to her plate. \u201cI\u2019m stuffed. Now what?\u201d</p><p>America pulled a small three-ring binder from her purse with a devious grin. It had small, foam letters glued to the front that read TRAVIS &amp; ABBY and our wedding date. \u201cNow we play a game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of game?\u201d I asked, wary.</p><p>She opened the binder. \u201cSince Cami couldn\u2019t be here until tomorrow, she made you this,\u201d she said, turning the front over to read the words painted on the front. \u201cThe What Would Your Husband Say? Game. I\u2019ve heard about it. Super fun, although typically it\u2019s about your future husband,\u201d she said, shifting excitedly in her seat. \u201cSo . . . Cami asked Travis these questions last week, and sent the book with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrieked. \u201cWhat kind of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting ready to find out,\u201d she said, waving the waiter over. He brought a full tray of brightly colored Jell-O shots.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf you get them wrong, you drink. If you get them right, we drink. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, glancing at Kara and Harmony.</p><p>America cleared her throat, holding the binder in front of her. \u201cWhen did Travis know you were the one?\u201d</p><p>I thought for a minute. \u201cThat first poker night at his dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Errrr! America made a horrendous noise with her throat. \u201cWhen he realized he wasn\u2019t good enough for you, which was the moment he saw you. Drink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw!\u201d Harmony said, holding her hand to her chest.</p><p>I picked up a small plastic cup and squeezed its contents into my mouth. Yum. I wasn\u2019t going to mind losing at all.</p><p>\u201cNext question!\u201d America said. \u201cWhat is his favorite thing about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cooking.\u201d</p><p>Errrrr! America made the noise again. \u201cDrink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck at this game,\u201d Kara said, clearly amused.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m doing it on purpose? These are good!\u201d I said, popping another shot into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cTravis\u2019s answer? Your laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of endearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is his favorite part of your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing, ding, ding! Correct!\u201d</p><p>Harmony and Kara clapped, I bowed my head. \u201cThank you, thank you. Now drink, bitches.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed, and popped their shots.</p><p>America turned a page and read the next question. \u201cWhen does Travis want to have kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I blew through my lips. \u201cIn seven . . . eight years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year after graduation.\u201d</p><p>Kara and Harmony made the same face, their mouths forming \u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink,\u201d I said. \u201cBut he and I will have to talk about that one some more.\u201d</p><p>America shook her head. \u201cThis is a prewedding game, Abby. You should be much better at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. Continue.\u201d</p><p>Kara pointed. \u201cTechnically she can\u2019t shut up and continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d American and I said in unison.</p><p>\u201cNext question!\u201d America said. \u201cWhat do you think Travis\u2019s favorite moment of your relationship was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night he won the bet and I moved in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect again!\u201d America said.</p><p>\u201cThis is so sweet. I can\u2019t take it,\u201d Harmony said.</p><p>\u201cDrink! Next question,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat is one thing Travis said he\u2019ll never forget that you\u2019ve said to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Kara leaned in. \u201cJust guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I said I loved him?\u201d</p><p>America narrowed her eyes, thinking. \u201cTechnically, you\u2019re wrong. He said it was the time you told Parker you loved Travis!\u201d America burst into laughter, and so did the rest of us. \u201cDrink!\u201d</p><p>America turned another page. \u201cWhat is the one item Travis can\u2019t live without?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was your first date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically it was the Pizza Shack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect!\u201d America said again.</p><p>\u201cAsk her something more difficult, or we\u2019re going to get hammered,\u201d Kara said, throwing back another shot.</p><p>\u201cHmmm . . .\u201d America said, thumbing through the pages. \u201cOh, here we go. What do you think Abby\u2019s favorite thing about you is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of question is that?\u201d I asked. They watched me expectantly. \u201cUm . . . my favorite thing about him is the way he always touches me when we sit together, but I bet he said his tats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d America said. \u201cCorrect!\u201d They drank, and I clapped to celebrate my small victory.</p><p>\u201cOne more,\u201d America said. \u201cWhat does Travis think your favorite present from him is?\u201d</p><p>I paused for a few seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s easy. The scrapbook he got me for Valentine\u2019s Day this year. Now, drink!\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed, and even though it was their turn, I shared the last shot with them.</p><p>Harmony wiped her mouth with a napkin, and helped me to collect the empty cups and place them on the tray. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan now, Mare?\u201d</p><p>America fidgeted, clearly excited about what she was about to say. \u201cWe hit the clubs, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo way. We talked about this.\u201d</p><p>America stuck out her lip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m here to renew my vows, not to get a divorce. Think of something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he trust you?\u201d America said, her voice very closely resembling a whine.</p><p>\u201cIf I really wanted to go, I would go. I just respect my husband, and I would rather get along than sit in a smoky club with lights that give me a headache. It would just make him wonder what went on, and I\u2019d rather not go there. It\u2019s worked so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect Shepley. I still go to clubs without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I haven\u2019t wanted to, yet. Tonight, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>America\u2019s brows pulled together. \u201cFine. Plan B. Poker night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>Harmony\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI saw a flyer for movie night tonight at Honeymoon Beach! They bring a screen right on the water.\u201d</p><p>America made a face. \u201cBoring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think it sounds fun. When does it start?\u201d</p><p>Harmony checked her watch, and then her face fell, deflated. \u201cIn fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make it!\u201d I said, grabbing my purse. \u201cCheck please!\u201d</p><p>Travis</p><p>\u201cCalm your tits, dude,\u201d Shepley said. He looked down at my fingers nervously beating against the metal armrest. We had landed safely and taxied in, but for whatever reason they weren\u2019t ready to let us off yet. Everyone was quietly waiting for that one, tiny ding that meant freedom. Something about the ding of the fasten seat belt light that made everyone jump up and scramble to get their carry-on luggage and stand in line. I actually had a reason to be in a hurry, though, so the wait was particularly irritating.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is taking so long?\u201d I said, maybe a little too loud. A woman in front of us with a grade-school-age kid turned slowly to give me a look. \u201cSorry.\u201d She faced forward in a huff.</p><p>I looked down at my watch. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019re not,\u201d Shepley said in his typical smooth and calming voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>I stretched to the side, looking down the aisle, as if that would help. \u201cThe flight attendants haven\u2019t moved. Wait, one is on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>I sat upright and sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re not. You just miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. I knew that I looked pitiful and I wasn\u2019t even going to attempt to hide it. This was the first time Abby and I had spent a night apart since before we were married, and it was miserable. Even after a year, I still looked forward to when she\u2019d wake up in the morning. I even missed her when I slept.</p><p>Shepley shook his head in disapproval. \u201cRemember when you used to give me so much shit for acting like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t love them the way I love her.\u201d</p><p>Shepley smiled. \u201cYou really happy, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I loved her back then, I love her even more, now. Like the way Dad used to talk about Mom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shepley smiled and then opened his mouth to respond, but the fasten seat belt light dinged, sending everyone into a flurry of standing up, reaching up, and getting situated in the aisle.</p><p>The mother in front of me smiled. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds like you have it figured out more than most people.\u201d</p><p>The line began to move. \u201cNot really. We just had a lot of hard lessons early on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d she said, guiding her son down the aisle.</p> <p>I laughed once, thinking about all the fuckups and letdowns, but she was right. If I had to do it all over again, I\u2019d rather endure the pain in the beginning than have had it easy and then have it all go to shit later on.</p><p>Shepley and I rushed to baggage claim, got our luggage, and then hurried outside to catch a cab. I was surprised to see a man in a black suit holding a dry erase board with MADDOX PARTY scribbled in red marker.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMistah Maddox?\u201d he said, smiling wide.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Mistah Gumbs. Right this way.\u201d He took my larger bag and led us outside to a black Cadillac Escalade. \u201cYou\u2019re staying at the Ritz-Carlton, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shepley said.</p><p>We loaded the trunk with the rest of the bags, and then sat in the middle row of seats.</p><p>\u201cScore,\u201d Shepley said, looking around.</p><p>The driver took off, buzzing up and down hills, and around curves, all on the wrong side of the road. It was confusing, because the wheel was on the same side as ours.</p><p>\u201cGlad we didn\u2019t rent a car,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, the majority of accidents here are caused by tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d Shepley said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard. Just remember you are closest to the curb,\u201d he said, karate-chopping the air with his left hand.</p><p>He continued giving us a minitour, pointing out different things along the way. The palm trees made me feel enough out of our element, but the cars parked on the left side of the road were really messing with my head. Large hills seemed to touch the sky, peppered with little white specks\u2014what I assumed were hillside houses.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Havensight Mall, there,\u201d Mr. Gumbs said. \u201cWhere all the cruise ships dock, see?\u201d</p><p>I saw the big ships, but I couldn\u2019t stop staring at the water. I\u2019d never seen water such a pure blue before. I guess that\u2019s why they call it Caribbean blue. It was fucking unbelievable. \u201cHow close are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGettin\u2019 there,\u201d Mr. Gumbs said with a happy grin.</p><p>Right on cue, the Cadillac slowed to a stop to wait for oncoming traffic, and then we pulled into a long drive. He slowed once more for a security booth, we were waved in, and then we continued on another long drive to the entrance of the hotel.</p> <p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Shepley said. He tipped the driver, and then pulled out his cell phone, quickly tapping on the screen. His phone made a kiss noise\u2014must have been America. He read the message and then nodded. \u201cLooks like you and I go to Mare\u2019s room, and they\u2019re getting ready in yours.\u201d</p><p>I made a face. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they don\u2019t want you to see Abby, yet.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and smiled. \u201cShe was that way last time.\u201d</p><p>A hotel employee showed us to a golf cart, and then he drove us to our building. We followed him to the correct room, and then we walked inside. It was very . . . tropical, fancy Ritz-Carlton tropical.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll do!\u201d Shepley said, all smiles.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThe ceremony is in two hours. I have to wait two hours?\u201d</p><p>Shepley held up a finger, tapped on his phone, and then looked up. \u201cNope. You can see her when she\u2019s ready. Per Abby. Apparently she misses you, too.\u201d</p><p>A wide grin spread across my face. I couldn\u2019t help it. Abby had that effect on me, eighteen months ago, a year ago, now, and for the rest of my life. I pulled out my cell phone.</p><p>Love you, baby.</p><p>OMG! You\u2019re here! Love u 2!</p><p>See u soon.</p><p>You bet ur ass.</p><p>I laughed out loud. I\u2019d said before that Abby was my everything. For the last 365 days straight, she\u2019d proved that to be true.</p><p>Someone pounded on the door, and I walked over to open it.</p><p>Trent\u2019s face lit up. \u201cAsshat!\u201d</p><p>I laughed once, shook my head, and motioned for my brothers to come in. \u201cGet in here, you fuckin\u2019 heathens. I\u2019ve got a wife waiting, and a tux with my name on it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Happily Ever After</p><p>Travis</p><p>A year to the day after I stood at the end of an aisle in Vegas, I found myself waiting for Abby again, this time in a gazebo overlooking the rich blue waters surrounding St. Thomas. I pulled at my bow tie, pleased that I had been smart enough not to wear one last time, but I also didn\u2019t have to deal with America\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d last time.</p><p>White chairs with orange and purple ribbons tied around their backs sat empty on one side, the ocean sat on the other. White fabric lined the aisle Abby would walk down, and orange and purple flowers were pretty much everywhere I looked. They did a nice job. I still preferred our first wedding, but this looked more like what any girl would dream of.</p><p>And then, what any boy would dream of stepped out from behind a row of trees and bushes. Abby stood alone, empty-handed, a long, white veil streaming from her half-up, half-down hair, blowing in the warm Caribbean breeze. Her long, white dress was form fitting and a little shiny. Probably satin. I wasn\u2019t sure and I didn\u2019t care. All I could focus on was her.</p><p>I jumped the four steps that led up to the gazebo and jogged to my wife, meeting her at the back row of chairs.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! I\u2019ve missed you like hell!\u201d I said, wrapping her in my arms.</p><p>Abby\u2019s fingers pressed into my back. It was the best thing I\u2019d felt in three days, since I\u2019d hugged her good-bye.</p><p>Abby didn\u2019t speak, she just giggled nervously, but I could tell she was happy to see me, too. The last year had been so different from the first six months of our relationship. She had totally committed to me, and I had totally committed to being the man she deserved. It was better, and life was good. The first six months, I kept waiting for something bad to happen that would rip her away from me, but after that we settled into our new life.</p><p>\u201cYou are amazingly beautiful,\u201d I said after pulling back to get a better look.</p><p>Abby reached to touch my lapel. \u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself, Mr. Maddox.\u201d</p><p>After a few kisses, hugs, and stories about our bachelor/bachelorette parties (which seemed to be equally uneventful\u2014except for the whole Trent stripper thing), the guests began to trickle in.</p><p>\u201cGuess that means we should get in our places,\u201d Abby said. I couldn\u2019t hide my disappointment. I didn\u2019t want to be without her for another second. Abby touched my jaw and then rose up on her feet to kiss my cheek. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She walked off, disappearing behind the trees again.</p><p>I returned to the gazebo, and before long the chairs were all filled. We actually had an audience this time. Pam sat on the bride\u2019s side in the first row, with her sister and brother-in-law. A handful of my Sigma Tau brothers lined the back row, with my dad\u2019s old partner and his wife and kids, my boss Chuck and his girlfriend of the week, both sets of America\u2019s grandparents, and my Uncle Jack and Aunt Deana. My dad sat in the first row of the groom\u2019s side, keeping my brothers\u2019 dates company. Shepley stood as my best man, and my groomsmen, Thomas, Taylor, Tyler, and Trent, stood next to him.</p><p>We\u2019d all seen another year pass, we\u2019d all been through so much, in some cases lost so much, and yet come together as a family to celebrate something that had gone right for the Maddoxes. I smiled and nodded at the men standing with me. They were still the impenetrable fortress I remembered from my childhood.</p><p>My eyes focused on trees in the distance as I waited for my wife. Any second now she would step out and everyone could see what I saw a year before, and find themselves in awe, just like I was.</p><p>Abby</p><p>After a long embrace, Mark smiled down at me. \u201cYou are beautiful. I\u2019m so proud of you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for giving me away,\u201d I said, a little embarrassed. Thinking about everything he and Pam had done for me made hot tears pool in my eyes. I blinked them away before they had a chance to spill down my cheeks.</p><p>Mark pecked my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed to have you in our lives, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>The music began, prompting Mark to offer his arm. I took it, and we walked down a small, uneven sidewalk that was lined with thick, flowering trees. America was worried it would rain, but the sky was nearly clear, and sun was pouring down.</p><p>Mark guided me to the end of the trees, and then we rounded the corner, standing just behind Kara, Harmony, Cami, and America. All of them but America were dressed in purple, strapless satin minidresses. My best friend wore orange. They were all absolutely beautiful.</p><p>Kara offered a small smile. \u201cI guess the beautiful disaster turned into a beautiful wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiracles do happen,\u201d I said, remembering the conversation she and I had what seemed like a lifetime ago.</p><p>Kara laughed once, nodded, and then gripped her small bouquet in both hands. She rounded the corner, disappearing behind the trees. Soon after Harmony, and then Cami, followed.</p><p>America turned, hooking her arm around my neck. \u201cI love you!\u201d she said with a squeeze.</p><p>Mark tightened his grip, and I did the same with my bouquet.</p><p>\u201cHere we go, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>We rounded the corner, and the pastor motioned for everyone to stand. I saw the faces of my friends and new family, but it wasn\u2019t until I saw the wet cheeks of Jim Maddox that my breath caught. I struggled to keep it together.</p><p>Travis reached out for me. Mark held his hands over ours. I felt so safe in that moment, held by two of the best men I knew.</p><p>\u201cWho gives this woman away?\u201d the pastor asked.</p><p>\u201cHer mother and I.\u201d The words stunned me. Mark had been practicing Pam and I all week. After hearing that, there was no holding back my tears as they welled up and spilled over.</p><p>Mark kissed my cheek, walked away, and I stood there with my husband. It was the first time I\u2019d seen him in a tux. He was clean-shaven, and had recently gotten his hair cut. Travis Maddox was the kind of gorgeous every girl dreamed about, and he was my reality.</p><p>Travis tenderly wiped my cheeks, and then we stepped onto the platform of the gazebo, directly in front of the pastor.</p><p>\u201cWe are gathered here today to celebrate a renewal of vows . . .\u201d the pastor began. His voice melted into the sounds of the ocean breaking against the rocks in the background.</p><p>Travis leaned in, squeezing my hand as he whispered, \u201cHappy anniversary, Pidge.\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, as full of love and hope as they were the year before. \u201cOne down, forever to go,\u201d I whispered back. </p> </body></html>"]
