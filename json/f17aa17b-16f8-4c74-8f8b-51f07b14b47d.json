Don\u2019t kill him!\u201d Keira McDonough\u2019s scream, high and desperate, rang out across the crowded chamber.</p><p>Her cry cut through the noise as easily as the silver blade that had just sliced into his chest. The blade that had stopped right at Alerac O\u2019Neill\u2019s heart.</p><p>The men around him hesitated. No, these were not men. They were monsters. Vampires, hiding behind the guise of mere mortals. They wanted his blood. Both to drink it and to see it staining the stone floor beneath his feet as he died.</p> <p>Perhaps that dark wish was only fair, considering the fact that he wanted their blood, too. And I\u2019ll have it. Alerac wouldn\u2019t meet death without taking those bastards with him.</p><p>But then she was there. Keira blond hair whirled around her pale face as she shoved her way through the throng of vampires. They growled and flashed their fangs at her, but Keira didn\u2019t stop. She didn\u2019t fear the vampires gathered there.</p><p>She should.</p><p>\u201cLorcan...\u201d She stared\u2014her eyes wide and so damn blue that it almost hurt to look into them\u2014at the man who\u2019d just thrust that silver knife into Alerac\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please, I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><p>Keira should never beg. Especially not for his life.</p> <p>Among her kind, she was a princess. A treasure. One that he\u2019d tried to take.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Alerac gritted out the word even as smoke rose from his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you beg him for anything.\u201d The silver blade burned, destroyed\u2014that was its purpose. It was a weapon meant to be used against his kind.</p><p>Another monster, hiding under the guise of a man.</p><p>Only his beast was far more vicious than most could imagine.</p><p>Keira\u2019s lips trembled, and she shot a quick glance his way before focusing on Lorcan once more. \u201cI\u2019ll take his punishment.\u201d</p><p>The great room became dead silent. Every eye turned to Keira. Every eye, every ear, every fang.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alerac shoved the word out. \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>And he was shoved down to his knees. The knife was jerked from his chest and instead put to his throat.</p><p>Lorcan turned his head and pinned Keira in his sights. \u201cHis punishment is death. He came here, he used you, in order to get into our midst. To attack us from within.\u201d Lorcan Teague\u2019s voice cracked with fury.</p><p>The other vamps backed up in the face of his rage because Lorcan was the ruler. The leader of the vamp clan. A clan that Alerac had sworn to destroy.</p><p>He wanted these vamps to be nothing more than ash in the wind.</p><p>Except for her. Keira isn\u2019t like the others.</p><p>He\u2019d learned that lesson too late.</p><p>The silver blade burned and cut along Alerac\u2019s throat. He wanted to tell Keira that Lorcan\u2019s words were a lie, that he hadn\u2019t been using her.</p> <p>Only Lorcan wasn\u2019t lying. Why bother with a lie when the truth was just as brutal?</p><p>Alerac\u2019s plan had been simple enough, back in the beginning. Keira McDonough was the weak link in the vampire clan. The human who hadn\u2019t turned, not completely. She\u2019d been born to the blood, but her transformation to full vampire hadn\u2019t occurred yet. He\u2019d watched her from afar, because that was the only way to watch her.</p><p>The vampire princess. Locked away in her tower. Precious to her clan, so very valuable because of what she represented.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>She\u2019d been locked away, but he\u2019d always been good at picking locks. Getting to her side had been easy enough.</p><p>So had seducing her.</p><p>Keira had been his instrument of revenge. He\u2019d hoped to use her to get killing close to Lorcan.</p><p>Only now, Lorcan was the one with the knife.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ve started turning.\u201d Her voice was hushed. The room was filled\u2014easily\u2014with at least twenty vampires. All men. Female blood born vampires were incredibly rare.</p><p>That was why they held such value.</p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Lorcan demanded.</p><p>\u201cY-yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan yanked the knife away from Alerac\u2019s throat and grabbed Keira. The vampire pulled her close, caught her chin in his hand, and tilted her face back so that he could stare into her eyes.</p><p>Alerac knew why Lorcan gazed so deeply into Keira\u2019s eyes. If Keira were truly turning, then gold should be spreading in her gaze.</p><p>The gold will be there. Alerac had already seen it for himself. His hands clenched as he pulled at the silver manacles that bound him. He no longer felt the burn on his wrists or ankles. Right then, rage was all he could feel. He wanted Lorcan\u2019s hands off Keira. He knew the vamp lusted for her\u2014but you won\u2019t have her. Not now. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cYou are turning,\u201d Lorcan said as he held Keira\u2019s chin. Then he cast a hard, suspicious stare at Alerac. \u201cHave you fed for the first time?\u201d His features\u2014frozen forever in a mask of youth that made him look as if he\u2019d barely passed his twenty-fifth year\u2014were hard with tension.</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d Her stark whisper. \u201cI\u2019ve fed.\u201d Her gaze darted to Alerac.</p><p>She took my blood. The blood of a werewolf.</p><p>First, she\u2019d given him her body. Trusted him as she had no other. He\u2019d seduced her slowly, day by day. Week by week.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her body. Deepened the connection between them.</p><p>Then she\u2019d bit him. His blood had been the first that she ever tasted.</p><p>In turn, Alerac had taken her blood and discovered a rush of power that he\u2019d never anticipated.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s jaw locked. He lunged toward Alerac once more.</p><p>Alerac smiled at the bastard.</p><p>Aye, my blood, in her.</p><p>\u201cHe used you, Keira!\u201d Lorcan snarled. Alerac\u2019s blood dripped from the knife gripped in Lorcan\u2019s left hand. \u201cAnd yet you would give your life for him? Why?\u201d His thundering voice echoed through the chamber.</p><p>The other vampires shifted nervously. When Lorcan was this enraged, people died. It was an understood fact.</p><p>Everyone there knew the pattern. Lorcan\u2019s love of blood and death was too well documented.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Another bellow from Lorcan when Keira didn\u2019t answer quickly enough.</p><p>Alerac saw the faint movement of her throat as she swallowed. \u201cBecause I love him,\u201d Keira said softly, but with certainty.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s smile faded. Keira wasn\u2019t supposed to love him. He wasn\u2019t worthy of her love.</p><p>Now it was Lorcan who smiled. He shook his dark head. \u201cYou can\u2019t die for him, Keira. You have too much value to us.\u201d</p><p>That was right. Alerac eased out the breath that had frozen in his lungs. Keira couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t die. Lorcan could continue his torture tactics, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt Alerac for much longer. Alerac\u2019s pack was coming. They\u2019d be there before\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut you can take his punishment,\u201d Lorcan continued, all of the anger suddenly gone from his voice. Flat and cold, he said, \u201cAfter all, you were the one to bring him in to our clan. A dog, walking among gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no god,\u201d Alerac shouted at him. Lorcan was nothing, a blood drinker who lived off the fear he stirred. The werewolves were the truly powerful beings\u2014both man and beast. Power and savagery in one dangerous package. And they didn\u2019t have to feed off others in order to survive.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s dark eyes narrowed. \u201cOne hundred years. That\u2019s the penalty for treason in our clan. Imprisonment. Starvation. For one hundred years.\u201d</p><p>No, no, that wouldn\u2019t happen to Keira. His men were planning to attack the compound. They\u2019d save Keira long before she suffered even a single night\u2019s pain.</p><p>Keira eased closer to Alerac. Her skin seemed to become even paler as she gazed at him. They\u2019d sliced him, cutting into his body with that silver knife for hours, and they\u2019d kept him manacled with silver so that he wouldn\u2019t be able to transform into the body of his wolf.</p><p>No transformation meant no healing.</p><p>They thought they were making him weak.</p><p>They were wrong. He was the alpha of his pack. There was no weakness.</p><p>Except her.</p><p>Keira\u2019s hand lifted. Her palm brushed against his cheek.</p><p>He\u2019d had her under him, in bed, that very night. He\u2019d given in to his need one more time. Made a desperate mistake.</p><p>Lorcan had found them.</p><p>Now Lorcan thought to make Keira pay?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Alerac ordered her. The word was a growl from his beast.</p><p>Her hand dropped.</p><p>Her smile broke the heart that he shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cI won\u2019t let you die.\u201d Her chin lifted. Her bright stare cut toward Lorcan. \u201cI will take the punishment, but you have to promise me that Alerac lives.\u201d Her voice grew louder. All watched her with wide eyes. \u201cNo matter what else happens, he lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s lips were still twisted into a sly smile. \u201cBy the time you are free, he will be long dead.\u201d</p><p>Because werewolves weren\u2019t immortal, not like vampires. Not like their sworn enemies.</p><p>A battle that had raged for so long.</p><p>Blood. Death.</p><p>\u201cSwear it, Lorcan,\u201d Keira pushed, her voice even stronger now. \u201cVow it to me on the blood.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s gaze returned to Alerac. Smug vampire. \u201cI vow it,\u201d he agreed easily enough.</p><p>Keira\u2019s shoulders slumped. She glanced back at Alerac once more. Then she bent before him, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and bringing her lips close to his ear. \u201cI know you did not love me,\u201d she whispered, her mouth brushing against him. \u201cBut I loved you.\u201d Then she pulled back. Looked deep into his eyes.</p><p>The first time he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d thought she was a dream.</p><p>A beautiful, perfect dream\u2014a temptation.</p><p>A destruction.</p><p>Her lips pressed lightly against his.</p><p>\u201cTake her,\u201d Lorcan ordered, voice booming.</p><p>Other vampires rushed to obey.</p><p>Keira was hauled back.</p><p>He stared up at her, desperate. Alerac wanted to tell her that help was coming, it was just hours away. Hours? Or minutes? During the torture, he\u2019d lost track of time, and Alerac wasn\u2019t sure how long it would be before dawn arrived.</p><p>But if he told her about the others, then all of the vampires would be alerted to his plan. His men wouldn\u2019t have the element of surprise on their side. He had to protect his pack.</p><p>An alpha\u2019s job was always to protect the pack.</p><p>Shackles were put around Keira\u2019s wrists.</p><p>No.</p><p>He leapt to his feet with a roar, ignoring the silver and the vampires who tried to subdue him. The power of his beast beat within him. The sight of Keira, bound, enraged him. Not her. No one could hurt her. No one would hurt her.</p><p>The manacles broke from the walls. He lunged toward Lorcan.</p><p>But vampires could move fast, so very fast. Before Alerac could reach him, Lorcan\u2019s bloody knife was at Keira\u2019s delicate throat.</p><p>\u201cIf she loses her head, she will die easily enough.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s Irish brogue whispered through the words. A brogue that he picked up, and dropped, seemingly at will. Lorcan was centuries old. Some tales said that he\u2019d been born a Viking and had journeyed to Ireland long ago, bringing hell with him. \u201cDo you want her death on you?\u201d Lorcan asked as he studied Alerac. \u201cSeems so pointless, especially when we worked out a deal.\u201d</p><p>There was no fear in Keira\u2019s eyes. \u201cImprisonment won\u2019t kill me. It will hurt. I will suffer.\u201d She swallowed and pulled in a deep breath. \u201cBut I won\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>And you won\u2019t be imprisoned. My men will have you free by dawn.</p><p>\u201cAll of this...because I killed a few of your dogs?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s knife nicked Keira\u2019s throat. Her blood trickled down in a dark red line. \u201cThey should have known better than to tangle with me.\u201d</p><p>Vampires reached for Alerac. He threw out his chains, catching them across their faces. Snapping bones. Fighting. He couldn\u2019t attack Lorcan, not while he held that knife at Keira\u2019s throat, but he could go after the others. \u201cThey were my family!\u201d The rage came then, building, swelling within him. The vampires had taken away what he valued, now it was his turn to destroy them. To wipe out their stronghold. To end their blood reign.</p><p>Because of Keira, his men now knew how to get inside the vampire\u2019s keep. With the light of dawn, they\u2019d attack. The timing had been deliberate. Vampires were weakest during the day. The vampires would be weak, but the wolves would be at full strength. How long is it until dawn?</p><p>\u201cThey were family,\u201d Lorcan dismissed, a sneer twisting his face, \u201cand now they\u2019re rotting in the ground.\u201d</p><p>Keira tensed. Then she spun around, moving fast\u2014far faster than Lorcan had obviously anticipated. Vampire speed. Now that Keira was turning, she was coming into her vampire powers.</p><p>In a flash, she grabbed the knife from Lorcan, and she shoved it into his chest.</p><p>But silver wouldn\u2019t kill a vampire.</p><p>It would just make him hurt.</p><p>The other vampires swarmed around Alerac.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred years!\u201d Lorcan cried out. \u201cYou just attacked...your leader...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had my way,\u201d Keira said, as she stood before Lorcan, not backing down a bit, \u201cyou\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan yanked out the knife. Tossed it to the floor.</p><p>Eight vampires held down Alerac.</p><p>\u201cKeira?\u201d The voice, stunned, male, came from the open doorway.</p><p>Keira\u2019s head turned at the call.</p><p>No, not now!</p><p>But, with his incredibly poor timing, Keira\u2019s twin brother had just appeared. Ryan stood in the doorway, his hands fisted at his sides. His hair was as golden as his sister\u2019s. His eyes as blue.</p><p>\u201cKeira, what have you done?\u201d Betrayal was on Ryan\u2019s face. Rage.</p><p>The vampires had all turned on Keira. While she\u2014</p><p>She chose me.</p><p>His nails lengthened into claws as the beast pushed for freedom. The wolf within him was desperate to protect his mate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mate?</p><p>No, no, that couldn\u2019t be right. A werewolf would never mate with a vampire.</p><p>Fuck her, yes.</p> <p>Use her, yes.</p><p>Mate?</p><p>Keira turned back toward Alerac. \u201cI hope you...live a good life.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d traded two hundred years for his survival.</p><p>The beast howled inside of him.</p> <p>\u201cRyan...\u201d Lorcan ignored the blood that poured from his chest. \u201cYour sister confessed to conspiring with the wolves. She has even agreed to be punished in the wolf leader\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Ryan rushed toward her. \u201cKeira, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImprisonment. Starvation.\u201d Lorcan licked his lips. \u201cTwo hundred years.\u201d</p><p>Ryan blanched. \u201cSh-she won\u2019t survive! You know she won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe she shouldn\u2019t have spread her legs for the wolf, and then shoved a fuckin\u2019 knife in my heart!\u201d Jealousy and fury tore through Lorcan\u2019s words.</p><p>Alerac knew Lorcan had planned to wed Keira. He\u2019d locked her away because he\u2019d wanted her. Wanted the power that she represented.</p> <p>Ryan grabbed for Keira. Pulled her against him. \u201cKill the werewolf!\u201d Ryan ordered, voice thundering. \u201cJust do it\u2014now!\u201d</p><p>But Lorcan shook his head. \u201cI gave a blood vow. It\u2019s done. He lives, and so does she.\u201d</p><p>Ryan twisted Keira around in his arms.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s blood dropped onto the floor. The vamps would feed on him. He knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the scent of all that blood much longer.</p><p>He wanted them to feed on him. His blood was laced with a special tonic\u2014a poison just for them. He\u2019d known that he would be captured that night. He just hadn\u2019t counted on Lorcan finding him just as Alerac drove into Keira\u2019s delectable body.</p><p>That whole capture bit should have come after Keira had been told to flee from that place. But Alerac\u2019s lust for her had been his downfall. He\u2019d given in to his need once more.</p><p>And his perfect plan had gone to hell.</p><p>If Alerac had kept his hands off Keira hours before, then she would have escaped to safety.</p> <p>Instead, she had just sacrificed herself for him.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s breath came out in low, hard pants. Keira would be fine. The punishment would never be carried out. He\u2019d given orders to his men already\u2014Keira wasn\u2019t to be hurt. Just in case he hadn\u2019t been able to convince her to flee, he\u2019d made sure that his men knew their attack couldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cKeira, you can\u2019t do this! You can\u2019t!\u201d Ryan shook her. Her head snapped back.</p><p>Then she jerked away from him. \u201cThey aren\u2019t monsters.\u201d Her voice was low. Sad. \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes widened as he shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He rushed toward the vampire clan\u2019s leader. \u201cLorcan, please, don\u2019t do this! I\u2019ll do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Lorcan murmured.</p><p>Ryan nodded quickly.</p><p>Lorcan laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want from you. Nothing I can\u2019t take.\u201d</p><p>Another woman pushed through the crowd then. A pale woman with long, red hair and a twisting scar that wrapped around her neck. Jewels glittered on her fingers and power seemed to swirl in the air around her.</p><p>A witch.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s witch.</p><p>The same witch who\u2019d been at his side when Lorcan slaughtered nine members of Alerac\u2019s pack.</p><p>\u201cBut I can be merciful,\u201d Lorcan continued as the witch approached him. He reached for his witch\u2019s hand. \u201cShonna, my dear...\u201d</p><p>She only flinched a little bit when he touched her.</p><p>According to the whispers, she\u2019d tried to flee from Lorcan once. He\u2019d retaliated by nearly taking her head.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t attempted to leave him again.</p><p>\u201cWork up a spell,\u201d he ordered her softly as his gaze stayed on Keira. \u201cFreeze her body so that she does not need air to breathe. Keep her aware, of every single moment. Let her know that time is passing, let the hunger for blood consume her as she remains motionless in her prison.\u201d</p><p>Shonna nodded. \u201cIt will be done.\u201d</p><p>No, it fuckin\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Lorcan tapped his chin. \u201cAs I said, I am not without mercy.\u201d</p><p>Lying bastard.</p><p>\u201cMy vampiress must suffer during her imprisonment,\u201d Lorcan said. \u201cFor what is punishment without pain? But the instant she is free, then I want her to forget.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s gaze slid to Alerac. To the vampires who were fighting so desperately to hold him down.</p><p>Keira.</p><p>\u201cI want her to forget everything,\u201d Lorcan said as his shoulders squared. \u201cEverything.\u201d Then he glanced at Ryan once more. \u201cYou see, she\u2019ll be able to recover. She\u2019ll be able to come back to us.\u201d</p><p>Hope flashed across Ryan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t come back,\u201d Keira vowed. \u201cI won\u2019t be like you.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan laughed. \u201cYou already are.\u201d</p><p>A tremble shook the witch\u2019s body. Shonna\u2019s lashes swept down, concealing her gaze.</p><p>Lorcan stalked back toward Alerac. He knelt down, getting too close.</p><p>Your mistake.</p><p>\u201cKeira will come back to us, and, by then, you\u2019ll be long dead.\u201d</p><p>But I am not dead yet.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s claws flew up. He scraped across Lorcan\u2019s cheek, digging deep into the vamp\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Lorcan screamed and jerked away. He glared down at Alerac, chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the one who is dead,\u201d Alerac promised him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be the one mated to Keira while you are no more than a pile of bones.\u201d Lorcan swiped away blood. \u201cTake her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ryan shouted.</p><p>The shout did no good. All of the vampires in that hall were loyal to Lorcan. Their allegiance did not belong to Ryan, to a man who\u2019d been blood born, but was only now beginning his transformation into a full vampire.</p><p>Keira didn\u2019t fight the hands that grabbed her. Her eyes\u2014still unafraid, still too trusting\u2014met Alerac\u2019s, and that trusting gaze broke something in him.</p><p>Ryan rushed after her. After her...and the witch. Because Shonna had followed the group that took Keira away from Alerac.</p><p>The heavy, wooden doors closed behind them.</p><p>Alerac was left with about ten vamps who were all salivating for his blood.</p><p>Drink up. Fuckin\u2019 drink up. The faster they drank, the faster they\u2019d die. He\u2019d been sure not to let Keira sample his blood that night. But as for the others...</p><p>Drink your fill.</p><p>\u201cI said you would get to live.\u201d Lorcan picked up the silver knife. Flashed his fangs. \u201cBut I never vowed that you would not suffer.\u201d</p><p>A vampire yanked back Alerac\u2019s head, forcing him to stare up at Lorcan\u2019s face.</p><p>The leader smiled. \u201cI think I\u2019ll start with your eyes. After all, what good is a wolf that cannot see?\u201d</p><p>Dawn would come soon. Hours? Minutes?</p><p>He could survive anything until dawn. He knew Lorcan would not kill him right away. All in the realm knew of Lorcan\u2019s love for torture. He never let any of his enemies die easily.</p><p>He made my family suffer for hours. Days.</p><p>Alerac had been gone, taken away by another battle. When he\u2019d returned, there had been only decaying bodies waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to carve out your eyes, wolf. Then I\u2019m going to carve you up. Slice by slice. When you\u2019re bleeding from a hundred wounds, we\u2019ll feast on you.\u201d The blade came toward him, but in Alerac\u2019s mind, he didn\u2019t see it. He only saw Keira.</p><p>Then he saw nothing.</p><p>But he felt plenty, especially when the vampires began to feed on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do to him?\u201d The voice\u2014low, rumbling, angry\u2014came to him in the darkness.</p><p>Why was it still dark? Dawn should have come by now.</p><p>\u201cAlerac? Blast Lorcan to hell. Look at his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Then, rough hands yanked him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAlerac, Alerac, it\u2019s Liam. We got in, just like you said. We found the vampires. Half of \u2018em were passed out.\u201d</p><p>Because they\u2019d feasted on his blood\u2014just as Lorcan had promised. Drained him nearly dry.</p><p>They\u2019d taken the poison right from his veins.</p><p>\u201cA few got away, but we\u2019ll catch their scents. We\u2019ll hunt them,\u201d Liam swore.</p><p>Liam...the werewolf who was like a brother to him. The one who always had his back.</p><p>Alerac tried to force himself to speak. \u201cK-Keira...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to shift. Do you hear me? Shift now.\u201d The snap of command was in Liam\u2019s voice. So was the whisper of fear.</p><p>Only a shift would heal Alerac\u2019s injuries. Not just one shift, not after all they\u2019d done to him.</p><p>A few hours...</p><p>There was much, much that could be done in that time.</p><p>Alerac shook his head and nearly fell back down to the stone floor.</p><p>\u201cGet the silver off him!\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel that silver anymore.</p><p>But something hit the stone floor with a clunk. The chains?</p><p>\u201cThe silver\u2019s gone,\u201d Liam said as he pulled Alerac forward, forcing him to walk. \u201cShift.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. He could barely sense the beast inside of him. There was something else that was more important. Something he needed.</p><p>The only person he could see in the darkness that surrounded him.</p><p>\u201cK-Keira...\u201d Her name was a broken rasp. They\u2019d cut his throat, torn it with their fangs, and that weak rasp was all he could manage then.</p><p>Liam swore. \u201cThe vampire bitch? Look, we didn\u2019t hurt her. We didn\u2019t even see her.\u201d</p><p>She was all that Alerac could see. Her eyes had been so blue. So trusting.</p><p>There had been love in her eyes.</p><p>Love for a beast who\u2019d betrayed her.</p><p>\u201cKeira...\u201d Saying her name made him feel stronger. Made the beast inside stronger.</p><p>\u201cThe lass is not here! She wasn\u2019t here when we arrived. Look, forget her\u2014shift! Your eyes\u2014they\u2014they\u2014\u201d</p><p>He knew what they\u2019d done to his eyes.</p><p>Just as he knew about all of the flesh they\u2019d cut from him. Inch by inch. Slice by slice.</p><p>A growl built in his throat. They\u2019d taken Keira. Sent her to be imprisoned? He had to find her. Had to find\u2014</p><p>His bones began to snap. The wolf shoved and clawed his way to freedom as he pushed to get to the one thing he needed so desperately.</p><p>His knees gave way. He broke from Liam\u2019s grip and hit the floor. His claws scraped over the stones. He opened his mouth. Tried to call Keira\u2019s name once more.</p><p>But it was the wolf\u2019s cry that escaped from him. A long, mournful cry for a mate who wasn\u2019t there. A mate he hadn\u2019t recognized.</p><p>Not until it was too late.</p><p>Two hundred years...</p><p>Present Day</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Someone was watching her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the casual, even flirtatious, stares that she sometimes attracted when she worked at Wylee\u2019s Bar. Sure, her skirt was short enough and her top tight enough to get plenty of second glances.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t about her clothes. Or her figure. Or about some kind of fast hook-up between strangers.</p><p>I feel hunted.</p><p>Very carefully, Jane Smith put the empty beer pitcher on the bar. Then her gaze rose and locked on the long, stretching mirror that covered most of the wall behind that bar. In the mirror\u2019s gleaming surface, she could see the crowd that filled Wylee\u2019s.</p><p>And the man who watched her.</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her skin. The man was big, muscled, with huge shoulders that filled the doorway\u2014and he was still standing just inside the doorway. He\u2019d angled his body toward the shadows so that she couldn\u2019t clearly see his face, but she knew he was watching her. The realization was instinctive. Bone deep.</p><p>\u201cJane? Table four is waiting for you.\u201d More beer was pushed toward her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t want to head over and check on table four. She wanted to run, fast and far, from that little bar.</p><p>Because she was afraid.</p><p>In the last six months, she\u2019d been afraid plenty. Countless times, she\u2019d woken up at night, screaming, not even knowing why. She never dreamed when she slept. Just saw darkness. Total and complete.</p><p>But she feared.</p><p>The man in the doorway\u2014I\u2019m afraid of him.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d The bartender and the owner of the place, Hannah Wylee, frowned at her. \u201cGirl, you look like you\u2019re about to faint.\u201d</p><p>She felt that way, too.</p><p>But Jane forced herself to reach for the tray. To curl her hands around it and turn away from the bar and that broad mirror. She turned\u2014</p><p>He was still in the doorway. So tall. The stranger had to be about six foot four. And those shoulders\u2014they were truly brushing the sides of the old, wooden entrance to Wylee\u2019s Bar.</p><p>She wanted to see his eyes.</p><p>She was terrified to see them.</p><p>Jane lifted her chin, lifted that tray, and scurried through the crowd. It was a Friday night, and Friday nights were always busy. It was Miami\u2014a city known for non-stop parties. Tourists, locals\u2014everyone piled in on Friday nights.</p><p>It was only slightly past ten PM; the night was young. She wouldn\u2019t be escaping from this place until close to six that morning.</p><p>Bodies brushed against her. Hands that were a little too friendly tried to slow her down. Offers, invitations were thrown out to her. She ignored them, hurrying toward table four.</p><p>Only she didn\u2019t make it to the table.</p><p>She walked right into him.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been able to get across the bar that fast. But he had.</p><p>Her tray bounced against him. Beer sloshed, and she had to do a frantic grab to make sure that the whole try didn\u2019t go crashing to the floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Music beat around them. Voices rose and fell. Laughter filled the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d His voice was deep. Rumbling. Tinged with the faintest of accents.</p><p>Her goosebumps got even bigger.</p><p>Look at him.</p> <p>She made her gaze rise. Her eyes locked on his.</p><p>No, not on his. On the sunglasses he was wearing. Um, sunglasses, in a bar? At night? What was up with that?</p><p>Her attention shifted to his face. To the hard, square line of his jaw. A jaw that was clenched. His lips\u2014sensual, a little cruel\u2014were pressed into a thin line.</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest. Breathing deeply got incredibly difficult. \u201cUh, if you\u2019ll just get a table...\u201d Before they all filled up, \u201cone of the other waitresses will be with you in a few moments.\u201d Because she was not taking his table. Mr. Sunglasses could just keep on walking right past her.</p><p>He took the tray from her. Dropped it onto a nearby table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d One of the frat boys at that nearby table began.</p><p>But the man with the dark hair, midnight black and so very thick, wasn\u2019t paying the frat guy any attention. No, the stranger had stepped forward. He\u2019d wrapped his hands around her arms and pulled her right against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d Growled. Those words seemed more animal than man.</p><p>Her heart wasn\u2019t racing right then\u2014Jane could have sworn that it stopped completely.</p><p>Trouble.</p><p>Her gaze cast frantically around the bar. Hannah wasn\u2019t looking her way. And where were the bouncers? They should be there to help with situations like this one. No one was supposed to mess with the staff.</p> <p>Breathe, breathe. She forced herself to take a few deep breaths. Her heart began its mad thumping once more. \u201cI think...\u201d His voice had been a growl. Hers was a squeak. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got me confused with someone else.\u201d And she pitied that poor woman.</p><p>His fingers tightened. Then he was moving\u2014cutting his way right through the crowd and hauling her with him.</p><p>Finally, finally, Hannah glanced up and saw her being dragged across the bar. Hannah\u2019s mouth dropped open in surprise even as her green eyes widened in alarm.</p><p>Yeah, Jane was feeling pretty dang surprised and alarmed, too.</p><p>Help me. Jane mouthed. Then she screamed it. But the music was pumping, the crowd was already shouting, and her scream did nothing.</p><p>She tried to twist out of the guy\u2019s hold, but there was no give to him at all. He didn\u2019t even seem to notice her struggles.</p><p>\u201cCurtis! Sean!\u201d Hannah yelled, calling out for the bouncers.</p><p>But her stranger had Jane at the back door. He shoved that door open and dragged her outside. The night air was hot. Thick.</p> <p>She tried to pull away from him once more. Not happening. The guy\u2019s grip was unbreakable. He was strongest thing that she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He pushed her against the brick wall of the building. Caged her there. \u201cYou should have come to me. As soon as you were free.\u201d</p><p>He was insane. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips crashed down on hers. His kiss was wild, rough. Almost desperate.</p><p>She shoved her hands against his chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t step back.</p><p>Jane sank her nails into him.</p><p>He growled and just kissed her harder.</p><p>All she could hear was the frantic beating of her heart. Too fast. Shaking her body.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t letting her go. His kiss\u2014she felt like he was consuming her.</p><p>Fear beat at Jane. So much fear.</p><p>Where was Curtis? Sean? She tried to scream again, but his mouth muffled the sound. Fine, maybe she\u2019d just bite the jerk.</p><p>Only, before she could, his head lifted. Finally. Lifted and\u2014</p><p>He licked her neck. \u201cMissed you. So fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d His accent had deepened. What was that? Irish? It sounded like an accent she\u2019d heard on TV once. \u201cNever gonna let you go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, buddy, you will.\u201d Sean\u2019s sharp voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll be letting her go right now.\u201d</p><p>She sagged against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let her go,\u201d another hard male voice. Yes! That was Curtis talking! She recognized his familiar Alabama twang. \u201cOr, mister, that\u2019ll sure enough be the last mistake you ever make.\u201d</p><p>Jane sucked in a deep, desperate breath.</p><p>Her stranger\u2014still with his sunglasses on\u2014gave a rough sigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get involved in this,\u201d he said to the men. He didn\u2019t even bother glancing over at them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do.\u201d Sean was adamant. \u201cJane there is our friend, and you need to get your damn hands off her.\u201d</p><p>The man, who held her in a grip of steel, tensed. His head cocked, and he seemed to study her behind his sunglasses. \u201cJane.\u201d He tasted the name, frowning. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She found her voice with a stutter. \u201cPl-please, let me go.\u201d</p><p>His body locked, the muscles tensing even more against her.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Curtis\u2019s voice was harder than Sean\u2019s, harder and even meaner. \u201cOr I\u2019ll taze your ass.\u201d</p><p>The tazer was Curtis\u2019s weapon of choice. He\u2019d told her once that he didn\u2019t like to get bloody unless he had to.</p><p>Blood made the ex-linebacker feel nauseous.</p><p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d Curtis snapped, his drawl thicker. People usually jumped when Curtis gave an order.</p><p>Very, very slowly, the stranger eased his grip on Jane.</p><p>She immediately ran from him and straight into Sean\u2019s outstretched arms.</p><p>A growl rumbled in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Sean muttered. He shoved her behind his broad back. She was so glad that Sean was there. Tall, tattooed, with his gleaming bald head and the bulging muscles that normally made even drunk men give him a clear path\u2014he was a truly beautiful sight to her scared eyes right then.</p><p>Only the more she studied him, Jane realized that Sean didn\u2019t look so intimidating right then, not when he was so near the mysterious male\u2014the crazy male\u2014in the sunglasses.</p><p>The man who\u2019d held Jane, who\u2019d kissed her so fiercely, turned to slowly face them. Curtis came to stand at Sean\u2019s side, a united front. Curtis was as tall as Sean, but leaner, and his hands were currently curled around a tazer.</p><p>The guy never made empty threats.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wanted at Wylee\u2019s any longer,\u201d Curtis told him bluntly. \u201cSo hit the road, and don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>And the knot in Jane\u2019s stomach was getting worse.</p><p>\u201cJane isn\u2019t your name.\u201d He spoke just to her. Seemed to focus only on her.</p><p>Her heart stopped then.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you lie to them?\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cWhy lie to me?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers clutched at Sean\u2019s arm. He glanced back at her. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Her gaze swept over the stranger\u2019s face. The lamp posts behind the bar tossed light on him. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him in my life.\u201d</p><p>He took another step toward her. \u201cLie.\u201d</p><p>Curtis lifted his tazer. \u201cMan, I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The stranger lunged for him.</p><p>Curtis fired his tazer.</p><p>Only the tazer didn\u2019t actually do anything to the man in black. The shock should have hit him, immobilized him, but he didn\u2019t even slow down. He yanked the electrodes out of his chest, and in the next instant, he was in front of Curtis. One powerful fist drove into the bouncer\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Curtis flew back. Hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cGet inside, Jane,\u201d Sean demanded. \u201cGet back inside, now.\u201d</p><p>Then Sean tried to attack.</p><p>He was on the ground less than a second later.</p><p>And Jane was running\u2014too late\u2014for that back door.</p><p>Hard hands caught her around the waist and spun her around. She was screaming, not even realizing the desperate sound came from her, until his hand flattened over her mouth, stilling her cries.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting me. I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She was supposed to believe him? After he\u2019d just downed those two bouncers with barely any effort?</p><p>And why hadn\u2019t the tazer worked on him?</p><p>Her breath was rushing out in desperate bursts from her nostrils.</p><p>He brought his head close to hers and he-</p><p>Inhaled?</p><p>She held her body completely still, too terrified to even move.</p><p>She\u2019d seen something just this on TV last week. One of those crime shows that she liked to watch. A guy had been obsessed with a stranger. He\u2019d stalked her. Killed her.</p><p>Then the detectives had spent forty-five minutes tracking him down. Their tracking hadn\u2019t done the victim any good, though. She\u2019d been dead before the first commercial break.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be dead!</p><p>His head lowered over her throat, and, yes, the crazy guy was sniffing her. Sniffing her, then...licking her?</p><p>She shivered. A combination of fear and\u2014no, no, it had to just be from fear.</p><p>\u201cI would know you, anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes had closed. When had she squeezed her eyes shut? Jane forced them open now. He\u2019d stepped back, but she could actually still feel him. Feel his lips\u2014his tongue\u2014on her throat.</p><p>His hands dropped from her. \u201cWhat game are you playing?\u201d</p><p>Sean groaned.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cN-no game. You\u2019ve got me confused with someone else.\u201d Her words tumbled out too quickly. Desperation would do that to a girl. Make her talk fast. Make her shake and quake.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was adamant. And he didn\u2019t even look back at Sean and Curtis. Why would he? Not like they were a threat any longer. \u201cI know my vampire when I see her.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, she actually thought she might pass out. Just fall right at his feet. Her arms wrapped around her stomach as she swayed. \u201cV-vampire?\u201d Then she shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><p>Wait, that probably hadn\u2019t the smartest thing to say to the guy.</p><p>A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires aren\u2019t real.\u201d She was edging cautiously toward the bar\u2019s back door. Just a few more steps, and she\u2019d be able to rush inside.</p><p>This time, she\u2019d try to not get her ass dragged back outside again.</p><p>Like that had worked so well the first time.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>The sound stopped her.</p><p>His laughter was deep and rumbling and dark. And the man was scary\u2014so terrifying to her. So why in the world did she find the sound of that rough laughter to be sexy?</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m the crazy one.</p><p>\u201cI know your secrets.\u201d His voice was low, almost taunting. \u201cEvery last one.\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His lips parted. Wait, were his teeth sharper? Those teeth, his canines, sure looked sharper to her. They appeared to be getting even more so by the minute.</p><p>\u201cAm I having a nightmare?\u201d The question slipped from her. It sounded as absolutely lost as she felt.</p><p>His fingers lifted. Smoothed lightly over her cheek. \u201cI can take away all of your nightmares. I can make sure you never know another instant of pain or fear in your life again.\u201d</p><p>If only. \u201cLook, mister, you\u2019re the thing scaring me the most right now.\u201d</p><p>His hand seemed so hot against her flesh.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she was begging, she knew it. \u201cJust let me go.\u201d</p><p>The light from the lamp posts and from the back of the building bounced off his sunglasses. She was glad she couldn\u2019t see his eyes. She didn\u2019t want to see them.</p><p>In the next instant, his hand had dropped from her cheek and he\u2019d grabbed her right wrist. He lifted up her hand, staring down at her palm. \u201cYour rose. It marks you.\u201d His hold tightened. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Now he was obsessing over that weird red birthmark? Okay, sure, if you squinted, it did look like a rose, but so what? \u201cLet me go,\u201d Jane said again. Her desperation was making her voice shake.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d He released her and stepped back.</p><p>For now and forever.</p><p>She took a few frantic breaths. Hope stirred.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not what you think I am.\u201d She had to convince him. Had to get the guy to walk away. \u201cI\u2019m not a vampire. I\u2019m not some kind of monster.\u201d Though you sure may be. \u201cI\u2019m just a normal human, okay? Your average woman. My name is Jane and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Snarled.</p><p>Okay. The guy obviously had quite a few issues.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know you? You think I don\u2019t know your scent? Your touch? Every fuckin\u2019 thing about you?\u201d</p><p>She took another careful step toward the door.</p><p>Another groan sounded behind her stranger. Sean. A fast glance showed her that he was trying to rise. Hurry, Sean. Hurry.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know me,\u201d she whispered, hoping to keep the stranger\u2019s attention on her long enough for Sean to get more strength back. \u201cWe\u2019re strangers.\u201d Her frantic heartbeat seemed to be bruising her chest.</p><p>He smiled then. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>That smile\u2014it flashed actual fangs.</p><p>\u201cG-get away from her!\u201d Sean\u2019s voice. The guy sounded winded, and when the stranger\u2019s face tensed, she knew he was about to attack again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She reached for him. Curled her hands around his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt them again.\u201d Because she knew that he could.</p><p>Would?</p><p>But he nodded.</p><p>Voices rose in the wind then. Others were heading that way\u2014maybe to the parking lot that lay a few steps behind him. Hell, maybe they were just walking that way in order to get some action in the dark.</p><p>Either way, their audience was increasing.</p><p>And her stranger, after one long look down at the hands that held him, tilted his head back. He nodded, as if he\u2019d made a decision. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not if I see you first.</p><p>He backed away and actually seemed to just...vanish into the night.</p><p>That was good.

Her secret was out.</p><p>He\u2019d scared her.</p><p>Dammit, that hadn\u2019t been his plan.

Trap.</p><p>Cage.</p> <p>He\u2019d wanted to grab onto her and hold her as tightly as he could.</p><p>But she\u2019d stared up at him and acted as if he were a stranger.</p><p>Worse, a monster.</p><p>Well, what was fuckin\u2019 new there?</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>He turned at the words, not surprised to discover Liam waiting for him in the darkness.</p><p>They were both well used to the dark. \u201cYes.\u201d The word snapped out from Alerac.</p><p>Liam waited on the edge of the small parking lot, his body reclining against the motorcycle behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t see her.\u201d</p> <p>Wasn\u2019t he the observant one?</p><p>\u201cWe come all this way,\u201d Liam murmured, \u201cwe look for so long, but we don\u2019t take her?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was terrified.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed at that. \u201cWhen has fear ever stopped you?\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t. Only...it\u2019s her. This was different. This was the most important mission of his life.</p><p>The only thing that mattered to him.</p><p>Liam sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair. \u201cWe came here to see if she was the one.\u201d</p><p>The one who haunted him. Obsessed him.</p><p>\u201cIf she was the one, then we were supposed to take her. That was the plan, right?\u201d</p><p>Like he needed to be reminded of this shit. It was his plan.</p><p>Alerac marched toward his own motorcycle. Climbed on the bike. \u201cThere were too many eyes here.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t have approached her in that bar. He\u2019d planned...hell, he\u2019d just planned to walk inside. To get a look at her. To catch her scent. To see if she was the nightmare who chased him every time he slept.</p><p>Am I having a nightmare? Her voice, so different from what he\u2019d expected, whispered through his mind. No accent lightened her words. Fear had made them breathless and husky.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d intended just to watch her that night. But once he\u2019d actually crossed the threshold of Wylee\u2019s Bar, when her head had snapped up and his eyes had locked on her...</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>She was just as beautiful as he remembered.</p><p>Those high cheekbones. That heart-shaped face. The plump lips. The hair that was the color of the sun\u2014a sun she\u2019d once loved.</p><p>Barely five feet four, she\u2019d always been small. Deceptively delicate, but curved in all of the right places. Places he\u2019d touched and kissed.</p><p>One look and all he\u2019d been able to think about was touching her again.</p><p>\u201cBut she fuckin\u2019 feared me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Liam whistled. \u201cIs that why the lass is running now?\u201d</p><p>And she was. He\u2019d just caught her scent\u2014woman, sex, temptation\u2014drifting on the wind. He turned his head and saw her jump into a beat-up old truck. She gunned the engine and raced from the lot as if the devil himself were after her.</p><p>He was.</p><p>When you run, the beast likes to hunt.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain it\u2019s her? We\u2019re not about to terrify some mortal, are we?\u201d Liam pressed. \u201cThough that certainly wouldn\u2019t be a first. They are fun when they\u2019re afraid. I like the way they smell then.\u201d</p><p>Alerac gunned his motorcycle. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d Absolute certainty.</p><p>He just had to make her remember that truth.</p><p>Remember him.</p><p>Damn vampires and witches and their curses. He\u2019d been kept away from her for far too long.</p><p>\u201cThen hurry and claim her,\u201d Liam advised him, voice roughening. \u201cBecause if you found her, the others won\u2019t be far behind.\u201d</p><p>No, they wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019d gotten lucky. For once. A tip from a human who knew the score and who wanted to make an ally with the wolf pack.</p><p>He\u2019d found \u201cJane\u201d first. Finders fuckin\u2019 keepers.</p><p>The motorcycle shot away from the sheltering darkness.</p><p>He\u2019d backed off earlier because others had been close by. She\u2019d begged him to spare the humans, and he had. For her.</p><p>But he\u2019d told her the truth. He wasn\u2019t letting her go. He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He followed her red taillights and hoped that he\u2019d be able to keep his beast in check a little longer. But he\u2019d already waited two hundred years for her.</p><p>His control wasn\u2019t going to last forever. It might not even last until dawn.</p><p>It was just past midnight, when the darkness was at its thickest, and his motorcycle cut easily down the road. The woman who\u2019d called herself Jane had ducked off the main streets and gone straight for the back alleys.</p><p>He wondered just where she was running to.</p><p>Is she running to someone?</p><p>Jealousy was there, spiking in blood that was already overheated. But he couldn\u2019t stop the feelings. With her, he couldn\u2019t stop anything.</p><p>She braked her truck. Jumped out and ran inside a building\u2014a boarded up, ramshackle building that looked pitch black.</p><p>He parked his own bike. Jane hadn\u2019t even glanced back before she\u2019d dashed inside. She should have been smarter than that. Should have known that she was being stalked.</p><p>A vampire\u2019s instincts were normally much sharper.</p><p>Slowly, Alerac climbed from the motorcycle. He stared up at that building. It looked like it had been another bar, once upon a time. Now it was empty. Broken.</p><p>He inhaled. Caught her scent and\u2014</p><p>A man\u2019s scent.</p><p>Human.</p><p>In that damn building.</p><p>With her.</p><p>His back teeth clenched as he headed for the door.</p><p>Another scent reached him in that moment. One that drove both the beast inside of him and the man that he was trying so desperately to be...wild.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>He didn\u2019t attempt to open the door.</p><p>He just kicked it down and raced inside.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>When the door shattered and chunks of wood flew inside that old building, Alerac heard a man\u2019s sharp shout of surprise and pain.</p><p>He smiled. He\u2019d be hearing that sound again.</p><p>He took a step forward, but then\u2014then he was tackled. Something\u2014someone\u2014slammed right into him. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t have gone down, but the bastard had hit him with a silver-coated bat, one that burned like a bitch on impact, and then the guy had tackled him.</p><p>The man yelled, \u201cRun, Jane!\u201d</p><p>No, Jane wasn\u2019t running.</p><p>He grabbed that bat before the man could take another swing. Yanked it from the guy\u2019s hands and tossed it against the wall. Sure, his fingers blistered. Smoke rose from his palm. But he was long used to pain.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn,\u201d the man muttered, then he scrambled back.</p><p>Back to Jane? No, you don\u2019t.</p><p>Alerac was on his feet again. He rolled his shoulders back and lifted his head. His sunglasses had fallen. He didn\u2019t bother picking them back up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to hide here. They could see him for exactly what he was.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with his eyes?\u201d That was the man\u2019s shaking voice. The man\u2014some blond fool who stood between Alerac and Jane.</p><p>\u201cThey glow,\u201d Alerac muttered because he knew the guy was talking about the shine that turned his eyes even brighter, \u201cso that it will be the fuckin\u2019 better for me to see you.\u201d And kill you.</p><p>The guy leapt back, pulling Jane with him. Poor little Jane. So lost. She had a wall behind her. The fool in front of her.</p><p>And me, just waiting.</p><p>Then he realized that the blond fool wasn\u2019t bleeding. The blood wasn\u2019t his. Instead, the scent was coming from the discarded bag on the floor. A blood bag?</p><p>For Jane?</p><p>He\u2019d thought the man was feeding Jane straight from his veins. Instead, he\u2019d given her some kind of vampire take-out.</p><p>Alerac had heard talk that some vamps no longer took their sustenance directly from a live source. He just hadn\u2019t expected that to be the case with Jane. Her clan had always been particularly blood-thirsty. And they loved the rush of taking straight from prey.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t a vampire,\u201d Alerac said as he advanced, crushing chunks of broken wood beneath his feet. His eyes were on Jane. In the darkness, he could see her perfectly.</p><p>Thanks to the eyes of the beast. The only eyes that he had.</p><p>Still staring straight at Jane, he asked, \u201cSo want to tell me why you need that blood?\u201d</p><p>The male lunged for him.</p><p>Sighing, Alerac tossed the guy back against the nearest wall.</p><p>Humans. So weak. So easy to break.</p><p>He\u2019d better not be her lover.</p><p>Because, if he was, the male might not get to live much longer.</p><p>He expected Jane to cower against that wall. Instead, her chin lifted. Her eyes\u2014they seemed to grow brighter. Ah, so she was letting her vamp side out.</p><p>He could even see the faint edge of her white fangs, peeking out behind her plump, red lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about me,\u201d she said, lifting her spine and squaring her shoulders. Like that made her look more intimidating. \u201cBut you won\u2019t hurt my friend, and you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Her words had him pausing. \u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you.\u201d Truth. Her friend? Debatable. Alerac thought he might enjoy hurting the male.</p><p>Her brows rose even as her gaze slowly slid over him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let his expression alter. \u201cAlerac,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cAlerac O\u2019Neill.\u201d</p><p>The name seemed to mean nothing to her. A frown still pulling her brows low, she demanded, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>His head tilted as he heard the roar of an engine. Several engines. Big vehicles. SUVs. Coming fast toward their location. His gaze shifted to the human on the floor. Then back to Jane. \u201cI\u2019m the man who is going to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter was sharp and disbelieving. \u201cYou\u2019re the only threat I see here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear them coming for you.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a lot of time to waste. But he\u2019d try to get her to leave willingly with him. If that didn\u2019t work...</p><p>She will still leave with me.</p><p>\u201cThe enemies coming didn\u2019t follow me. I didn\u2019t lead them to you.\u201d He wanted her to understand that. \u201cAnd no one else followed you when you left that bar. I made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lower lip. A nervous gesture.</p><p>One that made him ache. It has been too long since I\u2019ve been with her.</p><p>A growl rose in his throat. \u201cSo if they didn\u2019t follow me...or you...someone else must have told them where you were.\u201d The someone who was now trying to crawl his way toward the door.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t escaping.</p><p>Alerac leapt over and grabbed the human. Alerac lifted him up and shoved the man against the wall. \u201cShe called you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Ah, yes, now he recognized the fellow. Dr. Heath Myers. Alerac had seen a grainy photo of the doctor before. Alerac\u2019s human informant had briefed Alerac about the man.</p><p>The man who\u2019d found a lost woman walking on the edge of a swamp. A woman with no memory. No past. A woman who had a thirst for blood and who weakened in sunlight.</p><p>Not a lost woman, but a lost vampire.</p><p>\u201cJane told you I was at the bar, that I knew what she was,\u201d Alerac said.</p><p>The doctor didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t need to. Alerac realized exactly what had happened.</p><p>Rage building, Alerac charged, \u201cYou realized you had to act fast, or you were about to lose your payday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Jane grabbed Alerac\u2019s arm and tried to yank him away from the doctor. Not happening. Even on his weakest day, he was far stronger than she could imagine. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! Heath is here to help me!\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Alerac told her. He kept his hold on the squirming doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s how long you have before the others get here.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him with those big, blue, fuck-me eyes. \u201cO-others?\u201d</p><p>So many enemies. All eager to use her. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he told her, \u201cand I\u2019ll make sure you live.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>If that was the way she wanted to play it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know you, Alerac O\u2019Neill!\u201d She yanked harder on his arm. \u201cBut I know Heath. I trust him.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHe saved my life! Helped me to\u2014to live in a world I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Then Alerac felt it. The hard, fast slice of a blade in his chest. A silver blade. There was no mistaking that familiar burn.</p><p>His gaze shot to the doctor. The man wasn\u2019t squirming any longer. He was smiling. \u201cI know how to kill your kind,\u201d Heath whispered.</p><p>Silver. Right to the heart.</p><p>Normally, that was an effective method for killing a werewolf.</p><p>He backed away from the doctor.</p><p>Jane got a look at his chest and the knife protruding from it. She screamed.</p><p>Normally. Alerac\u2019s knees gave way. He sank to the floor. His fingers curled around the knife\u2019s handle.</p><p>Heath grabbed Jane\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Jane left, she\u2019d be dead.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t running. She was staring at Alerac with horror filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJane, come on!\u201d Heath jerked her toward the door.</p> <p>Wrong move.</p><p>The guy had probably just bruised her.</p><p>Alerac slowly pulled the knife out of his chest as the smoke drifted from the wound. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about my kind,\u201d he said to the doctor. The knife hit the floor. He didn\u2019t need that weapon. Razor sharp claws burst from his fingertips. \u201cBut you will, human. I promise, you will.\u201d</p><p>Heath dragged Jane through the broken door. She\u2019d caught sight of Alerac\u2019s claws. And, judging by the fear flying across her face, she hadn\u2019t been prepared to see them.</p><p>The woman looked as if she\u2019d never seen a werewolf\u2019s claws before.</p> <p>Fuckin\u2019 Lorcan. He\u2019d done this to her. Taken away her past. Destroyed her memories.</p><p>\u201cRun, Jane, hurry!\u201d Heath\u2019s shout.</p><p>Alerac followed them to the doorway. The sound of approaching engines could be heard clearly now. Those growls were too close. \u201cGo with him,\u201d Alerac called, \u201cand he\u2019ll turn on you.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s breath panted out, but she pulled away from Heath. Whirled back to face Alerac.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d He wanted her to come to him. To take that step. Willingly.</p><p>But Jane shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p> <p>Then she jumped into her truck. Heath was already inside, sitting next to the passenger door. Jane floored the vehicle. It lurched forward.</p><p>Heath glanced back. Flipped him the middle finger.</p><p>A low whistle came from the Alerac\u2019s right. \u201cI guess we get to kill that human, huh?\u201d Liam. Alerac had known that the wolf waited just outside the building. Liam hadn\u2019t attacked because Alerac had told him to stand down.</p><p>But now...that human...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dead man.\u201d Alerac lifted his hand to his chest. His heart hurt, but it would heal.</p><p>With his shift.</p><p>The shift that was already pulsing through him.</p><p>Jane wasn\u2019t getting away, and he wouldn\u2019t fight the men who thought to take her in human form.</p> <p>No, for their crime, they\u2019d face his beast.</p><p>And they\u2019d all die.</p><p>\u201cTurn left,\u201d Heath\u2019s words snapped out, and Jane automatically yanked the wheel to the left. The truck heaved, then jerked into the narrow gap between two buildings.</p><p>Her white-knuckled grip on that steering wheel never eased as Jane spared a fast glance for Heath. \u201cDid you see his hands? And why was he burning when you hit him with the bat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was silver. And because he\u2019s a freaking werewolf.\u201d</p><p>A werewolf. \u201cWhat?\u201d She slammed on the brakes. The pick-up shuddered to a stop.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop! Keep driving!\u201d Heath glanced over his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come after us. I heard that once a werewolf gets your scent, he doesn\u2019t lose it. He\u2019ll track us\u2014now shove down that damn gas pedal!\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t moving. Wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cHow do you even know about werewolves?\u201d</p><p>Vampires were real. Okay, they had to be real. Because she was a vampire. But werewolves?</p><p>Her head was throbbing, the temples feeling like they were ready to burst.</p><p>\u201cI know because after I found you, I did some checking.\u201d He was sweating. And she could see the pulse beating frantically along his throat. \u201cI was trying to help you, Jane. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted, since the first moment I found you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as the truck\u2019s engine idled. Heath. Her only real friend in this messed up world. \u201cYou\u2019re the first thing I remember.\u201d She\u2019d been walking, lost, slipping and falling her way through the swamp. The sun had been rising. She\u2019d been so weak that her whole body shuddered.</p><p>I\u2019ve got you.</p><p>He\u2019d been there. Wrapping a blanket around her skin. Protecting her. Helping her</p><p>A doctor. Out in the swamp on his afternoon off from work. Poor guy. He\u2019d probably never expected to find someone like her.</p><p>Someone who\u2019d been starving. But not for food.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>He\u2019d given her transfusion after transfusion in his small, isolated office. He\u2019d realized she was...different.</p><p>Heath had protected her before she\u2019d even realized that she needed protecting.</p><p>He\u2019d even been the one to get her the job at Wylee\u2019s. She didn\u2019t have any paperwork, no Social Security card or driver\u2019s license\u2014Jane had nothing. Hell, she\u2019d even had to pick out her own name.</p><p>But Heath had called in some favors that Hannah owed him, and she\u2019d been able to get paid under the table. And been able to survive.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me, don\u2019t you, Jane?\u201d He asked her. Heath\u2019s hand rose. He brushed back the hair that had fallen over her left eye.</p><p>His hand was slightly cool. Not as hot as the\u2014the werewolf\u2019s had been.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Heath pushed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d As soon as he\u2019d realized what a freak of nature she truly was, Heath could have turned her over to the cops. To the government. But he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d said others would hurt her. That they had to find a way to protect her.</p><p>Hiding in plain sight had been that way.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cGood. Now slam your foot down on that gas. You can\u2019t ever let that werewolf take you. Not ever, do you hear me, Jane? He\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She put her foot down on the gas.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Alerac O\u2019Neill.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d told her that.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a killer, and his prey of choice? The prey he takes down the most?\u201d Heath swallowed. She heard the small click of sound easily in the truck\u2019s interior. \u201cAccording to the stories I\u2019ve heard, the guy always hunts vampires.\u201d</p><p>Like he was hunting her.</p><p>The truck lunged forward. But before she could make the next turn up ahead, two big SUVs shot out, and they blocked her path.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here. Hell, yes,\u201d Heath muttered, sounding incredibly relieved.</p><p>She didn\u2019t exactly feel the same relief. \u201cWho is \u2018they\u2019? Tell me, now.\u201d</p><p>Alerac had told her that others were coming. He\u2019d said that she needed to run from them.</p><p>\u201cThese guys can help you,\u201d Heath told her as he reached for his door. \u201cI told them to meet us back there at the old bar. But he got there first.\u201d</p><p>Men were climbing out of those SUVs. She counted at least eight of them. They were big, tough-looking. All wore black. All also had fierce, hard expressions on their faces.</p><p>A shiver slid over her.</p><p>No weapons. They don\u2019t have weapons.</p><p>But one man was holding a duffel bag.</p><p>Before she could stop him, Heath jumped from the truck. He rushed toward those men. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d He pointed back toward Jane as she sat, motionless, behind the staring wheel.</p><p>She forced herself to climb from the truck. Jane stared at those men as her stomach twisted. Were they human? It was strange that she should even have that question. Before that night, she\u2019d thought that she was the only paranormal out there.</p><p>Before a werewolf came to her and changed the world around her.</p><p>\u201cWe have to hurry,\u201d Heath said as he glanced nervously around the area. \u201cThe alpha wolf is on her trail already.\u201d</p><p>Alpha wolf?</p><p>Two of the men shared a hard share and a nod. Then, as if the others had been waiting for that small signal, they all pulled out weapons\u2014guns.</p><p>Jane grabbed tightly to the truck\u2019s driver-side door. It was open, and it was a shield for her body, in case those men decided to shoot her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jane!\u201d Heath was already climbing into the SUV on the right. He\u2019d snatched up the duffel bag.</p><p>What was in that bag?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you pointing your guns at me?\u201d Jane shouted to the men, not about to \u201ccome\u201d any place then without an explanation. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d</p><p>The men didn\u2019t speak. They also didn\u2019t lower their weapons.</p><p>But...</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t pointing them at you. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>His voice. The werewolf.</p><p>Then she felt his hand on her shoulder. A warm weight. She\u2019d never even heard Alerac walking up behind her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re aiming at me right now.\u201d</p><p>The breath left her body in a hard exhale. Yeah, vampires still breathed. At least, she did. She breathed. Her heart beat. And she feared\u2014fear seemed to be consuming her.</p><p>\u201cGet away from the woman!\u201d This shout came from the man in black who\u2019d just hurried forward. A man who spoke with a clipped British accent.</p><p>A man who\u2019d just flashed fangs.</p><p>\u201cNow you know that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Alerac shouted back. The werewolf\u2019s arms wrapped tightly around her. He\u2019d been stabbed in the heart moments before. How was he with her now? How was he just walking around? \u201cBut if you and your little gang of bloodsuckers don\u2019t get out of here, you\u2019ll all be dead in the next minute.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her behind his back.</p><p>Protecting her?</p><p>No, surely he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Yet it seemed he was.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, and I\u2019m not letting her go.\u201d His strong voice carried easily in the night. \u201cSo run to your hole and tell Lorcan to back the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not run!\u201d The man yelled.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Alerac shrugged. \u201cThen you can die. Because my pack has you surrounded right now.\u201d</p><p>And, as if on perfect cue, a series of howls filled the night. Bloodcurdling, fierce, terrifying.</p><p>The men\u2014vampires\u2014began to edge back toward the waiting SUVs.</p><p>\u201cWant to see who wins in this fight?\u201d Alerac asked, the words a dark taunt. \u201cBecause I\u2019m betting my wolves can take out you and your new bloods in less than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>She peered around Alerac. The, ah, new bloods, were definitely backing up. Some had already jumped into the SUVs.</p><p>But that one man\u2014the guy who seemed to be the leader\u2014he hadn\u2019t moved. He was still standing there, aiming his gun at Alerac.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to return without her.\u201d She could see more of his face now. Hard edges, but a weak jaw. His hair was thick, pushed back from his high forehead. His gaze\u2014it looked as dark as the night\u2014turned to her. He stared at her, then said, \u201cAttack.\u201d</p><p>The word was low, and it took her a few seconds to realize that the British guy\u2014the guy who Heath had said was there to help\u2014had actually just given the order for his men to attack her.</p><p>Lucky for her, only half of the men attacked. Half ran. The running half jumped into the SUV, the one already occupied by Heath, and they tore out of there.</p><p>Alerac spun toward her. He wrapped his arms around her and shielded her with his body. The bullets started flying. Jane could smell his blood. Could hear the impact as the bullets hit him. Sank into him.</p><p>\u201cWooden,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSOBs were plannin\u2019 to use wooden bullets on you.\u201d</p><p>And she also heard growls. Howls. The fast thud of\u2014of\u2014</p><p>Alerac released her as men screamed.</p><p>She looked over and saw that the vampires were under attack. Wolves, giant, hulking wolves, had gone after the vampires.</p><p>Even as his blood dripped onto the ground, Alerac headed into that fray. \u201cYou\u2019re dying, vampire.\u201d</p><p>As she watched, Alerac fell to the ground. But when his hands hit the pavement, they weren\u2019t hands any longer.</p><p>They were paws. Long, dark, sharp claws sprang from those paws.</p><p>Bones snapped and popped.</p><p>The vampire leader tried to fire at Jane again, but his gun just clicked. The vamp spun away, rushing for the closest SUV, but he never made it.</p><p>A big, snarling black wolf launched at him.</p><p>The vamp screamed.</p><p>The sound was cut off.</p><p>More howls filled the air.</p><p>She wanted to cover her ears. Wanted to pretend that a massacre wasn\u2019t happening just feet away from her.</p><p>Humans had to be close enough to hear those sounds. Those howls. The screams. The police would come. Right?</p><p>She stumbled back. Her hip hit the metal of her truck. Get in. Get away. She started to climb inside.</p><p>\u201cSorry, love, but you aren\u2019t leaving him again.\u201d</p><p>Another man was there\u2014another man who\u2019d moved too dang quietly. He grabbed her arms, pulled her close. Thanks to her enhanced senses, she could see him clearly in the darkness. She stared into his eyes. Golden. Angry. \u201cHe\u2019s killing for you. The least you can do is hang around and watch the blood.\u201d His smile was cruel. \u201cI thought your kind liked the blood.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach was cramping. Nausea rising in her throat. No, she didn\u2019t like the blood. She hated it. The first time she\u2019d actually tried to drink it, she\u2019d vomited. She craved the blood and despised it at the same time.</p><p>Yes, she was screwed up. She knew it.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jane whispered. \u201cI just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids flickered. The man before her was handsome, far too perfect, with even features. He had thick brown hair and angry eyes. Such incredibly angry eyes. His rage seemed completely directed at her. He scared her. They all did.</p><p>What was new?</p><p>She was a vampire. She should have been able to make others fear. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>The words sounded like a threat.</p><p>Probably because they were.</p><p>There were no more screams then. The silence penetrated her awareness. She looked back over her shoulder.</p><p>The wolves bent over their fallen prey. The vampires were dead. So much blood soaked the pavement.</p><p>And the black wolf, the biggest beast there, was stalking toward her. His green eyes glowed\u2014glowed with that same startling intensity that she\u2019d seen back at the old bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>The wolf began to shift. It wasn\u2019t some instant process. The fur seemed to melt from him. His bones snapped and reshaped. The paws on the ground became tanned hands. He rose slowly, lifting his head so that his shining eyes met hers.</p><p>Jane realized she\u2019d forgotten to breathe.</p> <p>He was naked. The muscles of his chest rippled. And as he continued to advance, her gaze dropped over him. She frowned when she saw the markings on his chest. A tattoo. One with intricate lines that covered the flesh right over his heart. Flesh that should have been sliced open from Heath\u2019s attack. Yet the flesh appeared completely healed.</p><p>Her gaze wanted to drop even more. She wouldn\u2019t let it. Instead, Jane made her eyes rise, and she held that glowing stare as he closed in on her.</p><p>Alerac stopped just in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>His head lowered toward hers. \u201cThat\u2019s twice that I\u2019ve let you run. Don\u2019t try for a third time.\u201d</p> <p>The words were a rumbled whisper of menace.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like the punishment I give if you flee from me again.\u201d</p><p>Then he was taking her arm. Her body brushed against his naked flesh. She gasped at the contact and tried to pull away.</p><p>Yeah, that wasn\u2019t happening. The wolf had a strength she\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>Or, if she had, Jane didn\u2019t remember it.</p><p>But then, I don\u2019t remember anything before that swamp. Six months. That was as far back as her memory went.</p> <p>Six short months.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her gaze flew to the street. To the pile of bodies. She flinched.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s hold tightened on her. \u201cI get that you don\u2019t remember, okay? Let me help you out. That prick vampire? All of his men? They were here to get you, to force you to come back with them. They\u2019re working for a guy named Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>The name meant nothing to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a master vampire,\u201d Alerac said in that deep, rumbling voice of his. \u201cHe\u2019s also a sadistic bastard who wants to make you suffer.\u201d He pulled in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let him get his hands on you again.\u201d</p><p>Again? That \u201cagain\u201d part really scared her.</p><p>\u201cYou...protected me,\u201d Jane said softly. The bullets had hit Alerac. Her hand rose up, before she could even think about what she was doing, and she touched his chest. Her fingers slid over that heated skin.</p> <p>He tensed beneath her. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wounds are gone.\u201d No more blood. Nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cThe shift heals me.\u201d The words were clipped.</p><p>Her hand stilled on his chest. She stared up into his eyes.</p><p>And realized that his mouth was just inches from hers.</p><p>She also realized that her heart was thundering in fear, yes, but there was also more happening to her.</p><p>I want his mouth.</p><p>Just where in the sweet world had that thought come from?</p><p>His eyelids flickered. \u201cI can give you everything that you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, just not here, mate,\u201d said the wolf with the angry eyes. That wolf also shared Liam\u2019s faint accent. \u201cLocal cops will be coming soon. They\u2019re on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear them, Liam,\u201d Alerac said. But he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Jane frowned. She didn\u2019t hear any sirens. She was getting that their senses were a lot better than hers. Scary since Jane had already thought that her vision was pretty sharp. She could see well in the dark, could catch a scent from half a mile away, and she\u2019d once heard a baby cry from four blocks down the road.</p><p>Just how good are their senses? Jane wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to find out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d Alerac said this with certainty.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know him, and he\u2019d just left a street corner full of blood behind him.</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he told her. There was something in those words, an intimacy, that had her body tensing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been found, little vampire,\u201d he murmured as his shining gaze held hers. No wonder he\u2019d worn sunglasses in the bar. Those eyes would have scared all of the humans right out of the place. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve been found, you\u2019re going to find yourself in the middle of a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t want a war.\u201d The other wolves were shifting back into the forms of men. Coming to stand around them. Glaring. They all seemed to hate her.</p><p>All but Alerac.</p><p>He looked at her as if\u2014as if he wants to devour me.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be a snack for the big, bad wolf.</p><p>Alerac wasn\u2019t looking away from her. \u201cSome will want to kill you. They\u2019ll want to torture you just to hear you beg.\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. She wasn\u2019t in to the torture scene, not at all.</p><p>\u201cSome will want to use you. A pawn with no fuckin\u2019 clue.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>To use her? To torture her?</p><p>That glowing stare drifted over her face. \u201cYou. I\u2019ll keep you alive, but in return, I get you.\u201d</p><p>Then she could finally hear the sirens, too. Like screams in the night.</p><p>\u201cLive or die, your choice,\u201d the one he\u2019d called Liam said. \u201cJust choose fast.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to die. What waited for someone like her on the other side? Jane was afraid to find out. If she was a vampire, did that mean she was some kind of abomination? \u201cLive,\u201d she said, lifting her chin.</p><p>Alerac smiled. \u201cGood, because you really didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes flickered.</p><p>Liam tossed some clothing and shoes at Alerac. He dressed in an instant, then he was pulling her toward him. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my truck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it. You don\u2019t need anything from your old life.\u201d</p><p>They were in front of a motorcycle. He climbed on. Motioned for her to jump on behind him.</p><p>She slid onto the bike.</p><p>\u201cWrap your arms around me.\u201d</p><p>Tentatively, her fingers settled around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCome closer. Hold me tighter.\u201d</p><p>Her breath whispered out. She slid closer. Her breasts brushed his back. Her arms dropped. Her hands curled around his stomach.</p><p>The motorcycle growled to life, with a growl much like Alerac\u2019s own. Then they were lunging forward. Racing into the night.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look back at the bodies. She turned her face against his shoulder, and Jane tried to figure out how she was going to survive with the werewolf.</p><p>A werewolf who seemed particularly skilled at killing vampires.</p><p>That sure hadn\u2019t gone according to his damn plan.</p><p>Lorcan Teague stood in the shadows. The swirl of police lights flashed around the street, a sickening blue illumination that had his eyes narrowing. Humans were hurrying around the scene. Snapping pictures of the bodies. Looking for evidence. Roping everything off with their yellow police tape.</p><p>Vampires had attacked someone here.</p><p>They\u2019d attacked the woman known as Jane Smith.</p><p>Only there should have been no such attack. He hadn\u2019t sent out the order for Jane to be taken in. What would have been the point? Jane was supposed to go off with the werewolf alpha.</p><p>In order for her blood to become stronger, she had to go with the beast.</p><p>He\u2019d planned so carefully.</p><p>But it looked as if another player had entered the game. Someone who was screwing with his agenda.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be tolerated.</p><p>He turned away from the scene. He inhaled the scents in the night. The werewolves had fled one way.</p><p>Vamps...my own kind...had gone another.</p><p>His fangs stretched and burned in his mouth.</p><p>Someone was about to pay the price for betrayal. It would be a very, very high price indeed.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>He drove until he could see the red streaks of dawn sweeping across the sky. Alerac didn\u2019t want to stop, he wanted to keep right on driving until he had Jane safe with him and back at his home. Where he could be certain no more vampires would attack her.</p><p>But the sun wasn\u2019t her friend. Hadn\u2019t been, since her twenty-fifth birthday. He should know. He\u2019d been there that day. He\u2019d covered her with his coat, trying to shield her from the light that burned her now.</p><p>The motorcycle braked near the rundown motel. They were still in Florida. Still miles to go before he felt secure enough.</p><p>But Liam was already hurrying inside. Securing the rooms for the group. Alerac knew that the humans at the motel thought they looked like a motorcycle gang. He\u2019d heard the whispers when they\u2019d all ridden up on their bikes.</p><p>The human staff members weren\u2019t completely wrong.</p><p>They were a gang, of sorts.</p><p>He turned off the bike. Jane was already sliding off the seat, trying to get away from him.</p><p>He caught her hand, brushed his fingers over her pulse. Enjoyed the way it sped beneath his touch. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here today.\u201d But he\u2019d make other arrangements soon. As long as Jane was covered, safely away from that sunlight, his pack could keep traveling. It would be easy enough to acquire a van for their use.</p><p>Liam exited the motel\u2019s office and headed back toward him. The werewolf tossed Alerac a room key. He caught it easily, fisting his fingers around it. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me,\u201d he told Jane. As if there was another option. Hell, no, he didn\u2019t trust any other wolf with her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust anyone else with her.</p><p>\u201cKent and Finn, you take the first watch,\u201d Liam ordered.</p><p>The two werewolves nodded. Their curious gazes kept drifting to Jane.</p><p>Everyone in his pack had heard whispers about her.</p><p>Now they all wanted to get close to the legend.</p><p>As he advanced toward the motel, Alerac kept Jane at his side. He sent a hard, determined, back off glare to the others.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t speak until they were inside the small room. One bed. King-sized. Plenty of room for them both.</p><p>The last time I was in bed with her...</p><p>Well, that time had ended in plenty of bloodshed.</p><p>And with her disappearance.</p><p>He slammed the door shut behind them. \u201cYou can rest here while the sun\u2019s high.\u201d Vampires were always at their weakest during the day. That part of the old story was true enough.</p><p>She had stopped in the middle of the room. Her eyes were on the bed.</p><p>How he\u2019d like to strip her and take her on that bed.</p><p>The wolf inside was clawing at him, so desperate for the woman he\u2019d been denied for far too long.</p><p>More than a lifetime. Hell, more than two lifetimes. Did she have any idea what he\u2019d done for her?</p><p>He exhaled slowly. Forced his muscles to unclench.</p><p>If she knew, she\u2019d probably be running. Screaming.</p><p>Instead, she turned slowly to face him. Her hair brushed across those glass-sharp cheekbones. \u201cI don\u2019t like being in the dark.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cMost vamps do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d Jane began, frustration flashing across her face, but then she stopped. Seemed to catch herself. Or maybe she just thought better of yelling at him. She cleared her throat and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about the others.\u201d She tightened her hands into little fists. \u201cI just know about me. Until tonight...\u201d She gave a broken laugh. \u201cI thought I was the only freak out there.\u201d</p><p>Anger hummed through him, and Alerac found himself crossing the room in quick strides. \u201cYou\u2019re not a freak.\u201d If anyone dared to call her that with him near...</p><p>Last mistake that person would make. Last.</p><p>Her smile was sad. \u201cEverything I know about the world, I\u2019ve pretty much learned from TV. I don\u2019t remember anything about my life until six months ago. I even had to teach myself to read and I-I\u2019m still not very good at that.\u201d Shame whispered beneath that confession.</p><p>The instant she is free...I want her to forget. Lorcan\u2019s words drifted through Alerac\u2019s mind. The bastard. Alerac had thought he just meant that she would forget the pain of her imprisonment. All of those desperate years that she\u2019d been trapped.</p><p>But Lorcan had taken every instant of her life away. Every memory.</p><p>\u201cI need a witch.\u201d</p><p>Jane blinked at him. \u201cDo what now?\u201d</p><p>Not just any witch. He\u2019d need a very powerful one. \u201cYou\u2019re under a spell.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him as if he were crazy. A growl worked in his throat. \u201cI turned into a wolf right before your eyes. You\u2019re a vampire. Did you truly think nothing else out of the ordinary existed?\u201d The shadows were full of monsters. She needed to realize that fact in order to keep surviving.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t want them to exist.\u201d A quiet confession.</p><p>What would he have to trade in order to the get the aid of a powerful witch? The price would be high. It always was. \u201cWe\u2019ll get your memory back.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted as she stared up at him. \u201cDo I want it back?\u201d</p><p>No. There was no way that she could want to remember her imprisonment. Maybe I can keep that part from her. Maybe I can get a witch who will pull up only memories before the day she traded her life for mine.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know me? Were we...were we friends?\u201d Before he could answer\u2014and he didn\u2019t want to lie, not to her\u2014Jane shook her head. \u201cHeath told me that you tracked vampires. That you killed them.\u201d</p><p>True enough. He\u2019d killed countless vampires over the centuries.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d Asked so softly as fear slid into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted you dead, I could have killed you behind Wylee\u2019s Bar.\u201d He could have killed the bouncers and her. Instead, he\u2019d let the men live.</p><p>For her.</p><p>Jane swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYour death isn\u2019t what I want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you,\u201d and because he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her, not for even another second, he pulled her against him. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>When her lips parted in surprise, he took her mouth. The kiss should have been softer. She was delicate, almost broken, and he hated that. He wanted her strength back. Wanted her passion.</p> <p>Yes, he should have used gentleness with her. Care. But he wasn\u2019t human, and easy wasn\u2019t the way of the beast.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth as he lifted her up against him. So small. He took three steps, and he had her body pinned against the wall.</p><p>He would have gone straight for the bed, but he was trying\u2014in his way\u2014not to scare the hell out of her.</p><p>The wall seemed the safer alternative.</p><p>Maybe.</p> <p>Her taste. Her fucking taste was incredible. The first time he\u2019d kissed her\u2014he still remembered that moment\u2014he\u2019d gotten a little drunk off her.</p><p>He was getting drunk right then.</p><p>She tasted of paradise, of every pleasure he\u2019d ever had. Woman and temptation. Sweet wine.</p><p>Secrets in the dark.</p><p>His hands were wrapped around her waist. His fingers brushed just under her breasts. He wanted to lift up his hands. To touch her nipples. Pretty, pink nipples.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kissing him back.</p> <p>She had to feel the thick arousal pressing against her. The way he had her lifted up, there would be no missing it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kissing him back.</p><p>His mouth eased from hers, just for a moment. \u201cKiss me back.\u201d Growled words, and not what he\u2019d wanted to say. He\u2019d wanted to say...</p><p>Need me. Desire me. Crave me.</p><p>The way he craved her.</p><p>He put his mouth against hers once more. His tongue swept over her lips. Pushed into her mouth.</p><p>And her tongue\u2014yes!\u2014she kissed him back.</p><p>Her nipples tightened against his chest. Her hips arched toward him, and her nails sank into his shoulders.</p> <p>He liked the sting of pain.</p><p>Liked her mouth moving on his even more.</p><p>She kissed him with a tentative hunger, as if just discovering her desire again. He would help her to yearn, to need. He would guide her, show her every fuckin\u2019 thing about his body.</p><p>About the passion they had together.</p><p>Her legs lifted. Wrapped around his hips.</p><p>He thrust against her, helpless. Dammit, he wanted in.</p><p>She was sucking his tongue. Giving a little moan in the back of her throat. His cock was so swollen he hurt, and the only relief would come from her. He\u2019d thrust into her, drive as deep as he could go. Her body would remember him. She\u2019d respond just as she had before. \u201cKeira...\u201d</p><p>She shoved against him.</p><p>Because it was her, he let her go. Alerac eased her to the floor, then he dropped his hold. He stared at her, breath heaving, desire like a red haze before him.</p><p>\u201cWh-what did you call me?\u201d Her breath came as fast as his. Her eyes were wide, filled with passion\u2014and fear.</p><p>\u201cKeira.\u201d He said her name deliberately.</p><p>Her hands flattened on the wall behind her, as if she needed the support. \u201cThat\u2019s...me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His Keira. She would be his again. Always. No one would take her from\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A definite shake of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that, understand? I-I know you think you know me but...\u201d Another fast shake of her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. And I don\u2019t remember being her.\u201d</p><p>But she was Keira. Lost, but finally found.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jane.\u201d Her voice was husky. Arousing. \u201cJane Smith. That\u2019s the name I chose. The only name I know.\u201d She lifted one trembling hand from the wall. Touched her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s me, not K-Keira.\u201d</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou and Keira...you were...lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I were lovers.\u201d The words snapped from him.</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>And he remembered the way she\u2019d run away with the human. The doctor. While Alerac had been bleeding, she\u2019d fled with Heath. Their hands had locked. She\u2019d gone to that rundown building seeking the doctor.</p><p>With her memories gone, had Keira turned to another? To that bastard?</p><p>His claws burst from his fingertips. \u201cWere you with him?\u201d</p><p>She jumped away from that wall. Moved so fast. Vampire fast. And in the next instant, she had half the room between them.</p><p>He tried to leash his beast, but the possessive fury filling him was too strong to fight. \u201cYour doctor,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cThe man who left you during that vampire attack. Were you with him?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide. \u201cIf I say yes, what happens?\u201d</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>He whirled for the door.</p><p>She grabbed him. Forced him back toward her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t with him.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see past the fury of the beast.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, okay? And even if I had been...\u201d</p><p>His gaze fixed on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter so much to you? I was here for six months.\u201d Her words broke at the end. \u201cMy face was splashed in the paper. I was on the news. A lost woman with no memory.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cNo one came for me. I didn\u2019t matter to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Lie.</p><p>\u201cYou matter more than you know.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t talk to her any more. Couldn\u2019t stand there and inhale her scent. She\u2019d wanted him when they kissed. He\u2019d caught the sweet smell of her desire.</p><p>No, he couldn\u2019t stand there, not with his beast so close to the surface. That was why he\u2019d turned for the door.</p><p>Why he had to leave.</p><p>To protect her, while he still could.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to leave the room. My pack is guarding you, and they won\u2019t let you go.\u201d He pulled from her. Spun around and grabbed the door knob.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes...\u201d</p><p>That whisper stopped him.</p><p>\u201cThey always glow. The other wolves\u2014after they transformed\u2014the glow in their eyes faded.\u201d</p><p>He nearly smashed the door knob in that instant. \u201cI\u2019m not like the others.\u201d His glow never faded. It couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Lorcan had cut out his human eyes. It had taken a very long time for the beast to regenerate new eyes for him. When those eyes had finally come back...</p><p>Not the eyes of a man.</p><p>And they never would be.</p><p>Just as he would never be a man.</p><p>He yanked open the door. Then Alerac walked into the sun, leaving his vampire behind before he lost all control.</p><p>Tracking the traitorous vampires was easy enough. They\u2019d left plenty of blood in their wake.</p><p>As the sun rose, Lorcan knew that those bastards would be seeking shelter. Unlike him, they weren\u2019t at full power during the light.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t know his secrets. He\u2019d been trading in magic\u2014and even in science\u2014for centuries. He knew that he was destined to become the most powerful vampire to ever walk the earth.</p><p>Soon, with the right mix of blood coursing through his veins, he would be unstoppable.</p><p>Lorcan approached the house alone. He didn\u2019t need an army. He could fight this battle on his own.</p><p>When he reached the door, he knocked lightly.</p><p>And then some fool actually just swung the door open.</p><p>Lorcan smiled at him. Inhaled. A human. One who carried a familiar scent. Jane. Only that wasn\u2019t her real name. To him, she would always be Keira. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d he said to the blond human.</p><p>The vampires in that house rushed toward him. Attacking with claws and fangs.</p><p>Lorcan shoved the human aside. He would deal with him very, very soon.</p><p>He slashed out with his own claws. Took the head of one vampire. Disemboweled another. Drained a third. The blood flowed and screams filled the air.</p><p>The human tried to run.</p><p>Foolish, foolish human.</p><p>Lorcan followed him outside and slammed the human back against a tree.</p><p>\u201cY-you should be weak,\u201d the human whimpered.</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-Jane was weak in the sun.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWho are you, human?\u201d He lifted him up and rammed his head into the tree once more.</p><p>\u201cD-doctor Heath Myers.\u201d</p><p>A doctor. Hmm. \u201cJane\u2019s doctor.\u201d The name was familiar to him. Because he\u2019d had eyes on Jane. On those close to her.</p><p>I should have been watching this one more closely.</p><p>Lorcan dropped the human.</p><p>\u201cYou killed them all,\u201d Heath\u2019s voice was hoarse. He started to wretch on the ground.</p><p>A sigh broke from Lorcan. \u201cYou\u2019re about to join them. You aligned yourself with the wrong vampires.\u201d</p><p>Heath swiped his hand over his mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I was aligning with vamps,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThought it was...someone else...until tonight.\u201d</p><p>Curious now, Lorcan bent next to the man. His eyes narrowed on the human\u2019s face. \u201cLet\u2019s just see what you thought.\u201d And he sank his teeth into the man\u2019s throat while Heath Myers screamed.</p><p>If you wanted to look at a human\u2019s past, all a vamp had to do was take a bite.</p><p>Darkness. It was always the same when she slept. Jane instantly sank into a thick suffocating darkness.</p><p>She was trapped. Her wrists shackled. Her ankles bound. The darkness was complete and consuming.</p><p>She cried out, screaming again and again, but soon her voice was gone. Gasps were all that could escape from her throat.</p><p>Her voice was broken.</p><p>She was lost.</p><p>There was only the darkness.</p><p>Tears leaked down her cheeks. She knew that she\u2019d been left in the darkness. Forgotten. There was no rescue. No hope.</p><p>There was nothing.</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d The voice, it was new. Voices never entered her dreams.</p><p>Yet she heard a man\u2019s voice. Low. Rumbling. Demanding.</p><p>She tried to see the man in the darkness.</p><p>He\u2019s not there. A taunt, from within. She was alone. That was the way that she would always be.</p><p>\u201cJane, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She could feel him, touching her cheeks. As if he were wiping away tears. She knew that she cried. The darkness made her cry. No, it was the hopelessness that did that.</p><p>Slightly rough fingertips brushed her cheeks once more.</p><p>Why could she feel him, but not see him?</p><p>\u201cA r\u00fansearc,\u201d his rumble continued, and the language\u2014did she know it? Yes. It seemed familiar, just as his voice seemed familiar, but the memory was just out of reach.</p><p>As all memories were to her.</p><p>His hands moved to clasp her shoulders. \u201cWake for me. Now.\u201d</p><p>If only she could just open her eyes for him. But it wasn\u2019t that easy to escape the darkness. Not once it had her in its greedy grasp. She hated to sleep. Fought it with every bit of strength that she had.</p><p>To her, the darkness was death.</p><p>No escape.</p><p>His mouth pressed to hers. The touch was electric, sending a sharp pulse of desire straight through her body. His lips brushed against hers, and his tongue slipped into her mouth.</p><p>She awakened with a gasp.</p><p>And he stole that breath, taking it away from her.</p><p>His mouth lingered for an instant. She didn\u2019t fight him, actually, Jane wanted to grab onto Alerac and hold him as tightly as she could.</p><p>He saved me from the dark.</p><p>But then he pulled back.</p><p>She realized that she was on the bed. That big, king-sized bed in the small motel room. He was curled over her, his hands now pressing into the mattress, caging her.</p><p>His gaze\u2014would she ever grow used to that shining green gaze?\u2014pinned her. \u201cYou were crying in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d seen her. When she was so weak. Humiliating. \u201cSorry.\u201d If you don\u2019t want to see me cry, then don\u2019t watch me. She held the words back, for now. Angering the big, bad slayer of vamps probably wasn\u2019t a good idea.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you dream of?\u201d</p><p>Jane shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDid you remember?\u201d Alerac pressed.</p><p>Jane had to laugh. \u201cAll I remember is darkness. Having a voice that can\u2019t scream because it\u2019s broken.\u201d She shoved that darkness from her mind, but she knew it would come back. It always did. \u201cI dream of being forgotten.\u201d Exactly what had happened to her.</p><p>Six months. Her face flashed in the newspaper and on TV. For six months. But no family had come to claim her. No one had come to tell her that she mattered.</p><p>That she was loved.</p><p>Forgotten. Yes, that was exactly what she was.</p><p>Not surprising, really. Why search for a monster?</p><p>\u201cYou were never forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to his.</p><p>The faint lines near his eyes had deepened. \u201cI should have transported you during the day, while you slept but\u2014but you seemed weak.\u201d</p><p>Right. Weak. Wonderful. Just what she wanted to be thought of by this tough, scary guy. Weak probably equaled prey in his eyes.</p><p>His gaze slid over her features. \u201cI thought it would be best if you had a day of sleep. A day to prepare for what will come.\u201d</p><p>That sounded ominous. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>His stare turned away from her as he glanced toward the locked door. \u201cVampires will hunt us in the night, so we must take care.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hand. Curled it around his chin. Forced him to look back and see her. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>Those too-bright eyes seemed to burn through her. \u201cYou tempt much when you touch me. The sheets smell of you. And though you might try to deny it...\u201d He lifted the hand that had cradled his cheek. Brought it to his mouth. Kissed the palm. Lightly licked her.</p><p>Jane shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he said, sounding both satisfied and hungry. \u201cAnd the scent of your desire drives me fuckin\u2019 crazy.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cA werewolf\u2019s senses...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre ten times better than a human\u2019s.\u201d Grim. He licked her palm again. Nipped lightly with his teeth.</p><p>The heat surging through her body had her heart pounding in a double-time beat.</p><p>\u201cSo I know exactly when you get wet for me,\u201d Alerac whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to hide your desire from me.\u201d</p><p>He knew. Horror widened her eyes as they flew back to his.</p> <p>\u201cMy pack is waiting outside.\u201d</p><p>The faint snarl of the motorcycle engines finally penetrated her awareness.</p><p>Oh, crap, if he could scent her desire...could they all?</p><p>Yes. The answer was right there on his face.</p><p>Her own face burned. Talk about humiliating.</p> <p>But Alerac shook his head. \u201cThey know you\u2019re mine,\u201d he said simply. \u201cNone would dare speak ill to you.\u201d</p><p>His. \u201cI\u2019m not...yours, Alerac.\u201d They needed to be clear on that.</p><p>His hold tightened on her hand. \u201cWasn\u2019t that the deal?\u201d He murmured. \u201cYour safety, but in return, I have you.\u201d</p><p>A desperate deal. She hadn\u2019t even realized just what she\u2019d been giving away.</p><p>Had she?</p><p>\u201cYou fear me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be a fool not to.\u201d A werewolf with glowing eyes and razor sharp claws. Um, yes, a smart girl would fear him.</p><p>So would a dumb girl for that matter. So would any freaking one.</p><p>The sound of the snarling engines outside seemed to grow even louder.</p><p>\u201cFear can be a good thing. It will help keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her afraid of him?</p><p>Alerac climbed from the bed. Looked even bigger. She swore the guy had grown while she slept.</p><p>Then she realized that the pillow beside her bore the impression of\u2014of a head. The covers near her were rumpled. She jumped up from that bed. \u201cYou slept with me!\u201d He\u2019d stormed out. Done his angry wolf routine, then he\u2019d come back and crawled in bed with her.</p><p>While she hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been there.</p> <p>\u201cI protected you.\u201d He\u2019d already turned away.</p><p>\u201cProtected me from what? The motel maid?\u201d She rushed after him, but had to do a fast halt when he hurried out of the room. What the hell, Alerac? You don\u2019t leave in the middle of an argument. She yanked on her shoes, adjusted her sleep-wrinkled clothes, and followed fast. \u201cYou crawled into bed with me because\u2014\u201c</p><p>At least six werewolves were on their motorcycles. All of them were staring at her.</p><p>Jane clamped her mouth closed. Jerk wolf.</p><p>Alerac glanced back at her, and a faint smile lifted his lips. \u201cYou were saying, a r\u00fansearc?\u201d</p><p>What she\u2019d been saying would be finished\u2014in private. But her eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d</p><p>That faint smile faded. \u201cIt\u2019s an Irish expression. It means vampire.\u201d</p><p>Liam coughed. Or choked. Hard to tell for sure.</p><p>Alerac eased onto on his motorcycle. Darkness had fallen again, but the moon wasn\u2019t blocked by clouds tonight. It shone, high and heavy, though not quite full, in the sky above them.</p><p>All of the men were staring at her. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cHas she fed?\u201d Finally, that suspicious question came from Liam.</p><p>Her gaze cut to him. \u201cShe can tell you herself.\u201d Her fangs weren\u2019t even aching. She didn\u2019t need blood every day. \u201cAnd the answer is, no. I haven\u2019t fed tonight. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not about to start biting anyone.\u201d</p><p>A murmur\u2014an angry one\u2014seemed to go through the pack.</p><p>\u201cWolves aren\u2019t on the vampire menu,\u201d Liam told her, but only after a quick glance at Alerac. \u201cOr rather, for you, only one is.\u201d</p><p>And that one had lifted his hand toward her. He held that hand, palm open, toward her. \u201cCome, Jane.\u201d</p><p>Like she had a choice. But she wasn\u2019t a dog to be called. So she held her ground a moment longer. Get the point, wolf. I don\u2019t jump at your command. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home.\u201d A pause. \u201cYour home.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a home.</p><p>Her chest began to ache. Unwanted. Forgotten.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe we\u2019ll find a damn witch along the way,\u201d Alerac added, voice darkening.</p><p>Jane wasn\u2019t so sure she wanted to find a witch. Was her past worth remembering?</p><p>Maybe it was time to find out. Alerac knew her, he held her secrets\u2014so why didn\u2019t the guy just spill them? \u201cWhy are my own kind hunting me?\u201d</p><p>His hand lowered. He kicked up the stand on the motorcycle. Then he came to her, easily controlling the bike as he circled around and advanced on her.</p><p>She had to hold back her smile. She\u2019d wanted that. For him to be the one to make the move. I\u2019m not jumping for you.</p><p>But when that big, snarling bike and the equally big wolf came to a stop right in front of her, Jane stiffened. Yes, I\u2019m afraid of him.</p><p>Afraid, yet she could admit\u2014she was also drawn to the wolf. She should be running away from him. But she wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>\u201cThe vamps think you committed a crime against them.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d turned on the other vampires? It just gets worse for me.</p><p>\u201cAnd some of them won\u2019t stop coming, not until\u2014well, not until I make sure they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. \u201cI-I thought vampires already were dead. The undead, right?\u201d That was what she\u2019d seen on TV. She\u2019d made sure to watch every vampire movie that she could find, hoping that maybe she\u2019d find some kind of secret message or insight into her own biology.</p><p>The movies hadn\u2019t been helpful. She didn\u2019t sparkle. She didn\u2019t serve the devil. She didn\u2019t attack children. She didn\u2019t do any of the things that those vamps had done.</p><p>Well, except she did drink blood. But only when she absolutely had to do so.</p><p>\u201cSome folks do have to die, for a little while, in order to come back as vamps.\u201d Alerac gave a slow shake of his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened to you. You never died. You were born as you are.\u201d</p><p>Born as a vampire? That hadn\u2019t been in the movies.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have power to them. Why you\u2019re a threat and why they won\u2019t stop coming.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cYour birthmark. The circle of gold that surrounds your pupils. Those are both signs that you are a pureblood. Not made from a bite, but born to be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>The little mark on her left palm seemed to burn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth. And you have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Like trust was easy. Trusting a human was hard enough. Trusting a werewolf?</p><p>\u201cGet on the bike,\u201d Alerac ordered with a curt nod. \u201cWith darkness, they\u2019ll be coming soon.\u201d</p><p>She looked beyond him. At the thin row of pine trees. At the darkness. Were the vampires already stalking her? \u201cThey all want me dead?\u201d All of her kind? Surely there was at least one who wanted her alive. She had a family somewhere, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Her gaze jumped back to him. \u201cAlerac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw them,\u201d he said, voice devoid of emotion. \u201cThey fired wooden bullets at you.\u201d</p><p>Bullets that he\u2019d taken into his own body as he shielded her.</p><p>\u201cIf those bullets had hit your heart, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d kept her alive before. Her own kind wanted her cold in the ground. But he...</p><p>She climbed on to the bike. Wrapped her arms around him. Held him tight.</p><p>After an instant, his body seemed to relax against hers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a helmet behind you,\u201d he murmured, the words drifting to her over the roar of the bike. \u201cVamps can die if they lose their heads, so, this time, be sure you wear it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. She hadn\u2019t even realized...</p><p>Her hands pulled away from him. Fumbled. She got the helmet on. Then she started to worry. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>He glanced back at her. Those eyes...her shiver seemed to start on the inside and then push its way out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning to lose my head.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but\u2014</p><p>The motorcycle lunged forward. Wind beat against her, and she held on to Alerac as tightly as she could.</p><p>The rest of the pack closed around them as they left the motel. The scream of the engines was soon all that she could hear. The miles passed, and the pavement vanished beneath them as the bikes moved faster and faster.</p><p>The vibration of the bike shook her whole body, beginning first in her legs, then slowly moving up. She pressed closer to Alerac as the vibration continued.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to make of the werewolf.</p><p>A werewolf. The knowledge wasn\u2019t so shocking now. How could it be? He was right. She was a vampire. Not like she could judge.</p><p>If Heath were right, and all Alerac wanted was to kill her\u2014he could have done so plenty of times by this point.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. In fact, he hadn\u2019t hurt her at all.</p><p>He\u2019d protected her. Taken bullets for her. Killed, for her.</p><p>Told me to wear a helmet so that I\u2019d keep my head.</p><p>They\u2019d been lovers once. This knowledge was there. It was obvious from the looks that he gave her. Jane knew there was no denying what she\u2019d seen in his eyes\u2014or the way he\u2019d touched her.</p><p>When he\u2019d whispered Keira to her, she\u2019d realized just how intimately they must have been involved. His voice had burned with desire and a heavy possessiveness.</p><p>Whatever Alerac truly wanted from her, Jane didn\u2019t think it was about her death.</p><p>He might not want to kill her, but the vamps sure seemed to want her out of this world.</p><p>She wanted to know what crimes she\u2019d committed against her own kind. Why they hunted her so fiercely.</p><p>During the six months when she\u2019d felt abandoned because no one had come forward to claim her\u2014well, maybe she should have been relieved. Because if the vamps had gotten to her before Alerac did, would she already be dead?</p><p>The bikes slid into another curve.</p><p>Jane frowned, trying to locate a road sign. She didn\u2019t know if they were in Alabama, Georgia, or even still in Florida.</p><p>Her arms were wrapped around his stomach. The guy\u2019s abs were as hard as a rock. His attention seemed totally on the road. Hell, the guy acted as if he didn\u2019t even realize she was clinging so desperately to him.</p><p>Jane started to ease her hold.</p><p>His right hand lifted and immediately curled around her thigh.</p><p>His fingers pressed into her.</p><p>The touch heated her. No, he heated her. The awareness that she had for him wasn\u2019t natural. She recognized that. Fear shouldn\u2019t be so tangled with desire, but it was.</p><p>She looked at him, and she feared.</p><p>She looked at him, and she wanted.</p><p>The vibration of that bike continued, making her body too hyperaware and sensitive. Her thighs were aching. And she could all too easily imagine those strong fingers of his sliding between her legs.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. Her breath was coming too hard and heavy and her\u2014her fangs were growing.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><p>She rarely fed.</p><p>Her fangs shouldn\u2019t be coming out. She\u2019d worked hard to control them. She\u2019d wanted to blend with the humans. Not freak them out.</p><p>But her fangs kept burning as they stretched in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSt-stop,\u201d she managed to push the words out.</p><p>Because something was wrong.</p><p>He didn\u2019t slow.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She yelled to him. \u201cYou have to stop!\u201d Because a hunger was building within her, one that was making her body shake.</p><p>A hunger for his blood.</p><p>She wanted to bite. To sink her fangs into him and taste the werewolf. And that was wrong. As wrong as the desire that kept stirring within her.</p><p>A desire to be taken by him\u2014rough and wild and hard.</p><p>To be claimed by the man that she didn\u2019t even know.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t let her off that motorcycle\u2014right freaking then\u2014she was going to give in to dark impulses and bite him.</p><p>So much for being all confident with Liam and saying that she wasn\u2019t looking for blood. All she could think about right then was getting a drink from Alerac. Sinking her teeth into him. Tasting him.</p><p>Heath told me never to take directly from a living human. He said I\u2019d lose control. That I\u2019d kill.</p><p>But Alerac wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>The motorcycle slowed. Finally. Yes! Before it had even come to a full stop, she jumped from the bike and tried to put some much needed distance between her and her companion.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>She stood on the side of a highway. Underneath the twisting branches of a heavy oak tree. Her right hand was over her mouth. She\u2019d slapped it over her fangs, horrified, because they were fully extended.</p><p>He shoved down the kickstand and stalked toward her. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop. They\u2019re tracking us.\u201d</p><p>Yes, true. But she couldn\u2019t get on that bike with him. There was no way Jane could be that close to him without biting. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shot rang out. Even as it thundered, Jane saw Alerac lunge toward her. His body hit hers\u2014but he hit her an instant too late. Pain spread through her upper chest.</p><p>She and Alerac slammed into the ground.</p><p>Her shirt was wet. She hurt.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s hands were on her. \u201cNot your heart,\u201d he growled. Begged? \u201cNot your heart...\u201d</p><p>No, no, her heart was still racing frantically. The shooter had missed her heart, thanks to Alerac and his fast reflexes.</p><p>The bullet hadn\u2019t driven into her heart, but it had still penetrated deeply in her chest. And she was bleeding. So much blood pumped from her.</p><p>\u201cFind them!\u201d Alerac shouted as his head jerked up. \u201cKill them! Every last one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Her blood was on his hands. Again.</p><p>Her breath rasped out, and her eyes\u2014so afraid\u2014stared up at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alerac had taken her into the woods. Gotten her protection while his men hunted.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet is still in you.\u201d It had to come out. She would keep bleeding\u2014she wouldn\u2019t be able to heal\u2014until he got it out of her.</p><p>\u201cThen...get me to a doctor. A doctor can get it out!\u201d Her words rushed out in a whisper.</p> <p>Jaw clenching, he shook his head.</p><p>He could see every inch of her so perfectly in that darkness. His eyes were a gift and a curse. He could see the terror streaking across her face and the blood that soaked her shirt.</p><p>There was so much that she just didn\u2019t seem to understand about her kind. Softly, Alerac told her, \u201cVampires can die from blood loss.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her die before him.</p><p>She shook her head. Her back was against an old oak tree. \u201cGet me to a doctor, Alerac.\u201d Her voice hardened. \u201cHe\u2019ll stop the blood.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, but that would give them another problem. \u201cHuman doctors can\u2019t find out what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-Heath...he knows. He kept my secret...\u201d Pain threaded through her voice.</p><p>Heath. Alerac planned to deal with that human. \u201cHe didn\u2019t keep any secret for you. He sold you out.\u201d His claws pushed from his fingertips, and, carefully, he sliced open the top of her shirt. \u201cAnd other humans would do the same. They aren\u2019t going to protect a vamp.\u201d</p><p>Her hands came up and pushed against him. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. \u201cIt has to come out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. There was so much fear in her gaze. \u201cN-not here. You can\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>Howls echoed around them as his pack tracked their prey. There were no more gunshots. Just those howls. The fools who\u2019d tried to hurt Jane would be running.</p><p>Or they\u2019d be dying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the bullet out, and then your body will heal.\u201d He tried to keep his voice calm. Hard, when he wanted to bellow his fury.</p><p>\u201cHeal?\u201d Jane whispered. \u201cI need to be sewn up! Once I\u2019m sewn up, I\u2019ll heal!\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the way it worked for her. Alerac suspected that Heath had deliberately kept Jane in the dark about the extent of her vampire powers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream,\u201d he told her. The way she was bleeding...it was too much. He couldn\u2019t afford to waste any additional time.</p><p>He took a deep breath, inhaled the scent of her blood, and then his fingers slipped inside of her wound.</p><p>She gasped as her body tensed.</p> <p>He had to use his claws. Fuck, he had to use his claws on her in order to get to that bullet.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, a r\u00fansearc.</p><p>He glanced up at her face. Saw a tear leak down her cheek.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t making any sounds. Wasn\u2019t moving at all. She\u2019d frozen against that tree, as he cut into her.</p><p>They will pay. They will beg for death.</p><p>He had the bullet. It was still intact. He pulled it from her, slowly, carefully.</p><p>Smoke curled around his fingertips.</p><p>As soon as his hand left her body, Jane\u2019s breath choked out.</p><p>He stared at the bullet for an instant, ignoring the slight burn in his fingers. Not wood.</p><p>Silver.</p><p>The shot hadn\u2019t been meant for Jane. You didn\u2019t shoot a vampire with silver.</p><p>He\u2019d rushed to knock her out of the way because he\u2019d thought that she was the intended target.</p><p>It was me.</p><p>Instead of saving her, he\u2019d gotten her shot.</p><p>\u201cW-when do I start to heal?\u201d Her voice was weaker than it had been before.</p><p>He threw the bullet away. \u201cIt will start almost instantly now.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps thundered toward them.</p><p>He spun, surging up to his feet.</p><p>Liam stood there, a pair of jeans hanging low on his hips. \u201cThey\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cThere were two,\u201d Liam said, his gaze darting to the ground behind Alerac. To Jane. \u201cBoth vamps. I took them out.\u201d</p><p>Even after two centuries, they were still trying to take her away from him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t stop again,\u201d Alerac said, his hands clenching into fists. Her blood is on me. \u201cUntil we\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded.</p><p>\u201cAl-Alerac?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, he turned back toward her.</p><p>\u201cWh-when do I start healing?\u201d Jane asked again. Her voice was so faint, so lost.</p><p>And...and the bleeding hadn\u2019t stopped. If anything, it seemed to have gotten worse.</p><p>He fell to his knees beside her.</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d Liam stood over him. \u201cUh, should it?\u201d</p><p>No, no. \u201cYou drank blood last night.\u201d He\u2019d seen the blood bag. She\u2019d taken it\u2014</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cI told you I...hadn\u2019t fed...didn\u2019t get the chance...before you showed up.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. \u201cHow long has it been since you took blood?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Licked her lips. \u201cA few weeks. I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t drink much. I don\u2019t like\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what you like, princess,\u201d Liam muttered and even he sounded worried now. \u201cIt\u2019s about what will keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze was on Alerac. \u201cI feel so weak.\u201d</p><p>Because she was. She was bleeding out right in front of him. Dying, while he watched.</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>Alerac put his wrist to her mouth. \u201cDrink from me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull away. There was no place for her to go.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me. You need fresh blood. It will heal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I would heal when the bullet was gone.\u201d Her lashes swept down, hiding her gaze from him. \u201cI can\u2019t...drink. Not straight from...anyone. H-Heath said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew what Heath said!\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. Drinking straight from a source is what you do.\u201d Okay, maybe that wasn\u2019t totally true, but he wasn\u2019t about to go into the finer points of vampire lifestyle while she bled out in front of him. She needed blood. She was going to get it.</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t...\u201d Jane said, her words even weaker.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t drink,\u201d Liam cut in, his voice cold and hard, \u201cthen you\u2019ll die. The bleeding is too heavy. Vamps tend to bleed too much anyway. If it can\u2019t stop, then you\u2019ll die under that tree.\u201d</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t. If he had to force Jane to take his blood, then Alerac would do it. There was no way that he\u2019d lose her.</p><p>Her laughter was bitter, broken. Too weak. \u201cI can\u2019t...because I don\u2019t know...h-how!\u201d</p><p>His heart slammed into his ribs.</p><p>\u201cMy f-fangs...they aren\u2019t out. They were...b-before. That was why I...stopped...\u201d Her words were so low that, if it hadn\u2019t been for his enhanced hearing, Alerac might have missed them. \u201cI-I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He had his own fangs. Fangs and claws. Alerac used the claws on his right hand to slice across his left wrist. Then, before she could argue with him, he put his wrist to her mouth. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDrink or die,\u201d Liam told her, edging ever closer.</p><p>Her lips trembled against his wrist, the movement soft like a butterfly\u2019s wings. Her mouth opened. She\u2014</p><p>Tasted him.</p><p>It had been so long since she\u2019d drank from him. Too fuckin\u2019 long.</p><p>Her tongue licked over his skin.</p><p>His cock stretched, ached. Too long.</p><p>How many nights had he dreamed of her? How many times had he woken, reaching for her? Always searching, but never finding her.</p><p>He had her now.</p><p>Her fangs pierced his skin.</p><p>He shuddered. A growl rumbled in his throat. Her fangs might not have been out moments before, but they were sure there now. She was drinking from him, taking him into her body.</p><p>It was more than just blood.</p><p>Life.</p><p>He wanted her. Wanted to thrust deep into her even as she drank from him.</p><p>Some mistakenly believed that a vampire\u2019s bite was about pain and degradation.</p><p>He\u2019d believed that.</p><p>Until her.</p><p>Until he\u2019d learned of the pleasure that a bite could bring. A release damn close to the one he had from sex. Pleasure that shook his body, that consumed.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice. Worried. Angry.</p><p>Because she had taken so much from him.</p><p>He wanted to give her more.</p><p>No, he wanted Liam gone, he wanted Jane naked, and he wanted to be the one biting.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019ve become. Soon enough, she would.</p><p>\u201cStop her, Alerac,\u201d Liam ordered fiercely. \u201cStop her.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Alerac turned his head. Met Liam\u2019s gaze. \u201cWait for us by the motorcycles.\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Alerac held his gaze. \u201cWait for us.\u201d</p><p>The werewolf gave a jerky nod, then turned and stalked away.</p><p>When he was gone. Alerac looked stared back at Jane. Her lashes swept over her cheeks. Her hands had risen so that her fingers curled around his arm.</p><p>She was taking his blood, drinking it so eagerly when she\u2019d been hesitant before.</p><p>He fuckin\u2019 wanted her.</p><p>Her lashes slowly lifted. There was a faint shine in her eyes, one that hadn\u2019t been there before. The power that was inside her, trying to come out.</p><p>Hell, yes.</p><p>Her gaze held his. Her tongue slid over his skin and\u2014</p><p>Horror widened her eyes. She pushed his hand away from her mouth even as she leapt to her feet.</p><p>A very fast move. Her strength was back.</p><p>And her wound had closed.</p><p>He rose slowly, aware that his jeans were far too damn tight around his cock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d She\u2019d put her hands over her mouth\u2014over those delicate fangs\u2014and the words came out as a mumble.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be sorry for what you are.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d once cursed what she was, and he was glad that she didn\u2019t have that memory.</p><p>Memory.</p><p>Alerac stiffened.</p><p>In the heat of the moment, he\u2019d forgotten one of the most important parts of a vampire\u2019s power.</p><p>When a vampire drank blood, it wasn\u2019t just about getting a rush of strength. When a vampire drank blood straight from a victim, he or she also tapped into that person\u2019s memories.</p><p>Will she see my memories?</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t have memories of her own, and he wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted her to see what he\u2019d done with his life. She already feared him enough.</p><p>Her hands slowly fell back to her sides. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I-I took too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes more than that to weaken me.\u201d Did she hear the rough edge of desire in his words?</p><p>Her gaze drifted over him. Down, down, then her stare jumped right back up to hold his.</p><p>His smile was grim. \u201cThe bite just made me want you more.\u201d</p><p>She backed up a step. Rammed into that oak tree.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, a r\u00fansearc, I won\u2019t take you here.\u201d</p><p>Another quick step back. \u201cYou aren\u2019t taking me anywhere!\u201d Jane fired at him.</p><p>Yes, he was. But there was a time and a place for everything. \u201cOur enemies are growing closer. I want you at my home, where I know we have the advantage.\u201d</p><p>His wrist seemed to throb where she\u2019d taken his blood. He could almost still feel her mouth on him.</p><p>It made him remember the first time that his vampiress\u2019 s fangs had pierced his flesh. She\u2019d been scared then. Scared but aroused.</p><p>\u201cYou looked the same way then,\u201d the words came from him, unplanned.</p><p>Jane stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to drink from me then, either, but your fangs came out.\u201d They\u2019d been kissing. He\u2019d had her naked in his arms. For vampires, physical lust and bloodlust were so tangled together. Her fangs had come out. He\u2019d wanted her bite.</p><p>And, after she\u2019d bitten him, then he\u2019d wanted everything from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened after I bit you?\u201d Her voice was soft. Husky. Temptation in the dark.</p><p>He turned away from her. \u201cWe fucked.\u201d</p><p>A twig snapped behind him.</p><p>\u201cStop backing away,\u201d he muttered without looking over his shoulder. The woman was always pulling away from him. \u201cWe need to get on the bikes and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Her footsteps didn\u2019t follow his. He squared his shoulders. Waited. \u201cJane...\u201d</p><p>Then he heard the whisper of her footstep. One. Then another. She crept toward him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Incredibly soft.</p><p>Now he did look back. Curiosity had always been a weakness of his.</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life.\u201d Her lips lifted in a small curve. \u201cTwice now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d also cost this woman her life. \u201cSave your thanks. That\u2019s not what I want.\u201d But he found himself reaching for her hand. Pulling her with him. Keeping her by his side.</p><p>They broke from the trees. The others turned to look at them. They\u2019d all know what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Werewolves weren\u2019t supposed to offer themselves up as prey to vampires.</p><p>Jane wasn\u2019t any vampire.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>His stare swept the men. No one spoke. No one questioned him.</p><p>They knew better.</p><p>Alerac stalked toward his bike. The scent of Jane\u2014her blood\u2014followed him.</p><p>Jaw locking, he reached into his saddle-bag and pulled out an extra shirt for her.</p><p>Then, making sure he shielded her with his body, he ordered, \u201cTake off your top.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped.</p><p>He smiled. She was just so damn cute.</p><p>\u201cThe shirt and the bra.\u201d</p><p>She edged closer to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vamps will follow the scent of your blood. So we need to leave as much of that scent behind as we can.\u201d Or, even better, maybe they could use that scent to lead the vamps on a false trail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jane grabbed for the top he offered. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go into the woods and change. I won\u2019t do some kind of peep show for your pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t see you.\u201d Not with his body blocking hers. \u201cAnd we need to move.\u201d They\u2019d lost too much time already. Granted, that was his fault. He\u2019d been too taken with her. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t learned a damn thing from the mistakes of his past.</p><p>She stood on her toes. Glanced over his shoulder. \u201cMake them all turn away.\u201d</p> <p>Fine. \u201cTurn the fuck away,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>He knew they would.</p><p>She clenched the cloth in her hands. \u201cNow you turn away, too.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cTurn. Away.\u201d</p> <p>He turned. Crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you naked before.\u201d</p><p>Her clothing rustled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t seeing me naked now.\u201d</p><p>A challenge? His lips curved. \u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. He heard the slight sound. His smile stretched.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her. His shirt swallowed her, but at least the blood was gone.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to clean off my skin with my old top. A little blood is left, not much though.\u201d</p><p>He jumped onto the bike. \u201cFinn,\u201d he called out. A wolf with dark red hair drove his motorcycle closer. \u201cTake this to the east. Give \u2018em a trail to follow, then meet back up with us at base.\u201d</p><p>Finn took the material from him. Rode off without a word.</p><p>Alerac reeved the motorcycle. Jane took up a position behind him. She wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cCloser.\u201d A growl.</p><p>She slid closer.</p><p>Much better.</p><p>\u201cBe prepared for another attack!\u201d Alerac called out. Those hunting them weren\u2019t going to stop.</p> <p>Not until Alerac saw them all cold in the ground.</p><p>The two vampires had been ripped apart.</p><p>Breath heaving, rage nearly blinding him, Lorcan stared down at their remains.</p><p>They\u2019d died too quickly. They should have suffered.</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s still alive.\u201d The human\u2019s voice came from behind him.</p><p>Lorcan whirled toward him.</p><p>Heath frowned at him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t. Some plans could come back and twist and\u2014bite you in the ass.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Jane dead.\u201d The words were clipped. \u201cAlerac had better keep her alive.\u201d</p><p>Heath edged back a step. The glimpse into the human\u2019s mind had been very interesting. Traitors had been revealed. Secrets uncovered.</p><p>Lorcan wasn\u2019t the only one with enemies stalking him in the night. Alerac had his share, too.</p><p>Foolish wolf. When would he learn? Trust no one in this world.</p><p>Even your own blood would turn on you.</p><p>\u201cWh-what do you want me to do?\u201d Heath asked him as he squared his shoulders. \u201cI told you, I want to help Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a lie.\u201d Lorcan was tired of the lies. What did they matter? \u201cYou want immortality. Jane won\u2019t give it to you.\u201d He titled his head to the right as he studied the man. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYou can be useful to me, doctor. You can help me get what I need. If you do, then I\u2019ll give you exactly what you have coming to you.\u201d</p><p>Heath nodded quickly.</p><p>The werewolves would attack instantly if they were confronted by a vampire. But if a human came calling...</p><p>Lorcan smiled. This human would definitely prove to be useful. And, when that usefulness was at an end, he would die.</p><p>Dawn was coming. Jane saw the faint streaks of gold and red across the sky. She tensed, her hands tightening around Alerac. \u201cWe need to stop!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He\u2019d heard her, hadn\u2019t he? With his shifter hearing, he must have.</p><p>But she still tried again, \u201cWe need to stop!\u201d</p><p>The first time she\u2019d gone out in the sunlight, Jane had been hit with a lethargy so strong that she\u2019d almost keeled over. When day came, she just got weak. No other way to describe it. Her body wanted to shut down and curl in on itself. There was no way she could stay upright on that bike during the day.</p><p>The bike began to slow. They were nearing a rest area. A deserted looking place. He eased into the parking lot, and the other pack members fell in behind him.</p><p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t burn in the sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she muttered. She\u2019d discovered that TV myth just fine on her own.</p><p>He shut off the bike.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me...weak.\u201d A stark confession. She was sure that lethargy would hit her any moment. She needed a place to crash.</p><p>\u201cYou have my blood. You\u2019ll be stronger now.\u201d He seemed so certain. She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Jane hopped off the bike. Took off her helmet. She started to walk toward the shelter of the rest area.</p><p>Alerac caught her hand in his. \u201cI know more about vampires than you do.\u201d</p><p>He knew more about everything than she did, and that fact pissed her off. She was walking blindly, and she hated it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close to my home. Just a few more hours to go.\u201d</p><p>The sun was stretching higher into the sky with each moment that passed. The weakness hadn\u2019t started.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>\u201cA few more hours in sunlight,\u201d she muttered as she tried to tug her hand from his. \u201cI don\u2019t want that, okay? I don\u2019t want to fall off the bike. Don\u2019t want to slam into the pavement and have you drag the poor, beaten vampire away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d A pause, then he said, \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>She stopped tugging her hand and stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Good. Because she was shaking in her shoes.</p><p>\u201cBut my blood is in you now. Werewolf blood is very strong. It\u2019s going to protect you.\u201d He kept staring into her eyes. \u201cTrust me.\u201d Then he pulled her straight into the faint sunlight.</p><p>She expected the lethargy, the weakness to hit her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI told you, my blood protects you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. The sunlight was warm on her skin, and she didn\u2019t feel the usual weakness. Not even a little.</p><p>His gaze seemed to see right into her soul. \u201cYou have nothing to fear from me.\u201d</p><p>In that instant, standing in the sunlight, strength still coursing through her, she almost believed him. But deep inside, a soft voice whispered...</p><p>He lies.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the man who took Jane.\u201d</p><p>Hannah Wylee frowned across the bar. The place should have been closed. It was long past dawn, and she should be at home, sleeping.</p><p>But just as she\u2019d been ready to leave, he\u2019d come in.</p><p>Tall. Muscled. With icy eyes that seemed to see right through her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even remember when everyone else had left. Didn\u2019t remember how she\u2019d wound up alone with him in that empty place.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he repeated the name softly. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Hannah shook her head. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Jane had run off, left without a word. Damn inconvenience. Now she\u2019d have to get another waitress. She\u2019d tried to call Heath and ram into him about Jane. Talk about ungrateful. After all she\u2019d done for the woman. But Heath had been dodging her.</p><p>Probably because he knew how pissed she was.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else was here, someone was after Jane.\u201d His voice seemed to pour into Hannah.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. She felt like they\u2019d been talking about Jane for a long time, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Hannah,\u201d he murmured. There was no accent in his voice. Just darkness. \u201cBut I will, if you don\u2019t tell me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>His words should have terrified her, yet she found there was no room for terror. She felt frozen. No, she was frozen. Hannah couldn\u2019t make herself move.</p><p>And he was coming ever closer to her.</p><p>He lifted his hand. His fingers curled around her neck. \u201cThe last night that Jane was here, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-a man came in.\u201d She remembered that. That guy had filled the doorway, catching her eyes. Big and rough\u2014scary. \u201cI think Jane ran from him.\u201d</p><p>Those fingers tightened on her throat. \u201cWhat did his eyes look like?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, searching her memory. \u201cHe...he had on glasses.\u201d Sunglasses, inside the bar. More memories pushed through her mind. \u201cI sent my bouncers after him.\u201d No one messed with her staff.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy took \u2018em down.\u201d She\u2019d had to fire them. What good were bouncers who couldn\u2019t control one guy?</p><p>His hold was heavy on her throat. \u201cAnd did he hurt Jane?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, or tried to. \u201cShe left. Ran out the front. Alone.\u201d Hannah thought that was the truth. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away from him.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHannah, I need to know the truth. Don\u2019t worry, it will only hurt for a moment.\u201d</p><p>He was beautiful. Gorgeous. The best-looking man she\u2019d ever seen. And something was wrong with her. He\u2019d done something to her, she knew he had. Because she wouldn\u2019t have told him so much about Jane. Wouldn\u2019t have shut herself in there alone with him.</p><p>What did he do?</p><p>She forced herself to speak. \u201cWh-what will hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to strangle her. But his head ducked toward her throat. Something sharp sliced across her jugular.</p><p>Hannah didn\u2019t even have the chance to scream.</p><p>It was cold. The air had grown increasingly chilled as they drove\u2014drove up higher and higher into the mountains.</p><p>Alerac had given her a jacket that he\u2019d taken from his saddle-bag. Leather. One that smelled of him. One that made her feel strangely comforted.</p><p>Just as he did.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t burned in the sunlight.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even felt weak.</p><p>His blood? Yes, it had to be.</p><p>I drank from him. The knowledge should have horrified her. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>Up, up, they went, until it seemed that they were in the very clouds. Dark clouds that threatened a coming storm.</p><p>They\u2019d stopped only to refuel. Kept driving and driving. It had been more than just a few hours.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Heavy gates swung shut behind them. Iron. Clanging closed.</p><p>Alerac turned off his motorcycle. \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>Home.</p><p>She stared up at the heavy structure. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. Made of thick, white stones, the massive house seemed to spring right from the mountain. Glass windows looked out into the coming night. Bright lights shone from within.</p><p>Her werewolf lived...here?</p><p>The cold air chilled her lungs as she moved away from the bike. There were a few other houses, much smaller, nestled along the mountain. Homes for his pack members?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She truly wanted to believe him.</p><p>But when she looked into his eyes, they were hot and hard. Hungry. For her.</p><p>They were on his turf, and he\u2019d already told her exactly what he wanted. The price she had to pay for the safety he provided.</p><p>Could she pay that price?</p><p>He took her hand. Since she couldn\u2019t very well just stand there in the growing cold, she followed him. The other werewolves dispersed, heading toward the other houses. Then she and Alerac were inside.</p><p>The first thing that Jane noticed was the fire. It blazed in a massive fireplace. Her gaze slowly slid away from the flames, and Jane saw a winding staircase that led up to the higher levels of the house. It looked like there were at least two more floors up there.</p><p>\u201cYour bedroom is at the top of the stairs.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cMy room?\u201d Just to be clear.</p><p>\u201cOur room,\u201d he corrected as he raised one brow.</p><p>So he was still holding to that.</p><p>The door swung open behind them. Jane turned so see Liam heading inside. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like we were followed, yet.\u201d</p><p>Alerac inclined his head. \u201cThey\u2019ll come calling soon enough. We\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d</p><p>The fire wasn\u2019t chasing away the chill in her bones. \u201cWhy is it that they want me dead?\u201d Betrayal, check. But it was time for her to get some specifics. If she was going to be hunted every minute, Jane figured that she deserved to know why.</p><p>\u201cRest.\u201d Alerac glanced toward the stairs. \u201cThen you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Screw resting. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have any memories?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at Liam. \u201cCall in the debts we have. See if you can find me a witch.\u201d</p><p>Again with the witch talk. That talk made her nervous, but she pushed on, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember anything? We\u2019re here, we\u2019re supposedly safe. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>Liam hurried into another room. She thought he muttered something like \u201cGood luck with that,\u201d on his way out.</p><p>Alerac waited until Liam was gone, then he put his hand to Jane\u2019s back and guided her a little closer to the fire. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember because you were made to forget.\u201d His eyes were on her. Blazing now\u2014brighter than the flames in that fireplace, and his eyes fully showed a stark, desperate need. \u201cThe vampire clan leader, Lorcan Teague, wanted you to forget me, so he made a witch put you under a spell.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was pounding faster. Shaking her chest. Her fingers had a nervous tremble. \u201cYou said...I know we were lovers.\u201d</p><p>That need got even sharper. Jane caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cWe were.\u201d His eyes held her trapped. \u201cBut werewolves and vampires aren\u2019t supposed to mate. We\u2019re supposed to fight. To hate. To kill one another.\u201d His fingers skimmed over her cheek. \u201cNot to fuck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, now the fire was a little too hot. Or maybe she was a little too hot. Jane edged back.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to be together,\u201d Alerac continued, and his fingers brushed back her hair. \u201cAnd Lorcan wanted to make sure that when you were free, you didn\u2019t remember me.\u201d</p><p>His head bent.</p> <p>She tensed.</p><p>His lips brushed over her throat.</p><p>A shiver slid over her. That shiver had nothing to do with nervousness and everything to do with desire. Her sex was suddenly aching. Her nipples were tight. When she\u2019d taken his blood before, it had been as if a gate had broken open inside of her. She\u2019d been flooded with emotion. Need.</p><p>Lust.</p><p>For him.</p> <p>\u201cThe bastard thought I\u2019d be long dead by the time you were free. That you wouldn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d done.\u201d His voice roughened even more. \u201cI showed him.\u201d Another sensual press of his lips along her throat.</p><p>Her knees were starting to feel funny. \u201cWhy would you be...long dead?\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. \u201cWerewolves aren\u2019t immortal.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never get used to those glowing eyes. Eyes that saw in to her.</p><p>\u201cYou were locked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked away?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where. I couldn\u2019t find you. I looked and I looked, but you were gone.\u201d</p><p>Her lips had turned desert dry. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d demanded the truth, but in that instant, Jane didn\u2019t think she wanted to hear\u2014</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred years.\u201d</p><p>No, she definitely hadn\u2019t wanted to hear that truth.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Jane was in his home. Where he could keep her safe.</p><p>He could hear the rush of the shower\u2019s water pounding down on her. After he\u2019d told her that she\u2019d been imprisoned for over two hundred years, he\u2019d expected more questions. Instead, she\u2019d turned and headed up the stairs without a word.</p> <p>He\u2019d followed her.</p><p>He felt like he was always fuckin\u2019 following her.</p><p>She won\u2019t get away again.</p><p>He stood before the closed bathroom door. Jane was inside. Naked.</p><p>He\u2019d stripped off his own shirt. Now he wore only a pair of loose jeans that hung on his hips.</p><p>Did Jane realize just how delicate his control was? Probably not. She didn\u2019t seem to understand just how desperately his beast wanted her.</p><p>His wolf had been denied its mate for far too long.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be denied any longer.</p><p>The water stopped.</p><p>Rustles. Whispers.</p><p>Move away. It would be wise to move away from the door. To give her some space, but...</p><p>The wolf within him wasn\u2019t letting him move. The man was at the end of his rope. Too hungry for her. Too desperate to reclaim what had been stolen from him.</p><p>No, he shouldn\u2019t have lived for two hundred years. But he hadn\u2019t been about to give up.</p><p>Sometimes, you didn\u2019t realize what you had until it was gone.</p><p>The door creaked open.</p><p>Jane stood there, clad only in her towel.</p><p>Once you realized just how valuable some things\u2014some people\u2014were, you\u2019d fight even the devil to get them back.</p><p>For her, he\u2019d fight anyone. Everyone.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to find his. \u201cAlerac...\u201d</p><p>He reached for her. Kissed her before she could speak again. He loved her taste. It drove him wild.</p><p>Her skin was soft beneath his hands. Still wet from the shower. He wanted to lick that skin. He wanted to lick every single inch of her body.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>He\u2019d never claimed her as his mate before. He wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake again.</p><p>He lifted her up against him. Held her easily in his arms. She was so small and delicate. When they\u2019d first met, and she\u2019d still been more human than vampire, that delicacy had scared him.</p><p>She\u2019d been too breakable.</p><p>He\u2019d waited to take her then, so desperate for her to change and become a full vampire\u2014so that he couldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>A werewolf\u2019s passion wasn\u2019t an easy thing. Rough. Wild. Savage.</p><p>After waiting for so long now, that savagery was just beneath his surface.</p><p>His claws wanted to come out. He wanted to snarl and howl and take.</p><p>But the man held onto control. Barely.</p><p>He carried her toward the bed. Put her on the heavy covers. Pulled back to stare down at her.</p><p>Did she want him? He inhaled, desperate to see\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel this way?\u201d Her voice was a husky stroke right over his skin. \u201cNo matter what happened before, I shouldn\u2019t want you this badly.\u201d</p><p>Yes, you should. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with desire.\u201d Not a damn thing.</p><p>Her wet hair spread behind her on the bed. The towel was knotted between her breasts.</p><p>She stared up at him. Her eyes were so blue. As blue as the skies over Ireland, the home she\u2019d once had. \u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>You did. \u201cThen get to know me.\u201d At first, he\u2019d wanted her to get all of her memories back. But now, in truth, there were parts of their past that he never wanted her to remember. Selfish? Yeah, but it would be easier to forget those parts.</p><p>The betrayals. The lies.</p><p>He reached for her hand. Brought it to his lips. He kissed her knuckles and turned her hand over so that he could score his teeth over her palm.</p><p>Her breath hissed out.</p><p>\u201cYour body knows me, and I know it.\u201d That towel needs to come off. He had to make this good for her, before the beast took over for him.</p><p>Too long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of you in this bed.\u201d A stark confession from him.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cI never have dreams. Only darkness.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d lost his sight, she\u2019d been the only light in his darkness.</p><p>He licked her palm. Then Alerac inhaled the tempting scent of her arousal. She wanted him. She feared him, but she wanted him.</p><p>He put her hand back on the bed. Let his fingers trail up the silken skin of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cJ-just so you know...\u201d she told him, watching him with desire shadowing her eyes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t because I owe you for my life.\u201d</p><p>His fingers eased up a few more inches, pushing away that towel. \u201cThen what is it about?\u201d</p><p>She rasped out a quick breath. \u201cDesire.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was well acquainted with desire.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not natural, the way I feel about you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t want you this much.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she should. \u201cMaybe your body just remembers what your mind can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>The one word had his head jerking up. If she was telling him to stop, to back away, he would.</p><p>For her, he\u2019d do anything.</p><p>But then she said, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>She fuckin\u2019 broke his heart. The heart too many had tried to carve right out of his chest. The heart he\u2019d given to her two centuries before.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Then he was unknotting that towel. Peeling it away from her body. She was just as she\u2019d been in his dreams. Those perfect, round breasts with their pink-tipped nipples. The soft curve of her stomach. The lush flare of her hips.</p><p>The temptation of her sex\u2014soft and pink and waiting.</p><p>He bent his head and took a breast between his lips. Licking. Sucking. Tasting. The nipple was hard and tight and he loved the way she gasped and arched toward him.</p><p>He kept tasting her, sampling her, even as his fingers slid down her stomach and pushed between her legs.</p><p>She was wet for him.</p><p>Already.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Her hands were on his back, her nails lightly raking over his skin. He\u2019d wanted her touch for too long.</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut as he kissed his way down her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAlerac?\u201d</p><p>He kept kissing her. He\u2019d taste the need she had for him. He\u2019d make sure to give her pleasure before the beast broke free.</p><p>Her pleasure mattered. If he made it good enough for him, maybe she\u2019d stay, once she learned the truth.</p><p>He\u2019d seduced her to his side before.</p><p>Can I do it again?</p><p>His hands pushed her legs apart. Her scent\u2014so good\u2014was making him light-headed with raw need and lust. He stroked her with his fingers, learning the secrets of her sex once more. Her hips rose helplessly toward him.</p><p>Her body tightened.</p><p>He put his mouth on her. He damn well feasted.</p><p>She jerked beneath him. Tried to pull away.</p><p>\u201cAlerac\u2014it\u2019s too much!\u201d</p><p>No, not even close.</p><p>He used his lips and his tongue and he worked that sweet flesh until he knew that her release was at hand. He could feel it approaching in the stiffness of her body, the gasps that broke from her mouth.</p><p>He pushed his finger into her. Licked the center of her need.</p><p>Jane came against his mouth.</p><p>The taste of her pleasure broke his control.</p><p>He surged back over her. When she reached for him, Alerac grabbed her wrists and pinned her hands to the bed. He could see the edge of her fangs peeking out behind her red lips. Her eyes were shining with pleasure.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>He drove into her, plunging as deep as he could go, lost to everything but her. The bed heaved beneath them. The slats groaned as he thrust. Faster. Harder.</p><p>A growl built in his throat. The wolf was pushing through his control, demanding that he mark the mate he\u2019d lost so long ago.</p><p>He wanted to put his teeth on her, right there where her neck curved into her shoulder. The bite would claim her. Show all others that Jane belonged only to him.</p><p>And it would give him her blood. The powerful, intoxicating blood that had first addicted him.</p><p>His canines were burning in his mouth. Stretching. Sharpening. He parted his lips. Put his mouth right over that sweet spot. He sucked the flesh.</p><p>A choked scream came from Jane as she bucked beneath him. Another release. Pleasure that shuddered through her\u2014through him.</p><p>Don\u2019t bite her. Not yet. Not. Yet.</p><p>He yanked his mouth away from her and erupted into the core of her body. The pleasure was more than he remembered. Stronger. Consuming. Obliterating all that had come before.</p><p>Linking them.</p><p>Bonding them.</p><p>His heartbeat thundered in his ears, a mad drumbeat that wouldn\u2019t slow. Sweat slickened his back as he slowly lifted his head.</p><p>He stared down at Jane, lost.</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re still doing it,\u201d she whispered, her words a husky tremble.</p><p>His brows lifted. His cock was in her body, sated, but...I want more of her. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-looking at me...like you could devour me...\u201d</p><p>He smiled. That was exactly what he wanted to do.</p><p>Alerac began to thrust again.</p><p>Her legs curled around his.</p><p>She met him.</p><p>The pleasure rose once more.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dream of darkness.</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d crawled out of that swamp, Jane dreamed of blood.</p><p>Rivers of blood, enough to choke her. To drown her.</p><p>She saw men in an old chamber, a room made of stone. A fire flickered in a hearth. Voices were shouting.</p><p>Don\u2019t kill him!</p><p>The voice that made that desperate plea...that voice sounds like me.</p><p>The chamber vanished. She never saw who was being killed there. Jane was too busy staring at a new scene.</p><p>A dungeon. Two men were chained to the walls. When their heads turned, she realized that they weren\u2019t men.</p><p>Vampires.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this...\u201d One hissed.</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d Alerac said and\u2014</p><p>Wait, Alerac? In that instant, Jane realized that she was seeing these images from Alerac\u2019s point of view. She almost seemed to be inside of Alerac and looking out at the world from his eyes.</p><p>Even as Jane made that realization, the river of blood deepened. Alerac sank his teeth into the vampire\u2019s throat and he fed.</p><p>The vampire died moments later, horror and shock still on his face.</p><p>Then Alerac turned to the next vampire.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d The vampire shouted, fear making his eyes flare wide. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there! I don\u2019t know where she is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you were there,\u201d Alerac\u2019s voice seemed to boom all around her. \u201cI saw you.\u201d</p><p>His claws reached for the vampire.</p><p>That vision\u2014that dream\u2014vanished. Turned into another. More vampires. Being tortured by Alerac. Being drained by him. He took their blood. Liam was with him, watching his alpha. Smiling with a sick and cold grin as the vampires died.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find her,\u201d Alerac promised. \u201cEven if I have to kill every one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane jerked up in bed, the scream breaking from her lips.</p><p>Her heart drummed, shaking her chest, and the sheets were tangled around her naked body.</p><p>In the next instant, the bedroom door flew open. Alerac stood there, dressed in his jeans, nothing else. \u201cJane? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>I saw you kill\u2014you killed my kind.</p><p>She\u2019d been told that Alerac was a master when it came to killing vampires. She\u2019d just seen the master up close and personal on his kills.</p><p>He rushed toward her. His claws were out.</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>Alerac stilled. His eyes narrowed. Those bright eyes. Too bright. That gaze swept over her. Then his lips tightened. \u201cBeen dreaming, have you?\u201d</p><p>She jumped from the bed. Wrapped the sheet around her body. She\u2019d been moaning in that bed beneath him just hours before. Moaning beneath a man who killed so easily. \u201cI don\u2019t dream.\u201d</p><p>He went back and closed the door behind him. Blocked that one wonderful exit. \u201cNo, I guess memories aren\u2019t dreams, are they?\u201d</p><p>She could still feel him on her body. \u201cM-memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you took my blood, I knew it would happen.\u201d He shook his head. His claws vanished. \u201cJust a matter of time. With my luck, I should\u2019ve known the visions would come the first time you slept.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She just stared back at him.</p><p>His hands fisted. \u201cRight. You don\u2019t remember that part, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gritted out. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen a vampire takes blood from live prey, the vamp can tap into that person\u2019s memories.\u201d</p><p>So she didn\u2019t have her own memories, but she had his?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure which highlights you saw,\u201d he said, and she was glad that he didn\u2019t try to come any closer to her. She wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing from the scream that just shook this place, they weren\u2019t good ones, huh?\u201d</p><p>She gazed into those glowing eyes. \u201cDo you have good ones?\u201d</p><p>His fisted hand rose and pressed over his chest. Right over that dark tattoo that covered his heart. \u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Her breath felt cold in her lungs. \u201cKilling vampires.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve done that.\u201d A long pause. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t just...killing them. You were\u2014you were drinking from them.\u201d</p><p>All emotion left his face. \u201cSaw that, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo werewolves do that?\u201d She hated being so lost. \u201cYou drink from your prey?\u201d She\u2019d thought that blood-drinking was something that only vampires had to do for survival.</p><p>Alerac began walking toward her. She backed up, instinctively, and her shoulders pushed into the heavy wood of the bedroom\u2019s wall.</p><p>He kept coming. Stalking her. Closing in.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the answer slowly growled from him. \u201cUsually, we just kill our prey and move on. But I needed their blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His jaw was clenched tight. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Jane could only shake her head.</p><p>\u201cYou changed me. After you, I wasn\u2019t just a werewolf.\u201d He sounded angry, enraged\u2014at her? \u201cI had to feed from them. I didn\u2019t want their blood. I wanted\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He broke off. She was pretty sure her heart had just jumped right into her throat. \u201cYou wanted my blood,\u201d Jane finished.</p><p>\u201cI guess you addicted me.\u201d Still angry. \u201cYou changed me. Made me into something other than the wolf I\u2019d always been. I stopped aging. I didn\u2019t die, and the hunger for the blood grew.\u201d</p><p>So\u2014what? He was some cross between a vampire and a werewolf?</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about feeding.\u201d Those images were in her head, and Jane couldn\u2019t get them out. \u201cYou\u2014you tortured them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>No denial. She\u2019d hoped for one.</p><p>But he just stood there, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jane demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause they deserved the pain that was coming to them. They were there that night. They took you. They trapped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you killed them.\u201d</p><p>A little shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>He terrified her. \u201cNo one should speak of death so easily.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat did the vampires look like in your dreams?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to put distance between them. To run.</p><p>I can still feel his touch on my skin.</p><p>\u201cT-two were chained in a dungeon.\u201d That was what it had looked like. Just like a medieval dungeon that she\u2019d seen on a history channel special once. \u201cOne was blond. The other had brown hair. You killed the blond first, and then\u2014then you turned on the other one, even though he said...\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cDunstan said that he didn\u2019t know where you were.\u201d He raked a hand through his tousled hair. \u201cHe lied. It was his ship that took you across the ocean. Your blood that I\u2019d found still staining the floor of the vessel.\u201d</p><p>Nausea rolled in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHe deserved exactly what he got.\u201d There was no remorse from Alerac. \u201cThey all did.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t ask. She shouldn\u2019t, but she did. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cHow many vampires have you killed?\u201d</p><p>Then he smiled at her. Lifted his hand. Stroked her cheek. \u201cMy Jane...I stopped counting long ago.\u201d</p><p>She knocked his hand away. Shoved him away. She\u2019d thought that she could trust him. That he could help her.</p><p>But he was just as much of a monster as the creatures that had come after her. Killing. Not caring. Again and again.</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d Anger beat in her name as he squared off against her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they did\u2014\u201d</p><p>She locked her arms around her body. Escape. It was all she could think of. \u201cHow long until you drink from me?\u201d He\u2019d said that her blood addicted him. That she was the one he truly wanted.</p><p>Now, too late, she realized it wasn\u2019t about physical love. Or even some kind of emotional attachment that had linked him to her across time. To him, her blood was power.</p><p>And he wanted as much power as he could get.</p><p>\u201cI could have taken your blood when I took your body.\u201d Cold words. Brutal words.</p><p>True words.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t, but she remembered a moment when his teeth had edged over the curve of her shoulder. When she\u2019d felt just a flash of pain.</p><p>Then he\u2019d pulled back.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>One dark brow rose. \u201cAre you going to pretend that you didn\u2019t want to taste me? Because I\u2019ll know that you\u2019re lying. I saw your fangs.\u201d</p><p>Fangs that were emerging, even then. She clamped her lips closed, horrified.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we are,\u201d he said simply, shrugging. \u201cWhen we fight and when we fuck, the bloodlust rises within us.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want bloodlust. She just wanted\u2014</p><p>I don\u2019t know! But it isn\u2019t this!</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t fight nature.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to try. \u201cYou found me in Florida. Then you brought me here...because my blood makes you stronger?\u201d</p><p>His eyelids flickered. \u201cI brought you here to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was lying to her. Jane shook her head. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Before he could speak, she heard someone calling his name. Then Liam was shoving open the bedroom door. The werewolf glanced at her\u2014a fast sweep with his eyes that took in her sheet-clad body\u2014then focused completely on Alerac. \u201cWe have company.\u201d</p><p>The way he said it, Jane knew he wasn\u2019t talking about the good kind of guest.</p><p>Alerac spun toward him.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Liam said flatly. \u201cHe must have heard that we have her.\u201d</p><p>Alerac marched for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She hurried after him.</p><p>Alerac didn\u2019t slow.</p><p>So she grabbed him and made him stop. \u201cWho is Ryan?\u201d</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t like the look that Liam and Alerac shared.</p><p>\u201cWho is Ryan?\u201d Jane repeated.</p><p>\u201cA vampire.\u201d It was Liam who spoke. \u201cA very powerful, very angry vampire.\u201d</p><p>Great. \u201cSomeone else who wants me dead?\u201d Maybe they should just make a line.</p><p>Alerac glanced down at her hand as it curled around his arm. \u201cI have a...truce...of sorts with Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA truce that will be ending,\u201d Liam muttered. \u201cYou know it\u2019s gonna be over.\u201d</p><p>Alerac nodded. \u201cI will speak with him. Have the guards escort him to cabin on the ridge. I\u2019ll meet him there.\u201d</p><p>So he was just waltzing off to meet this Ryan guy? \u201cI want to come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An immediate and hard denial. \u201cIf he sees you...\u201d Alerac exhaled. \u201cI\u2019ll have an even worse battle on my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he the one who has been trying to kill me?\u201d The vampire who\u2019d sent men after her? Twice?</p><p>\u201cLorcan has been hunting you. As for Ryan, I\u2019ll find out exactly what he wants.\u201d His focus shifted briefly to Jane\u2019s face. \u201cHe won\u2019t be a threat to you.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the answer she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>But it appeared to be all that she was getting.</p><p>Alerac left her, with Liam following right on his heels behind him. There were murmurs in the hallway. Jane put her ear to the door and heard\u2014Alerac was putting guards on her! Men to make sure that she didn\u2019t leave the bedroom.</p><p>What. The. Hell.</p><p>She started searching for clothes. She yanked open the closet. She\u2019d take something of Alerac\u2019s and make an outfit. Just like on that fashion show she liked to watch.</p><p>Except she didn\u2019t have to make anything work.</p><p>Because one side of that massive closet contained clothes. Women\u2019s clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Did the werewolf have another lover? Lovers? Her eyes narrowed as she yanked some clothes from the hangers. She jerked them on.</p><p>A perfect fit.</p><p>She glanced into the long mirror that waited at the end of the closet.</p><p>The shirt that she\u2019d grabbed was the same blue as her eyes. The jeans hugged her hips and curled over her legs.</p><p>She found shoes next\u2014shoes that were the exact size that she wore.</p><p>The tightness in Jane\u2019s gut grew worse.</p><p>Whirling, she rushed from the closet.</p><p>She didn\u2019t waste time heading for the door and the guards out there. Instead, Jane hurried toward the big window that looked out over the mountains. She put her hands on the window pane and stared down.</p><p>Alerac and Liam were walking beneath her. The glow from the moon illuminated them.</p><p>They\u2019re going to meet the one called Ryan.</p><p>A vampire.</p><p>Alerac killed vampires.</p><p>He can\u2019t kill this one. Because something had happened when Alerac mentioned Ryan\u2019s name.</p><p>An image had flashed in her mind. An image of a tall man, with pale skin and blond hair.</p><p>And her eyes.</p><p>She wanted to see this man\u2014this vampire.</p><p>She wanted to make sure that he stayed alive.</p><p>Jane waited. Watched until Alerac vanished down a snaking path that led into the woods.</p><p>Then she opened the window. Three floors up.</p><p>A fall like that would kill a human.</p><p>Good thing she wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>She crawled through the window, clung to the side of the house for an instant, then she let go and just fell.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Alerac schooled his features as he faced off against Ryan McDonough.</p><p>It had been five years since he\u2019d last seen the vampire. That night, they\u2019d both been covered in blood. They\u2019d gone for each other\u2019s throats.</p><p>He could have killed the vampire then. Alerac had been moments away from taking the man\u2019s head. But he\u2019d stopped.</p><p>Because Ryan had her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s free, I know she is.\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice no longer held even the hint of an Irish accent. Like Alerac, he\u2019d left their homeland long ago.</p><p>Left searching for what had been taken.</p><p>Alerac glanced over his shoulder. Liam was watching them with a guarded gaze. Liam had never trusted the vampire, and he\u2019d sure never understood why Alerac let the guy keep living.</p><p>\u201cI was at the bar in Miami. I talked to the woman who owned the place. She told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked?\u201d Alerac interrupted slowly as he sauntered around the small cabin. \u201cOr did you drink her?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI needed the truth. I got it. Then I had to fly all the damn way up here to catch you\u2014and you know I hate those damn planes.\u201d Then he moved in a fast lunge and grabbed Alerac\u2019s arms. \u201cWhere is Keira?\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s claws had burst free at the attack. Even as Ryan tightened his hold, Alerac had his claws at the vamp\u2019s throat. \u201cI let you come onto my land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have my sister!\u201d There was no fear in Ryan\u2019s blue gaze. Only rage. \u201cAnd I want her back.\u201d</p><p>Not happening. \u201cYou need to step back. Or else we\u2019re about to see if you\u2019re still as much of a bleeder as before.\u201d</p><p>Jaw locking, Ryan slowly released Alerac. But he didn\u2019t retreat. The vamp kept standing toe-to-toe with him. \u201cI heard her cries in my mind. Over and over again, until they nearly drove me mad.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always known that Ryan shared a deep connection with Keira. Twins. The only born vampire twins that Alerac knew of in this world.</p><p>He just hadn\u2019t realized exactly how deep that connection went for them.</p><p>\u201cI knew the exact moment when she was free,\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice was low. \u201cBecause that\u2019s when her screams stopped.\u201d</p><p>Alerac swallowed. \u201cIf you were so tied to her, then why the hell couldn\u2019t you find her?\u201d</p><p>Ryan shoved him across the room. Alerac slammed into the wall.</p><p>\u201cI tried!\u201d Ryan snarled.</p><p>Liam rushed at him.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s fist sent the wolf down.</p><p>\u201cIn my mind, all I saw was darkness. All I could hear was her screams. I searched...\u201d Ryan stalked toward him. \u201cJust as hard as you did. I never gave up on her.\u201d</p><p>The vamp\u2019s fangs were out.</p><p>Only fair, since Alerac had never lost his claws.</p><p>\u201cYou just found her first,\u201d Ryan continued. His lips twisted into a savage grin. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get to keep her. She\u2019s my blood. My clan. And I\u2019m taking her home.\u201d</p><p>The hell he was.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d The word was barely human. It took all of the control Alerac possessed to keep the form of a man. \u201cA crumbling castle in Ireland? One that even you haven\u2019t inhabited in a century? And don\u2019t damn well talk to me about her clan. It was her clan that turned on her. That let her be sentenced to that hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you!\u201d Something seemed to break behind Ryan\u2019s eyes. He lunged at Alerac. Punching. Kicking. Clawing. \u201cYou destroyed everything!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the vampire\u2019s teeth came for his throat, Alerac realized that Ryan hadn\u2019t just come to the mountains in order to retrieve his sister.</p><p>The vamp had come to kill him.</p><p>Too bad for Ryan. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to die.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>She followed the sound of snarls. Of growls. And the scent of blood.</p><p>Her steps were soundless as she slipped through the woods. She expected some of Alerac\u2019s pack to come at her, but they didn\u2019t. Maybe it was her lucky night. She\u2019d eluded them easily enough.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019d just caught them unprepared because they hadn\u2019t been expecting her to do a header out of the window. Whatever.</p><p>Jane barely breathed as she approached the cabin on the ridge. A small cabin, its exterior dark. But...</p> <p>The growls were coming from that place.</p><p>So was the scent of blood.</p><p>She eased toward the narrow window. Faint light shone from behind that glass, and when she leaned closer, pushing up on her tip toes, Jane saw\u2014</p><p>Alerac. With his claws slicing toward the throat of a man with blond hair. A man with fangs. A man who turned his head at that exact moment.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes\u2014blue, bright\u2014met hers.</p><p>\u201cKeira.\u201d</p> <p>She could have sworn that she heard his whisper in her mind.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s claws were flying toward the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane screamed and pounded on the window.</p><p>The glass shattered, flying inward.</p><p>\u201cLet him go!\u201d She\u2019d cut her hands on the glass. Blood dripped from her fingers.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s head turned toward her. His eyes widened.</p><p>This scene\u2014it was just like the scenes from her visions. Alerac, killing.</p><p>A river of blood that never stopped.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Then hard hands grabbed her. She kicked back, landing a hard blow to someone\u2019s shin, but her captor didn\u2019t free her. He spun her around to face him.</p><p>She found herself staring at Liam\u2019s furious face. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here!\u201d</p><p>Screw that. It was her life. She wasn\u2019t going to be locked in any room while the werewolves decided her fate. She tried to break free. Liam didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>Liam...</p><p>He\u2019d been in those visions. He\u2019d taken the blood from the vampires, too. He\u2019d fed, just like Alerac had.</p><p>And Liam\u2019s eyes were already dropping to her throat.</p><p>No!</p><p>She slammed her head into his and punched him in the gut as hard as she could. He stumbled back, and she raced into the cabin.</p><p>Alerac stood frozen, with his claws less than an inch from the blond-haired man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him!\u201d Jane yelled.</p><p>\u201cKeira,\u201d the man whispered. The word almost sounded like a prayer.</p><p>The name still meant nothing to her.</p><p>But that man...his eyes...he mattered to her. She knew it, deep inside.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she took a cautious step toward Alerac. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>The floor creaked behind her. Then Liam\u2019s arms wrapped around her once more. \u201cNo more head butts,\u201d he snapped into her right ear. \u201cI think you broke my freakin\u2019 nose.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s gaze jerked to Liam\u2019s arms. Then to Jane\u2019s face. \u201cTake Jane back to the main house,\u201d he ordered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The blond man broke free of Alerac\u2019s hold. His fangs flashed\u2014definitely a vampire\u2014as he backed into the far corner. He frowned at her. \u201cWho\u2019s Jane?\u201d</p><p>I am.</p><p>Liam tried to pull her toward the door. Jane dug in her heels and got ready to do more damage to the werewolf\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cLet her go!\u201d The sharp order came from the blond vampire. Then he was there, right in front of Jane. He\u2019d moved so quickly. Vamp fast. And he wasn\u2019t waiting for Liam to follow his order. The vampire grabbed Liam\u2019s right arm. Broke it. Then he pulled Jane against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d The vampire was trembling against her. His scent filled her nose. He smelled like the ocean. The scent reassured her.</p><p>He reassured her.</p><p>And she had no memory of him at all.</p><p>But she found her hands wanting to rise. Wanting to hold tight to him.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d Alerac said as the wood of the floor creaked beneath his approaching feet. \u201cYou know the spell that was put on her. She doesn\u2019t remember a damn thing, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Ryan. She tilted her head back. Stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI think she remembers me,\u201d the one called Ryan murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Keira?\u201d</p><p>There was blood on his mouth. She hadn\u2019t noticed it before. Her gaze dropped to that blood, then she looked over at Alerac.</p><p>His neck was bleeding.</p><p>The vampire had taken his blood. She\u2019d thought that Alerac was the one attacking, but had he just been defending himself?</p><p>The vampires want you dead. Alerac had told her that before.</p><p>He\u2019d also saved her life.</p><p>And in your visions, he killed vampires.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d Alerac said again, voice rougher.</p><p>Jane glanced back into Ryan\u2019s eyes, so like the ones that she saw when she looked into a mirror. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you,\u201d she told him, almost hating to say the words.</p><p>Pain flashed over his handsome face. \u201cBut you remember him?\u201d He threw a hard glare toward Alerac.</p><p>\u201cShe remembers nothing.\u201d Alerac reached for her. His claws were out, but his hands were incredibly gentle as he pulled her away from Ryan. \u201cLorcan wanted her to be this way. The bastard thought he\u2019d get to her first.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes had hardened. \u201cBut you put him out of commission, didn\u2019t you? I heard that you killed five of his closest allies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I nearly took the bastard\u2019s head,\u201d Alerac finished. \u201cI would\u2019ve...if I hadn\u2019t thought that I needed to keep him alive.\u201d</p><p>Her own head was aching. The scent of blood\u2014now she knew that it was Alerac\u2019s blood\u2014that scent was making her hungry.</p><p>\u201cI kept him alive because he was the only one left who knew where she was. He killed those who took her to be imprisoned long ago. I needed him.\u201d Disgust thickened Alerac\u2019s words. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t need him to live any longer.\u201d</p><p>He spoke of death so casually.</p><p>To him, it was casual.</p><p>Her fangs ached.</p><p>Ryan held out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to go.\u201d</p><p>But Alerac pushed her behind his body. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going any place with you.\u201d</p><p>Uh, she was standing right there.</p><p>\u201cI let you live because of your blood bond to her, but I haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d Alerac said as he squared off against Ryan, \u201cnot for an instant, about what you did.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was pounding too fast.</p><p>\u201cYou let them take her,\u201d Alerac continued in a voice that sounded like thunder\u2019s rumble. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even try to stop them. Didn\u2019t try to help her.\u201d</p><p>She eased away from Alerac. Jane saw the fury on Ryan\u2019s face as he leaned toward the werewolf alpha.</p><p>\u201cAnd she took your fucking punishment,\u201d Ryan fired right back at Alerac. \u201cWhen she never even knew that you were just using her all along. Seducing her, to get the revenge and power that you wanted.\u201d</p><p>The fierce pounding in her chest seemed to slow then.</p><p>Alerac grabbed the vamp around the throat. Lifted him into the air. \u201cYou\u2019re done here. If I see you on my land again, you\u2019re dead.\u201d His gaze shot back to a watchful\u2014and still bleeding\u2014Liam. \u201cI told you before...get her out of here!\u201d</p><p>Liam took her arm. Jane jerked away from him. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She was sick. So damn sick of being in the dark. \u201cI want my memories back.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said that he could get her a witch. If she was under a spell, a witch could break that spell, right? \u201cI want my memories, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful what you ask for. You might be better off without them,\u201d Liam murmured.</p><p>That was her decision. Not his. Not Alerac\u2019s.</p><p>Alerac tossed Ryan toward the door. No, through the door. The wood broke and shattered at the impact. \u201cCome here again,\u201d he said, \u201cand brother or no brother, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Ryan cast her one final look. He was just outside of the cabin and\u2014and wolves were coming out from the darkness. They circled him.</p><p>The wolves just seemed to be waiting. Their sharp teeth glinted in the light.</p><p>\u201cOne word from me,\u201d Alerac told Ryan, the words low and vicious, \u201cand they\u2019ll tear you apart.\u201d</p><p>Ryan straightened to his full height. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s gaze darted toward Jane.</p><p>Meet me at the stream. Two miles south. Before dawn. Before the sun rises.</p><p>She bit her lip to hold back the gasp that wanted to break free. She\u2019d just heard Ryan\u2019s voice\u2014in her head.</p><p>Don\u2019t trust the wolf. Or his pack. Traitors want your blood.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s lips never moved, but she heard every word clearly in her mind.</p><p>But then Ryan turned around. He walked right through that circle of wolves. Headed out with his head up and never looked back.</p><p>Get away from Alerac as soon as you can. You must meet me before dawn.</p><p>She watched Ryan until he vanished. Then she moved to hurry away from that cabin.</p><p>But Alerac caught her wrist. His fingers curled around the delicate bones.</p><p>She tilted up her chin. \u201cYou should have told me that I had a brother.\u201d The anger was there, growing and beating inside of her.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d Alerac said, voice deep. \u201cHe was there when you were imprisoned. He didn\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Not caring for the audience that watched, Jane challenged, \u201cAnd you did? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t saying anything. Not then.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trust him. I can\u2019t trust you. I can\u2019t trust Heath.\u201d Her breath rushed out. \u201cIt seems the only person I can trust is myself.\u201d</p><p>A hard shake of his head. \u201cI told you that I\u2019d keep you safe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some possession.\u201d The fury was so strong that she was shaking. \u201cI\u2019m a person. It\u2019s not your job to keep me anything.\u201d She\u2019d been afraid, and the fear had led her to this place, this mountain with him.</p><p>She should have known to be wary of the desire he stirred within her. But she\u2019d just been so happy to actually be feeling something again. Something\u2014anything other than fear.</p><p>He seduced you once.</p><p>And he was doing it again. She was so desperate for some security, desperate for someone to want her, that she\u2019d given in before considering all of the risks.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d Her voice was flat. Surprising, considering that she felt as if she were breaking apart on the inside.</p><p>He glanced at her hand. Swallowed.</p><p>Released her.</p><p>She moved away from him and maneuvered through the smashed remains of the cabin\u2019s door. All of those wolves\u2014they\u2019d sure come out fast enough. She stared at them, suspicion pushing through her. \u201cThey were in the woods, weren\u2019t they? When I was coming here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have orders not to attack you.\u201d Alerac\u2019s curt voice. \u201cJust to make sure that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d Her voice mocked the word as she glanced over her shoulder. \u201cOr that I stay captive?\u201d Her laugh was bitter. \u201cI feel like a prisoner.\u201d She rubbed her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s a real familiar feeling.\u201d She started walking then, heading toward the path that would take her back to the main house. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be followed any longer. Keep them back, Alerac!\u201d</p><p>She could hear the footfalls from the wolves.</p><p>\u201cKeep. Them. Back!\u201d</p><p>She wanted to break and run. To head for that stream. But...not yet.</p><p>First she had to make sure that no one followed her. She stopped. Took a breath. Then looked back at the werewolf who seemed to be sinking his claws right into her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s your land, right? Surely I\u2019m safe here. I can manage a walk back to the house all by myself.\u201d</p><p>He studied at her, his gaze unblinking.</p><p>Jane realized that she was holding her breath.</p><p>Then he inclined his head toward the wolves. \u201cGo back to your other duties.\u201d</p><p>They turned. Eased away.</p><p>She started walking again.</p><p>One foot.</p><p>In front of the other.</p><p>She headed into the woods. Kept her pace slow. Alerac would still be able to hear her footsteps. She had to wait. Had to plan her moment just right.</p><p>When it was safe, then she\u2019d go to her brother.</p><p>\u201cWe should have killed him years ago.\u201d Liam shook his head as his bones began to pop and stretch. The guy had to shift in order to heal his broken nose and his broken arm. \u201cI told you again and again, the bastard deserves a good killing.\u201d</p><p>But Alerac had never been able to end Ryan McDonough\u2019s life. Because when he looked into Ryan\u2019s eyes all he could think about was how much she loved her brother.</p><p>Even though that same brother had turned his back on her.</p><p>Her screams stopped.</p><p>Keira and Ryan had always shared a special connection. He should have known that Ryan was linked to her, even during her imprisonment. But if Ryan had been able to touch her thoughts then, why hadn\u2019t he saved her? Why hadn\u2019t he freed Keira?</p><p>Liam howled as he took the form of the beast. The others were gone, the small clearing empty. As for Jane...</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear the soft sound of her footsteps any longer.</p><p>He marched forward. She wanted a witch, and he\u2019d given the order to acquire one. But now Alerac had to wonder if Jane truly needed those memories back. Her life before the imprisonment had been short, just twenty-five years of freedom. Then two hundred in hell. Why should she be forced to remember that imprisonment? Why couldn\u2019t they just go forward? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wind shifted, blowing against his face. A storm was coming. He could smell it in the air.</p><p>He could also smell Jane\u2019s sweet scent. Only that scent wasn\u2019t coming from the north, as it should have been.</p><p>The south.</p> <p>His muscles locked. He inhaled again. His senses were the sharpest in the pack.</p><p>He focused, trying to hear\u2014</p><p>Racing footsteps. Heaving breaths.</p><p>Jane was running from him. Again. A-fuckin\u2019-gain.</p><p>His hands fisted. She didn\u2019t trust him. She\u2019d given him her body, but that hadn\u2019t been enough.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The one word tore from him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, though every part of him wanted to rush after her.</p><p>But maybe it was time he stopped chasing her. Jane was right. She wasn\u2019t a possession. She was a person. And if he caged her, how was he any different than Lorcan?</p><p>Liam was shifting again behind him. Turning back into the form of a man. \u201cGo...after her...\u201d Liam managed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s running to her brother.\u201d Obviously. The bond of blood. It was stronger than any bond he could forge with her. \u201cIt\u2019s time he told her the truth, anyway.\u201d No more fucking lies or secrets. He was tired of them.</p><p>\u201cKill...him...\u201d A barely human demand from Liam.</p> <p>But Alerac shook his head. He could admit\u2014to himself\u2014that killing Ryan was beyond him. He could never be the one to take her brother\u2019s life.</p><p>That was a sin that Jane would never forgive.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t follow her toward the south. He began to walk back to his cabin. The home he\u2019d foolishly made for her.</p><p>A home that was empty.</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t follow him.</p><p>She ran frantically through the woods. Twigs snapped at her and scraped across her cheeks. She kept slipping in the dirt and on the roots, and Jane sure hoped that she was heading south.</p><p>Then she heard the faint rush of the stream. Yes. She burst from the bushes.</p><p>But Ryan wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p>The moonlight fell on the water, making it shine and glisten, as it tumbled through the rocks.</p><p>She looked to the left. To the right. \u201cRyan?\u201d Jane called out. He should have been there.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard his voice in her mind again. There was nothing in her mind but silence. Nothing around her but the rush of the stream.</p><p>The air was cold. The wind blew harder against her cheeks.</p><p>Jane knew she didn\u2019t have much time. Alerac would realize that she wasn\u2019t back at the cabin. He\u2019d come after her.</p><p>A twig snapped behind her. Jane spun around.</p><p>No one was there.</p><p>Hunted.</p><p>The instinctive awareness was back.</p><p>She bent to the ground and wrapped her fingers around a thick, heavy tree limb that had fallen down.</p><p>A growl reached her ears. Her head jerked to the right, and Jane caught the flash of glowing eyes from the thick brush. Her breath rushed out. A wolf. Alerac had sent one of his men after her. So much for not having guards.</p><p>She started to lower the branch. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that\u2014\u201d</p><p>The wolf lunged at her. A big, muscled wolf, with golden eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d seen those eyes before, only they had been in the face of a man.</p><p>Liam?</p><p>He hit her with his paws, and Jane fell to the ground. Her head slammed into one of the stones that lined the stream. The limb fell from her fingers.</p><p>The wolf put his mouth at her throat.</p><p>She heard more growls then. Other wolves were closing in on her. She counted at least three of them.</p><p>\u201cS-stop!\u201d</p><p>They edged ever closer.</p><p>Jane realized that the wolves weren\u2019t there to protect her. No, that wasn\u2019t their intent at all.</p><p>Then the wolf above her began to shift. His fur vanished from his body as his bones cracked and snapped. The brutal transformation lasted only for a moment, then Liam\u2019s handsome face was smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou should have listened to Alerac. The fool truly did want to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shifted completely. His claws were still at her throat. He brought his mouth close to her ear. His breath blew over her cheek. \u201cHe would have protected you. But me? I don\u2019t give a damn about your safety. It\u2019s your blood that I want.\u201d</p><p>It was her blood that he was about to take.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s here to protect you, princess. It\u2019s time for you to bleed.\u201d</p><p>His head slid down to her throat. She felt the rasp of his teeth against her skin.</p><p>No one\u2019s here to protect you.</p><p>Yes, someone was there. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she whispered, and Jane lifted her hands. Her own nails had lengthened, sharpened, and she drove them right at his face. When her claws raked over him, Liam screamed and leapt back.</p><p>In the next moment, she was on her feet.</p><p>A white wolf lunged at her. She caught his head in her hands. Jerked as hard as she could.</p><p>When the bones snapped that time, the wolf stopped howling instantly.</p><p>The white wolf\u2019s body fell to the ground. Began to shift.</p><p>Her breath sawed from her lungs.</p><p>Liam circled around her. Blood poured from the deep scratches on his face. But the crazy SOB was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cI guess the lost vampire has some bite after all.\u201d He swiped away the blood that rained down his cheek. \u201cBut you\u2019re still on your own. Even a vamp at full power couldn\u2019t take us all out.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed for the limb she\u2019d dropped before. \u201cLet\u2019s just see about that.\u201d Her words didn\u2019t tremble. Her knees did.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered as his face hardened. \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Then he motioned with his right hand, and two wolves leapt toward her.</p><p>Alerac froze when he heard the howl. It died away almost immediately, but the sound seemed to echo in his mind.</p><p>He turned to the right. Stared into the night.</p><p>Jane.</p><p>He\u2019d thought to let her go. But\u2014</p><p>He took off at a run, and when he jumped over a fallen tree, his body shifted into the form of a beast.</p><p>She\u2019d knocked one wolf back, snapping the limb in two when she swung it into the beast\u2019s head. The other wolf struck out with his claws. Those claws sliced their way down her leg.</p><p>Screaming, she rushed to the other side of the stream. Where was some damn silver when she needed it? Her fumbling fingers grabbed a heavy rock. She threw it at the charging wolf.</p><p>It smashed right into his head.</p><p>The wolf hit the ground.</p><p>Three down, temporarily anyway.</p><p>That just left her and\u2014Liam.</p><p>He was laughing. Laughing and walking across that stream. \u201cI forgot,\u201d he murmured as the laughter slowly faded. \u201cYou fed on Alerac recently. That would explain the rush of strength.\u201d</p><p>He was about to feel her rush of strength. Where the hell was another heavy stone?</p><p>Right...there.</p><p>She leapt forward and tried to grab it.</p><p>But Liam grabbed her first.</p><p>He caught her wrist in tight grip. \u201cYour brother broke my arm.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cConsider this payback.\u201d He snapped her wrist.</p><p>Pain surged through her. She shoved against him, but he wasn\u2019t letting go. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cAlerac got to you first. He found you first in Ireland. Got you to spread your legs and offer your neck. He took the power that should have been mine.\u201d</p><p>His left hand fisted in her hair.</p><p>\u201cNow I get to taste the blood with all the power. I get the bond that he wanted so very badly.\u201d</p><p>She kneed him in the groin. Punched. Twisted. He didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>\u201cI get your power, and then I\u2019llget the pack. They\u2019ll all follow me.\u201d</p><p>Her feet kicked against his, and Liam stumbled. They crashed right back down, only this time, they landed in the stream. The water soaked them.</p><p>His claws rose. Scraped down her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that your kind heals so easily.\u201d</p><p>Wait, what\u2014</p><p>His claws sliced over her throat. Blood pulsed from her. The water from the stream\u2014such cold water\u2014covered her.</p><p>His mouth lowered to her throat. He licked her, taking her blood. \u201cFirst claws,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThen I get to bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s roar broke the night. That fierce cry was the most beautiful sound that she\u2019d ever heard. He was coming for her.</p><p>He\u2019d realize what Liam was doing. She opened her mouth to scream for him.</p><p>But Liam sank his teeth into her throat. Pain engulfed her.</p><p>Then\u2014then it started to thunder. No, not thunder.</p><p>Gunshots.</p><p>Liam\u2019s mouth tore from her neck, and his body fell away from hers.</p><p>She crawled away from him. Her hand went to her throat as she tried to stop the blood from flowing.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Keira! Hurry!\u201d Ryan\u2019s desperate voice.</p><p>She looked to the left. He was there, at the edge of the woods, and he still had a gun in his hands.</p><p>Jane cast one fast glance at Liam. Smoke rose from the bullet holes in his chest. His eyes were closed.</p><p>Was he dead?</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes opened.</p><p>No, not dead. Jane jumped to her feet and ran toward Ryan. He lifted the gun higher. Seemed to aim right at her.</p><p>She ducked.</p><p>He fired.</p><p>A groan sounded from behind her.</p><p>Ryan opened his left hand to her. She grabbed it, holding it like the lifeline that it was.</p><p>He pulled her close against him. \u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Great plan. Fabulous plan. Only...</p><p>She was bleeding so much from her throat. She couldn\u2019t speak. And she felt too weak.</p><p>He turned. Rushed back into the brush. She tried to follow him, but after three steps, she fell flat on her face.</p><p>\u201cKeira!\u201d</p><p>Hands lifted her up. She was tossed over a shoulder. Then she didn\u2019t see anything else.</p><p>But she heard something...a long, low howl that sent a shiver of fear chasing her into the darkness.</p><p>When he broke from the trees, Alerac\u2019s gaze went straight to the stream. To the stream that smelled of Jane\u2019s blood.</p><p>But Jane wasn\u2019t there. Three wolves were. Wolves from his pack. They were hurt, one was shuddering.</p><p>Yet, as soon as they saw him, they attacked.</p><p>What. The. Hell.</p><p>They came in hard and fast\u2014and they came in for the kill.</p><p>But Alerac wasn\u2019t the pack alpha for nothing. Soon it was their blood flowing into the stream. Their bodies hitting the ground.</p><p>They died in mere moments.</p><p>And he howled into the night, lost, betrayed.</p><p>His gaze swept the scene. Seeing so much. The tracks of a man, but the scent of a vampire.</p><p>The tracks of another wolf, heading away from the stream. Heading back up the mountain. That wolf\u2019s scent was familiar, and the sting of betrayal burned ever deeper.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I see...?</p><p>The rage built in him, but Alerac held tight to his control. He left the broken bodies behind him.</p><p>In the form of the wolf, he inhaled deeply, pulling in all the scents\u2014those both familiar and foreign to him. He locked onto the one scent that mattered. The only one that did.</p><p>The scent of Jane\u2019s blood.</p><p>He\u2019d been willing to let her leave him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t willing to let her die.</p><p>The paws of the beast flew across the ground. When he crossed the stream, he sent the bloody water churning and splashing around him. The others scents there\u2014he took note of them.</p><p>Jane was his priority. Finding her.</p><p>Punishment. Justice. Payback. All of that would come. It would fuckin\u2019 come.</p><p>Liam raced deeper into the woods. No, no, no. Jane shouldn\u2019t have escaped. Her blood was in his mouth. Sweet and rich and powerful. Everything that he\u2019d ever dreamed.</p><p>But she was gone.</p><p>Her bastard brother.</p><p>He\u2019d told Alerac to kill the fool. Over and over, he\u2019d given him that order.</p><p>But Alerac didn\u2019t take orders from anyone.</p><p>I\u2019m the lackey who jumps at his command.</p><p>No more. Jane was his ticket to power. He\u2019d known that truth for years. She\u2019d been the one to amp up Alerac\u2019s strength. She can give me the same boost. As soon as Jane had been located, Liam had known that he would have to take her from the alpha.</p><p>He\u2019d even hired those vamps to try and take her in Florida. Those men hadn\u2019t been working for Lorcan. They\u2019d been on Liam\u2019s payroll. Both attacks had come by Liam\u2019s order.</p><p>He\u2019d encountered plenty of vampires over the years. He\u2019d drained most of them. But some, a few that he\u2019d thought would prove valuable, Liam had let some of them keep living. They owed him, and he\u2019d been collecting on those debts. Sending out those vamps on his blood mission.</p><p>He\u2019d been the one to connect Heath and Jane. Heath had been working under his orders the whole time. Studying Jane\u2019s blood, trying to determine the source of her power\u2014and of Alerac\u2019s.</p><p>But when Liam had realized that Alerac was going down to Miami to claim Jane, he\u2019d sent his vamps to collect her. He\u2019d known that his time to experiment had run out. He\u2019d needed to make his move.</p><p>Only those vamps had failed.</p><p>But Alerac hadn\u2019t realized Liam was his enemy. Alerac was too focused on Lorcan. Always Lorcan.</p><p>Hell, Lorcan wasn\u2019t even in the game. As far as Liam knew, the bastard wasn\u2019t in the country.</p><p>Liam had tried to be careful. He hadn\u2019t wanted to battle directly against Alerac, not until he\u2019d taken plenty of Jane\u2019s blood to boost him.</p><p>But his plans had changed. Alerac kept defeating every enemy that Liam had thrown at him.</p><p>Tonight, when Jane had gone off on her own, it had been his best chance.</p><p>I took that chance.</p><p>Now Alerac would know that he had a traitor\u2014traitors\u2014in his pack. Alerac would come for him.</p><p>His chest heaved. His claws cut into the tree near him as fury pumped through his gut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Let him come. He knew Alerac\u2019s secrets. Every bloody one of them. And he\u2019d use those secrets.</p><p>He\u2019d take out the alpha.</p><p>He\u2019d rule the pack.</p> <p>Alerac would die.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cHold on, Keira! Just hold on!\u201d</p><p>The words sank through the veil of darkness that surrounded her. She groaned and tried to open her eyes.</p><p>But then her face slammed into something hard. Wait, was that a man\u2019s back?</p> <p>Her body was bobbing, jerking, because she was flung over someone\u2019s shoulder. And that someone was running fast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you out of here,\u201d the guy was promising her.</p><p>Ryan.</p><p>The vamp who was supposed to be her brother.</p><p>\u201cI have a car waiting on the other side of the mountain. I\u2019ll get you there, get you some blood, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel fine.</p> <p>She shoved herself up so she could stop staring at his back. Instead, she looked into the woods that they were fleeing through.</p><p>Glowing eyes stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cAlerac,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t find us!\u201d Ryan said, breath panting. He was running incredibly fast.</p><p>Just not fast enough.</p><p>He\u2019s already found us.</p><p>Alerac was in wolf form, and he was charging right for them.</p><p>Part of her, deep inside, was glad to see him.</p> <p>\u201cAlerac,\u201d she managed to say again, trying to warn Ryan.</p><p>Ryan just ran faster.</p><p>Until he heard the growls. Growls that were now far too close. While vamps could move fast, apparently Alerac was faster.</p><p>That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re an amped up werewolf/vamp combo.</p><p>Ryan spun to face Alerac, but her brother didn\u2019t loosen his hold on her. \u201cStay back!\u201d</p><p>Alerac didn\u2019t. He just charged right at Ryan. He hit with an impact that sent Ryan\u2014and Jane\u2014falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cKeira!\u201d Ryan tried to grab for her once more.</p><p>But Alerac put himself between them. A big, fierce beast. His body vibrated with fury.</p><p>So did hers. Fury and pain and fear. A terrible combination.</p><p>\u201cWe...have to leave...\u201d She forced the words out. Her neck still throbbed. Burned. Blood soaked her. Was she healing yet? She couldn\u2019t tell. It didn\u2019t feel like she was healing, but maybe the blood loss had just made her weak. Too weak to tell when her throat closed up.</p><p>Alerac growled again.</p><p>Ryan was back on his feet. \u201cIf you can\u2019t have her, then she has to die, is that it?\u201d Ryan yelled.</p><p>Alerac didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cYou sent your men after her. You let them tear into her because she wanted to leave you.\u201d Ryan glared at the wolf. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember her past, fine, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s your damn prisoner! She didn\u2019t escape one hell to venture into another!\u201d</p><p>No. Jane pushed up to her feet. She wasn\u2019t in hell with Alerac. Alerac hadn\u2019t sent Liam to attack her. Alerac didn\u2019t even know that his men were betraying him.</p><p>\u201cLet. Her. Go,\u201d Ryan demanded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you hurt her enough already? She was punished for you. That time in prison should have been your time. She traded her life for yours once. Just let her go.\u201d</p><p>She thought Alerac would attack him.</p><p>But...</p><p>There was no attack.</p><p>Alerac looked back at her. No more growls. No howls.</p><p>He stared at her, and the shift swept over him. Beast became man, and then it was Alerac who was on the ground before her. He rose slowly, still never taking his eyes from her.</p><p>Then Alerac walked toward her, naked and strong, with eyes that were swirling with emotion. \u201cI didn\u2019t send them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d Her voice was a rasp.</p><p>His gaze fell to her throat.</p><p>It was sure easy to read the emotion he felt then\u2014rage flared in his gaze. \u201cConsider Liam dead.\u201d</p><p>So easily? Liam had been with Alerac for so long, but he\u2019d go after the wolf now? For her?</p><p>\u201cYou need blood,\u201d Alerac murmured. He took another step toward her.</p><p>Only to be wrenched back by Ryan. \u201cWhat she needs is to get away from you!\u201d</p><p>She took your punishment.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s jaw clenched, and he gritted out, \u201cMy blood will make her stronger. She\u2019s hurt!\u201d</p><p>But now Ryan was the one standing between her and Alerac. \u201cYou just want to strengthen the bond between the two of you. A bond you manipulated from the very beginning! Keira should have never been with you!\u201d He jabbed his finger into Alerac\u2019s chest. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know the truth? Lorcan wasn\u2019t the only one using a witch in those days. I know what you did!\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted. Touched her throat. The wound hadn\u2019t closed yet.</p><p>Her fangs were out because hunger cut through her.</p><p>Alerac.</p><p>\u201cYou used magic in order to get to Keira,\u201d Ryan charged. \u201cShe turned on her family because you tricked her! You\u2019re still tricking her. She needs to learn the truth about her past!\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-screw the past,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And both men gaped at her.</p><p>Did it look like the past mattered right then? \u201cI\u2019m dying here.\u201d The words barely could escape because of the damage to her throat.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mouth dropped. \u201cKeira, my blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alerac tossed her brother head-first into the nearest tree. \u201cIt\u2019s Jane. And I\u2019m here.\u201d He caught her chin in his hands. He titled his head, offering his neck to her. \u201cTake from me.\u201d</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t need to hear a second offer. Her teeth sank into his throat. She was so afraid of hurting him\u2014the way that Liam had hurt her\u2014and tears leaked down her cheeks at the thought of causing him pain.</p><p>As she stood there, her teeth in his neck, his body against hers, his arms came up. Wrapped around her. Pulled her close.</p><p>Thunder rolled across the sky. Rain began to fall on them, hitting softly first, then harder, washing away the blood on her. Soaking her clothes.</p><p>\u201cDrain him, Keira!\u201d That was Ryan. Annoying her. \u201cIt\u2019s what he deserves.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t sure what Alerac deserved, but she didn\u2019t think it was death.</p><p>Her tongue lightly licked over his skin. She loved his taste.</p><p>She also loved the power of his blood. Just a few sips and she wasn\u2019t weak, not any longer. Her body seemed to pulse with energy and life.</p><p>And lust had heated her.</p><p>Not lust for his blood.</p><p>For him.</p><p>She pulled her mouth from his neck. Alerac\u2019s head lifted. Raindrops clung to his lashes as he peered down at her. \u201cI didn't send them after you.\u201d</p><p>An understanding sank into her, one that left her feeling lost. \u201cYou weren\u2019t coming after me at all, were you?\u201d He\u2019d known that she\u2019d run. Of course, he\u2019d known. Mr. Super Senses.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot until I heard the howls.\u201d</p><p>The howls had come when the werewolves attacked her. \u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d Jane whispered.</p><p>\u201cThree are dead.\u201d The lines near his mouth deepened. \u201cThe fourth will be.\u201d</p><p>The dangerous intent in his voice made goosebumps rise on her arms.</p><p>\u201cAll right, she\u2019s strong again. Not get away from her.\u201d Ryan\u2019s words rapped out. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to leave, Keira.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d Alerac corrected in a hard, tight voice. \u201cShe wants to be called Jane now.\u201d</p><p>Ryan blinked. \u201cWhat? Jane isn\u2019t her name. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders straightened. \u201cI don\u2019t know Keira. I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>He blanched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jane, and\u2014\u201d Oh, crap, this could be one huge mistake. But with his blood strengthening her, with his arms still around her, with Alerac\u2019s eyes on her in that intense look that seemed to be breaking her heart, she could only say, \u201cAnd I\u2019m not leaving him.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell who was more surprised by her announcement.</p><p>Ryan.</p><p>Or Alerac.</p><p>Or, hell, maybe even me.</p><p>\u201cAlerac O\u2019Neill has Keira at his compound. The wolf has his whole pack around her, and they\u2019re going to be guarding her constantly.\u201d Lorcan Teague stalked around the small room, circling the human. \u201cIt\u2019s now show time for you, Heath. Time to prove just how much you want that precious immortality.\u201d Heath Myers was sweating as he sat at the small table. \u201cI can do this,\u201d the doctor said, his words a fast rush. \u201cIf I can talk to her, I can convince her that I\u2019m on her side. That I\u2019m trying to help her.\u201d</p><p>They were only an hour away from Alerac\u2019s home on the mountain. Lorcan didn\u2019t dare go any closer. He wasn\u2019t sure where Alerac would have his guards positioned. Some of those dogs could catch a scent from miles away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just a matter of walking to the gates and getting instant admission,\u201d Lorcan murmured.</p><p>Heath\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cI-I don\u2019t smell like a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just human. All I need to do is get close to them. If Jane sees me, she won\u2019t let the werewolves hurt me.\u201d</p><p>The guy was an idiot. \u201cYou think that woman controls the werewolf alpha?\u201d Laughable.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014I think Jane will listen to me.\u201d Sweat leaked down Heath\u2019s temple. \u201cJust give me this chance, okay? I can get to her.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan stilled. Then he leaned over the table. He made sure that Heath saw the threat in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not about getting to her. It\u2019s about Keira coming to me.\u201d They needed to be very, very clear on this point. In two hundred years, no other blood princess had been born to his clan. They were too damn rare.</p><p>When he\u2019d first learned that Keira had defiled herself with that wolf, his rage had nearly driven him mad.</p><p>But two hundred years had passed. The world had changed. There had been a few more werewolf and vampire matings over the years. He\u2019d heard of those instances.</p><p>And been surprised by their results.</p><p>It seemed that when a vampire and werewolf bonded, when they shared blood, they also shared power.</p><p>Lorcan liked power. I will be the strongest vampire to walk this earth. He\u2019d ruled his clan. Now it was time to rule all the vamps. It was his time.</p><p>He needed Keira back under his control because he wanted to study her. Heath wasn\u2019t the only doctor at his beck and call. Sure, magic was still his favorite pet, but Lorcan had also learned the value of science.</p><p>On its own, Keira\u2019s blood was useless to him. The power was only active when she bonded with the werewolf.</p><p>So I let the werewolf have you, for a time. He could have taken Keira from that little bar at any point. He hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d waited. He\u2019d let Alerac get to her because he needed for those two to exchange blood once more.</p><p>He was sure that the werewolf had given into his hunger for Keira by now.</p><p>So I have to get the blood now. The blood, and Keira.</p><p>Since making the discovery about the vampire and werewolf matings, Lorcan had drained his share of werewolves. He had received a slight strength increase from that wolf blood, but nothing like what the stories said the mated pairs enjoyed.</p><p>Lorcan didn\u2019t want a sliver of power. He wanted everything.</p><p>Keira was his key.</p><p>\u201cYou get to her,\u201d he told Heath and he smiled, letting his fangs flash. \u201cOr you die.\u201d Simple fact. Either the werewolves would kill the doctor for stumbling onto their land\u2014</p><p>Or I\u2019ll kill the fool when he fails.</p><p>Heath jumped to his feet. He hurried for the door. But then, he stopped. Glancing over his shoulder, the doctor said, \u201cWhen I do this, when I bring her to you, promise that you\u2019ll turn me then.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no, he wasn\u2019t turning this prick. But he vaguely remembered making some sort of offer, so he just said, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s eyes became suspicious slits. Maybe he wasn\u2019t as dumb as he appeared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live forever, never aging, never changing,\u201d Lorcan murmured, with a bored wave of his hand, \u201conce Keira is brought back to me.\u201d</p><p>Heath nodded and reached for the door once more.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Lorcan said. This was going to be the fun part. \u201cIf you go running to them with a sob story about me, you have to at least look as if you suffered a bit while in captivity.\u201d</p><p>The color bleached from Heath\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cIf you go to them all hale and hearty, then they\u2019ll never believe you were my prisoner.\u201d</p><p>The human\u2019s pulse was racing.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s make sure they believe,\u201d Lorcan said. \u201cLet\u2019s make real sure.\u201d</p><p>He attacked.</p><p>\u201cWe have traitors in our midst.\u201d Alerac\u2019s voice boomed out into the night. He wanted to clear the air, fuckin\u2019 then. If any others had turned on him, Alerac wanted to face them.</p><p>The werewolves\u2014all in human form\u2014were gathered around him. At his announcement, there were uneasy murmurs from the group.</p><p>Jane stood just behind Alerac, with her brother close at her side.</p><p>Ryan. That man was going to keep being a fuckin\u2019 thorn in his side.</p><p>But Alerac owed him. Because it seemed that Ryan had saved Jane\u2019s life at that stream.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, traitors?\u201d Finn demanded, his eyes narrowed and his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cLiam attacked my mate tonight. He took her blood. He tried to take her from me.\u201d The rage was still there. The rage and the pain of betrayal. Liam had been at his side for so long. How had he missed this? How? \u201cThree werewolves were with him. Saul. Benjamin, and Mitchell.\u201d He let his gaze sweep the group. \u201cThose three are dead, killed by my claws, but Liam escaped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because Alerac had made a choice. Track Liam or follow Jane\u2019s scent. He\u2019d followed Jane.</p><p>More murmurs and whispers swept through the group.</p><p>Did they doubt what he was telling them?</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>Fuck, yes, they did.</p><p>Finn stepped forward. \u201cWe don\u2019t like having vampires in our midst!\u201d</p><p>There were nods. Growls of agreement. They growled, even when in the form of men and women.</p><p>Suspicious stares were cast toward Jane and Ryan.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Ben and Saul were the ones attacked,\u201d Finn added. \u201cMaybe your vamp was the one to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alerac had him by the throat before he could say anything more. \u201cYou question my word? The word of your alpha?\u201d</p><p>Finn couldn\u2019t speak to respond, mostly because Alerac was crushing the guy\u2019s windpipe.</p><p>But Finn did manage to shake his head\u2014no.</p><p>\u201cNo one threatens Jane and lives.\u201d Simple. His word\u2014his pack law. He released Finn. The guy sucked in a deep breath.</p><p>Suspicion churned within Alerac. He\u2019d been blind to Liam\u2019s betrayal. Was he still being blind now? \u201cIf there are others helping Liam, siding with him, I will learn the truth.\u201d</p> <p>There weren\u2019t any murmurs then. Just considering glances. No, those were suspicious glances. The wolves seemed to weigh each other.</p><p>\u201cI brought you here,\u201d Alerac said, voice strong and cold. \u201cI created this pack. If any of you think to turn on me\u2014then challenge me, now. Come at me. See if you have what it takes to be alpha.\u201d Because he was sure ready to kick the shit out of someone.</p><p>Only none of the wolves approached him.</p><p>Their heads lowered in submission.</p><p>He\u2019d found these wolves over the years. They\u2019d been alone, lost. He\u2019d brought them together.</p><p>No, not just me. Liam was at my side. Would the wolves feel they owed their allegiance to him?</p><p>Or to Liam?</p><p>His gaze swept the group once more. Stopped on a pair of angry brown eyes.</p> <p>Zoe. She and Finn were the two newest members of the pack. Finn had seemed to fit in with the others instantly, but Zoe had remained aloof.</p><p>Zoe wasn\u2019t like the others. She was a werewolf who couldn\u2019t shift. The beast within her had never been able to push its way out, not completely.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s dark hair was still wet from the storm. The rain had stopped just minutes ago. \u201cYou called her your mate!\u201d A faint southern accent whispered beneath Zoe\u2019s words. \u201cIs that what she is?\u201d</p><p>To Alerac, Jane had been his mate for centuries. But he glanced back at Jane.</p><p>She was staring at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cVampires make us nervous,\u201d another werewolf called out. \u201cWe follow your orders, but, alpha, we need to know just who you are bringing into our pack.\u201d</p><p>He should have known that it would come to this. Fear could live in the heart of any man. Or beast.</p><p>\u201cIs she your mate?\u201d Zoe pressed. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t remember a claiming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why Liam went after her.\u201d The words came from another werewolf. Denton. \u201cMaybe he wanted a claim. I can smell him on her.\u201d</p><p>Claws burst from Alerac\u2019s hands. In an instant, he\u2019d slashed that jerk. Denton had always been a mouthy SOB. \u201cThe only scent on her is mine. Just because Liam attacked her, it doesn\u2019t give him a claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlerac...\u201d Jane\u2019s voice was soft, worried.</p><p>But it was Zoe\u2019s hand that reached out to Alerac. She touched his shoulder. That light touch stopped him from killing Denton. \u201cMaybe you should make a claim them,\u201d she told him quietly. Her eyes were worried. \u201cA claim would reassure...\u201d Zoe swallowed, and said, \u201call of us.\u201d Her eyes sent him the message that he needed to heed her words. \u201cA public claiming is the way of the pack.\u201d</p><p>It was.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t claim an unwilling bride.</p><p>\u201cOh, the hell, no,\u201d Ryan snarled, leaping toward them. \u201cThis dog isn\u2019t mating with my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Four werewolves closed in on him.</p><p>Alerac lifted his hand. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>They stopped.</p><p>Dammit. He should have seen this problem before. Zoe was trying to help him. He got that. To reassure his pack\u2014the pack that remained in the middle of this freakin\u2019 mutiny\u2014he needed to claim his vampire. Then the others wouldn\u2019t be so worried that she was going to turn on them.</p><p>Or...um, feed on them.</p><p>She only drinks from me.</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to shout her name but this wasn\u2019t exactly the time for endearments and soft promises.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the type for those promises anyway.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t step toward him. She just stared back at him. Hell, if she rejected him in front of his pack, what would he do then?</p><p>He turned his back on the wolves. Then hesitated. \u201cDon\u2019t kill the male vampire. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Zoe pushed through the crowd that had surrounded Ryan. \u201cI\u2019ll keep him alive.\u201d She positioned herself in front of a frowning Ryan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection,\u201d Ryan muttered.</p><p>\u201cRight, Drac. Whatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied that Ryan would keep living\u2014for the moment\u2014Alerac eliminated the distance between him and Jane.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jane asked him. Her neck had healed, but Zoe was right. Liam\u2019s scent was on her.</p><p>Bastard. You will suffer for this.</p><p>Liam had gone right after the one thing that Alerac valued most. Why?</p><p>\u201cI called you my mate in front of the pack.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even sure that had been an accident. Maybe he\u2019d realized, deep down, exactly what he was doing. \u201cThe wolves are nervous about having a vampire here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo vampires,\u201d she said, voice soft.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd with three of their own dead, they need reassurance.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered, concealing her gaze.</p><p>\u201cIf you accept my claim, then you\u2019re part of the pack. You\u2019re part of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d look like a fool. He\u2019d also have to fight all of the werewolves who wanted to go for her throat and for Ryan\u2019s. \u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure you get a safe escort to wherever you want to go.\u201d There was no need for her to know the rest.</p><p>Her lashes lifted. \u201cWhat is a werewolf claiming? Does it mean we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re dating?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cIt\u2019s like marriage.\u201d Only there was no divorce for them. No out clause. The claiming was forever. Beyond life and death.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to marry you?\u201d He could see himself reflected in her eyes. A scary sight. Why the hell would she want to be saddled with him?</p><p>She was already afraid of him, and she didn\u2019t even know half of the things that he\u2019d done in his life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to trust me.\u201d His voice was low, but he knew the others would still be able to overhear him. \u201cI\u2019ve protected you so far. I want to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>But then she made the breath leave his lungs. Made his heart damn near burst from his chest.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI want more than safety.\u201d</p><p>Hell. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He would try to give it to her. He would try\u2014</p><p>\u201cI want my life back.\u201d</p><p>Ice encased his skin.</p><p>The werewolves began to whisper behind him. He prepared for battle. The first wolf that attacked her would lose a limb.</p><p>He straightened his shoulders. He\u2019d been the one to take her life away. He\u2019d be the one to make sure she got it back. That she got everything back. \u201cJust stay behind me,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s about to get bloody.\u201d</p><p>He turned away.</p><p>She touched him. Wrapped her fingers around his arm, just as Zoe had done. Only when Zoe touched him, his blood hadn\u2019t heated. His body hadn\u2019t tensed. Need hadn\u2019t pounded through him as his beast clamored for escape.</p><p>For her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to fight them all?\u201d</p><p>Silence from the wolves. They had to be tensing for battle, too.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Now Jane sounded confused. \u201cThey\u2019re your family. They didn\u2019t all attack me. It was just the ones in the woods.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. But if he didn\u2019t claim her, they\u2019d grow more suspicious of her. Vampires and werewolves had a very long blood feud going.</p><p>One that wasn\u2019t ending overnight. His claim would protect her.</p><p>Without it, he\u2019d make sure that his claws and teeth did the job.</p><p>Her hold tightened on him. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d taken his choice away.</p><p>Alerac pulled from her. Kept his spine straight and his chin up as he met the stares of his pack. His claim had just been publicly refused. That should have been humiliating.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He just...his chest hurt.</p><p>Alerac lifted his claws. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be first?\u201d He was alpha for a reason. He\u2019d prove that fact again this night. Before the sun rose, their blood would be on the ground. Jane would be safe.</p><p>He did a \u201ccome here\u201d motion with his claws. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane\u2019s yell.</p><p>And then Jane was there. In front of him. Grabbing his wrists. Pushing her body against his. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing this for me!\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was. He wasn\u2019t going to let her be threatened.</p><p>Jane shook her head. \u201cNo, not for me.\u201d Her pulse raced. He could smell the fear that drifted from her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the scent of fear on Jane.</p><p>He preferred the sweet scent of her desire.</p><p>\u201cI accept your claim.\u201d</p><p>He liked it when\u2014</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to fight. No need to turn on your own. I accept your claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ryan muttered.</p><p>Her fingers were stroking the inside of his wrists. She was trying to soothe him. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to be soothed.</p><p>She\u2019d just accepted his claim. That changed everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Her voice was a breathless whisper.</p><p>\u201cNow...\u201d Alerac turned her in his arms, positioning her so that all would see just what was coming. \u201cI take you. I make you mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>She was a creature straight from some kid\u2019s nightmare. A blood-drinker. An immortal power.</p><p>And her knees were shaking.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s hard body pressed behind her. She could feel the strong muscles of his chest. The ripple of his cut abs. He hadn\u2019t bothered with a shirt, so it was all too easy to feel the strength of his bare muscles against her.</p><p>He\u2019d jerked on a pair of jeans. And his cock was, ah, definitely getting bigger and harder behind her.</p><p>Everyone was staring at her.</p><p>\u201cUh, Alerac...\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure just how the werewolves did things, but putting on a show for the pack wasn\u2019t her idea of a good time.</p><p>\u201cDo you accept my claim?\u201d His voice seemed to thunder behind her.</p><p>Jane nodded.</p><p>Then she jumped when she felt his breath whisper against her ear. \u201cYou have to say the words, a r\u00fansearc.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Okay. \u201cI accept your claim.\u201d</p><p>The werewolves started shouting then. She wasn\u2019t sure if those were celebrating shouts or we-want-to-kill-her shouts.</p><p>It was too hard to tell the difference.</p><p>That whisper of his breath slid away from her ear as his mouth moved down to her neck.</p><p>Jane couldn\u2019t help it. She tensed even more. The memory of Liam holding her down and tearing into her throat was far too fresh in her mind.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to trust Alerac.</p><p>\u201cIt will only hurt for an instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Jane began.</p><p>But it was too late. His teeth sank into her. Not her throat, but right at the curve of her shoulder. It did hurt, but, like he\u2019d said, the pain only lasted an instant. A white- hot pulse that charged through her body.</p><p>After that pain, pleasure. She gasped because she\u2019d only been prepared for pain. Not for this.</p><p>More pules of pleasure shot through her, starting right there, where his mouth was on her skin, and they surged down...straight down to her sex.</p><p>He was licking her. Kissing her skin.</p><p>And she was about to climax just from his mouth on her.</p><p>Horrified\u2014they\u2019re watching\u2014Jane spun in his arms.</p><p>Those arms closed tightly around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d His voice carried easily over the shouts. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been so bad. She looked up at him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re...mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeira!\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked at Ryan\u2019s bellow. The werewolves were holding him back. Had the guy tried to lunge forward and stop the claiming?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Zoe still stood in front of him. She was frowning up at Ryan. \u201cDumb, Drac, dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this!\u201d Ryan yelled at Jane. \u201cDon\u2019t trade your life again. Don\u2019t do it for me!\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t. Jane shook her head. \u201cI did this for me.\u201d</p><p>Then she was being lifted up in Alerac\u2019s arms. He carried her into the main house. Before he crossed that threshold, he glanced back. \u201cZoe, keep the male vampire alive.\u201d</p><p>Zoe nodded.</p><p>Alerac glanced over at the rest of his pack. \u201cLiam is banished. If you see him, take the bastard down. He will not hurt this pack again. Search the woods. Protect the borders. Do not turn your back on him.\u201d</p><p>Their faces were grim. Jane realized that they were all going to be hunting Liam now. He\u2019d been a brother to them one moment, then a traitor the next.</p><p>Why? Alerac had trusted him. She was pretty sure Alerac had loved him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As had the others.</p><p>Now there would be no room for love.</p><p>Only death.</p> <p>Alerac turned from the assembled wolves. He carried her inside, and he shut the rest of the world.</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes you think she\u2019s less,\u201d the small female said as she glared up at Ryan, \u201cbecause your sister just tied herself to a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Ryan barred his fangs at her. Her scent...He shook his head, feeling a little drunk. Maybe that was just fury making him feel that way. Four werewolves were holding him in place\u2014two on each side of him. If it hadn\u2019t been for their cutting grip, he would have rushed up and stopped Alerac long before the alpha claimed Keira.</p><p>\u201cIt was her choice,\u201d the woman continued. Her skin was the most delectable shade of dark cream that he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cLet it be, and you\u2019ll both be under pack protection.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like he gave a damn about that. \u201cThe same pack that attacked her just an hour ago?\u201d He was tired of those SOBs holding him. His fangs were ready to rip and tear.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her.</p><p>She shook her head. Then she pointed to the werewolves. \u201cLet him go. I\u2019ll watch the vamp.\u201d</p><p>They let him go. Just like that.</p><p>The other werewolves were all backing away. The show was over, so they were gone? Forget that.</p><p>He stalked toward the main house\u2019s entrance.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to interrupt him right now.\u201d She sighed and said, \u201cWhether you\u2019re her brother or not, Alerac might just take your head if you interrupt the bonding ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Ryan halted. \u201cI can take Alerac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you\u2019re an ancient vampire?\u201d She rolled her dark eyes. \u201cBig deal. Alerac has killed plenty of those.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s not just a werewolf. Not anymore. Not thanks to her.\u201d</p><p>His sister had changed Alerac. That change made the alpha even more dangerous.</p><p>He turned his head. Found his gaze sliding right back to the woman. She was small and delicate, when werewolves were normally built along much harder, tougher lines. Her dark eyes were wide, almond shaped, and her full lips were set determinedly.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Ryan demanded as he studied her. She looked young, barely twenty-five, but werewolves and their ages could be deceptive.</p> <p>Not as deceptive as a vampire\u2019s age of course but...</p><p>\u201cZoe.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt her. You know he can\u2019t.\u201d She glanced toward the sky. \u201cThe sun\u2019s rising soon. You need to get to shelter.\u201d</p><p>Shelter wasn\u2019t what he needed. \u201cKeira is being hunted.\u201d</p><p>Zoe gave a little shrug as she headed away from him. \u201cI think she calls herself Jane now.\u201d</p><p>He stared after her.</p><p>\u201cSunlight makes you weak, right? I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d want the others to see you that way.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cNo one is letting you leave, by the way. So you can come willingly with me, or one of those guys\u2014\u201d She pointed toward the wolves who lingered near the edge of the woods. \u201cThose guys will just lock you up until Alerac is ready to deal with you.\u201d</p><p>Deal with\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe said we couldn\u2019t kill you, not that we couldn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t looking at him any longer. \u201cAfter the pain vampires have inflicted on this pack, there are plenty of werewolves looking for some payback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of some mangy wolves.\u201d</p><p>The words were barely out of his mouth before he found claws at his throat. Her claws. \u201cMaybe you should be,\u201d Zoe snapped.</p><p>He smiled at her\u2014and knocked those claws away. In the next breath, she was trapped in his arms, and his teeth were inches from her throat. Her scent\u2014so heady, so tempting\u2014dared him to take a bite.</p><p>But when he looked up, he saw the wolves circling in on him.</p><p>Ryan let her go. Except...he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>He wanted to bite.</p><p>He locked his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you for today. You keep your claws off me, and I\u2019ll keep my teeth out of you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. He\u2019d try.</p><p>She was just...tempting.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d Ryan pushed.</p><p>She smiled at him. The woman actually flashed dimples as she said, \u201cI don\u2019t make deals with vampires.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t usually want to fuck werewolves.</p><p>\u201cBut I think we can avoid killing each other until nightfall.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like a plan.</p><p>He followed her away from the main house, enjoying the sway of her ass. A very nice ass, one that was encased in tight jeans.</p><p>\u201cAre you this fierce when you shift into a beast?\u201d Ryan asked her, curious. Because if she was, the woman would be one dangerous killing machine.</p><p>She stopped at the door of a two-story cabin, one with a row of flowers growing on its side. Pain flickered over her face. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe that.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slashed up to meet his. \u201cBelieve it. What you see is what you get.\u201d Zoe swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t shift. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A werewolf who couldn\u2019t shift? He stared after her, and he felt shame. Shame that he\u2019d attacked her. Shame that he\u2019d made her hurt and\u2014</p><p>\u201cGet your ass in here, Drac, before you burn.\u201d</p><p>He got his ass in that cabin.</p><p>Heath stared at the pool of blood on the floor. His blood. Just inches from his face.</p><p>He should move. Get up. Run.</p><p>But he just felt so weak.</p><p>A door opened. Closed. Footsteps came into the room. Soft, rustling.</p><p>\u201cHello, witch.\u201d That was Lorcan\u2019s rough voice.</p><p>The footsteps stopped. Heath managed to turn his head, just a few inches, and he saw the woman.</p><p>No, not just a normal woman, a witch.</p><p>She was beautiful, with golden hair and deep eyes. But those eyes looked wrong\u2014broken.</p><p>His gaze slid to her neck, and to the deep marks there. Would he soon bear similar scars?</p><p>Lorcan destroys everything that he touches.</p><p>The witch stared down at Heath. Pity softened her face. \u201cI thought you were going to let him live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Lorcan just sounded bored. He usually did. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my dear, I didn\u2019t drain him dry. He\u2019ll be able to pull himself off the floor soon enough.\u201d</p><p>The legs of a chair screeched as they were shoved across the wooden floor. Then Lorcan appeared. He wrapped his hands around the witch. Pulled her close.</p><p>The vampire acted as if he didn\u2019t even feel the flinch that shook her. \u201cDo you have the cure?\u201d he asked as he bent to lick the woman\u2019s neck.</p><p>The pain had lessened in Heath\u2019s neck. What cure?</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. Her eyes didn\u2019t actually look broken so much as dead.</p><p>\u201cOnce she discovers that she has a brother, Keira\u2014I mean, Jane\u2014will pay dearly for that cure.\u201d</p><p>Jane had a brother?</p><p>I can use that. I can use this cure. Heath kept his body still on the floor, not wanting to draw Lorcan\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cPity for her,\u201d Lorcan muttered, \u201cthat she didn\u2019t get the cure sooner. Now it\u2019s time for Ryan to die. Time for him to burn.\u201d He laughed then. \u201cAnd he will burn, from the inside, out. He\u2019ll die screaming. He won\u2019t even last another full day.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan freed the witch. He stalked toward Heath and kicked him in the ribs. \u201cAnd, human, it\u2019s time for you to finish our deal. Go get Jane. Bring her to me.\u201d</p><p>Heath crawled for the door. And, with every painful inch, he planned.</p><p>She\u2019d chosen him. Him.</p><p>Alerac kicked the bedroom door shut behind him. His hands were shaking. The control he\u2019d kept so carefully was being torn to shreds.</p><p>Jane waited in the middle of the bedroom. Her arms were by her sides and her feet shifted nervously. \u201cAh, what happens now?\u201d</p><p>Now he took her.</p><p>But first...Alerac cleared his throat, and tried to speak with the voice of the man. Hard, when the beast was clawing his way to freedom. \u201cYou have to bite me.\u201d</p><p>Her sensual lips parted. \u201cI-I already have.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat was different. That was about survival. This time, it\u2019s for bonding.\u201d He crossed to her. His fingers lifted, and his thumb pressed against her lips.</p><p>She stared at him, and the darkness spread in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou drink from me so that we can be linked.\u201d</p><p>Her breath blew lightly over his thumb. \u201cI\u2019ll get more of your memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d That didn\u2019t matter to him. She\u2019d chosen to be his mate, so there was no going back now. He wanted her to know all of him. Good. Bad. Everything gray that fell between.</p><p>No matter what she saw in his memories, he would find a way to prove to Jane that he could be better. That their life together could be a happy one.</p><p>Her fangs were growing. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have found vampire fangs sexy. He did, but only on her.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He invited her as he forced his hand to drop. \u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers rose and pressed against his chest. The palm of her right hand was just over his tattoo, and the mark seemed to burn at her touch.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Jane asked. Her gaze had fallen on the edges of that tattoo. \u201cHow do you even have it? I would think that when you shift, it would vanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a special tattoo.\u201d And it had taken two days to get it. Two days of gut-wrenching pain. Because she was right\u2014a normal tattoo would have vanished with his shift. \u201cA witch made a magic ink for me. One that would last forever.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell her what the Celtic knot meant, not then. Alerac didn\u2019t reveal that the tattoo itself was a symbol of forever, that the corners symbolized his search. North. South. East. West. He\u2019d vowed to search every corner of the earth.</p><p>For her.</p><p>She\u2019d already accepted his claim. In that moment, he just wanted to focus on the present. On making sure the bond that they created was strong.</p><p>Her eyes met his. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Liam bit me...\u201d Her body trembled. \u201cIt hurt. I don\u2019t want to do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you bite me, it\u2019s not about pain.\u201d His fingers slid down her body. Gripped her slender waist. \u201cOnly pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 vow it.\u201d</p><p>Jane gave a small nod. Then she rose onto her toes. Her mouth was on his throat. Yes. He felt the lick of her tongue. The caress of her lips.</p><p>The bite of her teeth.</p><p>His control shattered as the pleasure pumped through him.</p><p>He pulled her tighter against him. Held her closer. His cock was fully erect, desperate to thrust inside of her. He was desperate.</p><p>Her mouth on him...the pleasure was almost as strong as the release he found when he was thrusting into her body.</p><p>He shoved down her jeans. She kicked them away, along with her shoes.</p><p>He tore her underwear. Tossed it.</p><p>Her mouth was still on him.</p><p>He wanted in her.</p><p>He lifted her lips. Jane\u2019s legs wrapped around him. Her tongue pressed over his skin. She was lifting her teeth\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he ordered. Or maybe he begged.</p><p>He took two steps. The bed was too far. He pushed her back against the nearest wall. Held her in his arms. Drove as deep into her as he could go.</p><p>He filled her. Every single inch of her hot core. She was tight and wet, and he had no control. None.</p><p>He was holding her too tightly. Driving in to her too deeply. But he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Again and again, he thrust into her. Deeper. Harder. More.</p><p>She came, bucking against him, and her mouth pulled from his as she cried out his name.</p><p>Her sex clenched around him, spasming with her release. Those milking contractions propelled him to his own climax. He thrust hard into her. And erupted.</p><p>The pleasure blazed through him, consuming him from the inside out.</p><p>Her breath heaved out. So did his. Alerac\u2019s heartbeat raced in his chest.</p><p>He looked down at her. Jane\u2019s eyes were wide, her face flushed with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done.\u201d Not even close. But at least he\u2019d taken the edge off. Now he could make it to the bed, and he did. He carried her toward the four-poster. Made sure not to let his claws hurt her skin.</p><p>He eased her down on the covers. She started to lie down on her back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He turned her onto her stomach. Put her hands down. Lifted her onto her knees. She glanced back at him. \u201cAlerac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you this way.\u201d Gravel-rough.</p><p>Her gaze fell to this cock. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d And he was about to, again. He pushed into her, and she was slick and swollen from her release. Thrusting into her right then was better than the best dream he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Her fingers clenched the bed covers. A moan spilled from her throat.</p><p>He covered her with his body. Alerac put his mouth on her shoulder. He\u2019d marked her there, in front of the pack. Now he\u2019d mark her while they were alone.</p><p>In and out. He thrust slowly, holding back the pleasure. In. Out.</p><p>It was his turn to lick her skin. To taste her.

Driving into her as deeply as he could go. He\u2019d been kept apart from her for far too long. He\u2019d had too many empty nights, too many dreams of her. He\u2019d woken, alone, lost, bellowing her name.</p> <p>She was with him now. Linked, bound, forever.</p><p>There was no escape.</p><p>His release was even stronger this time. His heart nearly burst from him as held her tighter.</p><p>No escape.</p><p>Because, if he lost her again, Alerac knew he\u2019d go mad.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take his punishment.\u201d</p><p>The words were soft, almost broken.</p><p>They were her words.</p><p>Jane could see herself, a small figure surrounded by angry vampires. She was staring straight ahead and offering to take someone\u2019s\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Those words...that was Alerac\u2019s voice.</p> <p>She looked down and saw a knife hanging from her chest. No, not her chest\u2014Alerac\u2019s.</p><p>This was his memory. She was seeing everything from his point of view again.</p><p>The knife was yanked from him. The silver burned, and smoke drifted up from the wound. Then the blade was pushed against Alerac\u2019s throat.</p><p>A vampire stood there, eyes shining as he glared down at Alerac. His dark hair was swept back from his high forehead. His lips twisted in disgust. \u201cThe punishment is death,\u201d the dark vampire said. \u201cHe came here, he used you, in order to get into our midst. To attack us from within.\u201d</p><p>Wait\u2014that vampire had to be the one Alerac had warned her about\u2014Lorcan. That guy was obviously the boss in this little nightmare scene.</p><p>She\u2019d expected him to look like a monster. He didn\u2019t. He was handsome, seemingly in the bloom of his youth. It was only when he looked deeply into Alerac\u2019s eyes that she could see the flare of evil.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019ve started turning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Lorcan demanded to know.</p> <p>\u201cY-yesterday.\u201d</p><p>The knife was lifted from Alerac\u2019s throat. His hands clenched as he pulled at the silver manacles that bound him.</p><p>\u201cHe used you!\u201d Lorcan snapped. Alerac\u2019s blood dripped from the knife. \u201cAnd yet you would give your life for him? Why?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond right away.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s shout filled the chamber.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love him.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan smiled, but it was a cold and cruel sight. \u201cYou can\u2019t die for him, Keira. You have too much value to us.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut you can take his punishment. After all, you were the one to bring him in to our clan. A dog, walking among gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no god,\u201d Alerac snarled.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cOne hundred years. That\u2019s the penalty for treason in our clan. Imprisonment. Starvation. For one hundred years.\u201d</p><p>One hundred years. How could even a vampire survive that long without some kind of food? Because he\u2019d said starvation\u2014</p><p>\u201cI will take the punishment, but you have to promise me that Alerac lives. No matter what else happens, he lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lorcan\u2019s lips were twisted into a sly smile. \u201cBy the time you are free, he\u2019ll be long dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear it, Lorcan. Vow it to me on the blood.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s gaze returned to Alerac. \u201cI vow it,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>The vampires hauled her away. Shackles were put around her wrists as Alerac watched, and something...broke in him. He lunged to his feet, roaring, as his beast pushed for freedom. He yanked the manacles from the wall.</p><p>The images vanished into a swirl of darkness.</p><p>For once, Jane preferred the darkness. Fear was acid in her gut, churning, destroying.</p><p>But the darkness didn\u2019t last.</p><p>New images slipped before her. The dark haired vampire\u2014Lorcan. She knew him now. Knew him through Alerac\u2019s memories. He was the bastard who had imprisoned her.</p><p>Then he was before her. No, not before her, but before Alerac. Another vision, another one starring Lorcan. He was smiling his twisted, evil grin.</p><p>\u201cI said you would get to live.\u201d Lorcan bent and picked up the silver knife. \u201cBut I never vowed that you would not suffer.\u201d</p><p>Another vampire yanked back Alerac\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll start with your eyes,\u201d Lorcan said. \u201cAfter all, what good is a wolf who cannot see?\u201d</p><p>The blade came toward him. The silver burned and cut and the pain rolled through him.</p><p>In her mind, Jane was screaming. She was crying. She was so desperate to escape that silver knife.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see Lorcan any longer. She saw red\u2014blood.</p><p>Then she saw nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane reached for her eyes, sobbing. She\u2019d been sentenced to a lifetime of darkness. She hadn\u2019t meant\u2014</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>Her breath froze.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her wrists. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t lower her hands. \u201cI saw more of your memories.\u201d She was sure starting to think that she was far better off without the knowledge of the past.</p><p>The past freaking terrified her.</p><p>Jane forced herself to take a deep breath. Then she lowered her hands. \u201cLorcan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw him in the visions?\u201d</p><p>Saw him, and would never be able to forget that SOB. He\u2019d enjoyed hurting her\u2014and Alerac. Jane nodded. \u201cI saw what he did...to you.\u201d She looked into his eyes, those glowing eyes that didn\u2019t belong to a man.</p><p>But to the beast.</p><p>\u201cHe took your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s chest was bare. The sheet tangled around his waist. He leaned over her, caging her against the covers.</p><p>Her hand lifted to his cheek. \u201cHe took your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I plan to take a hell of a lot more from him.\u201d</p><p>Was that supposed to make her feel better? It didn\u2019t. \u201cIs that why your eyes glow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost the eyes of the man.\u201d No emotion was in his voice. \u201cWhen a werewolves shifts, the beasts heal our injuries. When I finally healed, the beast gave me even better eyes than I\u2019d had before. Stronger. Sharper.\u201d</p><p>Finally healed. \u201cHow long did it take you to heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t an answer.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Now there was emotion sliding through his mask as he eased away from her.</p><p>She thought it did matter. \u201cOne hundred years.\u201d That had been the punishment determined by Lorcan. \u201cYou searched for me, all that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cIt was two hundred years. After you took the knife and stabbed Lorcan,\u201d a wry smile curved his lips as he seemed to recall the memory, \u201che got pissed and upped your sentence.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d stabbed the guy.</p><p>Good.</p><p>The two hundred years part? Not so good. Yet somehow that didn\u2019t bother her as much as the fact that... \u201cHe cut out your eyes. I-I thought you were supposed to be protected.\u201d The vampiress in her vision\u2014Keira, me\u2014she\u2019d wanted to protect Alerac. Not get him tortured.</p><p>Alerac rose from the bed. He walked toward the closet.</p><p>Nice ass.</p><p>He hauled on a pair of jeans and destroyed her nice view. \u201cYou were more important than my damn eyes.\u201d He turned back to face her. \u201cMy pack was coming. We had planned a dawn attack on the vampires. You should have still been there at the keep. They would have gotten you out. Gotten me free. I would have killed Lorcan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill him?\u201d She pulled the covers over her breasts.</p><p>His hand rose and pressed against the tattoo that covered his heart. \u201cBecause he was the only one who knew where you were. He sent men to hide you, to lock you up, and then his witch killed them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember meeting any witches, but, even so, the very idea of them was making her plenty nervous.</p><p>\u201cI had to let Lorcan live as long as you were trapped. He was the only one that would be able to free you. That fuckin\u2019 bastard. I dreamed of killin\u2019 him, again and again.\u201d His accent thickened a bit as his hand dropped. \u201cNow I can. You\u2019re safe, and he\u2019s about to be minus a head.\u201d</p><p>She hurried from the bed. \u201cAll of the other vampires\u2014did you kill them for vengeance?\u201d</p><p>Those images were still in her head, too. Alerac, soaked in blood. Alerac, feeding on them.</p><p>He stared back at her. \u201cThey were allied with Lorcan. I thought they might know where you were.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who can drink memories, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted but she wasn\u2019t sure what to say then.</p><p>\u201cYou changed me.\u201d His voice was low. \u201cI planned to use you. Fuck, you think I like admitting it? Seduce the vampiress, then use her to get inside the castle.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that exactly what he\u2019d done?</p><p>\u201cSomething changed.\u201d He wasn\u2019t touching her. She found that she couldn\u2019t touch him.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>She\u2019d told him that. When they were surrounded by vampires. When she\u2019d traded her life for his.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t given her the same words.</p><p>\u201cI planned to destroy all of the vampires in that clan, but not you. Not you. I was going to take you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d had my blood.\u201d And he\u2019d realized that it made him stronger?</p><p>He gave a grim nod. \u201cBut more than that, I\u2019d had you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlerac\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then she heard the shouts from outside. Angry. Desperate. In the next instant, she and Alerac were both running to the window.</p><p>The sun was still out, and it should have weakened her when she pressed open that glass.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. Just as it hadn\u2019t weakened her when she\u2019d been on that motorcycle with him.</p><p>Because of his blood? Alerac had told her the truth. It sure seemed as if she\u2019d built up some kind of immunity to the sunlight, thanks to him.</p><p>She saw Zoe and Finn. They were rushing toward the main cabin, with\u2014with Heath between them?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d Alerac demanded.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Heath shouted, looking up at that same moment. Blood dripped down his face and neck. \u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><p>She started to race down to him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alerac wrapped his hand around her wrist. \u201cHe\u2019s working for Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>Heath looked as if he were dying.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s gaze found hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll see him together. I want to discover just what game the doc thinks he\u2019s playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not a game? What if he just needs help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sold you out before.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s a killing crime.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back down at Heath\u2019s slumped figure. To her, it appeared as if someone had already tried to kill him.</p><p>And, if Heath didn\u2019t get help soon, he might not survive much longer at all.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Zoe and Finn dropped Heath on the floor. The doc hit the wood and moaned. A pitiful sound.</p><p>An annoying sound.</p><p>Jane attempted to hurry toward the guy.</p><p>Smothering a sigh, Alerac just blocked her path.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop that?\u201d Jane snapped at him.</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t, because he didn\u2019t trust the guy. \u201cYou searched him for weapons?\u201d Alerac demanded of Zoe and Finn.</p><p>Zoe glanced up at him. \u201cNo guns. No knives. No stakes.\u201d Her nose wrinkled. \u201cJust a bloody and beat-up human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was dumped on the south side of our land,\u201d Finn answered quickly. \u201cFound him when I was patrolling to make sure Liam hadn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>Dumped\u2014or delivered?</p><p>\u201cPl-please...\u201d Heath muttered. \u201cHelp...\u201d</p><p>Jane shoved Alerac out of her way and knelt next to the doctor. She turned him over, and when she got a good look at his face, Jane gasped.</p><p>His nose had been broken. His left eye was swollen shut. Blood dripped from his mouth\u2014aw, did the doc lose some teeth?\u2014and gaping wounds covered his throat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...insane...\u201d Heath whispered. \u201cYou...you have to help me...\u201d</p><p>Zoe and Finn were still standing close by.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be taken to a hospital,\u201d Jane said. She looked over at Zoe. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a car to transport him.\u201d</p><p>Heath grabbed her hand.</p><p>Alerac tensed. You\u2019re about to lose that hand.</p><p>\u201cN-no, hospital. I\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d have to explain...the bites...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt. You need help,\u201d Jane told him. \u201cYou could die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-need blood...\u201d</p><p>The hell, no.</p><p>Alerac marched forward. He grabbed Heath and hauled the guy to his feet. \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not this much of a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>The man blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think,\u201d Alerac continued, letting his disgust show, \u201cthat you can drag your carcass in here, after what you\u2019ve done, and get blood from Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-dying...\u201d Heath whispered pitifully.</p><p>\u201cBull.\u201d The wounds actually seemed to already be...healing.</p><p>Healing as Alerac stared at them.</p><p>Suspicion churned in his gut. \u201cYou bastard.\u201d</p><p>Heath tried to pull free.</p><p>Alerac wasn\u2019t letting him go. \u201cYou were her doctor, her friend, for these last six months. She trusted you\u2014and you...you took her blood, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Heath was fighting to get free now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alerac turned his bright stare on Jane. \u201cHe took your blood.\u201d Certainty. Rage.</p><p>She rose to her feet. After a moment, Jane gave a faint nod. \u201cSamples. He said that he needed them for tests.\u201d</p><p>Alerac shook his head. \u201cNo, he needed the blood for its power.\u201d He lifted Heath up into the air, and the smaller man dangled above the floor. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know your type? Greedy, desperate, willing to trade anyone and everyone for the promise of immortality?\u201d</p> <p>Heath stopped looking quite so beaten. His lips twisted in a hard snarl. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you did when you took her blood? Werewolves aren\u2019t supposed to live as long as you have. You found out that vamp blood can extend your life. You found\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s claws were out. \u201cThis is the part where you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane jumped forward. \u201cDammit, no!</p><p>Heath started to smile.</p><p>But then Jane continued, \u201cWe can\u2019t kill him yet. We have to find out what he knows about Lorcan first.\u201d</p> <p>That wiped Heath\u2019s smile away.</p><p>Alerac nodded. Then he said, \u201cFinn, get some rope. I want to make sure this SOB is tied up tight.\u201d</p><p>Heath was fighting now. Too late.</p><p>Jane stared at him, anger coursing through her veins. \u201cYou really were just going to sell me out that night, weren\u2019t you? Just hand me right over to Lorcan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to Lorcan, not then.\u201d He huffed out a hard breath. \u201cTo the other werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Rage nearly choked Alerac then. \u201cLiam.\u201d</p> <p>A frantic nod from Heath. \u201cH-he was the one I called. He arranged for the guys in those SUVs to meet us.\u201d His words tumbled over each other. \u201cMan, I swear, I didn\u2019t even know Lorcan then.\u201d</p><p>Then. Alerac dropped the bastard to the floor. \u201cSo when did you make Lorcan\u2019s fine acquaintance?\u201d</p><p>Heath didn\u2019t rise from the floor. He curled in on himself. \u201cA-after. The men who were left...they were trying to figure out how to get Jane\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alerac growled.</p><p>Heath flinched. \u201cBut Lorcan found us first. It was like hell came at them. Lorcan broke into the house, and he killed them all in seconds. Every last one. He took their heads.\u201d A thick swallow. \u201cTheir organs.\u201d</p><p>Same old twisted Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cBut he let you live?\u201d The question came from a doubting Zoe. \u201cYour story is crap.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s head lifted. His eyes slid toward Jane. \u201cHe smelled your blood on me. He let me live because of that. I told him that we were friends. Th-that I could help him to find you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alerac wanted to rip him apart, \u201cwhat you told him was that you\u2019d betray Jane, that you\u2019d sell her out.\u201d And he already had a pretty good idea of the price that Heath would have demanded. \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re gonna trade Jane for immortality?\u201d Probably a fat wad of cash, too.</p><p>Heath shook his head. \u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand!\u201d His eyes locked on Jane. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to kill you! You\u2019re part of his clan. He just wants you back.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d taken the human inside.</p><p>Lorcan smiled. Either Jane would trust the doctor\u2014or Heath would die.</p><p>When he\u2019d first found Heath, the human had been so desperate. Crying. Begging.</p><p>Once, Lorcan had enjoyed it when his prey begged. Now it just bored him.</p><p>But he\u2019d spared Heath because Lorcan had known that he could use the human as a distraction, at the right time.</p><p>The time is right now.</p><p>He lifted his hand to his throat. It still ached, but the pain was more of a memory. Lorcan had long ago grown used to pain\u2014both giving it and taking it. He\u2019d made sure that the doctor enjoyed plenty of pain before Heath had been allowed to venture to Jane\u2019s side.</p><p>He knew what was happening inside that wolf pack. The betrayal. The battle.</p><p>Liam had turned on Alerac. He\u2019d thought the two wolves were as close as brothers. But even a brother would kill you if there was enough power involved.</p><p>Lorcan had killed both of his brothers centuries ago. A witch had come to Lorcan long before he\u2019d ever tasted his first sip of blood. She\u2019d told him that his brothers were destined to destroy him.</p><p>He\u2019d destroyed them first. As their blood had soaked the ground beneath his feet, he\u2019d learned just how valuable a witch could be.</p><p>A witch\u2019s power could change the world.</p><p>And the right vampire\u2014he could rule the paranormal world.</p><p>Normally, he wouldn\u2019t give a damn about werewolf politics, but Liam had crossed the line. He\u2019d hurt Jane.</p><p>Twice, Liam had sent vampires after her.</p><p>My own damn kind. The knowledge still burned.</p><p>Those vampires could have killed Jane. They hadn\u2019t realized just what an immense mistake they were making.</p><p>No one could kill Jane. She belonged to him. Not just as a clansman, but so much more.</p><p>He was the only one left who remembered the bond that had been forged so long ago. Perhaps it was time for him to enlighten the others.</p><p>For them to truly see that there was no hope for Jane and Alerac. The lovers weren\u2019t going to get some romantic, happy ending.</p><p>It was too late for that.</p><p>Jane was already linked to another, through blood and pain, until death.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to kill you! You\u2019re part of his clan. He just wants you back.\u201d</p><p>Right. Jane didn\u2019t buy that line for an instant. Not with the images of Lorcan still swirling in her mind.</p><p>Finn came back into the room, holding thick rope in his hands. Alerac dumped Heath into the nearest chair, and they tied him up tight. Tight enough to cut off the circulation.</p><p>Then Alerac backed up. He cocked a brow and glanced at Jane. \u201cWant to go first?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she had plenty of questions for her friend. \u201cHow did you know to find me in that swamp?\u201d When she\u2019d been walking alone, covered in dirt and grime. Her mind broken. Her body convulsing from hunger. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t some vacation trip. Some coincidence.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s gaze glanced around, sweeping the room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t expect Liam to come to your aid,\u201d Alerac snapped at him. \u201cThe pack knows he\u2019s a traitor. He\u2019s been hunted now.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d Jane demanded.</p><p>\u201cL-Liam told me where to find you. Said he\u2019d drunk the memory from some vamp years ago. The enchantment that held you prisoner was supposed to fall away this year, and he figured that if you were strong enough, you\u2019d crawl your way to freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was she?\u201d Alerac\u2019s voice was low.</p><p>In his binds, Heath shrugged. Some blood still dripped from his wounds. \u201cAll I know is she dug her way out of a grave in that swamp.\u201d</p><p>A grave. \u201cI was buried alive? All that time?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>\u201cHow could even a vampire survive that?\u201d Zoe asked as sympathy flashed across her face. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you need food? Air? I mean, you breathe, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the spell,\u201d Alerac said, voice wooden. \u201cIt locked in the air in her lungs, froze her body, and made it her prison. She could feel the bloodlust and hunger, but she couldn\u2019t move.\u201d His face was tight with fury. \u201cMagic can do anything, if it\u2019s strong enough.\u201d Alerac yanked his hand through his hair. \u201cLiam knew.\u201d</p><p>Jane tried to focus on breathing. She\u2019d been shoved in the ground somewhere out in that swamp, buried alive for all of those years? A prisoner, in her own body. I don\u2019t want those memories back. Maybe that made her a coward, but she didn\u2019t care. Screw the past. She was ready for the future.</p><p>\u201cIt was gift, you know?\u201d Heath was staring at her now. \u201cOnce I went with Lorcan, I realized that.\u201d</p><p>What? Now she was the one grabbing for Heath as she lunged forward. \u201cBeing imprisoned was a gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His chin lifted. \u201cLosing your memory was. You should thank Lorcan for that. He was merciful to you. If you\u2019d kept those memories, you\u2019d probably be insane.\u201d</p><p>She was staring at someone insane. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be sure to thank him, all right.\u201d She\u2019d thank the bastard by taking his head. That\u2019d really show her gratitude to the jerk.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he send you here?\u201d Alerac asked as he pulled Jane away from Heath.</p><p>Heath\u2019s gaze jumped to him. \u201cBecause I promised him that I could deliver Jane to him.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise I\u2019ll keep,\u201d Heath swore.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how,\u201d Zoe said as she lifted a brow. Finn stood just behind her. \u201cI mean, considering you\u2019re tied to a chair right now, and you look like werewolf chow to me.\u201d</p><p>Finn growled.</p><p>Heath licked his bloody lips. He turned his head, and his eyes found Jane once more. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go with me, Jane, if you don\u2019t go back with me to meet Lorcan, then he\u2019s going to hurt someone that you care about.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cI should believe you because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorcan thinks I\u2019m here to use our friendship.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have a friendship. They had lies.</p><p>\u201cBut I saw. I saw.\u201d</p><p>Good for him. Disgusted, she turned away from him. She didn\u2019t want to hear any more of his stories.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that you have a brother, Jane?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she did. Jane hesitated. Her gaze slid toward Zoe. The other woman gave an almost imperceptible nod.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that he\u2019s about to die?\u201d</p><p>The guy was bluffing. Jane spun to face him, and her hands fisted on her hips. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has poison in his veins. Poison that Lorcan put there.\u201d The hair at his temples was wet with sweat. \u201cLorcan has the cure to that poison. If you go to him, you can take the cure.\u201d</p><p>Her heart kicked into her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d Another one. Ryan would have mentioned his imminent death, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Alerac was now staring at Zoe, too. \u201cBring the vamp in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but the sun\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s weak, I want him in here.\u201d</p><p>Zoe nodded, then hurried from the room.</p><p>Jane kept staring at Heath. \u201cIt\u2019s just another lie,\u201d she said, sadly. \u201cAnother trick. Maybe you were supposed to come here and try to get me to your side, but when you started to heal, you realized that wasn\u2019t going to work because we\u2019d all realized that you\u2019d been using my blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dammit, I\u2019m telling you the truth!\u201d</p><p>But his truth sounded like lies to her.</p><p>Heath exhaled. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I swear it is. The guy is going to die unless you go meet Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>She just gazed back at him. Liar, liar.</p><p>Heath swore and jerked against his ropes. \u201cDon\u2019t believe me? Then just drink me. Vamps can see memories. As old as you are, you should be able to control the memories you pull up. Lorcan does. He can see anything he wants when he drinks from prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Lorcan.\u201d She might as well be a newborn vamp as far as memory control was concerned. As far as any vamp powers were concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou want your brother to die, fine. You can just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ryan burst into the cabin. Zoe was at his side, casting worried glances his way. \u201cWhat. The. Hell?\u201d Ryan demanded as he advanced toward Alerac.</p><p>Then he got a look at the bound man.</p><p>Ryan stopped. Frowned. Then shrugged as if seeing a bound human was a typical occurrence for him.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you need to tell us?\u201d Alerac asked Ryan.</p><p>\u201cSure. You\u2019re an SOB who will never be worthy of my sister?\u201d</p><p>Alerac smiled. \u201cNot that.\u201d A pause. \u201cAre you dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d Ryan shot right back.</p><p>\u201cThe poison\u2019s in you!\u201d Heath yelled, straining against the ropes.</p><p>Ryan slowly stepped toward the yelling man. \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the human doctor who found Jane,\u201d Alerac told him. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also the man who\u2019s been taking her blood.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s teeth snapped together. \u201cIs he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says you\u2019ve got poison in you,\u201d Alerac continued with a watchful gaze. \u201cAnd the only way to get a cure? Well, seems Jane has to trade her life for yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any trade.\u201d Flat. Instant.</p><p>Jane\u2019s breath caught. Wait\u2014he hadn\u2019t denied the poison. He\u2019d just said he didn\u2019t want a trade. Jane studied him, trying to see past the guard of his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cThis human works for Lorcan?\u201d Ryan\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cHe always did like to use his lackeys. He\u2019d get them to do his grunt work, then drain \u2018em dry. The fools thought they\u2019d get immortality.\u201d</p><p>Heath\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cAll they got was a fast trip to hell.\u201d</p><p>Heath wasn\u2019t struggling any longer.</p><p>\u201cIs there poison in your veins?\u201d Jane asked him.</p><p>Ryan smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s not your problem. Hell, you don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t have memories of him. \u201cYou\u2019re my brother.\u201d And he\u2019d touched her mind. When he\u2019d sent that message to meet him at the stream, she\u2019d actually felt him in her head. That touch had been strangely comforting. Familiar.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to reach out to him again, using that mental link, but Jane had found nothing.</p><p>No link.</p><p>No comfort.</p><p>His face hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to offer your life for me or for some cure that Lorcan doesn\u2019t have. I know I\u2019ve been living on borrowed time. I\u2019ve known it for nearly two centuries.\u201d He rubbed his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault. I tried to get him to make me a deal with me. After he took you away, I was willing to do anything, to trade anything, to find you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her chest ached.</p><p>\u201cLorcan\u2019s witch made me a potion. See, he\u2019d let her keep living because she didn\u2019t know exactly where you were imprisoned. He got her to create a special brew. Said that it would connect me to you.\u201d His eyes squeezed shut. \u201cI drank it, like a fool, and I got that deeper connection. I could hear you in my head. Crystal fucking clear. You were crying, screaming. Helpless. And those were your real cries. Your body might have frozen, but you were conscious of every moment that passed.\u201d He ran a hand over his face. \u201cYou were aware and always screaming in your mind. In my mind. I could hear you, twenty-four, seven, but I couldn\u2019t find you. I couldn\u2019t free you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe potion was poison,\u201d Alerac said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Finn murmured, sounding shaken. \u201cThat\u2019s twisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Lorcan,\u201d Ryan said as his eyes opened. \u201cHe gets off on playing his games.\u201d</p><p>Zoe rocked back onto her heels. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t go crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Jane shivered. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The thought of him suffering, with her, for all that time...</p> <p>\u201cI sent you messages with my mind back then,\u201d Ryan said, voice soft. Shoulders slumped. \u201cJust like I did when I told you to meet me by the stream.\u201d</p><p>Alerac tensed.</p><p>\u201cOver and over, while you were imprisoned, I\u2019d tell you that everything was going to be all right. That you would be safe. That I\u2019d find you.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cBut the cries never stopped, and I figured you couldn\u2019t hear me.\u201d</p><p>Jane could only shake her head. She\u2019d sure heard him clearly enough when he told her to meet him at the stream. Maybe she had heard him for all of those other years, too.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I needed to be closer, in order for you to hear me.\u201d Ryan\u2019s hands were fisted. \u201cI tried a lot over the last six months.\u201d He rolled his shoulders. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to hear me then, either. You didn\u2019t seem to hear me until I came to this wolf compound.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d had Alerac\u2019s blood by then. She frowned. She\u2019d started to get stronger after taking Alerac\u2019s blood. Had that made her able to finally connect with her brother\u2019s link?</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Now Ryan was circling around Heath. \u201cNone of that matters now. I took the poison, and there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Lorcan want you dead?\u201d Zoe asked. \u201cYou were in his clan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought I might one day fight him for power over the clan.\u201d A grim smile. \u201cHe was right. Though there wasn\u2019t exactly much left of our clan.\u201d His attention shifted to Alerac. \u201cNot after your wolves tore through our keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the poison do?\u201d Zoe edged toward him. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery damn minute,\u201d Ryan said grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s like fire in my veins.\u201d</p><p>Jane swiped away a tear. When had that fallen?</p><p>\u201cHow long do you have?\u201d Finn wanted to know.</p> <p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve located Keira\u2014Jane,\u201d he corrected almost absently, \u201cprobably only a day or two more.\u201d But he didn\u2019t seem to care. Why not? He should care. He was talking about his death too casually. \u201cThe potion linked me to her. The witch said it would burn brightest when I found what I sought.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d sought her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to burn alive,\u201d Heath whispered. His gaze swept over them all. \u201cBurn from the inside out. Lorcan thinks he\u2019ll die within the next twenty-four hours. But there\u2019s a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying.\u201d Ryan whirled away from the human.</p><p>Jane stepped into her brother\u2019s path. \u201cDrink from him and see.\u201d He might be ready to give up and die, but she wasn\u2019t ready to let him go.</p><p>A faint furrow appeared between Ryan\u2019s brows.</p><p>\u201cDrink from him. What do we have to lose? Just...see. There could be a chance for you.\u201d He\u2019d suffered for so long. Didn\u2019t he deserve a chance?</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His teeth flashed. \u201cI could go for a bite.\u201d He turned back toward Heath. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>That was the only warning Heath had. Ryan grabbed for the man, twisted his head to the side, and shoved his fangs into Heath\u2019s throat.</p><p>Jane\u2019s own throat burned. Liam had done that to her. He\u2019d wrenched her head to the side\u2014</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>Alerac. His voice. His hand on her arm.</p><p>She blinked. When had he moved so close to her?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he told her. His voice was strong and certain. She glanced away from Alerac and back to her brother.</p><p>Ryan had freed Heath. \u201cFuck me.\u201d There was shock in his voice. Ryan swiped a hand over his lips, wiping away the blood. \u201cThere is a cure.\u201d</p><p>Relief made her a little dizzy. There was a cure, and it looked like they had about twenty-four hours to find it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come for the cure,\u201d Lorcan said as he glanced over his shoulder. His witch stood there, pressing her back into the corner. For a being so powerful, she was also incredibly weak.</p><p>Breakable.</p><p>The marks on her neck were just starting to heal.</p><p>It was so hard to find good witches these days.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come, and I\u2019ll kill them.\u201d Simple. He\u2019d deliberately let Heath learn of the cure. Every move that he\u2019d made had been deliberate.</p><p>If Heath hadn\u2019t been killed on sight at the werewolf compound, then either Ryan or Keira would drink from the human. They would look into his memories.</p><p>That was the way of the vampire.</p><p>When they took his blood, they\u2019d learn of the cure. They\u2019d learn of Lorcan\u2019s hiding spot in the mountains.</p><p>They\u2019d plan an attack.</p><p>Alerac would follow his bread crumbs so perfectly. So foolishly.</p><p>You destroyed my clan. Now it\u2019s my turn to destroy your pack.</p><p>Everything was falling into place. Every fucking thing.</p><p>He crooked his finger toward the witch.</p><p>When she flinched, he smiled. \u201cCome now, my dear, it\u2019s almost time for you to do your part.\u201d</p><p>She had a role to play, just as he did. Only once his lovely witch had done his bidding, then he\u2019d kill her.</p><p>She was incredibly weak, and he despised weakness. It would soon be time for a new model.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting on the other side of the mountain, in a blue house just past the bridge.\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice was flat. \u201cI saw the house in the human\u2019s mind. Lorcan is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trap.\u201d Alerac knew this. They all had to know this. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trading Jane.\u201d That plan was pure shit.</p><p>Jane stood near the fireplace. No fire burned. She stared at the empty hearth. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. If he wanted me dead, if he wanted me at all, why didn\u2019t he come for me himself when I was free? Why wait six months? Why start the attacks now?\u201d</p><p>Alerac wanted to know the answers to those questions, too. At first, he\u2019d thought that he\u2019d gotten lucky. That he\u2019d found Jane first.</p><p>Lucky hadn\u2019t been in the equation.</p><p>Lorcan was playing them.</p><p>\u201cLorcan is a tricky bastard. He\u2019s always manipulating, playing his games.\u201d Ryan was close to Jane\u2019s side. \u201cI don\u2019t know why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything special in her blood,\u201d Heath muttered.</p><p>Alerac frowned at him. \u201cA vampire\u2019s blood, by its very nature, is fucking special.\u201d It had certainly healed the human.</p><p>But Heath shook his head. He was sweating, but no longer bleeding. Fear oozed from the man\u2019s pores. Probably because he realized that he wouldn\u2019t be living much longer. Not much longer at all. \u201cLiam had me comparing her blood to other vamps. He was\u2014he was looking for something in her blood. Some kind of power that wasn\u2019t there. He kept saying that it should be there.\u201d</p><p>Liam knew that Alerac had grown stronger after taking Jane\u2019s blood. That he\u2019d transformed into something that was both werewolf and vampire.</p><p>Liam had taken the blood of other vampires so that his life could be extended. So that he could fight at Alerac\u2019s side. But he\u2019d never gotten the power boost that Alerac had received. Never transformed into a hybrid creature.</p><p>Only Alerac had done that\u2014with the aid of Jane\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cI think Liam and Lorcan both want to know how you changed me.\u201d Alerac made sure that his voice carried easily across the room. \u201cHell, maybe Lorcan even held back on making contact with you because he wanted me to find you first. He probably even wanted us to mate, so that he could see the changes.\u201d Was that why the guy hadn\u2019t directly come at them yet? He was waiting, watching?</p><p>Her breath whispered out. \u201cChanges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun isn\u2019t hurting you anymore. You aren\u2019t weak, and you should be weak during the day.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Lorcan wanted you to spend time with me because he wanted\u2014\u201d Alerac broke off. He wanted us to mate. To fuck. To bond. \u201cWhen you came from your imprisonment, you weren\u2019t linked to me.\u201d Those words were so hard to utter, but they were true. He\u2019d been tied to her, body and soul, for two centuries.</p><p>She\u2019d shared no such tie with him.</p><p>So Lorcan had tried to reset the bond.</p><p>In order to see the power in her blood? \u201cWe\u2019re Lorcan\u2019s experiment,\u201d Alerac said. \u201cAnd he wants us\u2014both of us\u2014so he can figure out how to get the same power for himself.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s attraction to Jane had been undeniable, too consuming, and it was being used against him now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left,\u201d Ryan said, voice grim. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to make the most of that time. I\u2019ll do my best to take him out.\u201d</p><p>Alerac shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve tried before. That didn\u2019t work\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t kill him for the same reason you couldn\u2019t\u2014he knew where Jane was! If he\u2019d died, we might never have seen her again.\u201d His gaze cut to Jane. \u201cWhen the screams stopped, I thought for sure you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Pain flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Ryan backed toward the door. \u201cYou aren\u2019t trading for me. You aren\u2019t trading yourself for anyone, ever again.\u201d He pointed toward Alerac. \u201cKeep her safe, wolf. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll come back and haunt your ass.\u201d</p><p>Then he yanked open the door, and the fool ran right out in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cRyan!\u201d Jane tried to go after him. Not happening. Alerac wrapped his forearm around her stomach and pulled her back against him. \u201cDammit, let me go!\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cZoe!\u201d He trusted her. As I trusted Liam. His back teeth ground together. \u201cFollow him and make sure he doesn\u2019t get himself killed.\u201d</p><p>Zoe was already running through the door.</p><p>\u201cFinn.\u201d</p><p>Finn jerked to attention.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone found Liam\u2019s tracks?\u201d The guy was good at covering himself. He should be good. Alerac had taught him well.</p><p>Finn shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s like he just vanished.\u201d</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. Liam would be turning up again. Like Lorcan, he was after the power that could come from Jane.</p><p>And like Lorcan, he wasn\u2019t getting her.</p><p>Two enemies after me. Time to even up the odds a bit.</p><p>\u201cMake sure the human doesn\u2019t leave,\u201d he ordered Finn.</p><p>Jane turned in his grasp. \u201cYou\u2019re going after Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Ryan would be his distraction. While Lorcan and his lackeys were fighting Ryan, Alerac would engage his own attack. \u201cI\u2019ll take men with me. The bastard won\u2019t live to see another sunset.\u201d</p><p>Alerac couldn\u2019t wait to rip him apart.</p><p>\u201cIf you go, then I go.\u201d Jane was adamant.</p><p>Alerac opened his mouth to argue.</p><p>\u201cIf I took your punishment, then don\u2019t you think you owe this to me?\u201d Her words vibrated with intensity. \u201cTwo hundred years. I won\u2019t stand on the sidelines anymore. I won\u2019t keep hiding. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Alerac closed his mouth because he had no words.</p><p>\u201cYour pack backs us, my brother fights, you fight.\u201d Her shoulders straightened. \u201cI fight, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her anywhere near Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be shut out. I\u2019ve lost my past, but I\u2019m not losing my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will!\u201d This came from Heath. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill you, Jane! Don\u2019t do this! He\u2019s going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag him,\u201d Jane snapped to Finn.</p><p>A grin curling his lips, Finn moved to obey. Soon all Heath could do was grunt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire. And, thanks to you, I\u2019m also more.\u201d She held Alerac\u2019s gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s see just how much power we have together. Let\u2019s see if we can make Lorcan fear us this time.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the scared woman who\u2019d run from him when he first saw her in Wylee\u2019s bar. It wasn\u2019t even the delicate vampire princess who\u2019d first stolen into his heart on a long ago night in Ireland.</p><p>This woman...determination burned in her eyes. Fury hardened her muscles.</p><p>She was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Alerac nodded. \u201cWe will make him fear.\u201d</p><p>And beg.</p><p>And...die.</p><p>Liam watched them leave. Alerac took most of his men with him. He took Jane.</p><p>The alpha made sure to keep her right at his side.</p><p>The storm had helped Liam. It had covered his scent. Hid his tracks.</p><p>He\u2019d learned a few other ways to hide his scent over the years, even from someone with senses as powerful as Alerac\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The motorcycles roared away.</p><p>The sun hadn\u2019t weakened Jane.</p><p>It looked like she was changing, too.</p> <p>He waited until the growl of the motorcycles died away. He\u2019d been watching the main house carefully. He\u2019d seen the activity there.</p><p>The familiar human who\u2019d been dragged inside.</p><p>The human who hadn\u2019t come out. He was sure that Heath had told them all of Liam\u2019s secrets.</p><p>Heath would pay for that.</p><p>Liam surveyed the area. Only a few wolves remained. Alerac must think he\u2019d need his pack\u2019s support in the coming battle, but the alpha should have planned better.</p> <p>He should have left more of a defense at home.</p><p>If you didn\u2019t protect what you valued, then you only had yourself to blame when it was destroyed.</p><p>Liam carefully worked his way to the main house, never making a sound, barely breathing.</p><p>Then he slipped in through a back window. He knew every inch of that house. Knew which boards would squeak beneath his feet. Which doors would creak when he opened them.</p><p>There were no squeaks. No creaks.</p><p>He saw the human. Bound. A gag in his mouth. Heath\u2019s eyes widened when he caught sight of Liam. The human started to jerk and twist, and his gaze darted behind Liam\u2019s form.</p> <p>Ah, a warning. Interesting.</p><p>He spun around just as Finn charged at him.</p><p>But poor Finn never had a chance. He wasn\u2019t immortal. He hadn\u2019t been gorging on vampire blood for two lifetimes.</p><p>Liam drove his hand into Finn\u2019s chest. Then he pulled out the werewolf\u2019s heart.</p><p>When Finn fell to the floor, Liam was smiling.</p><p>The human whimpered behind his gag.</p><p>Liam dropped the heart. He turned back to his new prey. \u201cWell, well...I guess we meet again.\u201d There was dried blood on Heath\u2019s neck and shirt. Someone had been drinking from him.</p><p>Taking his memoires?</p> <p>Liam already had enough memories in his head. Memories that seemed to tear him apart. Memories from the vampires. From their countless attacks. Again and again. He didn\u2019t even dream anymore\u2014he just saw the memories.</p><p>Endlessly.</p><p>Sometimes, he wasn\u2019t sure if those memories belonged to the vampires he\u2019d killed\u2014or to me.</p><p>His fingers tightened on Heath\u2019s throat. \u201cYou were supposed to be working with me. That was why I paid you so much.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled the man\u2019s eyes. He was muttering frantically behind his gag. Liam narrowed his eyes. \u201cIf you try to scream, I\u2019ll rip out your throat.\u201d</p><p>A desperate nod.</p><p>Liam jerked out the gag.</p><p>\u201cPl...please...\u201d Heath wheezed. \u201cI can still help you.\u201d</p><p>And he would. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went...after Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>A foolish move. \u201cAlerac actually took Jane to him?\u201d After all he\u2019d done to keep her out of the vamp\u2019s reach?</p><p>\u201cHer brother is d-dying. Lorcan has a cure.\u201d</p><p>Her brother. The prick Ryan. How many times did I say he needed to lose his head? But Alerac hadn\u2019t listened to him. Alerac never listened to him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lorcan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthside of the mountain. In the blue house, the one with the windows boarded up.\u201d</p><p>How like a vamp to hide behind boarded windows, cowering from the sun.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Liam murmured.</p><p>\u201cI-I can help\u2014\u201d</p><p>Liam snapped Heath\u2019s neck. \u201cNo, you can die.\u201d Because the human had failed him too many times already.</p><p>The he glanced around the cabin. He knew what this place was. Alerac\u2019s home for her. Alerac thought to offer the princess a perfect sanctuary.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t have that.</p><p>He\u2019d destroy them\u2014he\u2019d destroy everything.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The sun blazed down on them as Alerac and Jane crept toward the blue house. Heavy boards covered the windows. There were no cars outside the structure, no vehicles of any sort.</p><p>The pack had left their motorcycles a few miles away. They hadn\u2019t wanted to alert Lorcan to their approach. Now they closed in on the house, surrounding it from all sides.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ryan?\u201d Jane whispered as she edged closer to Alerac. She hadn\u2019t caught sight of Ryan or Zoe.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s nostrils flared, as if he were pulling in her brother\u2019s scent. \u201cHeading to the right. Dammit, he\u2019s getting too close to the house. He needs to wait!\u201d</p><p>Ryan wasn\u2019t going to wait for anyone.</p><p>\u201cHow many are in the house?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cCan you hear them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI count five.\u201d His gaze locked on the front door. But then he frowned. \u201cFive, but I smell...\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cBack!\u201d Alerac roared.</p><p>He grabbed Jane and began running with her.</p><p>Just as the blue house exploded.</p><p>The blast lifted Jane and Alerac both into the air. It tossed them, and then they slammed down into the hard earth.</p><p>She glanced back at the house\u2014only there was no house. Just flames.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d Jane whispered her brother\u2019s name.</p><p>Zoe ran from the flames. Her clothes were smoking. Blood dripped from a gash on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d Jane jumped to her feet. Alerac tried to stop her, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to be stopped. \u201cRyan!\u201d</p><p>Zoe grabbed her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I tried to pull him back\u2014\u201d</p><p>No, no, this couldn\u2019t happen. They\u2019d gone there to save Ryan.</p><p>She tried desperately to use the mental link that was supposed to be between them.</p><p>But Jane\u2019s mind touched nothing.</p><p>Then she heard laughter. Sick, twisted laughter that seemed to come from the very flames.</p><p>The red and orange flames stretched into the sky. They burned white-hot. She could feel the lance of that heat against her skin.</p><p>She yanked free of Zoe\u2019s hold and followed that laughter. It wasn\u2019t coming from the flames, but from the woods that were behind the house.</p><p>Lorcan stood there. Arms crossed over his chest. A dead werewolf at his feet. And a pale, scared blond woman at his side.</p><p>Though the sun was out, Lorcan certainly didn\u2019t look weak, not in any way.</p><p>\u201cLorcan.\u201d Alerac snarled his name with fury and hate.</p><p>Jane could only stare at him. This man\u2014with his perfect looks, his too pale skin, and his icy eyes\u2014he was the one who\u2019d wreaked havoc on her life for so very long.</p><p>Alerac charged toward him.</p><p>\u201cMake the wolf hurt,\u201d Lorcan ordered.</p><p>The blond woman lifted her hand. Then she clenched her fingers into a fist. Alerac fell down, howling as he clawed at his chest.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s men\u2014those still alive\u2014were gathering around them. She could hear bones snapping, and Jane knew they were shifting in preparation for an attack.</p><p>The blonde\u2019s gaze found Jane\u2019s. I\u2019m sorry. The woman mouthed the words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Jane shouted right back. \u201cBecause Lorcan is going to die!\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let Alerac be in pain. She wasn\u2019t just going to stand there. Jane leapt forward, feeling her own claws break from her fingertips even as her fangs burned in her mouth.</p><p>For his crimes, Lorcan would die. And as for the blonde\u2014you\u2019re his witch, aren\u2019t you?\u2014she\u2019d be joining the vampire in hell.</p><p>Lorcan smiled at her. \u201cWant me? Then come get me.\u201d</p><p>She was.</p><p>She raced toward him, going faster, faster, faster\u2014</p><p>And he was waiting. Not even trying to back away. Grinning and waiting for her attack.</p><p>The witch still had her hand clenched into a fist. Jane didn\u2019t know what kind of spell the woman was working, but\u2014it ends.</p><p>At the last second, right before Jane would have collided with Lorcan, she whirled and took that witch down.</p><p>Because I won\u2019t let Alerac suffer.</p><p>Jane drove her claws into the woman\u2019s chest. The blond screamed, and her hands opened as she tried to fight Jane.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hurt him,\u201d Jane said as she shoved the woman back into the woods. \u201cNo one does.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned on Lorcan.</p><p>That smile was still in place on his face. Wrong expression, jerk. Didn\u2019t he realize this was when he was supposed to be afraid?</p><p>There was no more snapping of bones behind her. No more howls. A fast and frantic glance showed her that the wolves had shifted, and they stalked forward quickly, surrounding Lorcan.</p><p>No escape.</p><p>Alerac rose from the ground. His breath heaved out as he lunged forward and put himself right next to Jane.</p><p>This was it. The end.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t Lorcan afraid?</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re going to take my head?\u201d Lorcan shook the head in question. \u201cYou do underestimate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour death has been a long time coming,\u201d Alerac told him. \u201cSo let\u2019s not wait any more.\u201d</p><p>His claws flew up and went right for Lorcan\u2019s throat.</p><p>There was still no fear in Lorcan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Alerac sliced his claws across Lorcan\u2019s neck.</p><p>And Jane fell to the ground. Blood poured from her neck, from a wound that she shouldn\u2019t have. From a wound that matched Lorcan\u2019s.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s throat was bleeding, but he was still on his feet, and his eyes gleamed with an unholy light.</p><p>\u201cJane? Jane!\u201d Alerac rushed to her.</p><p>She tried to put her hand over her neck, to stop the flow of blood.</p><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d Alerac ordered his men. \u201cDo it, now!\u201d</p><p>The wolves leapt forward to attack.</p><p>One wolf sank his teeth into Lorcan\u2019s forearm.</p><p>Jane screamed as phantom teeth tore into her arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d Alerac stared at her wound with desperate eyes. Then he whirled toward the swarming wolves.</p><p>Phantom teeth sank into her leg. Tore muscles.</p><p>\u201cStop! Stop the attack!\u201d Alerac bellowed.</p><p>The wolves froze.</p><p>Jane couldn\u2019t get off the ground. Blood soaked her.</p><p>Lorcan was on the ground, too. Covered in just as much blood. His head was turned toward Jane. He was...smiling. Still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve linked us,\u201d he said, the words little more than a whisper, yet she heard him clearly. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember, but you accepted the bond. You won\u2019t ever be his, not really, because you are mine. Body and soul, forever.\u201d</p><p>No, no, this wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cMy pain...is yours. Your life...is mine.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to deny it, but Jane couldn\u2019t. Not when her injuries were a perfect match to his.</p><p>\u201cGo get that witch!\u201d Alerac pointed to the woods.</p><p>She\u2019d tossed the witch that way, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>Darkness thickened around Jane.</p><p>\u201cIf your wolf, kills...me. Then he kills you...too.\u201d</p><p>Sick bastard.</p><p>She turned her head. Saw the flames, still shooting into the sky. Her brother had gone into those flames.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get to know him.</p><p>Her heart ached.</p><p>\u201cJane, it\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d Alerac was before her. He\u2019d slit his lower arm, and he pushed the blood offering toward her lips. \u201cJust drink from me.\u201d</p><p>She was hurt badly, she knew it. The wounds should have killed her\u2014and Lorcan.</p><p>Without Alerac\u2019s blood, she would die right there on the ground. So Jane drank. And as she drank, Alerac\u2019s powerful blood healed her.</p><p>It also healed Lorcan.</p><p>Soon he was on his feet, no wounds on his body. Healed too fast, from blood that he\u2019d never tasted.</p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lorcan murmured. \u201cHow some bonds can cut through flesh and be buried in the blood? And that is our bond. Through blood and pain...until death.\u201d</p><p>Two wolves broke from the woods. The blonde woman was in front of them. She was bleeding, stumbling, but she didn\u2019t look in immediate danger of dying.</p><p>Zoe hurried toward the witch. \u201cYou try a spell on me, and I\u2019ll knock your ass out.\u201d</p><p>The blonde\u2019s head was bowed. \u201cYou are already under one spell. Mine will not weaken you anymore than you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just say I\u2019m weak?\u201d Zoe leapt for her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill her, Zoe. I need the witch alive.\u201d Alerac\u2019s voice. Flat. Alerac pulled Jane to her feet, then he wrapped his arm around her. Wolves still circled Lorcan, trapping him with their bodies. \u201cYou sonofabitch, you think you\u2019ve won, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lorcan smirked. \u201cUnless you\u2019re planning to kill the vampiress there, then, yes, I have.\u201d He rubbed at his neck, at the wound that wasn\u2019t there any longer. \u201cYou see, you can\u2019t kill me\u2014not fucking ever\u2014not if you want the one you call Jane to keep walking on this earth with you.\u201d</p><p>How had he done it? How?</p><p>Magic, witchcraft, terrified Jane.</p><p>And Lorcan pissed her off. \u201cYou killed my brother.\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cHe was going to die anyway. The poison had eaten up his insides, and it was starting to play with his mind.\u201d Lorcan tapped his forehead. \u201cThe mind is the weakest part, you know. Once it breaks, there\u2019s no saving the body. Or the soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a soul,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have a life,\u201d he fired back, \u201cnot without me.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s body felt like stone against hers. She knew he wanted Lorcan\u2019s head. But if he attacked Lorcan, then Alerac would hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou had men in that house,\u201d she said, her mind struggling desperately to find a way out of this nightmare.</p><p>\u201cI had bait in that house. They were expendable.\u201d</p><p>So cold. Callous.</p><p>\u201cI also have men coming from the woods now. I\u2019d say, Alerac, that you have about one minute to get your pack to safety, and then the silver bullets will start flying.\u201d Lorcan\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cAh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I planned for that stupid human to tell you my location\u2014and to tell you about the so-called cure for Ryan. I needed you here. I needed you to bring me Jane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And they had.</p><p>\u201cThere was no cure,\u201d she said, voice leaden.</p><p>\u201cSure there was,\u201d Lorcan told her, frowning. \u201cDeath is the cure. It always is.\u201d</p> <p>What?</p><p>\u201cNow leave Jane here with me, and run while you can.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s head tilted toward the woods. \u201cI don\u2019t smell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve cloaked their scents. A little trick I learned from a voodoo priestess in Africa.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s teeth snapped together. \u201cDon\u2019t smell \u2018em, but I hear \u2018em\u2014attack!\u201d</p> <p>The wolves jumped into motion, even as the thunder of gunfire erupted. Bullets slammed the two wolves who were next to the witch. They howled in pain, and their coats thickened with blood.</p><p>The witch sank to the ground, her hands going over her head.</p><p>Then a bullet drove into her shoulder.</p><p>More bullets. More cries. More blood.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Alerac roared. Then he was hurtling forward. Transforming, shifting, and running toward the woods.</p><p>He had to protect his pack.</p> <p>She had to help him.</p><p>Jane ran after him. She spared one final glare for Lorcan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you again!\u201d he called out.</p><p>She chased her werewolf into the woods.</p><p>A bullet grazed her arm. I hope you feel that, Lorcan.</p><p>Then a man in black charged at her.</p><p>She grabbed the gun right out of his hands. With a quick twist, Jane broke those hands. Then she sank her teeth into the guy\u2019s throat.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s wolf was growling. Attacking. Taking down men left and right.</p> <p>And they were just men\u2014not vampires. Men. Mortal men who were in over their heads.</p><p>They\u2019d chosen the wrong side in this fight.</p><p>Another bullet hit Jane in the back. She dropped her prey. He wasn\u2019t a threat any longer. Not dead, but not about to fight back.</p><p>She spun on the new attacker. The bloodlust within her was rising as it never had before.</p><p>The man who\u2019d just shot her was taking aim at Alerac now.</p><p>No.</p><p>She rushed toward him. Before he could fire, her teeth were in his neck.</p><p>The bastard called Lorcan was getting away. Zoe chased after him, trying to dodge the bullets that were still flying. Silver. She hated silver.</p><p>What werewolf didn\u2019t?</p><p>Lorcan was rushing into a dilapidated storage building that was about thirty yards away from the remains of the burning house.</p><p>She heard the growl of an engine.</p><p>No.</p><p>When a truck burst from the side of that storage building moments later, Zoe jumped in its path. She had to stop him.</p><p>Lorcan was behind the wheel. Smiling at her. He reeved that engine and the vehicle zoomed right at her.</p><p>Wait for it. Wait for it. She could do this. She could\u2014</p><p>Something slammed into Zoe. She went flying, and when she hit the ground again, she found herself staring up at\u2014</p><p>A dead man.</p><p>Ryan glared down at her. Blisters covered his face and neck, and his skin seemed to be white-hot where it touched her. She could actually feel the scorch on her body.</p><p>\u201cGot a death wish?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s you.\u201d She was stronger than she looked. So much stronger. She could have stopped that truck.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Now she pushed him aside. Her stomach was knotting. Her heart racing, and she was happy\u2014no, couldn\u2019t be happy, just relieved, for Jane\u2019s sake\u2014that Ryan was still alive.</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t even know how the hell he was walking around. Vamps and fire were supposed to be a deadly combination.</p><p>Hell, with that much fire, it should have meant death for anyone.</p><p>Zoe jumped to her feet. The truck was vanishing down the road. She started to chase it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. We have something more valuable here.\u201d Ryan grabbed her hands.</p><p>Again, his touch seemed to scorch her.</p><p>He pointed to the bloody, cowering witch. \u201cConsider her our GPS device.\u201d</p><p>The gunfire stopped. Wolves shifted into human form, then transformed almost instantly back into beasts. They were trying to push the silver from their bodies. Trying to heal.</p><p>She glanced around, frantic, but only counted one dead\u2014the poor wolf that Lorcan had killed when the house exploded.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. She\u2019d buried too many of her pack mates over the years.</p><p>Too many.</p><p>Ryan marched toward the witch. He caught the blonde\u2019s arm and jerked her upright.</p><p>Her blood soaked her shirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d The blonde cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to help him! I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Ryan tossed right back at her. \u201cWe all have choices. Right now, my choice is\u2014do I let you talk or do I just pick a vein and find the real truth through your blood?\u201d</p><p>The vampire was fierce. Zoe had always found tough guys to be a turn-on.</p><p>Except when they were about to drink blood. Then...not so much.</p><p>Before Ryan could make his choice, Jane appeared, bursting from the woods. She was covered in blood, sporting some rather vicious claws, and her fangs were most definitely out.</p><p>This didn\u2019t look at all like the scared, lost woman that had first arrived at the werewolf compound with Alerac.</p><p>Jane looked like she could kick serious ass\u2014and she just had.</p><p>A dark wolf walked at her side. His body was massive, and his shining green gaze promised hell.</p><p>Jane put her hand on his head, stroking him.</p><p>Then Jane saw Ryan. She stopped. Shook her head. \u201cR-Ryan?\u201d In the next instant, she was running toward the vampire. Jane through her body against his and held on, tight.</p><p>The witch didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Lucky girl, she\u2019d just been spared a drinking. For the moment, anyway.</p><p>But Zoe knew that reprieve wouldn\u2019t last forever. In her experience, nothing lasted forever.</p><p>Not even vampires.</p><p>Alerac knew something was wrong the instant that he stepped back onto his land.</p><p>The scent of blood was too heavy. Too fresh.</p><p>He rushed toward the main house. \u201cFinn!\u201d He threw open the door. Ran into the great-room.</p><p>Finn\u2019s body was on the floor. The human\u2014with his neck twisted\u2014hung in his binds. The human\u2019s chest had been clawed open.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zoe shoved past them and ran to Finn. She fell to her knees beside him. \u201cNo, Finn!\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Finn and Zoe had come to Alerac\u2019s pack together. Not linked by blood, but by friendship. A deep and abiding friendship formed as abandoned children tossed from home to home in a foster care system that sure as hell hadn\u2019t been made for their kind.</p><p>No one had understood their rage. Their bloodlust. And when puberty hit and the beast surged for power\u2014the humans had tossed both Finn and Zoe into a psych ward, convinced they were going mad.</p><p>Alerac had found them. He\u2019d gotten them out.</p><p>\u201cFinn, don\u2019t leave me,\u201d Zoe begged.</p><p>He was already gone.</p><p>Jane crossed toward Zoe. She hesitated, then put her hand on Zoe\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Ryan dragged the witch over the threshold. His gaze immediately found Zoe. Tears tracked endlessly down her cheeks. He swore and hauled the witch to Zoe\u2019s side. \u201cHe...matters to you?\u201d</p><p>Zoe glanced up, staring at him as if he were crazy.</p><p>\u201cHell, of course, he matters.\u201d Ryan expelled a rough breath. Then he shook the witch. \u201cBring him back.\u201d</p><p>Ryan was insane. Not surprising, really. Alerac had long suspected that he was.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Jane began, voice uncertain, \u201cthis can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not human, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis heart is gone,\u201d Jane snapped to her brother. \u201cHe can\u2019t come back!\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned, and shook his head. \u201cBut she wants him back.\u201d He touched his temple. \u201cBring him back.\u201d</p><p>Yes, definitely insane.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d the witch whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s not here anymore.\u201d</p><p>A choked sob came from Zoe.</p><p>The witch glanced at Alerac. \u201cPlease, let me go.\u201d</p><p>Not likely. He still remembered what had happened when the witch used her magic on him. He\u2019d felt as if someone were cutting out his heart.</p><p>But Zoe couldn\u2019t keep holding Finn. Alerac motioned through the open doorway, at the two werewolves who were watching in shocked silence. \u201cTake care of Finn. Bury the human.\u201d</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>Zoe tightened her hold on him. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d But then she stopped. She inhaled. Stared down at Finn with watery eyes. \u201cI thought it was Lorcan. That he\u2019d done this.\u201d</p><p>So had Alerac. At first.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d Zoe whispered as she inhaled. Then she screamed, \u201cLiam!\u201d</p><p>Yes, Alerac had caught his scent, too. Liam had come back, and he\u2019d hunted right in Alerac\u2019s home.</p><p>Was the bastard still close?</p><p>Alerac glanced back through the open door. You are, aren\u2019t you? \u201cKeep the witch here,\u201d Alerac told Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m hunting.\u201d He couldn\u2019t kill Lorcan, not yet, but Liam was another matter. Liam had earned the death he had coming his way.</p><p>He\u2019d betrayed the pack, turned on his own kind.</p><p>He would die.</p><p>Alerac pointed to the witch. \u201cFind a way to break the spell that links Jane and Lorcan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind it, or you die. Because you\u2019re no fuckin\u2019 use to me otherwise.\u201d Then his stare cut to Jane.</p><p>Jane.</p><p>It almost hurt to look at her. Because\u2014I nearly killed her. He hadn\u2019t realized it. Had never suspected that Lorcan had somehow linked their life forces.</p><p>If he\u2019d severed Lorcan\u2019s head from his body, Jane would have died, too. In an instant.</p><p>When he\u2019d whirled and seen the blood flowing down her neck, horror had filled him. He hadn\u2019t been able to get to her fast enough. Hadn\u2019t been able to heal her soon enough.</p><p>He wanted to cross the room and take her into his arms.</p><p>But his job was to protect. To protect Jane. To protect the pack. So far, he\u2019d failed at that job.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>No other wolves would die by Liam\u2019s hand. Liam had been his best friend. His closest confidant for two hundred years. It was only fitting that Alerac be the one to end him.</p><p>Fitting? No, maybe just twisted.</p><p>But it had to be done.</p><p>\u201cSever the tie between them,\u201d Alerac commanded the witch. He couldn\u2019t even look at Finn\u2019s body then.</p><p>He headed back outside, into the too bright sunlight.</p><p>\u201cAlerac!\u201d</p><p>Jane. She\u2019d rushed toward him so quickly. \u201cLet me come with you.\u201d</p><p>There were some battles that he had to fight on his own. \u201cFigure out a way to save your brother. Maybe the cure wasn\u2019t total bull.\u201d</p><p>Then he faced the sun. He inhaled the scents. And followed the trail that he knew Liam had deliberately left for him.</p><p>Jane grabbed the witch and pretty much dragged the woman upstairs. Zoe and Ryan followed her, though Zoe just looked shattered.</p><p>I\u2019ve looked that way before.</p><p>Jane pushed the witch into the bedroom on the right. \u201cTell me your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-Mina.\u201d</p><p>Jane frowned at her, that name was familiar. She\u2019d seen a movie, during her vampire research and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what he called me.\u201d Mina\u2019s voice was softer now. \u201cI\u2019ve been with him since I was five. I don\u2019t really know...I don\u2019t remember what I was called before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDracula\u2019s freaking bride.\u201d Ryan sounded disgusted. \u201cGuess it makes sense that he\u2019d call you that. Asshole probably thinks that it\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>Mina\u2019s head whipped up. \u201cI\u2019m not his bride.\u201d Her index finger pointed to Jane. \u201cShe\u2019s his bride.\u201d</p><p>The hell she was. \u201cYou\u2019re a witch,\u201d Jane said. Stating the obvious, right?</p><p>But Mina still nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the poison in my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t craft that poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, of course you didn\u2019t,\u201d the disgusted snap came from Ryan. Zoe stared at them all, her hands wrapped around her stomach. Ryan continued, \u201cBecause you weren\u2019t Lorcan\u2019s flavor of choice back then. That was another witch. He killed her after she locked my sister in her prison with magic and poisoned me.\u201d He braced his legs apart as he stared at Mina. \u201cBut every poison has a cure, right?\u201d</p><p>A timid nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat cures me?\u201d</p><p>Mina\u2019s gaze darted to Zoe.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat. Cures. Me?\u201d</p><p>Mina swiped away a tear that had slid down her cheek. \u201cI read the old book that Shonna left behind.\u201d</p><p>Shonna. The name meant nothing to Jane. Big surprise.</p><p>\u201cShonna was his witch back in the day,\u201d Ryan explained. Had he read her mind, used their link to see what she was thinking? Or had he just guessed?</p><p>\u201cThe book said that the poison could be purged if you took the blood of a caged beast.\u201d Mina spoke quickly. \u201cShe said the beast had to be dormant, locked, and your poison would destroy that beast even as you were healed.\u201d</p><p>Ryan had turned to stare at Zoe. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s gaze darted between them.</p><p>Zoe laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s me? You think I\u2019m your cure?\u201d Her eyes were on the floor, not on Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m a curse. Not a cure. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Ryan told her, voice thick. \u201cI\u2019m not about to destroy you.\u201d He turned his glare back on the witch. \u201cThink of another way.\u201d</p><p>Jane heard a howl then, seeming to echo off the mountain. She headed toward the window. Stared out. She didn\u2019t see Alerac, but she knew that he was out there. Hunting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Preparing to kill the closest thing that he had to a brother.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let him go alone.\u201d He\u2019d been so determined. She\u2019d been\u2014</p><p>Lost. Desperate. Because she\u2019d wanted to find a way to sever her tie to Lorcan. She still needed to find a way to be free, but...</p> <p>Another howl sounded. That howl was harder. Wilder.</p><p>Not Alerac\u2019s. She knew his cry. Could recognize it on an instinctive level.</p><p>\u201cLiam is luring Alerac to him,\u201d Zoe murmured.</p><p>Yes, he was.</p><p>And she was supposed to wait there? Just wait and see who survived this battle?</p> <p>No.</p><p>She spun back to face the witch. \u201cHow did Lorcan convince you to stay with him? To help him for all this time?\u201d</p><p>Mina\u2019s lips trembled. \u201cI had no one else. He killed my parents when I was a child. He took my blood, over and over again. He kept me weak. So weak.\u201d</p><p>She was weak right then. Too thin. Too frail. Trembling as she stood there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>The witch blinked.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to need your blood, too.\u201d In an instant, he was at the witch\u2019s side. He\u2019d grabbed her hand and lifted her wrist to his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to find out if you\u2019re lying or not. I need to know how to live, and I need to know how to keep my sister alive.\u201d</p><p>He sank his fangs into her wrist.</p><p>The wolf stalked carefully over the stream. Jane\u2019s blood had covered the rocks in this stream. She\u2019d been attacked, right here, when she should have been safe on his land.</p><p>Rage twisted within Alerac.</p><p>Liam\u2019s scent was stronger here, leading him deeper into the woods.</p><p>After your attack on Finn, you knew I\u2019d be the one to hunt you.</p><p>Liam was sure leaving him a clear path to follow.</p><p>Liam had never challenged him for alpha status. He\u2019d always stood at Alerac\u2019s side.</p> <p>Until now.</p><p>Now the challenge was undeniable.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s head lowered over the water. He eased away from the stream. Liam\u2019s scent went back to the north. Higher up the mountain.</p><p>His head lifted. Alerac looked behind him. He could just see the roof of his home.</p><p>A wolf howled from the woods.</p><p>A battle waited.</p><p>Mina gasped when Ryan\u2019s teeth sank into her skin. Zoe surged forward.</p><p>But Ryan was already drinking. Mina\u2019s eyes had gone wide and glassy, and she stood stock-still, as if caught in a nightmare.</p><p>If Lorcan had been feeding on her for years, this probably was a nightmare for her.</p><p>\u201cStop, Ryan,\u201d Jane demanded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>So she made him. \u201cStop!\u201d Jane shoved him away.</p><p>He swiped the blood away from his mouth and frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you just drink from everyone?\u201d Zoe snapped. \u201cControl yourself!\u201d</p><p>Jane touched Mina\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Ryan\u2019s voice was shocked. \u201cShe\u2019s his witch. She\u2019s not going to help us! We have to make her reveal what she knows.\u201d</p><p>Mina\u2019s stare was still lost. No, blank.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jane said softly as she tried to reassure the other woman.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is,\u201d Ryan fired right back. \u201cI\u2019m dying, and you\u2019re somehow blood linked to a sadistic SOB who won\u2019t stop until he sees your werewolf cold in the ground. How is that \u2018okay\u2019 in any way?\u201d</p><p>Mina\u2019s lashes lowered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I made your werewolf hurt.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said that before. No, she\u2019d mouthed the words as she attacked Alerac. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSqueezed his heart, cut it, with my magic.\u201d</p><p>Ryan whistled. \u201cUsing black magic. But else would Lorcan\u2019s witch use?\u201d</p><p>Mina shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t always like this.\u201d Then her eyes were on Jane. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was, but I can\u2019t really be sure.\u201d</p><p>Jane swallowed. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Mina risked a glance at Ryan.</p><p>\u201cHe just wants to live,\u201d Jane told her, trying to make Mina understand. \u201cIs that so wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I told him how...the only cure I know.\u201d</p><p>Biting a caged beast. One that he\u2019d in turn destroy.</p><p>Mina shook her head as her eyes flickered toward Zoe. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can even shift, anyway. Why not let the beast go in order to save him?\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s lips parted in shock.</p><p>Then Mina was staring back at Jane. \u201cIf I tell you what you need to know, will you let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jane said at once.</p><p>Even as Ryan bellowed, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Mina nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, really.\u201d But her smile was sad. \u201cIf you want to sever the link with Lorcan, you just have to die.\u201d</p><p>Ryan swore.</p><p>\u201cThe link he created with you endures until death. Your blood. Your vow. There is no way to break it.\u201d Sadness whispered in Mina\u2019s words. \u201cYou will be linked to him, you will share his pain as you share his life. Until death,\u201d she said again, voice even softer.</p><p>This information was not helping.</p><p>\u201cShonna wrote about the bond. It was the last notation in her book.\u201d Mina\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cA witch\u2019s spell book is supposed to be sacred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did Lorcan keep her book around?\u201d Jane was surprised that Lorcan hadn\u2019t destroyed the spell book when he\u2019d killed Shonna.</p><p>\u201cBecause he wanted to make sure those spells lasted. If any of that magic started to weaken, he just made sure the new witch\u2014\u201d</p><p>Yeah, currently Mina was that new witch.</p><p>\u201c\u2014did her best to reinforce the magic.\u201d Mina exhaled on a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth here. If you want your wolf to be free, if you want Lorcan to die, then you must die.\u201d</p><p>That solution sucked.</p><p>\u201cNow I get to go.\u201d Mina hurried for the door.</p><p>Ryan blocked her path.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any more than that!\u201d Mina said, voice high and scared and angry. \u201cPlease! Let me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zoe curled her fingers around his arm, stopping his angry words. \u201cDid you see the scars on her neck?\u201d Zoe\u2019s words were quiet. \u201cThe scars that go up her arms? That probably cover her entire body?\u201d</p><p>Jane had seen the scars. Bite marks. They\u2019d pushed compassion through her. \u201cLet her go,\u201d Jane said, her voice as soft as Zoe\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s told us all that she can.\u201d Jane believed that.</p><p>Zoe nodded. It seemed the werewolf believed Mina, too.</p><p>But still Ryan hesitated. His gaze had softened, but he wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cWe need to know where Lorcan went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go find him.\u201d Mina\u2019s smile was bitter. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back here, the moment he thinks you\u2019re at your weakest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like him,\u201d Ryan muttered. Then he stepped aside.</p><p>Mina\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She skirted out of the room. Jane followed her. She wanted to make sure the wolves below knew that the witch was clear.</p><p>Only...</p><p>There were no wolves below. There should have been. They should have been guarding the house.</p><p>Where are they?</p><p>Mina was running down the stairs.</p><p>Jane just jumped right over the bannister and hit the bottom floor, her knees barely buckling. The enhanced power that she\u2019d gotten after taking Alerac\u2019s blood was sure a nice bonus.</p><p>Finn\u2019s body was gone. So was Heath\u2019s.</p><p>Jane tilted her head. She\u2019d been distracted upstairs and hadn\u2019t noticed the silence. So complete. Too complete.</p><p>Mina yanked open the house\u2019s front door.</p><p>Some of Alerac\u2019s packmates should have been out there, protecting that door.</p><p>The men were on the ground, not moving.</p><p>\u201cWh-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Mina\u2019s voice shook as she turned to glance back at Jane.</p><p>\u201cGet away from the door!\u201d Jane screamed as she lunged for the witch.</p><p>But it was too late. Because even as Jane rushed toward Mina, she saw Liam appear behind the witch. His claws drove right into Mina\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jane screamed.</p><p>Mina\u2019s eyes were on hers. Shocked. Pain-filled. Terrified.</p><p>Those eyes were on Jane, and the life was slowly bleeding away from them, even as Mina\u2019s blood soaked her clothing once more.</p><p>Then Liam tossed Mina aside, as if she were of no more consequence than garbage. To him, she probably was. He didn\u2019t know anything about Mina or her pain, and he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Liam filled the doorway.</p><p>Footsteps thundered from overhead. Ryan. Zoe. Rushing down in response to Jane\u2019s scream.</p><p>\u201cI knew he\u2019d leave you...leave you waiting for me.\u201d Liam leapt toward her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t back away from him. Her own claws ripped free, and she attacked him. They collided in a tangle of limbs and claws.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her!\u201d Ryan\u2019s yell.</p><p>Liam wasn\u2019t getting away from her. She raked her claws over his stomach. This man\u2014he thought to hurt her Alerac? Thought to destroy the pack? \u201cYou were his friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was his fucking shadow,\u201d Liam snarled right back. \u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d That booming voice was Alerac\u2019s. And he was\u2014he was standing right behind Liam. \u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>Liam whirled to confront him. But even as he turned, shoving Jane to the side, Alerac was attacking. Alerac\u2019s claws sank into Liam\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who knows how to disguise his scent,\u201d Alerac told him as he sank his claws even deeper in Liam\u2019s chest.</p><p>Liam cried out.</p><p>But Alerac wasn\u2019t showing mercy. Alerac was taking Liam\u2019s heart. Just as Liam had taken Finn\u2019s heart. Part of Jane wanted to look away from the horrible sight, but she couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><p>Ryan pushed into her back. Zoe gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou were like a brother to me,\u201d Alerac told Liam, voice thundering. \u201cWhy? Why betray me?\u201d</p><p>Liam shoved his hand, no, his claws\u2014right over Alerac\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Now Jane was moving. Because she was desperate. She grabbed Liam, but couldn\u2019t pull him away from Alerac. The werewolf was too strong. If she couldn\u2019t get him to break free, then both werewolves might die.</p><p>Not happening.</p><p>Jane sank her teeth into Liam\u2019s neck. Liam jerked his hand back as he tried to attack her.</p><p>And images, dozens of them, immediately swam through her mind.</p><p>Liam. Vampires. Fangs and claws and blood.</p><p>Voices that wouldn\u2019t stop shouting in his head. Dark desires that could never be satisfied. Desires that just grew worse as the blood flowed. Urges to hurt, to kill, to destroy.</p><p>It\u2019s not me anymore. I can\u2019t stop. Help me. Help me!</p><p>Jane wrenched her mouth away from Liam. Alerac yanked his hand back at the same instant.</p><p>And Liam fell. He slammed face-first into the floor.</p><p>She swiped her hand over her mouth, trying desperately to banish his taste and those terrible, twisted memories. She\u2019d seen Liam hurting so many people. Humans and vampires and werewolves.</p><p>He\u2019d hid his darkness for so many years.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>His heart was gone. His body was still. Liam was dead. Killed by his alpha\u2019s hand.</p><p>Jane looked up at Alerac. He stood there, bleeding, chest heaving, staring at her with the eyes of an enraged beast.</p><p>Part of her was afraid of him. He\u2019d taken the heart straight from Liam\u2019s chest.</p><p>Alerac stepped toward her.</p><p>Her own heart raced faster.</p><p>His nostrils twitched.</p><p>He smells my fear. Oh, crap. \u201cAlerac\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d whirled away from her. He stalked outside. Other werewolves were there. When had they gathered?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d His voice was flat. \u201cThe traitor is dead.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s fingers brushed down her arm. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She was. She just needed to talk with Alerac. To make him understand how she felt. \u201cI need Alerac.\u201d Jane stepped toward him.</p><p>But the visions from Liam\u2019s head\u2014those images of blood and pain and torture, flooded through her once more. She tried to stop them, but it was as if a dam had broken. The images wouldn\u2019t stop. They slammed through her, over and over again.</p><p>Was this what it was like for him? She could feel her sanity draining away.</p><p>She tried to call out to Alerac again, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t hit the floor when she fell.</p><p>Her brother was there to catch her.</p><p>But there was nothing to stop the bloody visions that filled her mind.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>She thought he was a monster.</p><p>Fitting, considering that was exactly what Alerac was.</p><p>I killed Liam. Alerac had done what was necessary. Liam had been a menace, turning on his own kind, attacking Jane.</p><p>And when I killed him, I could have sworn I saw relief flash in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the note of concern he heard in Ryan\u2019s voice. Alerac glanced back and saw Jane being cradled in her brother\u2019s arms.</p><p>Jane\u2019s eyes were closed, her long lashes dark against her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI think she fainted,\u201d Ryan muttered. He shook her gently. \u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires faint?\u201d Zoe asked. \u201cHere I thought blood-suckers were tougher than that.\u201d But a thread of concern had entered her voice, too.</p><p>Fear uncurled within Alerac. Fear, when he\u2019d forced that emotion away for so long. But Jane seemed to be unlocking all of his emotions. The good and the bad. Helpless, he went back to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had Jane fainted because she realized she was bound to a monster? To a man with a heart just as dark as Lorcan\u2019s?</p><p>He took her from Ryan. \u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stir.</p> <p>She had blood on her clothes. On her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d he said. He would. Always.</p><p>He cast a hard stare around the area. The witch was dead. Dammit, he\u2019d needed her. He\u2019d had plans for her. Now she was gone. Maybe I can find another witch. But her kind wasn\u2019t exactly thick on the ground, especially the powerful witches. \u201cTake care of her,\u201d he ordered his men as he inclined his head toward the woman\u2019s still body.</p><p>Ryan glanced over at her bloody form. \u201cShe had no magic to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve to die!\u201d From Zoe. Her cheeks were flushed. \u201cShe thought she was just getting to live, then Liam took that all away! She had hope, and he destroyed it.\u201d</p> <p>Liam had taken much away from them.</p><p>No more.</p><p>Alerac turned and began to carry his precious burden up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lorcan?\u201d Ryan shouted after him.</p><p>Alerac paused. Until he found a way to break the link between Jane and Lorcan, there was nothing that could be done. \u201cHe lives.\u201d That was all he could say. \u201cNo one goes after him without my express command.\u201d Because any attack would hurt Jane, and that he could not allow. \u201cIf anyone catches his scent on our land, alert me immediately.\u201d</p><p>He left the others and carried Jane into the bathroom upstairs. The shower there was huge, easily big enough to accommodate them both.</p> <p>\u201cJane?\u201d Why hadn\u2019t her eyes opened?</p><p>He held her with one arm, positioning her against the glass door of the shower. He stripped her, wanting that blood-stained clothing away from her delicate skin.</p><p>Her lashes began to flutter.</p><p>He stilled at once. \u201cI\u2019m just taking care of you.\u201d Her fear was the last thing he wanted.</p><p>Jane\u2019s eyes opened fully. \u201cHe was crazy.\u201d</p><p>Alerac shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI-I saw it. In his memories. The more blood he took, the more darkness ate away at him. Liam tried to hold on to his sanity, for so long, but he knew he was losing the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never said...\u201d Alerac began.</p> <p>\u201cHis father went mad, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Alerac nodded. Some werewolves could turn feral. The most dangerous of their kind.</p><p>\u201cHe saw it happen,\u201d Jane whispered. Her hands rose and curled around Alerac\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHe saw it, and so did I. He knew the same fate was happening to him, and he thought that if he could just become immortal, like you, he\u2019d have a different fate.\u201d</p><p>The drumming of Alerac\u2019s heart seemed to echo in his ears. \u201cHe drank vampire blood for me. To help me search for you. To avenge our pack.\u201d From the vampire attack that had nearly wiped them out so long ago. Lorcan\u2019s attack.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jane shook her head as her fingers tightened around his shoulders. \u201cHe did it for himself. Because he thought the blood would make him strong enough to fight the urges he had, but, after a while, it just made everything worse.\u201d</p><p>If Liam had been sick, Alerac should have known.</p><p>\u201cHe loved you,\u201d Jane whispered. \u201cAnd he hated you.\u201d</p><p>His jaw locked. \u201cYou only had a few sips of his blood. You can\u2019t know all of this.\u201d She couldn\u2019t know it. Jane hadn\u2019t even gotten Alerac\u2019s memories until she\u2019d slept.</p><p>A faint line was between her brows. \u201cI think I\u2019m stronger. Your blood made me stronger. Because I could see everything. From the first drop of blood that hit my tongue, I could see.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why, but Alerac felt like those words were a warning. \u201cThen maybe you should drink from me again. That way, you can fully see the monster before you.\u201d What the hell was he saying? He didn\u2019t want her to see him that way.</p><p>Did he?</p><p>Alerac stepped away from her. He\u2019d stripped her down to her bra and underwear. He tried not to notice the delicate temptation of her body. Failed.</p><p>He leaned into the shower and yanked on the water. Then he stripped without looking at her.</p><p>He put his hands on the shower\u2019s glass door. \u201cWhy did you faint?\u201d Because of what I am?</p><p>\u201cHis memories were too much. I couldn\u2019t shut them out any other way, so I guess I just shut down.\u201d</p><p>Alerac nodded. But he knew her words weren\u2019t the total truth. \u201cYou were afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlerac...\u201d</p><p>With a twisted smile, he glanced over at her. \u201cYou still are.\u201d</p><p>He climbed into the shower, and the rushing water poured over him.</p><p>The blood washed away. If only it were so easy to wash all the sins from his soul.</p><p>Then Jane was there. Naked, entering the shower with him. The water slickened her skin. Steam floated in the air around them.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid of you,\u201d Jane confessed.</p><p>She was trying to break him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid of myself. Since I\u2019ve met you, I\u2019ve changed.\u201d Her body brushed against him.</p><p>If the woman was so scared, she needed to be stepping back. Not getting closer. Because in another few seconds, he\u2019d be grabbing her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t plan to let go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the same woman you found in that bar. I-I still don\u2019t remember Keira, not really. But I\u2019ve seen her, through your eyes.\u201d Her lips pressed together. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that, though. I\u2019m stronger than I realized. You make me strong.\u201d</p><p>That was bullshit. She\u2019d always been strong. Someone weak didn\u2019t trade her life for another\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI know that I\u2019m going to keep changing. I\u2019m not going to be fully Jane, not fully Keira, but something in the middle. That scares me.\u201d Then she made a mistake.</p><p>She touched him.</p><p>Wet, silken flesh.</p><p>His cock was already erect and aching. The too-big shower suddenly seemed too small.</p><p>\u201cAnd you scare me, too. Because I know that you\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Not to her, dammit, never to her.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel so much. Desire. Need.\u201d She stood on her tip-toes and pressed her lips to his. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I feel like you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>He did. Had, from the moment he first saw her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her against the tiled wall. \u201cYou do.\u201d He didn\u2019t care what twisted magic Lorcan had spun. Jane was his. In life. And beyond death.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her go. He\u2019d find a way to break that spell or curse or whatever the hell it was.</p><p>He\u2019d find a way.</p><p>Jane\u2019s fingers slid down his body. Curled around his aroused flesh as he kissed her beneath the rough spray of the shower. His cock jerked at her touch. He was so ready for her. Always, for her. She stroked him, pumping his flesh, bringing his arousal to a harder, sharper, desperate edge.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>He lifted her up against that tile. Took her breast into his mouth. Licked and sucked and when she moaned, it was the sweetest sound he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>Her pleasure.</p><p>He kissed a path to her other breast. Her legs curled around his hips, and she positioned his cock right at the entrance to her sex.</p><p>\u201cNow, Alerac, I need you now.\u201d</p><p>He drove into her. Her silken heat covered him, straining around his length. His hands had flattened on the tile behind her. Their eyes were on level now. He stared at her.</p><p>In her gaze, Alerac saw every dream that he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Saw her.</p><p>He withdrew and thrust. Again and again. But he didn\u2019t make the rhythm rough and wild. Not this time. This time, he kept a stranglehold on his control. This time, he wanted to prove that he could be more than the savage who went wild for her.</p><p>His cock angled over her clit as he thrust. Her breaths came faster, harder. Her nails pressed into his shoulders. And her gaze held his.</p><p>His cock swelled even more. He drove deep.</p><p>Kissed her. Stroked her with his tongue and his lips, and she came around him, shuddering, her sex quivering along his length.</p><p>He held his body still as she came, loving the feel of her pleasure, and then, only when she was sated, he carried her from the shower. Her legs were still wrapped around his hips. His cock was still in the paradise of her body.</p><p>He lowered her onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cAlerac?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cYou make me happy.\u201d As few things in this world ever had.</p><p>Jane blinked at him, and her gaze seemed to soften. Then she smiled. \u201cYou make me...happy, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again.</p><p>Started to thrust. Still not too hard, not too wild. He wanted her to come again. Endlessly. He wanted to show her all that he could give to her. Wanted to prove that their life together could be good.</p><p>If she gave him a chance.</p><p>If she wouldn\u2019t fear him.</p><p>Her heels pushed into his lower back. \u201cAlerac, I want everything.\u201d And her sex clamped around him, her delicate inner muscles tightening.</p><p>For an instant, he paused.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she said once more, her voice a sensual demand. Then she arched toward him.</p><p>He put his hand between their bodies. Stroked her, pushed right when he knew her need was centered most.</p><p>He forced his control to hold. Forced it\u2014</p><p>She came.</p><p>He shattered. No, his control shattered. He thrust fast and furiously now, determined to claim her, every single bit of her. When the pleasure hit him, it consumed Alerac, wiping away his past and his future. Wiping away everything.</p><p>But his Jane.</p><p>You make me happy.</p><p>He would fight for that happiness. Battle a hundred vampires. Slay any beast in his path.</p><p>As long as that path led to her.</p><p>He was dying.</p><p>Ryan could feel death coming. Death wasn\u2019t cold. Wasn\u2019t some icy touch. Death burned and twisted and cut, destroying him from the inside out.</p><p>He\u2019d known that his time was coming. The pain had been growing.</p><p>Every moment, it had been his companion.</p><p>Lorcan and his twisted deals. He\u2019d connected Ryan to his sister all right, a connection that had eaten away at him for too long.</p><p>He coughed, choking, and wasn\u2019t surprised to see blood come from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to you?\u201d</p><p>Zoe. Whenever he turned around, she seemed to be there, watching him with her big, dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Death. There was no point in telling her. The witch had been clear on what he needed.</p><p>A caged beast\u2014that sure seemed to be Zoe. And it wasn\u2019t the first time that he\u2019d heard that particular line. Lorcan had told him\u2014when he tracked the SOB down fifty years ago\u2014something similar. That his freedom lay with a beast bound by chains that no one could see.</p><p>Knowing Lorcan\u2019s twisted streak, it had figured that the beast in question was a werewolf.</p><p>Zoe was the only werewolf he\u2019d ever encountered who couldn\u2019t fully shift.</p><p>But if he bit her, she\u2019d be destroyed.</p><p>For once, he\u2019d do the right thing. He\u2019d keep his fangs away from her.</p><p>He coughed again. But he caught the blood in his fist so she wouldn\u2019t see it. Then he turned away from her, smearing it on his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m going to check in the woods. Make sure that Lorcan isn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pack is patrolling\u2014\u201d Zoe began.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to patrol, too,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Lorcan. He\u2019d wanted to help his sister defeat their old clan leader, but he wasn\u2019t going to be any use to her.</p><p>A brother found, then lost, all so suddenly.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d grieve for him.</p><p>Maybe she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look back at Zoe. She was too much of a temptation to him.</p><p>He was just passing two twisted pine trees when Zoe grabbed him. She spun him back around to face her. \u201cI can smell your blood.\"</p><p>Shifter nose. He inclined his head. \u201cGood for you. Now do us both a favor...stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain\u2019s worse.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He didn\u2019t feel like lying anymore.</p><p>\u201cIs this really what you want?\u201d She asked him, tilting back her head and letting that heavy curtain of hair fall over her shoulders. \u201cTo just crawl off into the woods and die? Is that what you want for your sister? For her to stumble over your body?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hands around her. Dammit, mistake. Because touching her flooded him with a dark need. \u201cWhat I want,\u201d Ryan managed to choke out, \u201cis to sink my teeth into your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m your cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to taste you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>Control. Control. Control. \u201cBut for once in my life, I\u2019m trying to do the right thing.\u201d He moved her out of his way. Then he forced his fingers to stop touching her. To just let her go. \u201cI\u2019m not going to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch didn\u2019t say that you\u2019d destroy me. Just my beast.\u201d Her laugh was brittle. \u201cThe beast in me hasn\u2019t ever been anything to brag about.\u201d Her hands lifted. Claws sprouted from her fingertips. \u201cThis is about all I\u2019ve got. Claws and some enhanced strength. The others never wanted me here. They didn\u2019t think I belonged in the pack.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the pain. Just like always. Strange but, when he\u2019d touched her, the pain had seemed to lessen. It was sure back full force now. \u201cAlerac wants you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlerac is still trying to atone for the sins he committed against your sister. He tries to save everyone now. Finn...\u201d Sadness flickered across her face. \u201cFinn was my friend. The others here only tolerate me because Alerac tells them to do it. I\u2019m not one of them, and they know it.\u201d</p><p>He backed away from her. His heart seemed to be squeezing, held tight in a fist of fire. \u201cAnd what is it that you want from me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lashes lowered, concealing her gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the stories. When your sister bit Alerac, he changed. Became even more powerful. I\u2019ve seen that power with my own eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her scent had wrapped around him. Lush. Woman.</p><p>\u201cIf you bite me, I might lose my beast.\u201d</p> <p>Um, might? Based on what the witch had said, that was more of a definite.</p><p>\u201cBut maybe I can become something else. Something even more powerful.\u201d</p><p>Hell. She needed to get away from him. \u201cDo you want to turn out like Liam?\u201d</p><p>Zoe flinched.</p><p>\u201cBecause that could happen. Vamp blood isn\u2019t exactly the safest drug out there.\u201d For many, that was exactly what it was\u2014a drug. An addiction.</p> <p>An addiction to power and darkness.</p><p>Do the right thing. Dammit, he was. For once. \u201cGo back to your pack. Protect the alpha. And just forget you ever met me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan spun turned away from her. Hesitated. \u201cPlease tell Jane I said good-bye.\u201d He hadn\u2019t used their link to touch her mind again. Because he hadn\u2019t wanted her to see his certainty of death.</p><p>So he\u2019d kept a wall between them, even though he\u2019d felt her reach out to him several times. If he\u2019d let her in, she might have felt his pain. He didn\u2019t want her suffering as he did.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t protected her before. He was trying to, now.</p><p>Ryan swiped away the blood that dripped from his lips. Then, just as Zoe said, he crawled away to die.</p> <p>Jane opened her eyes and stared up at the ceiling. Darkness had fallen, she could feel it. An instinctive awareness.</p><p>Alerac was beside her, his body a warm and solid weight against her. He\u2019d wrapped his arm around her stomach, pulling her close.</p><p>She had more of his memories. So many more.</p><p>I\u2019ll take his punishment. She\u2019d had visions of that terrible night again.</p><p>But Jane still didn\u2019t remember the actual punishment that she\u2019d endured. And she sure didn\u2019t remember any last minute deal that she\u2019d made with Lorcan, agreeing to bind their lives.</p><p>But I know how to remember that deal.</p><p>Her memories were gone. Lost. Lorcan\u2019s weren\u2019t. She could retrieve his memories just as she\u2019d retrieved Alerac\u2019s. All she needed was some blood.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s blood.</p> <p>Her head turned. She stared at Alerac. In sleep, he didn\u2019t look quite so fierce. The hard lines of his face were smoothed some, his hair tousled.</p><p>Her fingers lifted and brushed lightly through his hair. Then she bent and pressed a light kiss to his cheek.</p><p>Alerac\u2019s eyes opened. The brightness didn\u2019t shock her anymore. She\u2019d seen his memories of the attack.</p><p>He\u2019d blocked most of the pain. And instead of seeing darkness, he\u2019d chosen to see her.</p><p>As long as Lorcan lived, he would be a threat to Alerac. Lorcan had wanted Alerac\u2019s destruction two centuries ago.</p><p>He wanted it now.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to stop,\u201d Jane whispered.</p><p>A faint furrow appeared between Alerac\u2019s brows.</p><p>\u201cLorcan will keep coming,\u201d she continued. Just like the monsters in all the movies she\u2019d watched on Saturday nights. \u201cWe have to stop him.\u201d</p><p>Alerac sat up, and the sheets fell into a tangle near his waist. \u201cWe can\u2019t. If he dies, then you die.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers rose and stroked over his tattoo. \u201cTell me why you got this.\u201d She knew\u2014she\u2019d seen it in his memories. Yet it seemed important for him to tell her on his own.</p><p>His heart raced beneath her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s my symbol\u2014forever. Eternity.</p><p>An endless knot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...for you,\u201d he continued, voice roughening. \u201cA design to show that I am bound to you, forever, that I would search until I found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t let you go. But I won\u2019t kill Lorcan because I can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid he would say that. \u201cWhat if Lorcan comes after your pack? What if hunts them?\u201d As he\u2019d done before.</p><p>When he killed Alerac\u2019s family. She\u2019d seen that memory. The terrible carnage that Alerac had found when he\u2019d returned to his home and found death waiting, courtesy of Lorcan.</p><p>Alerac shook his head. \u201cWe can defend ourselves.\u201d</p><p>No, they couldn\u2019t. \u201cNot if you aren\u2019t willing to kill the one attacking you.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid under her jaw. \u201cNo one hurts you. You will not suffer again for me or mine\u2014\u201d</p><p>She knew her smile was sad. \u201cOh, Alerac, are you still blaming yourself?\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered over his face.</p><p>Jane pulled away from him. She climbed from the bed. Dressed with fumbling fingers. Hurry, hurry.</p><p>\u201cI am to blame.\u201d His words were slow. \u201cYou suffered for me.\u201d</p><p>Enough. She put her hands on her hips and faced him. \u201cI suffered for me. I made the choice. Not you. It was all me.\u201d Because she wasn\u2019t some child to have others determine her life. Not then, and not now. It was still her choice. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand by and watch you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour memory...it\u2019s back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your memories are.\u201d She\u2019d seen herself clearly through his eyes. Heard her own whispered confession of love. \u201cWatching you die would have destroyed me.\u201d</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t do something about Lorcan, the same fate would wait for her. Lorcan wasn\u2019t going to give up. She turned from Alerac and paced toward the window.</p><p>She stared into the darkness. When would another attack come?</p><p>Her hand lifted and rubbed over her heart. It was aching.</p><p>No, it was burning.</p><p>Pain suddenly stole her voice, and Jane doubled over. Her head hit the window, and glass shattered.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d Alerac was there in an instant, pulling her toward him.</p><p>The burn just grew worse. And, in her mind, she could see the sudden image of her brother. \u201cRyan,\u201d she whispered. She hadn\u2019t touched his mind fully again, not since that one time when he\u2019d sent his message to her, but Jane knew that she was reaching him in that pain-filled moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Alerac demanded. His hands were so gentle on her.</p><p>Jane forced her head to lift. \u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>No surprise was in Alerac\u2019s gaze.</p><p>No hope, either.</p><p>Jane pulled in a heavy breath. Blood was dripping from a cut over her right eyebrow. The heat from the night drifted in from that broken glass. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let him go like this.\u201d She\u2019d just found him. To lose him now\u2014no.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d Alerac asked her. \u201cTrade Zoe\u2019s life for his?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t interested in a trade. \u201cLorcan can end this all.\u201d</p><p>She just had to find him.</p><p>Even if she had to do it on her own.</p><p>Jane yanked away from Alerac. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Then she leapt right through the window. More glass shattered around her. This time, she hadn\u2019t slowed down long enough to open the window. She\u2019d just gone right through the glass. I\u2019m stronger now.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d</p><p>Her knees didn\u2019t buckle when she landed. She didn\u2019t hesitate on the ground. She could smell her brother\u2019s blood, and she followed that scent, running hard and fast through the woods.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be the only one who wanted to see Ryan at the end. After all of his games, after all of his sick plans, Jane thought Lorcan might want to witness the sight of her brother dying, too.</p><p>Footsteps thundered behind her. Alerac. She\u2019d known that he would give chase.</p><p>But what Alerac didn\u2019t know...I\u2019m stronger than he is right now. Stronger and faster. His blood fueled her and power pulsed beneath her skin. So her legs pumped faster. The trees passed her in a blur, and she tracked the scent of her brother\u2019s blood deep into the woods.</p><p>Ryan hit the ground. A stone slammed into his cheek, and he felt a bone break.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go any farther.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>When he breathed\u2014a jagged exhale\u2014smoke drifted from his lips.</p><p>He was truly burning from the inside.</p><p>He\u2019d been weak a moment before. He\u2019d thought of his sister. Just a flash, and he\u2019d been in her mind.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to pull back, but she\u2019d had the link then.</p><p>She\u2019d known what was happening to him.</p><p>His fingers sank into the mud. He\u2019d tried to get away from her. Away from everyone. But\u2014</p><p>A twig snapped behind him.</p><p>Ryan forced his body to roll over.</p><p>She was there. Fate was cruel, giving him this last sight on earth.</p><p>Zoe shook her head as she crept out of the trees and toward the small clearing. \u201cAre you done running? Are you ready to see reason?\u201d</p><p>Reason? Reason wasn\u2019t about destroying someone like her so that he could live.</p><p>She took another step toward. \u201cLet me do this\u2014\u201d But she broke off as her head jerked up. She started to whirl back toward the trees.</p><p>Ryan tried to yell a warning.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Blood flew from his lips. Blood and smoke.</p><p>And blood flew from Zoe\u2019s neck. Because Lorcan had just appeared near Zoe. Lorcan had sliced his fangs across her throat.</p><p>As Ryan lay there, helpless to do anything but watch, Lorcan dropped Zoe to the ground. A pain-filled moan slipped from her lips.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have her ruining things for me, now could I?\u201d Lorcan murmured as he wiped the blood from his lips. \u201cNot when I\u2019ve been waiting so long for this particular show.\u201d Lorcan smiled.</p><p>Zoe wouldn\u2019t be his last sight on earth.</p><p>The last image that Ryan would see\u2014it would be the devil.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Jane burst from the trees, and she slammed her body into Lorcan\u2019s. \u201cStay away from him!\u201d Fury drove her, just amping up the power in her body.</p><p>She and Lorcan hit the ground, then they rolled in a tangle of limbs. Rocks and branches cut into her skin, and when they stopped their mad tumble, she was on top of Lorcan.</p><p>The SOB was grinning up at her. \u201cKnew you\u2019d be here, too,\u201d he said, sounding pleased. \u201cKnew it...we both wanted to see him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to watch my brother die.\u201d She held Lorcan\u2019s hands against the ground. From the corner of her eye, she saw Zoe.</p><p>Zoe wasn\u2019t dead. Not yet. The scent of the werewolf\u2019s blood filled Jane\u2019s nostrils. Maybe Zoe should be dead, but she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Zoe was crawling, dragging her body toward Ryan.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you are.\u201d Lorcan didn\u2019t fight her grip. Just kept grinning. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way for this to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d Jane said, then she sank her teeth into his throat.</p><p>Lorcan yelled and tried to throw her off him.</p><p>She held on tight. She drank.</p><p>And his memories came to her.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re brave...\u201d Lorcan\u2019s voice. Booming.</p><p>Jane saw her image, a pale woman with her wrists bound and her ankles chained.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d he snarled at her. \u201cYour lover will be dead long before you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised that you wouldn\u2019t kill him!\u201d Fear flared in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t kill him. I\u2019ll just make him beg for death.\u201d</p><p>Jane saw herself try to struggle out of the bonds.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never promised not to kill your brother.\u201d</p><p>She stopped fighting the bonds.</p><p>Lorcan walked around her. They were...in a dark room. Stone for a floor. Stone for the walls. She\u2019d been cut, deep slices at her wrists, and dried blood covered her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou were a traitor, so I have to expect that Ryan will be one, too.\u201d He bent near her, brushing his mouth beside her cheek. \u201cHow much shall I make him suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDo you want to save him? Do you want to make me a deal, the same way you bargained for the life of that werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the word was a ragged breath. \u201cSpare Ryan. He didn\u2019t know that I was with Alerac. He had nothing to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make him into nothing. I can stake him out at dawn. I can drain him. I can turn him into ash that drifts on the wind.\u201d</p><p>The big, wooden door opened. A woman stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cAh, Shonna, so good of you to join us.\u201d Lorcan didn\u2019t look back at her. His stare remained on his prey. \u201cWhat will you give me, lost little Keira, if I let Ryan live to see you free once more?\u201d</p><p>The desolation eased in her eyes. Hope brightened her stare. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe begged me to free you. Offered to trade anything for your safety.\u201d</p><p>A blood red tear tracked through the dirt on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cBind your life to mine,\u201d Lorcan said.</p><p>His words were chilling. She saw the shiver rake her body.</p><p>\u201cAgree to the link, a link that will last until death for us, and I\u2019ll let your brother live.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He shook his finger. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not how it works. You have to say the words. Doesn\u2019t she, Shonna?\u201d He looked over his shoulder at the woman with a long braid of red hair. A woman with a knife in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Shonna whispered. Then she began to whisper the words of a spell.</p><p>The bite scars on Shonna\u2019s neck twisted the witch\u2019s skin.</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s focused shifted away from the witch. \u201cYour werewolf will be long gone before you\u2019re truly free. You won\u2019t be betraying him,\u201d Lorcan added as he brushed her hair over her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ll be saving your brother.\u201d</p><p>Another shudder shook her form. \u201cI-I\u2019ll bind to you, until death.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At those words, the witch rushed forward with her knife. She drove that knife into Keira\u2019s chest.More blood joined the dirt and grime that covered her.</p><p>\u201cThe bind will start the moment you escape your prison, when your lungs fill with their first taste of new air,\u201d the witch\u2019s words seemed to echo with power. \u201cThe bond will continue, through blood and pain, until one of you dies.\u201d</p><p>Then Lorcan took the knife. He licked the blood away from the blade. \u201cDeath will be a very long time coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet the hell away from her!\u201d Alerac bellowed.</p><p>His cry had Jane jerking up. The images vanished.</p><p>And Lorcan was able to toss her aside.</p><p>In the next instant, Lorcan was on his feet. \u201cShe was the one to come for me,\u201d Lorcan taunted. \u201cI guess our link is stronger than she\u2019d have you believe.\u201d</p><p>Jane spat out the blood in her mouth. She hated having any part of him in her, but now Jane understood.</p> <p>She\u2019d agreed to the trade. Lorcan had been right, she\u2019d willingly bound herself to him. \u201cYou bastard.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou said that you\u2019d let my brother live!\u201d</p><p>Lorcan shook his finger at her. \u201cNo, I said he\u2019d live to see you free. You\u2019re free. He\u2019s dead.\u201d With a smirk, he glanced toward Ryan\u2019s form.</p><p>But Ryan wasn\u2019t alone on the ground. Zoe had made her way to him. She\u2019d shoved her wrist over Ryan\u2019s mouth. With tears streaming down her cheeks, Zoe cried out, \u201cJane...make him...bite!\u201d</p><p>Alerac rushed to Zoe\u2019s side. \u201cGet away from him! You know what will happen if he bites you!\u201d</p> <p>Her beast would die.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...already d-dying...\u201d Zoe\u2019s voice was weaker. Probably because she was missing a big part of her throat. There was so much blood. \u201cLet me...h-help...\u201d Her gaze found Jane\u2019s. \u201cMake him b-bite...\u201d</p><p>Lorcan stalked toward Zoe and Alerac. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way, bitch. You don\u2019t get to save him. No one does.\u201d</p><p>His claws flew toward Zoe\u2019s neck.</p><p>Jane screamed.</p><p>Alerac caught Lorcan\u2019s hands in a tight grip.</p><p>Lorcan didn\u2019t back away. He leaned in toward Alerac. \u201cHow are you going to stop me? How are you going to stop me from doing anything? You can\u2019t hurt me. Because, if you do, you hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s gaze flew to Jane.</p> <p>\u201cTighten your grip a bit more,\u201d Lorcan taunted. \u201cBreak my wrist. Break her wrist.\u201d</p><p>Alerac became as still as stone.</p><p>\u201cM-make him bite...\u201d Zoe begged.</p><p>Jane focused on the female werewolf. Zoe only had a few moments left.</p><p>\u201cC-can\u2019t shift to heal...\u201dZoe whispered. \u201cCould never...s-survive...\u201d</p><p>Jane straightened her shoulders. Bite, Ryan. She attempted to find a link to his mind. She was trying desperately to reach out to him, but she couldn\u2019t connect. She could only feel an icy touch, a too deep cold, seeming to emanate from him.</p><p>Bite.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s wrist was still over Ryan\u2019s mouth. Her eyes were sagging closed.</p><p>Thud. Thud. Zoe\u2019s heart was giving its last few beats. Jane\u2019s enhanced hearing barely picked up the feeble sounds.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lorcan had torn away from Alerac. His eyes were on Jane. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be saved! He\u2019s dead! He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zoe gasped.</p><p>Jane smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s not dead yet. He\u2019s feeding.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan lunged toward Jane. Before he could grab her, Alerac was in his path once again.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ever hurt her again,\u201d Alerac vowed.</p><p>Lorcan staggered to a stop. \u201cOf course, I will. I\u2019ll hurt her again and again. Watch and see.\u201d Then he lifted up his claws\u2014and plunged them into his own chest.</p><p>Blood poured from the matching wound that instantly appeared on Jane\u2019s body.</p><p>Lorcan smiled his sadistic grin. \u201cI can hurt her anytime I want. From anywhere I want. That was all part of the spell. Pain for pain. Life for life.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan hadn\u2019t driven the claws into his heart\u2014because he didn\u2019t want to die. He just wanted her to suffer.</p><p>Alerac yanked the claws out of Lorcan\u2019s chest. \u201cStop it,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>Jane\u2019s blood dripped onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop hurting her,\u201d Lorcan agreed, voice sly and silken, \u201conce you\u2019re gone, wolf. Get the hell out of here. Leave Jane, and I won\u2019t hurt her again.\u201d</p><p>Lie.</p><p>Alerac glanced over his shoulder at Jane.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe both know that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d She ignored the pain in her chest. Or, at least, she didn\u2019t let the pain send her to her knees. \u201cYou leave, and he\u2019ll go after your pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go after them anyway.\u201d Lorcan admitted easily. \u201cDogs need death. And he,\u201d he swiped his claws over Alerac\u2019s chest. Alerac didn\u2019t even fight back. Alerac let the bastard attack him. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop me. He can\u2019t. Not if he wants to keep his precious a r\u00fansearc safe.\u201d</p><p>A r\u00fansearc.</p><p>Alerac had said that meant vampire.</p><p>He\u2019d lied to her.</p><p>What it really meant was...secret love. She knew that, now. Because she had Alerac and Lorcan\u2019s understanding of the language.</p><p>Alerac had been telling her how he felt, all along. She hadn\u2019t realized...</p><p>Alerac hadn\u2019t just been using her two centuries before. He loves me.</p><p>She ran to him and yanked him away from Lorcan\u2019s attack. Jane forced Alerac to face her.</p><p>His fierce gaze locked on hers. \u201cThere\u2019s a way,\u201d he said to Jane. \u201cI know there is. I just have to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I take those wolf eyes of yours, will you grow another set?\u201d Lorcan asked, voice curious. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to find out.\u201d His voice hardened as he said, \u201cIn case you missed the news, I have the power here. All of it. You can\u2019t hurt me, not without hurting her. You can\u2019t do a damn thing to me, but I can sure as fuck enjoy hurting you.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s shoulders straightened. She knew that he\u2019d take whatever pain Lorcan gave to him\u2014and not fight back.</p><p>For me.</p><p>His pack would suffer.</p><p>For me.</p><p>In the end, Alerac would lose his life.</p><p>For me.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. \u201cIt was my choice before,\u201d Jane whispered to him.</p><p>Alerac shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my choice now.\u201d She pushed onto her toes. Pressed her lips against his. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Then she backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jane,\u201d Alerac began. \u201cyou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold him, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s eyes widened. He glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>Ryan wasn\u2019t on the ground anymore. Wasn\u2019t spitting up blood. He was on his feet, and in an instant, he\u2019d lunged toward Alerac. Ryan wrapped his hands around Alerac. Held him tight.</p><p>Jane knew her brother wouldn\u2019t be able to hold Alerac for long.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t need a long time. After all, it only took seconds to die. She bent and grabbed a broken branch near her feet. Good thing there were plenty of tree branches lying around. And all you needed to stake a vampire was a chunk of wood. \u201cThe deal\u2019s over, Lorcan. Consider the bond broken.\u201d</p><p>Lorcan\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>They were still wide when she rushed toward him and drove that branch right through his heart.</p><p>Didn\u2019t see that coming, did you, bastard?</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The cry ripped from Alerac. He tossed Ryan aside. Raced toward Jane.</p><p>The wood went straight through Lorcan\u2019s body, shoving out of his back. Blood covered the vamp as his knees gave way and he hit the ground.</p><p>Alerac grabbed Jane before she could fall, too.</p><p>\u201cA r\u00fansearc, what have you done?\u201d Her chest was soaked with blood. Her breath barely wheezed out. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-because y-you wouldn\u2019t...ever h-hurt me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to end things yourself? You can\u2019t do this!\u201d Rage and grief twisted inside him, and destroyed any sane thought. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go! Dammit, no!\u201d</p><p>Blood trickled from her mouth. Her eyes stared up at him. \u201cLove...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He pulled her against his chest. Rocked her with mindless motions of his body. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you love me. Don\u2019t say that you love me while your heart is\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cJ-Jane?\u201d</p><p>He tilted back her head. Her eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cJane, don\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>His hold on her was too hard. He had to ease his grip or he\u2019d bruise her. He couldn\u2019t bruise Jane. He couldn\u2019t hurt Jane. He needed her too much. She had to stay with him. He couldn\u2019t make it through any more years without her.</p><p>\u201cLorcan\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s voice. Alerac\u2019s head snapped up. His gaze narrowed on the vampire. The one who\u2019d held him back. If Ryan hadn\u2019t grabbed him, then Alerac could have stopped Jane. He could have saved her.</p><p>No, no, I\u2019ll still save her. She\u2019s not gone. Not yet. She\u2019ll come back to me.</p><p>\u201cWe should burn his body,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cJust to make fucking sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Alerac\u2019s roar. If they burned Lorcan, then they would burn Jane.</p><p>Ryan swallowed. He stared right back at Alerac. Grief was in the vamp\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe knew that you wouldn\u2019t kill him, that you\u2019d let your pack die, that you\u2019d die, for her.\u201d</p><p>Yes, in an instant, he would have given his life for her.</p><p>\u201cShe chose to save you instead. Just like before.\u201d Ryan\u2019s lips twisted, but there was no humor there. Only pain. \u201cLooks like two hundred years didn\u2019t change the way that she felt about you, memory or no memory.\u201d</p><p>The drumming of Alerac\u2019s heartbeat was too loud. A red haze covered his vision. That haze was blood.</p><p>Jane\u2019s blood.</p><p>Jane.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t burning him,\u201d Alerac said. HIs words sounded hoarse, as if they\u2019d been scraped from his throat. \u201cYou aren\u2019t burning her.\u201d</p><p>Alerac\u2019s gaze flew back to Jane. He couldn\u2019t look away. Jane had saved him, too many times. It was his turn to save her. He had to save her. There wasn\u2019t any other option for him.</p><p>Without her, he didn\u2019t want to walk this earth.</p><p>Without her, it wouldn\u2019t be safe for him to walk this earth.</p><p>\u201cShe just needs blood,\u201d he said. His words were ragged. So was his breath. \u201cBlood heals. That\u2019s all she needs.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s footsteps shuffled closer. \u201cBlood won\u2019t bring back the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d A soft voice\u2014Zoe?</p><p>His head turned. He saw her standing, pale, trembling, just behind Ryan.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not breathing, Alerac,\u201d Zoe told him with pity in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in the ground for two centuries!\u201d Alerac yelled back. \u201cA witch put a spell on her then. She didn\u2019t need breath. She can still live!\u201d</p><p>He had to make her live. He cut his wrist, sliced it quickly with his claws, then dripped the blood into Jane\u2019s mouth. Then he massaged her neck\u2014she\u2019s warm, that means she lives\u2014as he attempted to force the blood down her throat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re linked,\u201d Alerac whispered. \u201cShe made me more than just a beast. I made her more than just a vampire.\u201d Please don\u2019t leave me. Please. \u201cShe\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight. He gave her his blood. \u201cI love you, Jane,\u201d he whispered. He told her that truth again and again.</p><p>But her eyes didn\u2019t open.</p><p>And the beast within him broke just as the man did.</p><p>Ryan felt as if his own heart had been cut out. Alerac wouldn\u2019t let his sister go. He clung to her too tightly. Had to hold her close constantly. Alerac had finally left the woods moments before, with Jane still held in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to...to lose him?\u201d Zoe\u2019s voice. She came toward him, a torch in her hands. Her movements were slow, her body still trembled, but her gaze was unflinching as it met his.</p><p>She saved my life.</p><p>By sacrificing her beast.</p><p>The fire in his chest was gone. The pain, the certainty of death\u2014all gone.</p><p>Because of her.</p><p>How was he supposed to repay a debt like that?</p><p>\u201cWill he s-survive losing her?\u201d Zoe asked. Her voice broke a bit. Her throat was almost fully healed. He knew the catch in her words came from grief, not pain.</p><p>Ryan wasn\u2019t sure that Alerac would survive. But one thing he did know...he had to burn Lorcan\u2019s body. That had been Jane\u2019s last order to him.</p><p>Bite...her whisper had floated through his mind, and he\u2019d found himself sinking his teeth into Zoe\u2019s arm.</p><p>Then...</p><p>Stop Alerac. Hold him.</p><p>He\u2019d been at Alerac\u2019s back in the next moment.</p><p>Burn Lorcan. Nothing can remain.</p><p>He took the torch from Zoe. They\u2019d waited until Alerac left for this last act.</p><p>But...when he burned Lorcan, would Jane\u2019s body turn to ash, too? He knew that was what Alerac feared.</p><p>\u201cGo to him,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMake sure...\u201d That he doesn\u2019t jump into the flames if Jane\u2019s body sparks fire. Make sure that he doesn\u2019t turn on his pack as the rage consumes him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zoe nodded and she hurried away.</p><p>Ryan stood over Lorcan\u2019s body, staring down at the vampire who\u2019d ruined so many lives.</p><p>But now, now that vampire would burn in hell.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s free of you,\u201d Ryan told him, voice thick. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever hurt her again.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted the torch. He\u2019d wait just a few more minutes so that Zoe could get to Alerac. Just a few minutes more.</p><p>\u201cAlerac, stop!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop. He kept walking, numb, holding Jane tight. Had he ever told her how beautiful she was? When she smiled, it was the most perfect sight he\u2019d ever witnessed.</p><p>He wished that she had smiled more.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to spend an eternity at her side.</p> <p>He\u2019d been given just days.</p><p>Zoe grabbed his arm. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, not yet.</p><p>\u201cRyan is burning Lorcan. You know it has to be done. He was so strong\u2014\u201d</p><p>His body tensed. \u201cThat will burn her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes...\u201d</p> <p>He spun in an instant and rushed back through the woods. Ryan should know better. Ryan was her brother. He should want to keep her alive. Not give her to the flames. As he ran, Alerac kept Jane locked tightly in his arms. Was her body growing colder? No, no, it couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The smell of smoke teased his nose. \u201cStop!\u201d Alerac bellowed.</p><p>Flames began to crackle.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He burst into the clearing.</p><p>Ryan shook his head and lowered the torch. The fire caught the edge of Lorcan\u2019s shirt. Grazed over the vamp\u2019s skin. Then Lorcan ignited.</p><p>The flames spread instantly.</p><p>And Jane\u2019s body began to feel warmer.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alerac whispered. This couldn\u2019t happen. Things were supposed to end differently for them. He was going to protect her. Going to spend all of his life with her.</p><p>\u201cPut her down before you burn!\u201d Zoe cried.</p><p>But he just held Jane tighter.</p><p>\u201cThings were going to be different,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Lorcan was completely engulfed in flames.</p><p>Jane\u2019s body was even warmer now.</p><p>\u201cSo different.\u201d He closed his eyes and bent his head. His lips brushed over her forehead.</p><p>Then he heard...it.</p><p>A soft thud.</p><p>A heart, beating again.</p><p>Breath whispered from lips that had been still moments before.</p><p>Alerac was afraid to look at Jane. What if his vision proved the other senses to be a lie? Better to stay this way, to just hope...</p><p>Has my sanity left already?</p><p>Without her, yes, he knew it had.</p><p>\u201cThings will be different.\u201d That was her voice. Soft and husky and hers.</p><p>Helpless now, his lashes lifted.</p><p>Jane\u2019s pale lips tried to curve into a smile. \u201cI could...sure use a little...more of the super blood y-you...have...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d give her anything.</p><p>\u201cFeel like...death warmed...over...\u201d Jane told him.</p><p>She was trying to joke? When he\u2019d just nearly lost his life? Because if he\u2019d lost her, his life would not have been worth living. I couldn\u2019t survive without her again.</p><p>He lifted her higher. Her arms curled around his neck. Her fangs sank into his throat.</p><p>Alive. Alive. Alive!</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d Ryan sounded shocked. \u201cHoly hell, Jane!\u201d</p><p>Her mouth pulled away from Alerac\u2019s throat. She looked up at him. Stared deeply into Alerac\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m only bound...to you now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always be bound to her.</p><p>\u201cYou p-pulled me back.\u201d Her voice was gaining strength. Faint color filled her cheeks. \u201cYou gave me...some of the beast inside. Inside me.\u201d</p><p>Not just vampire. Not just werewolf.</p><p>\u201cHis tie only lasted until death.\u201d Jane smiled. The most beautiful sight. \u201cYours lasted longer, and so did I.\u201d</p><p>Good. Because if she hadn\u2019t come back to him, Alerac would have followed her. He would have fuckin\u2019 fought death. Done anything\u2014for her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her. He needed her to hear the words. Alerac needed to say them, even though love felt like far too tame of a description for the way he felt.</p><p>\u201cI know, a r\u00fansearc,\u201dJane told him, eyes bright with emotion. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>A r\u00fansearc. Secret love. The love that had been in his heart from the moment he first saw her.</p><p>The love that would continue on in this world and beyond death.</p><p>He eased Jane to her feet. Her brother instantly grabbed her and held her tight.</p><p>Zoe wiped away tears. Alerac reached for the she-wolf, pulling her close.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m not pack anymore,\u201d Zoe mumbled, \u201cI should-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pack,\u201d he told her flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re family.\u201d And that was all that anyone needed to know. He owed Zoe a debt he could never repay.</p><p>A debt that Ryan could never repay, but he\u2019d sure enjoy watching the vampire try.</p><p>Then Jane was coming back to him. Smiling. Breaking his heart with her beauty. Filling him with a hope that he hadn\u2019t dared to feel in far too long.</p><p>\u201cI saw Lorcan\u2019s memories,\u201d Jane told him. \u201cI knew death was the way to break the tie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually died?\u201d Zoe\u2019s voice rose. \u201cThen how did you come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Jane said softly. \u201cLove, and a bit of werewolf blood. It\u2019s damn powerful stuff.\u201d</p><p>Was she talking about werewolf blood being powerful? Or love?</p><p>\u201cIt can break any curse or spell.\u201d Jane rose onto her toes and brushed her lips over Alerac\u2019s. \u201cIt can survive anything.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his heart. The heart that beat for her, now and always.</p><p>Over her shoulder, Alerac saw Ryan cast a quick glance toward Zoe. There was so much emotion in the vamp\u2019s eyes. Emotion that was familiar to Alerac.</p><p>No, Zoe wasn\u2019t leaving the pack or the family that was being created.</p><p>A family with ties that had been forged in blood and death.</p><p>A family that now had a future.</p><p>\u201cTake me home, wolf,\u201d Jane ordered him as her fingers stroked over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m ready to have that \u2018something different\u2019 you promised me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the fire, but it was out now. Just smoke, drifting away.</p><p>Lorcan was gone. No more monsters to slay.</p><p>Well, at least not at that moment. Alerac was sure there would be more paranormal ass to kick eventually.</p><p>There always was.</p><p>But for now, he\u2019d take his mate, the love that he could see in her eyes, and he\u2019d enjoy the happiness that they had coming.</p><p>No more punishment.</p><p>No more death.</p><p>For them, it was time to be free. Time to live.</p><p>A werewolf and his vampire. Together.</p><p>Forever. </p> </body></html>"]
