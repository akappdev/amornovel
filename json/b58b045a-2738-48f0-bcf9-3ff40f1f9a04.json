The sound seemed to reverberate around her, magnified a hundred times, drowning out the words intoned by Father Darien. This was her mother\u2014her mother\u2014and Virginia Dancy deserved so much more than a cold blanket of Kentucky mud.</p><p>Lorraine had received word the evening of April first that her mother had been involved in a horrible freeway accident. In the beginning she\u2019d thought it was some kind of cruel hoax, a distasteful practical joke, but the mud-splattered casket was real enough to rip her heart wide open.</p> <p>Her chest tightened with the effort to hold back tears. A low mewling escaped her lips and her trembling increased as she listened to the priest\u2019s words in the gray afternoon.</p><p>After a while, the friends who\u2019d come to say their last farewells started to move away. Father Darien gently took hold of Lorraine\u2019s hands and in sincere compassionate tones offered a few final words of comfort. Reaching deep within herself, Lorraine managed to thank him.</p><p>Still, she remained, standing by her mother\u2019s grave.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d Gary Franklin, her fianc\u00e9, stepped closer and placed his arm around her waist. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d</p><p>She resisted and held her ground when Gary tried to steer her toward the waiting limo. She wasn\u2019t ready to leave her mother. Not yet. Please, not yet. It made everything so final...to turn her back and walk away.</p> <p>This shouldn\u2019t be happening. This couldn\u2019t be real. But the reality of the moment was undeniable\u2014the open grave, the nearby headstones, the muddy ground. Her fears assailed her from all sides, sending a chill down her spine. Lorraine wasn\u2019t sure she could survive without her mother\u2019s love and support. Virginia had been her touchstone. Her example. Her mother.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I know this is difficult, but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d Gary again tried to urge her away from the grave.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice stronger now. What made it all the more difficult, all the more painful, was the complete lack of warning. Lorraine had talked to her mother that very weekend. They were so close; it had been the two of them against the world for as long as Lorraine could remember. Not a day passed that they didn\u2019t connect in some way\u2014with a conversation, a visit, an email message. On Saturday they\u2019d spent more than an hour on the phone discussing plans for the wedding.</p><p>Her mother had been delighted when Lorraine accepted Gary\u2019s proposal. Virginia had always liked Gary and encouraged the relationship from the beginning. Gary and her mother had gotten along famously.</p><p>Just last weekend\u2014just a few days ago\u2014her mother had been alive. During their phone call Virginia had chatted endlessly about the kind of wedding she wanted for her only child. They\u2019d discussed the wedding dress, the bridesmaids, the flowers, the invitations. Lorraine had never heard her mother sound more excited. In her enthusiasm, Virginia had even mentioned her own wedding all those years ago and the only man she\u2019d ever loved. She rarely spoke of Lorraine\u2019s father. That was the one thing she didn\u2019t share with her daughter\u2014at least not since Lorraine\u2019s early teens. Those were private memories, and it was as though Virginia held them close to her heart. They\u2019d sustained her through the long lonely years of widowhood.</p><p>Lorraine couldn\u2019t remember her father, who\u2019d died when she was three. Her mother had loved Thomas Dancy so completely she\u2019d never entertained the thought of re-marrying. No man, she\u2019d once told Lorraine, could live up to the memory of the one she\u2019d lost.</p> <p>Her parents\u2019 love story was possibly the most romantic Lorraine had ever heard. When she was small, her mother had often told her how wonderful Thomas had been. In later years, of course, she hardly ever talked about him, but Lorraine remembered those long-ago stories\u2014of her father being a decorated war hero and how her parents had defied everyone by getting married. They were the adventure tales, the marvelous bedtime stories of her early childhood, and they\u2019d made a deep and lasting impression on her. It was one of the reasons Lorraine had waited until she was twenty-eight before becoming engaged herself. For years she\u2019d been searching for a man like her father, a man who was noble. Honest. Brave. A man of integrity and high ideals. No one seemed right until Gary Franklin came into her life.</p><p>\u201cLorraine, everyone\u2019s gone.\u201d Gary\u2019s arm tightened around her waist.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Please.\u201d She couldn\u2019t leave her mother, not like this. Not in a cold wet grave when Virginia Dancy hadn\u2019t even reached the age of fifty. The pain was more than Lorraine could bear. As the agony of the moment overwhelmed her, tears began to roll down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey, let me get you away from here,\u201d Gary murmured in a compassionate voice.</p><p>Lorraine took a step in retreat. She didn\u2019t want Gary. She didn\u2019t want anyone except her mother. And her mother was in a grave. \u201cOh, Mom,\u201d she cried, then broke into sobs, unable to stop herself.</p><p>Gary turned her in his arms and held her protectively against him. \u201cLet it out, sweetheart. It\u2019s okay. Go ahead and cry.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine hid her face in his shoulder and wept as she hadn\u2019t since that night the state patrolman had come to her with the tragic news. How long Gary let her weep, she didn\u2019t know. Until her eyes stung and her nose ran and there were no more tears to shed.</p><p>\u201cThe house is going to fill up and you\u2019ll need to be there,\u201d Gary reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we should go,\u201d she agreed, and wiped her nose with the tissue he handed her, grateful that Virginia\u2019s neighbor, Mrs. Henshaw, would be there to let everyone in. Lorraine was calmer now, more self-possessed. People would want to talk about her mother, and since Lorraine was the only one left in the family, she\u2019d have to be in control of her emotions.</p><p>Together she and Gary started toward the parking lot. Away from her mother. Away from the only parent she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s one, small comfort was the knowledge that after twenty-five years apart, her parents were finally together again.</p><p>Lorraine couldn\u2019t sleep, but then she hadn\u2019t really expected to. She should be exhausted. She was exhausted; she\u2019d barely slept in days. This past week had been the most emotionally draining of her life. But even now, after the funeral and the wake, she was too restless to collapse into sleep.</p><p>Gary seemed to think that spending the night at her mother\u2019s house wasn\u2019t the best idea. He was probably right. Her judgment, along with everything else, had been thrown off-kilter by her mother\u2019s death.</p><p>The wake had been here, at Virginia\u2019s place, since Lorraine\u2019s apartment was much too small to host the event, and a restaurant seemed too impersonal. Parishioners from St. John\u2019s Church where Virginia had faithfully attended Mass all these years, plus a large group of neighbors, coworkers and friends, had lingered to tell Lorraine how sorry they were. They, too, appeared to have difficulty accepting the suddenness of her mother\u2019s death.</p><p>Virginia had been an active member of St. John\u2019s and a devout Catholic. For twenty years she sang in the choir and worked tirelessly for her church \u201cfamily.\u201d As a stockbroker with a large national firm, she\u2019d made a name for herself in the business world. Turnover at the firm was high, and Virginia had learned that office friendships were often fleeting. Nevertheless, the house had been crammed with people.</p><p>Contrary to what Lorraine had assumed, she wasn\u2019t needed as hostess. Friends and neighbors arrived bearing casseroles, breads and salads, which soon covered the dining-room table. The extras spilled into the kitchen and lined the countertops.</p><p>Lorraine was grateful to everyone, especially Gary who\u2019d been both helpful and kind. Yet throughout the wake, all Lorraine had wanted was to be alone, to grieve by herself without people pressing in on her. But that wasn\u2019t possible. It took her a while to realize that the friends who\u2019d come were in need of solace, too. So she\u2019d thanked them for their condolences and done her best to take on the role of comforter. Before long, she\u2019d found herself depleted of energy, and she\u2019d sunk into her mother\u2019s favorite chair. Sitting there helped her feel closer to the mother she\u2019d loved so deeply. It eased the ache of loneliness that threatened to consume her in a room full of people.</p><p>An endless stream of sympathy and advice had come at her.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019ll want to keep the house...\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had nodded.</p><p>\u201cNaturally you\u2019ll be selling the house...\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was a fine woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to miss her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a happier place now...\u201d</p><p>\u201c...such a senseless tragedy.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had agreed with one and all.</p><p>By the time everyone had left, it was dark. Gary had helped her with the cleanup and urged her to return to her own apartment. Or to his. He didn\u2019t seem to understand her need to stay here, but how could he? He\u2019d never lost a parent.</p><p>\u201cYou should go on home,\u201d she\u2019d told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, you shouldn\u2019t be alone. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want,\u201d she\u2019d insisted, yearning for him to leave. It was an unfamiliar feeling, and one she didn\u2019t fully comprehend. She loved Gary, planned to spend the rest of her life with him, but at that moment she\u2019d wanted him out the door. She had to deal with her grief and pain in her own way.</p><p>\u201cYou need me,\u201d Gary told her with loving concern.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cJust not right now.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment registered in his deep brown eyes and he nodded with obvious reluctance. \u201cYou\u2019ll phone if you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had said she would.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her on the forehead in a sweet gesture of love and consolation. Shivering with the evening\u2019s cold, Lorraine had stood out on the porch and watched him drive off.</p><p>She\u2019d cleared away the dishes, then wandered aimlessly through the house, pausing in the entrance to each room. Tenderly she caressed the things that had once been her mother\u2019s most prized possessions. She closed her eyes and pictured her mother and father together at last and the wonderful reunion they must be enjoying.</p><p>Lorraine was comforted by the knowledge that Virginia had been happy during the last weeks of her life. She\u2019d been thrilled at the news of her daughter\u2019s engagement, thrilled at the prospect of planning a large formal wedding. No sooner had Lorraine said yes to Gary\u2019s proposal than Virginia had started making elaborate plans for the October wedding. She\u2019d valued tradition and frowned on Lorraine\u2019s having chosen a small emerald necklace in lieu of the usual engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cYou have your wish now, Mom,\u201d she said aloud. The wedding ring on her left hand had belonged to her mother. The inside of the band was engraved with the words \u201cI\u2019ll love you always. Thomas.\u201d The funeral director had given it to her that very day, just before he\u2019d closed the casket. Lorraine had slipped it on and wouldn\u2019t remove it until the time came for her own wedding. Her mother had worn this ring since the day Thomas Dancy placed it on her finger, and now Lorraine would wear it, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat am I going to do without you, Mom?\u201d Lorraine said into the stillness of the night, her eyes welling with tears. It surprised her that she had any left.</p><p>She mulled over everything she\u2019d done that had been a disappointment to her mother. She\u2019d dropped out of medical school after her second year and trained as a nurse-practitioner, instead. Virginia had said little, but Lorraine knew her mother regretted that decision. She liked to think she\u2019d made up for it when she met Gary, who sold medical supplies to Group Wellness, where Lorraine worked.</p><p>The fact that she\u2019d become a lapsed Catholic had distressed her mother, as well, but Lorraine had never identified with the church the way Virginia had. She attended a nondenominational Christian church, but her mother would have preferred she remain Catholic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mom,\u201d she whispered, knowing she\u2019d let her mother down in countless other ways.</p> <p>When she\u2019d finished her emotional journey through the house, Lorraine had taken a hot shower and changed into a nightgown, one she\u2019d bought Virginia the previous Christmas. After giving the matter some thought, she\u2019d chosen to sleep in her mother\u2019s room, rather than her own. When she was frightened as a child, she\u2019d always climbed into her mother\u2019s bed. Lorraine was frightened now, afraid of the future, afraid to be without Virginia, without family.</p><p>As she lay there sleepless, she gathered her memories around her, finding consolation in the happiness they\u2019d experienced. Day-to-day life had been full of shared pleasures, like cooking elaborate meals together, watching the classic movies they both loved, exchanging favorite books. Virginia also worked for several church-sponsored charities, and Lorraine sometimes spent an evening helping her pack up boxes of food for needy families, or stuffing envelopes. Her mother had been a wonderful woman, and Lorraine was proud of her. She\u2019d been devout in her faith, hardworking, kindhearted. Smart, but generous, too.</p><p>After an hour or so, Lorraine gave up even trying to sleep. She sat up and reached for the framed photograph of her parents, which rested on the nightstand. The picture showed Virginia as young and beautiful, wearing a full, ankle-length dress with a wreath of wildflowers on her head. Her long straight hair fell nearly to her waist. She held a small bouquet of wildflowers in one hand; with the other hand she clasped her husband\u2019s. Her eyes had been bright with happiness as she smiled directly into the camera.</p><p>The Thomas Dancy in the picture was tall and bearded, and wore his hair tied in a ponytail. He gazed at his bride with an identical look of love and promise. Anyone who saw the photograph could tell that the two of them had been deeply in love.</p><p>As recently as last weekend, when they\u2019d been discussing Lorraine\u2019s wedding plans, she\u2019d teased her mother about the photo, calling her parents \u201cflower children.\u201d Virginia had been good-natured about it and merely said, \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly this photograph was the only one Lorraine had of her parents together. Everything else had been destroyed in a fire when she was in grade school. Lorraine remembered the fire, not realizing until years later all that she\u2019d lost. Her parents\u2019 photographs and letters, her father\u2019s medals...</p><p>Lorraine knew that Virginia O\u2019Malley had met Thomas Dancy her freshman year in college and they\u2019d quickly fallen in love. The war in Vietnam had separated them when her father volunteered for the army in 1970. He\u2019d survived the war and come home a hero. It was a year later, during a routine physical, that something unusual had shown up in his blood work. That something had turned out to be leukemia. Within six months, Thomas was dead and Virginia was a young widow with a child.</p><p>Virginia\u2019s parents had helped financially for many years, but both of Lorraine\u2019s maternal grandparents had died in the early eighties. Her father\u2019s relatives were unknown to her. Her mother had one younger brother, but he\u2019d gotten involved with drugs and alcohol, and communication between them had been infrequent at best. The last time Virginia had heard from her brother was five years ago, when he\u2019d phoned her asking for money to make bail. Virginia had refused. Lorraine\u2019s only cousin lived someplace in California, and she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from her since the summer she was thirteen.</p><p>In other words, Lorraine was alone. Completely and utterly alone.</p><p>The phone startled her, and she whirled around to grab the receiver. \u201cHello,\u201d she said breathlessly, uncertain who to expect.</p><p>Gary. \u201cJust checking to make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Why can\u2019t you just accept that I need this time by myself? His attitude upset her. This wasn\u2019t like Gary.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to be alone,\u201d he said. He\u2019d told her this earlier, more than once. \u201cI know it\u2019s all a terrible shock, but the last thing you should do now is isolate yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGary, please. I buried my mother this afternoon. I...I don\u2019t have anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Her words were met with an awkward pause. \u201cYou have me,\u201d he said in a small hurt voice.</p><p>She regretted her thoughtlessness and at the same time resented his intrusion. \u201cI know how that must have seemed and I\u2019m sorry. But everything\u2019s still so painful. I need a chance to adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided to sell the house?\u201d Gary asked.</p> <p>Lorraine wondered why everyone was so concerned about what she did with the house. \u201cI...don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense to put it on the market, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and sought answers. \u201cI can\u2019t make that kind of decision right now. Give me time.\u201d</p><p>She must have sounded impatient because Gary was immediately contrite. \u201cYou\u2019re right, darling, it\u2019s too soon. We\u2019ll worry about it later. Promise you\u2019ll phone if you need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>After a few words of farewell, she ended the call. As she replaced the receiver, her gaze fell on the clock radio. She was shocked to discover it was only nine o\u2019clock. It felt more like midnight. She lay back down and stared up at the ceiling, letting her thoughts creep into the future. Her mother wouldn\u2019t be at her wedding, wouldn\u2019t be there for the births of her grandchildren. Virginia Dancy had looked forward to becoming a grandmother; now her grandchildren would never know her.</p><p>Rather than deal with yet another aspect of her loss, Lorraine turned her mind to Gary\u2019s unexpected call. He\u2019d brought up a number of questions she still had to face.</p><p>The house had to be dealt with soon. If it sat empty for long, it\u2019d start to deteriorate, not to mention attract vandals. Gary was right; she had to figure out what to do with it. Finances and legal issues posed another problem. She\u2019d never even seen her mother\u2019s will.</p><p>She\u2019d handle one thing at a time, she decided. That was advice Virginia had given her as a child and it had always stood her in good stead. One step and then the next...</p><p>The call from Dennis Goodwin, her mother\u2019s attorney, came a week after the funeral, when Lorraine had returned to work. She\u2019d been waiting to hear from him. Dennis had told her at the funeral that there were a few legal matters that needed to be resolved and then he\u2019d get in touch. He wouldn\u2019t need more than fifteen or twenty minutes. He\u2019d promised to phone the following week and set up an appointment.</p><p>True to his word, Dennis had called exactly a week after she\u2019d buried her mother.</p><p>Lorraine arrived at the appointed time, prepared to hear the details of her mother\u2019s will. The receptionist greeted her pleasantly, then reached for the intercom button. \u201cLorraine Dancy is here to see you,\u201d she announced.</p><p>A moment later Dennis Goodwin appeared in the reception area. \u201cLorraine,\u201d he said, his voice warm. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d He ushered her into his office.</p><p>Lorraine knew that Virginia had both liked and trusted Dennis. They\u2019d worked in the same Louisville office building, and during that time, he\u2019d acted as Virginia\u2019s attorney of record for her will and any other legal matters.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he invited. \u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as well as can be expected,\u201d Lorraine told him. She no longer felt the need to brush aside her own grief in an effort to comfort others. The week since the funeral had been difficult, and she couldn\u2019t have borne it without Gary\u2019s constant support.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019re already aware,\u201d the attorney said, leaning toward Lorraine, \u201cI knew your mother for a number of years. She was one of the most talented stockbrokers I ever met. Back in the eighties, she recommended I purchase shares in a little-known Seattle company called Microsoft. Because of her, I\u2019ll be able to retire in a couple of years. In fact, I could live off that investment alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom loved her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made several smart investments of her own,\u201d he added. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about finances for a long time to come.\u201d</p><p>The news should have cheered her, Lorraine supposed, but she\u2019d much prefer to have her mother back. No amount of financial security could replace what she\u2019d lost.</p><p>She folded her hands in her lap and waited for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cYour mother came to me four years ago and asked me to draw up her will,\u201d Dennis said. He rolled away from his desk and picked up a file. \u201cAccording to the terms, you\u2019re her sole beneficiary. Under normal circumstances, our meeting wouldn\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut in the event of an untimely death, Virginia asked me to speak to you personally.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine slid forward in her chair. \u201cMom wanted you to talk to me? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedical school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She gave a deep sigh. \u201cMom never understood about that.\u201d</p><p>The attorney raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a big disappointment to Mom when I decided to drop out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine looked out the window, although she scarcely noticed the view.</p><p>\u201cA number of reasons,\u201d she finally said, glancing down at her hands. \u201cI love medicine and Mom knew that, but while I have the heart of a physician, I don\u2019t have the competitive edge. I hated what medical school was like\u2014the survival of the fittest. I couldn\u2019t do it. Maybe I\u2019m lazy, I don\u2019t know, but I have everything I want now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was brief. \u201cI do almost as much as a doctor, but without the bucks or the glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe your mother did understand that,\u201d Dennis said, although Lorraine suspected it wasn\u2019t completely true. \u201cBut she wanted you to know that the funds are available if you should change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s eyes stung as she held back the tears. \u201cDid she tell you I\u2019m engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Gary and I only recently told...\u201d Lorraine let the rest fade. The attorney waited patiently, but she didn\u2019t trust her voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you reconsider and decide to try medical school again, I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help you.\u201d</p><p>His offer surprised her. \u201cThank you, but I\u2019m not going to. Not when Gary and I are about to start our lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I promised I\u2019d bring it up if the occasion arose. It saddens me that it has.\u201d</p><p>Within a few minutes, Dennis had finished explaining the terms of the will and handed her the necessary paperwork. When she\u2019d read everything, he passed her another sheet of paper.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAn inventory of the safe-deposit box. I went down to the bank yesterday afternoon and retrieved everything. I have it all for you here.\u201d He stood and picked up the manila envelope on his credenza. \u201cI need you to confirm that every document listed on the sheet is accounted for.\u201d</p><p>Because it was expected of her, Lorraine dumped the contents of the envelope onto the desk and checked off the items on the list. She\u2019d previously seen or known about everything here. Or so she assumed until she found the opened letter addressed to her mother. How odd, she mused, studying its colorful foreign stamps.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about this letter?\u201d she asked the attorney.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Actually, it seemed odd to me that Virginia would put something so obviously personal in with documents that were all business-related.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Mexico,\u201d Lorraine said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cYes, I noticed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPostmarked seven years ago.\u201d She withdrew the single page inside. After scanning it, she turned it over and read the signature. Gasping, she lifted her head to stare at Dennis Goodwin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t know about this?\u201d She was unable to conceal her shock.</p><p>\u201cLorraine, I don\u2019t know anything about that letter. I was your mother\u2019s lawyer, not her confidant. What she chose to place in the safe-deposit box had nothing to do with my role as her attorney.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine sagged against the back of the chair and raised her hand to her throat. \u201cCould...could I have a glass of water, please?\u201d Her mouth felt dry and her voice had gone hoarse. This couldn\u2019t be true. Couldn\u2019t be real. This was crazy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Dennis stepped out of his office and quickly returned with a large paper cup.</p><p>Lorraine drank the contents in several noisy gulps and briefly closed her eyes, trying to take in what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if something\u2019s upset you,\u201d Dennis said.</p><p>\u201cYou really haven\u2019t read the letter?\u201d she asked shakily.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. It would\u2019ve been highly unethical to do so.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine waited until she\u2019d regained her composure enough to sound unemotional. \u201cIt appears, Dennis,\u201d she said calmly, \u201cthat my father isn\u2019t dead, after all.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>The nightmare woke Thomas Dancy out of a deep sleep. He opened his eyes and filled his lungs with air. A breeze wafted in through the bedroom window and a full April moon cast fingers of cool light into the room. It\u2019s just a dream, he reminded himself. One that came to him periodically. It was always the same, and despite the passage of almost thirty years, it hadn\u2019t lessened in intensity. He relived every gut-wrenching detail\u2014and always woke up at the same point, trembling with fear and terror. Again, as he did every time, Thomas felt unabashed relief that it had only been a dream. Again, he reminded himself that the worst was over. He\u2019d walked through that hell once, and lived.</p> <p>Thomas threw back the sheet and sat on the edge of the thin mattress as the darkness and the effects of the nightmare closed in around him. Even now that he was wide-awake, the fear would not release him, had seeped into his very bones.</p><p>He\u2019d lost so much, back in the early seventies. By far his greatest and most profound loss had been his wife and daughter, but the dream had nothing to do with them.</p><p>In an effort to combat the lingering traces of depression\u2014the dream\u2019s legacy\u2014he formed a mental picture of Ginny and tiny Raine the day he\u2019d left for Vietnam. Ginny had been so young, so beautiful. Her face had been streaked with tears as she held their daughter in her arms. Despite everything that had gone wrong in the years since, that particular image never failed to lighten his heart.</p><p>She\u2019d come to the airport to see him off to war. A war he didn\u2019t understand and had no desire to fight. It had nearly killed him to leave his family that day. But in the end he\u2019d been the one to do the killing.</p><p>Guilt surged up in him and he shook his head, refusing to allow his thoughts to stumble down that path. He rubbed his face with both hands, as if he could erase the last residue of the dream and all the memories it brought back.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The trembling started again, and he stood and walked over to the window and stared into the night. He gazed at the reflection of the moon over the smooth water of the bay, off in the distance. He needed a reminder that the war and its aftermath were far behind him.</p><p>As memories of the war faded, they were replaced by thoughts of Ginny. Despite the years, despite her abandonment, he still loved her. He\u2019d made a new life for himself here in El Mirador, and he\u2019d come to think of Mexico as his home. He was a simple man, living a simple life. He\u2019d never be rich, but then, money wasn\u2019t important to him. Ginny had understood that.</p><p>Ginny...</p><p>Earlier that night, before his dreams had erupted into the sights and sounds of a brutal war, his wife had come to him in his sleep. He\u2019d seen her as she was at twenty, and their love had seemed as real as the windowsill beneath his fingers.</p><p>His heart sang at the sound of her name in his mind. He remembered the first time he saw her on the university campus and how he\u2019d dismissed her as virginal and uptight. But the clich\u00e9 about opposites attracting was certainly true in their case. He\u2019d embraced the beliefs of the late sixties\u2014like student power and \u201cdoing your own thing\u201d\u2014ideologies she\u2019d regarded with contempt.</p><p>As it happened, they\u2019d attended the same English class and sat across from each other. Thomas took it upon himself to break through that barrier of reserve she held between herself and the world. Ginny was the challenge he couldn\u2019t resist. He didn\u2019t mean it to happen, but before he knew it, he\u2019d fallen in love.</p><p>So had she.</p><p>A slow smile relaxed the taut muscles of his face as he recalled the night they\u2019d first slept together. She\u2019d been innocent, and while he was far from a virgin, that afternoon with Ginny was the first time he\u2019d truly made love. The honesty of their lovemaking had forever changed him. Instinctively he\u2019d known that, despite his other lovers, she was the only woman he\u2019d really loved.</p><p>He wanted to marry her. His feelings had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with his heart. They met every day after class and took crazy chances to be together in either his dorm or hers. Once they\u2019d made love, it was impossible to stop, and their physical need for each other grew until it dominated all common sense.</p><p>He\u2019d suspected Ginny was pregnant long before she did....</p><p>By that time he was renting a two-room apartment off campus. His sole piece of furniture had been a worn-out mattress tucked in a corner. What cooking he did was on a hot plate. The lack of material wealth was of little concern to either of them. They were too much in love to care.</p><p>Ginny\u2019s conservative family was shocked by the changes in her when she arrived home for the holidays with him in tow. Her hair was waist-length and her attire consisted of long cotton dresses and sandals. Her parents hadn\u2019t liked him then and liked him even less when they discovered he\u2019d gotten their honor-student daughter pregnant. It didn\u2019t surprise him that her family strongly disapproved of their marrying. One of the things that distressed Thomas most in the years that followed was the rift he\u2019d caused between Ginny and her family.</p><p>They wrote their vows themselves and at Ginny\u2019s insistence found a sympathetic priest who agreed to perform the ceremony. Their lovemaking had been good before they were married, but afterward it was incredible.</p><p>With a wife to support and a baby on the way, Thomas had been forced to drop out of college and find employment. At one time he\u2019d seriously considered medicine as a career, but that had been an unlikely dream from the beginning. He and Ginny both knew that. Besides, the only way he could\u2019ve attended medical school would have been on a scholarship, and his marks had fallen since his involvement with Ginny. Still, he wouldn\u2019t have traded his marriage for even a full-ride scholarship to the best medical school in the country.</p><p>Although they lived in poverty, Thomas and Ginny were blissfully happy. At Lorraine\u2019s birth, he was with Ginny as much as the doctors would allow. It\u2019d been hell not to go into the delivery room with her. When the nurse came out and told him he had a daughter, Thomas broke into tears of joy. His heart had never known that kind of happiness.</p><p>Two days after they brought Lorraine home from the hospital, Thomas walked into a U.S. Army recruiting office and handed over his life to Uncle Sam. It wasn\u2019t what he wanted, but he had no real choice. Little did he realize when he put on that uniform how much he was about to lose.</p><p>The nightmare was about Vietnam. Again and again he relived the day he\u2019d held David Williams in a blood-filled rice paddy and watched him die. He\u2019d been helpless to do anything but scream in anguish.</p><p>He wrote Ginny about David, but words were inadequate to describe his loss. More than a friend had died that day. Part of Thomas Dancy had died, too. The young man he was, the innocent twenty-one-year-old who believed in the power of love and goodness, also bled to death in that rice field. From then on, he was able to kill without conscience.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to war a kid, trying to provide for his family, and returned a killer. It\u2019d taken Ginny\u2019s love to wipe away the ugliness of those long months in Vietnam. Halfway through his tour he\u2019d flown to Hawaii on leave and never returned to the war. He despised what he\u2019d become.</p><p>The army referred to him as a deserter, but Thomas knew that walking away had saved his life. He would have lost his mind if he\u2019d gone back. He\u2019d hidden in San Francisco for a while and Ginny had come to him there, loved him, given him back his sanity. The bitterness and hatred inside him had slowly melted away until he was almost whole again, almost able to put all the horrors he\u2019d seen out of his mind. But he felt a moral obligation to save others from what he\u2019d experienced. Instead of fleeing to Canada as so many before and after him did, he made it his mission to work toward ending the war. He joined an extremist group and made friends with its leader, Jos\u00e9 Delgado, who had family in Mexico. Because Thomas had some fluency in Spanish after four years of study, Jos\u00e9 insisted they speak the language when talking about their plans. It had started out as a safety measure and then later become a necessity.</p><p>\u201cThomas?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he turned at the sound of his name.</p><p>\u201cThe dream again?\u201d Azucena asked in a low whisper.</p><p>He nodded, not wanting to explain that his thoughts had been of Ginny and the daughter he no longer knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slipped out of bed and walked to his side, her bare feet silent on the stone floor. \u201cCome back to bed,\u201d she urged in Spanish as she wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he promised, unwilling just yet to let go of the memories.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she enticed once more, splaying her fingers across his chest. \u201cI will help you forget the bad dreams you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzucena...\u201d</p> <p>Her response was wordless. She kissed his neck and pressed her heavy breasts against him.</p><p>He needed her then as he\u2019d needed her so many times before. Despite the advanced state of her pregnancy, he kissed her with little gentleness and she responded with a hunger that ignited his own. When he would have stopped, she pulled him to the bed and drew him close.</p><p>Azucena deserved a much better man than he would ever be. She deserved someone who would love her completely for herself. A man who could give his name to the child who grew inside her. It shamed him that she was only two years older than his daughter, but that didn\u2019t stop him from taking everything she offered. In the moment of his release he cried out Ginny\u2019s name. It wasn\u2019t the first time, and he suspected it wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>Lorraine had read the letter so many times she\u2019d memorized it. She\u2019d given up sleeping at her own place and spent the nights at her mother\u2019s house instead. While she stayed there, she slept very little. Exhausted and angry, she sat in the dark living room night after night and tried to make sense of what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>She was vaguely aware that two weeks or so had passed since that afternoon in Dennis Goodwin\u2019s office. Morning dawned and bright light spilled into the room and still Lorraine hadn\u2019t slept. She wasn\u2019t capable of dozing for more than an hour or two. The deep satisfying sleep of those at peace with life seemed forever lost to her.</p> <p>The mother she\u2019d known and loved was someone whose existence had virtually disappeared. Virginia\u2014or the person she\u2019d pretended to be\u2014was completely out of reach now. Her actions were beyond Lorraine\u2019s understanding\u2014or forgiveness. Lorraine felt as if the foundation of her entire world had crumbled beneath her.</p><p>Although she knew each word of the letter by heart, she removed it from the envelope and read it once again.</p><p>Dearest Ginny,</p><p>Today is our daughter\u2019s twenty-first birthday. Where did all those years go? It seems only yesterday that I bounced Raine on my knee and sang her to sleep. It hurts to realize how much of her life I\u2019ve missed.</p><p>I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I never stopped loving you or needing you. I wish things could have been different for us. All I ask of you now is that you tell Raine the truth about me.</p><p>The decision to tell her I was dead is one we made together. At the time it seemed the right thing to do, but I\u2019ve regretted it every day since. You know that. You also know I\u2019m a man of my word. I\u2019ve done as you wanted and stayed out of your lives, but I\u2019m pleading with you now to tell Raine the truth. All of it. She\u2019s legally an adult and old enough to make her own judgments.</p> <p>I\u2019m teaching at a small school in a coastal town called El Mirador on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. You can reach me by phone at the number on the bottom of the page. The school will make sure I get the message.</p><p>Are you well, Ginny? Do you lie awake at nights and think of me the way I do of you? Are you happy? This is my prayer for you, that you\u2019ve found peace within yourself.</p><p>I\u2019ll always love you.</p><p>Thomas</p><p>Three truths hit Lorraine full force each and every time she read the letter. First and foremost, despite what she\u2019d been told, her father was alive and well. Second, he loved her. Last\u2014and what had the most profound impact on her\u2014her mother had lied to her all these years.</p><p>There was a loud knock at the front door, yanking Lorraine away from her thoughts.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised to find Gary standing on the other side of the screen door. \u201cI figured you\u2019d be here.\u201d He glanced into the living room and eyed the disarray.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked, although it was obviously morning.</p> <p>\u201cYou were due at work an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that late already?\u201d she asked. She drifted around the room, picking up books and papers and piling them neatly on a shelf. Anything to avoid looking at him. Anything to delay telling him what she\u2019d decided.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do for you anymore,\u201d he said, raising his palms in a gesture of helplessness. When she didn\u2019t answer, he walked into the kitchen and opened the cupboard, then pulled out a tin of coffee.</p><p>Lorraine followed him.</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good idea if you got dressed for work,\u201d he suggested pointedly.</p><p>Rather than argue with him, she did as he asked, taking a quick shower and putting on her uniform, although she had no intention of showing up at the clinic. The scent of freshly brewed coffee greeted her when she returned. Gary handed her a mug and poured himself one.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d he said, motioning for her to sit at the table.</p><p>Once more she complied, because fighting him demanded too much energy.</p><p>He took the chair across from her. \u201cSweetheart, hard as this is, you\u2019ve got to get on with your life.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pretend not to know what he was talking about. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good start.\u201d He sipped his coffee, then sighed heavily, as if he\u2019d dreaded this confrontation. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been yourself ever since that meeting with your mother\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He seemed unsure how far to press her. \u201cI realize the letter upset you. It would\u2019ve upset anyone, but you\u2019ve got to come to grips with reality. Sleeping here every night, watching the same movies over and over, isn\u2019t going to help.\u201d He paused and changed tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s been a month now, and you haven\u2019t dealt with your mother\u2019s death any better than when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I haven\u2019t,\u201d she agreed, cradling the mug with both hands, letting its warmth seep into her palms. Somehow she managed to go in to work most days, but she\u2019d been late a number of times. Again and again she sat in front of the television and escaped into her favorite movies. Movies her mother had loved, too\u2014romance, adventure, suspense, anything that would take her mind off the lies Virginia had told her. Lies both her parents had conspired in.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do here every night?\u201d he asked. \u201cBesides watch Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d It seemed he had only to look around for an answer to that.</p><p>He glanced back into the living room and frowned.</p><p>Lorraine tried to look at the house through his eyes and had to admit its appearance must come as something of a shock. She was as neat and orderly as her mother had been. Both were meticulous housekeepers, yet Lorraine had gone about systematically tearing every room apart. The place was a shambles.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you hope to prove?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lorraine was stunned by his lack of comprehension. \u201cI\u2019m not hoping to prove anything. I\u2019m hoping to find what else my mother saw fit to hide from me.\u201d</p><p>He gazed into the distance as if it took some effort to assimilate her words. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but have you thought about talking to a counselor?\u201d he asked gently. He risked glancing in her direction.</p><p>\u201cYou mean a mental-health professional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...yes.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine burst out laughing. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve gone off the deep end? That I\u2019m losing it?\u201d As her laugh turned to a giggle, she wondered if he was right. At times the feeling of betrayal and pain threatened to strangle her. That her parents, particularly her mother, had chosen to lie to her was incomprehensible.</p><p>\u201cI know how difficult this is for you,\u201d Gary added, rushing his words. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand, and I know the people at Group Wellness are, too, but there\u2019s a limit to just how accommodating everyone can be while you deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you.\u201d</p><p>Gary\u2019s eyes revealed his suspicion. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m booking the next month off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month?\u201d She could tell he was taken aback by the news. \u201cThat long? I think a week or two should be sufficient, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to save most of our vacation time for our honeymoon and\u2014\u201d He stopped midsentence and his eyes narrowed. \u201cHave in mind? You have something in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see my father.\u201d</p><p>It was a moment before he spoke. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy flight\u2019s scheduled to leave at seven o\u2019clock Tuesday morning.\u201d</p><p>Gary stared at her. \u201cWhen did you decide this?\u201d His voice was calm, which Lorraine recognized as a sign of anger.</p><p>\u201cLast week.\u201d She\u2019d known when she bought the ticket that Gary would disapprove. It was one of the reasons she hadn\u2019t discussed her plans with him beforehand.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said in a hurt-little-boy voice. He picked up his mug and took a long swallow.</p><p>\u201cI phoned the school where he teaches and talked to the secretary.\u201d Communication had been difficult, but the woman\u2019s English was far superior to Lorraine\u2019s high-school Spanish.</p><p>Gary\u2019s silence was comment enough, but Lorraine hurried on with the details, hoping to settle this before she left for Mexico. She didn\u2019t want to slight Gary or offend him, but she had to see her father, talk to him face-to-face. She had to find out what had driven him and her mother apart. Why her parents had allowed her to believe he was dead. There had to be a logical explanation for the lie; she prayed there was. Of all the emotions he\u2019d revealed in his letter, the strongest was love, for her and for Virginia. And all these years they\u2019d deprived her of that love. Why?</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to your father?\u201d Gary asked, his voice now devoid of emotion.</p><p>She hesitated before answering, knowing Gary would find fault with this aspect of her plan. \u201cNot directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone number is for the school where he teaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was in class when I called,\u201d she continued. Surely that made perfect sense. \u201cI left a message giving my flight information and asking him to meet my plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he returned your phone call?\u201d</p><p>Again she hesitated. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Gary snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question, Lorraine. Either he returned your call or he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>This conversation had been unsatisfactory almost from the first. \u201cI resent your tone, Gary. I was hoping you\u2019d support me.\u201d</p><p>He released his breath in a long-suffering sigh. \u201cI just wish you\u2019d talked to me about it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told him, and she was. \u201cI realize this is unfair to you, but I have to find out what happened between my parents. My father\u2019s alive, and I want a chance to know him\u2014to talk to him, to learn why they felt they had to lie. You can understand that, can\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took his time answering. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted with obvious reluctance. \u201cBut like I said, I wish you\u2019d included me in this decision.

I have to do this before I can get on with my life\u2014with our life.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he nodded, as if his agreeing to her trip was a gift. \u201cI still wish you\u2019d told me so I could\u2019ve changed my schedule and joined you.\u201d</p><p>Joined her? Not once had Lorraine considered asking Gary to accompany her. He couldn\u2019t come anyway, she thought with a surge of relief. Not when he was so recently promoted and training his replacement.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the real reason, and she knew it. She loved Gary, but she didn\u2019t want him with her. This journey into her family\u2019s past was her adventure, and hers alone.</p><p>Letting Lorraine travel to Mexico by herself had never sat easy with Gary Franklin. He loved his fianc\u00e9e and realized this was a difficult, unsettling time for her. A measure of his love was his willingness to stand by and watch her fly off on her own. Not only that, he\u2019d offered to drive her to the airport\u2014which meant getting up at 4:00 a.m. He glanced at his watch in the dashboard light. Quarter to five now. They\u2019d discussed this trip countless times since the morning she\u2019d sprung it on him, and he was convinced she was making a mistake. But Lorraine didn\u2019t want to hear that and had stopped listening to him.</p><p>Although his only intent was to protect her, shield her from further hurt, she refused to imagine any outcome other than a joyful reunion with the father she\u2019d never known. He\u2019d long admired Lorraine for her common sense, but she exhibited little of it in this unpleasant matter.</p> <p>Gary had liked Virginia, and her death had shaken him, too. He\u2019d respected Lorraine\u2019s mother for her business savvy and the way she worked in what was still largely a man\u2019s world. Furthermore he trusted her judgment. Since she\u2019d chosen to tell Lorraine a lie regarding her father, he figured there had to be a good reason. Gary feared that whatever it was would mean bad news for Lorraine, maybe even heartbreak.</p><p>Besides her unwillingness to listen to his advice, he couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact that she didn\u2019t want him with her. She hadn\u2019t tried to hide it, either, and that hurt.</p><p>He parked the car and collected his thoughts as he approached the house.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked Lorraine when she answered the door.</p><p>She nodded. At least she\u2019d packed sensibly, he noted\u2014just one medium-size wheeled suitcase. She wasn\u2019t like some women, who found it necessary to bring every outfit they owned. She looked smart, too, in an off-white linen pantsuit, her blond hair neatly pulled back. She seemed a little uncertain, but obviously determined to follow through.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your passport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraveler\u2019s checks and cash?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cInsect repellant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGary! Honestly, you make me sound like a child heading off to camp.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen it like that, but she was probably right. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>Because there was hardly any traffic this early, the drive to the airport didn\u2019t take long. He insisted on having a coffee with her after she\u2019d checked in. They sat there, not knowing what to say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d she murmured at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to. Will you phone?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged lightly. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the phone situation in El Mirador. My guess is the schoolhouse is the only place in town with a working phone.\u201d</p><p>He wished she hadn\u2019t reminded him how primitive this village was likely to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write,\u201d she promised, \u201cand phone if I can. Plus I\u2019ll email if I have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He had to be happy with that.</p><p>They hugged and kissed and he clung to her for a moment, then stepped back as she left for the departure lounge. She\u2019d vanished from view, and still Gary stood there.</p><p>Despite Lorraine\u2019s optimism, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that everything\u2014in his life and in hers\u2014was about to change.</p><p>Three</p><p>Jack Keller had never thought of himself as a big-game fisherman. But owning a thirty-two-foot twin-diesel cabin cruiser made about as much sense as anything else in his life, which was damn little.</p><p>He\u2019d \u201cretired\u201d as a mercenary, gotten out of the death-defying game while the getting was good. At the end of his five-year stint he was sick of it all. Sick of the low-profile corporate rescues Deliverance Company had specialized in. Jack was tired of fighting hotheaded terrorist groups and corrupt governments that used innocents in a cruel game of greed and revenge.</p><p>He had, however, been paid well for his skills, and he\u2019d managed to save most of it. The major part had been wisely invested, and with the proceeds of the sale of his condominium in Kansas City, he could live comfortably in Mexico until he was a very old man. Growing old in the tropics appealed to Jack. Footloose and fancy-free, that was him. The boat was a bonus he hadn\u2019t expected. An inheritance of sorts from Quinn McBride, a friend whose life he\u2019d saved a decade earlier. Jack had lived aboard Scotch on Water for the past three years. He\u2019d stayed in the Gulf of Mexico for most of that time, dropped anchor here and there, made a few friends. The strongest of these friendships was with Thomas Dancy, another American expatriate who lived in the tiny coastal town of El Mirador.</p><p>Although Thomas was about fifteen years his senior, the two shared a camaraderie and a deep love of their adopted country. Thomas was a man of secrets, but Jack had a few of his own. It was because of Thomas and Azucena that Jack had hung around the Yucat\u00e1n; in the past few weeks, though, he\u2019d decided to expand his horizons. Lately he\u2019d been thinking about heading to the Florida Keys, stopping off at some of those small Caribbean paradises along the way. He\u2019d heard the people were friendly, and it didn\u2019t hurt any that the women were gorgeous.</p><p>Then again, he might return to Belize. He\u2019d pulled into port at Belize City any number of times and he was impressed with the beauty of the country. His American dollars were always welcome; Jack had no problem with that. The women were warm and friendly\u2014and there was a pretty se\u00f1orita he was sure would be glad to see him. Jack couldn\u2019t quite remember her name, but no doubt it\u2019d come to him in time.</p><p>Either Florida or Belize\u2014he had yet to decide. Before he set his course for either destination, he needed supplies and figured he might as well check his mail, too. Not that he was expecting anything. He hadn\u2019t heard from Cain, Murphy or Mallory in several weeks, but he wasn\u2019t much for keeping in touch with old friends himself. His life as a mercenary was far behind him. These days he had little in common with the men of what used to be Deliverance Company. His friends were married now, and the last Jack had heard they\u2019d settled into domesticity. Not Jack, though.</p><p>Standing on the flybridge, the sun in his face and a breeze slapping his unbuttoned shirt against his tanned chest, Jack set Scotch on Water in a westerly direction. He checked the chart and saw he wasn\u2019t far from El Mirador. It\u2019d been a couple of months since he\u2019d had a beer with Thomas. Azucena must be ready to pop that kid of hers any day now, if memory served him right. Perhaps he\u2019d arrive in time for the blessed event, and he and the new father could celebrate.</p><p>This was their third kid in six years. Good grief, Thomas was as bad as Cain and Murphy, but at least Thomas had an excuse. Azucena was a traditional Catholic and didn\u2019t believe in birth control. Sex without marriage, sure; birth control, no. Interesting logic, Jack thought with a grin. During one visit, Thomas had confessed how upset he\u2019d been when Azucena got pregnant the first time around. In the years since, he\u2019d apparently grown accustomed to fatherhood. Then again, Jack might, too, if he had a hot-blooded woman like Azucena warming his bed. There was some reason Thomas couldn\u2019t marry her, some reason in his past; he\u2019d alluded to it but never explained.</p><p>A few years back, fool that he was, Jack had given marriage serious consideration. He found it hard to believe now, but he\u2019d actually been ready to buy into the whole scene\u2014wife, family, house in the suburbs. Luckily he\u2019d escaped that trap...but at the time he hadn\u2019t felt especially lucky. In fact, it\u2019d hurt pretty badly when Marcie turned down his proposal. What really got him was that she\u2019d married a plumber named Clifford instead. It still boggled his mind that a woman as smart and sexy as Marcie would find happiness with a slow-witted moose of a man named Clifford.</p><p>But they did seem happy. He found it remarkable, but had to admit he felt relieved; he wouldn\u2019t want her to be anything else. He\u2019d received picture Christmas cards from her and Clifford for the past two years. The first one showed her standing proudly beside her big oafish husband with her stomach halfway across the room. She looked ten months\u2019 pregnant. Next year\u2019s Christmas card explained why. Twins. He\u2019d forgotten their names now, but they were rather unimaginative, as he recalled. Billy and Bobby or something like that. What he remembered most was how happy Marcie had seemed. Her face had glowed with joy as she held one squirming toddler and Clifford hoisted the other. Jack had kept the photograph tucked away on the boat as a reminder that she\u2019d made the right choice in not marrying him. Other than that one all-too-brief episode, Jack had realized a long time ago that he wasn\u2019t the marrying kind. Nope, not even close. He wasn\u2019t interested in settling down with a woman, putting up with all that domestic stuff. He enjoyed his carefree life and didn\u2019t need anyone messing with his mind. Or his heart...such as it was.</p><p>No question, things had worked out for the best when Marcie married Clifford. Jack would have made a rotten husband, but there were times, albeit few and far between, when he wondered what would\u2019ve happened if Marcie had married him.</p><p>He\u2019d drink a beer in her honor, Jack decided, frowning into the wind. To Marcie and their lucky escape.</p><p>The Boeing 767 landed in M\u00e9rida on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula early that afternoon. As Lorraine exited the aircraft, she peered over the customs counter, hoping her father had received her message and follow-up letter and been able to meet her plane. The only photograph she had of him was the wedding picture, which showed him with long hair and a beard. He\u2019d be fifty now, and Lorraine had no idea whether or not she\u2019d even recognize him.</p><p>The map securely tucked in her purse showed that El Mirador was about seventy-five miles north of M\u00e9rida. She glanced around anxiously. It took an unusually long time to clear customs, with lots of people complaining about the unnecessary hold-up. From what Lorraine could make out, the small customs office was short-staffed because of some museum theft. Apparently every available officer was checking the luggage of passengers leaving the country. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After what seemed like an eternity, she was waved through. She collected her suitcase and carefully searched the waiting area, but saw no one remotely resembling the man in the photograph.</p><p>\u201cTime for Plan B,\u201d she muttered to herself, grateful that she\u2019d thought this out beforehand. She made her way across the airport to the car-rental booth.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the clerk asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she said, digging through her purse for her driver\u2019s license. \u201cYou speak English.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d The young woman flashed her a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cI need to rent a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019m going to be needing it, possibly an entire month, unless there\u2019s a rental agency I can return it to near El Mirador.\u201d</p><p>The friendly smile faded when Lorraine mentioned the name of the town. The clerk looked over her shoulder and said something in Spanish that Lorraine didn\u2019t understand. Right away the first woman was joined by a second, who appeared to be the manager. They spoke in rapid Spanish, and while Lorraine recognized a few words, she couldn\u2019t catch the gist of the conversation.</p> <p>When they finished, the girl with the toothpaste-ad smile turned serenely to face Lorraine once again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my supervisor says we have no cars available at this time.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cBut you were perfectly willing to rent me one a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She didn\u2019t deny that.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl Mirador has no roads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo roads?\u201d</p> <p>The clerk pulled out a rental agreement, silently read it over and underlined the appropriate section before handing it to Lorraine. People in the line behind her were becoming impatient, so Lorraine moved away and sat down to read the section the other woman had highlighted. With the aid of her dictionary, she discovered that rental cars were not allowed on anything but paved roads. In other words, El Mirador was well off the beaten path, and the roads leading in and out of it were either dirt or gravel. Getting there, it seemed, would be no easy task.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Plan C.\u201d Except she hadn\u2019t yet figured out what that would be. There had to be another way to reach El Mirador. A bus. If she couldn\u2019t get a rental car, she\u2019d take a bus. Which meant she had to find the bus station first.</p><p>That decided, she wheeled her suitcase out of the air-conditioned airport. The blast of heat made her stagger. She felt as if someone had thrown a hot towel over her head. Almost immediately her linen pantsuit became damp and clung to her like a second skin. Summers in Louisville could be stifling, but she\u2019d never experienced anything like this\u2014and it was only May. She looked down at her limp wrinkled trousers and sweat-stained jacket; this was what she got for wanting to make a good impression on her father. If she\u2019d been meeting anyone else, she would\u2019ve dressed less formally.</p><p>Joining the long line for a colectivo\u2014cab\u2014she patiently waited her turn. Unfortunately the taxi driver spoke little English, but with her pocket dictionary and traveler\u2019s phrase book, she was able to get her message across. The driver nodded repeatedly at every question, then loaded her suitcase into his trunk, which he tied shut with a frayed rope.</p><p>Lorraine climbed into the backseat and searched for a seat belt. There wasn\u2019t one. The instant he got behind the wheel, her meek and mild-mannered driver turned into a road warrior. Lorraine was tossed about the backseat like a sack of oranges, flung from one side of the vehicle to the other as he wove in and out of traffic. He switched from lane to lane, sometimes racing toward oncoming traffic at a death-defying rate. It would have helped had she found something to hang on to, but all she had were her wits, and those had scattered long ago. The one compensation was that she was too terrified to notice how miserably hot it was.</p><p>By the time she arrived at the bus station, she was grateful to have survived the trip. Her shoulder ached from being slammed against the side of the car and her jaws hurt from being clenched. She paid the fare with no argument but without any tip, either, and lugged her suitcase into the depot.</p><p>One thing was for sure: her presence certainly attracted a lot of attention. Every eye in the dilapidated place was focused on her. With what she hoped was grace and style, she squared her shoulders and made her way up to the window as if she\u2019d done this every day of her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a ticket to El Mirador,\u201d she said in English, forgetting to use Spanish.</p> <p>The man stared at her blankly.</p><p>Lorraine reached for her phrase book and flipped pages. Mentioning the name of the town apparently wasn\u2019t enough to achieve the result she wanted, so she attempted more than once to ask for a ticket. Each time, the agent merely shrugged and looked blank.</p><p>Then he tried speaking to her. First he spoke slowly, then louder as if that would make her understand. After five minutes of this, she was ready to scream with frustration.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I can help.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine turned to find a smiling clean-cut man standing next to her.</p><p>\u201cJason Applebee,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLorraine Dancy.\u201d She held out her hand, noting that his was bandaged. \u201cYou\u2019re American?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure am.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI guess that\u2019s fairly obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you speak Spanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFluently.\u201d Then, as if to prove it, he spoke to the man behind the counter. The clerk grinned, nodded and said something in return. His eyes moved to Lorraine; she couldn\u2019t miss the relief in his expression.</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t understand what either of them had said. By this point she was beyond translating even the simplest verbs. Jason turned to her. \u201cNow, what were you trying to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a ticket to El Mirador.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Jason said, his face lighting up. \u201cI\u2019m heading that way myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought it was just a small town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m going to a place not far from there. I was planning to spend the night in El Mirador.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s a hotel?\u201d If things didn\u2019t work out with her father, it was reassuring to know she\u2019d have someplace to sleep that night.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could call it that,\u201d Jason said, and they both laughed.</p><p>Lorraine paid for her ticket, and Jason bought his, as well. When they\u2019d finished, they sat in the shade outside and waited for the bus, which was due to arrive, Jason said, in thirty minutes.</p><p>\u201cWill you be staying at the hotel, too?\u201d her newfound friend asked as he arranged his backpack at his feet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Lorraine said. It had been a long day already, with a plane change in Atlanta and a two-hour delay. \u201cHow long will it take to reach El Mirador?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours, possibly more\u2014if the bus doesn\u2019t break down, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great.\u201d She sighed loudly, wondering if anything else could possibly go wrong.</p><p>\u201cHey, it isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Jason said. \u201cAt least there aren\u2019t any bandidos. Not like the dig I was on last week.\u201d He explained that he was a part-time archaeology lecturer at a small college in Missouri; she didn\u2019t recognize the name. He was here doing research for his doctoral thesis. He\u2019d been in Mexico a month now, he told her, although this wasn\u2019t his first trip. Lorraine guessed him to be in his mid-thirties. He had short dark hair and the ubiquitous sunglasses, and wore a short-sleeved cotton shirt tucked neatly into khaki pants. The freshness of his clothes made Lorraine feel even more despairing about the condition of her own.</p><p>\u201cSo you were working on this dig? And...and there were bandits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, lifting his bandaged hand. Jason entertained her for the next hour\u2014the bus was late, of course\u2014with tales of his adventures, including a harrowing description of the incident during which he\u2019d injured his hand. He\u2019d rescued one of the Mexican assistants on the dig from a knife-wielding pair of thieves. She shuddered at his dramatic telling.</p><p>Lorraine liked Jason. It was impossible not to. He was witty and cheerful, not to mention generous with his help. He bought some melon slices from a street vendor and shared them with her. Lorraine hadn\u2019t really been hungry, but the fruit quenched her growing thirst.</p><p>She\u2019d never made friends with anyone so quickly. She suspected that everyone responded to Jason this way; his open exuberant personality encouraged confidences and camaraderie.</p><p>With billowing exhaust and much grinding of gears, the bus finally pulled into the station. Jason had been right to warn her about its likely condition. The rattletrap of a vehicle looked as if it\u2019d been on the road since the Second World War. Its color was no longer distinguishable and half the windows were missing. In this heat, though, that was probably a blessing.</p><p>The bus was one thing, her fellow travelers another. The minute the bus rolled into the yard, people appeared from every direction. Adults and children and caged chickens. One man was hefting a pig under his arm.</p><p>\u201cGo and get us the best seat you can,\u201d Jason advised, urging her toward the bus. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure our luggage gets on board.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine watched, astonished, as two men clambered on top of the bus and waited for Jason and another man to throw suitcases up to them. She didn\u2019t envy anyone the task of lifting her suitcase, let alone hurling it eight feet off the ground.</p><p>After about ten minutes a breathless Jason climbed on board and collapsed onto the seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned you\u2019d be traveling to someplace near El Mirador,\u201d Lorraine said once he\u2019d caught his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to another dig,\u201d he said, shifting a bit to give her more room on the cramped seat. The narrow cushion was barely wide enough for one adult, let alone two.</p><p>He\u2019d told Lorraine a little about Mayan ruins earlier, and she\u2019d found it fascinating.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dig near El Mirador?\u201d She\u2019d researched the tiny coastal town at the library and on the internet, but hadn\u2019t learned much. El Mirador had a population of less than a thousand. The economy of many of these towns along the coast depended, not surprisingly, on the fishing industry, but there was little else. She couldn\u2019t remember reading about Mayan ruins in the area around El Mirador, but that didn\u2019t mean much.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jason said, \u201cour El Mirador was named after another El Mirador, in Guatemala. It was an important Mayan site\u2014one of the earliest. But there\u2019s a Mayan temple a few miles from this El Mirador, too. It was discovered a few years ago, and they\u2019ve only begun excavating, so I want to spend a few weeks there before I go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome is Missouri, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJefferson City,\u201d he said. \u201cNow what about you? Why are you traveling to El Mirador? It\u2019s not like the town\u2019s exactly a tourist destination.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine took her time answering, wondering how much to tell Jason. She\u2019d known him slightly more than an hour. Granted, they\u2019d become virtually instant friends, but still... This wasn\u2019t the kind of personal information one generally shared on such recent acquaintance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father lives there,\u201d she said without elaborating.</p><p>\u201cIn El Mirador?\u201d Jason\u2019s eyes widened briefly. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Peace Corps?\u201d</p> <p>Lorraine looked out the window. Considering how nervous she was about meeting her father, she should be grateful for someone to talk to. She\u2019d tell Jason the whole story, she decided impulsively. He\u2019d certainly told her a lot about his own background, and she sensed she could trust him. She took a deep breath. \u201cTo be honest, Jason, I don\u2019t really know. I haven\u2019t seen him since I was three\u2014I was told he\u2019d died of leukemia. I only found out a month ago that he\u2019s actually alive, and once I did, I couldn\u2019t stay away. My fianc\u00e9 thinks I\u2019ve gone off the deep end and maybe I have.\u201d She ended up telling Jason about her mother\u2019s death, the letter she\u2019d discovered with the items from the safe-deposit box and about Gary.</p><p>Jason took a moment to absorb everything. \u201cDoes your father know you\u2019re coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said, struggling not to sound defensive. Then she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Since he hadn\u2019t been in M\u00e9rida to meet her, she no longer knew what to expect.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been in touch with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Lorraine had grown resentful when Gary asked her these same questions. But Jason seemed genuinely interested and concerned about her, while Gary had been so insistent. So overprotective. \u201cI phoned and left a message at the school, but he didn\u2019t return my call. When I didn\u2019t hear back from him, I sent a letter. I was hoping he\u2019d be waiting for me at the airport...but he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you mail the letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeginning of last week.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cI hate to tell you this, but I\u2019ll bet he hasn\u2019t gotten it yet. The mail\u2014\u201d They hit a rut in the road just then. The bus jolted badly and sent both Jason and Lorraine flying upward. Her teeth felt as if they\u2019d been shaken loose, and she heard Jason\u2019s cry of pain as his head slammed into the roof. The pig escaped, squealing as it raced toward the back of the bus. Undisturbed by the commotion, the driver didn\u2019t even slow down.</p><p>After a few minutes, everything was quiet again, and Jason finished his sentence. \u201cThe mail in this part of the world is notoriously slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should probably assume that your father has no idea you\u2019re coming,\u201d he warned her. \u201cWho knows if he got your phone message\u2014and he definitely won\u2019t have the letter.\u201d</p> <p>His words sobered Lorraine. She\u2019d traveled thirteen hundred miles, the last part under deplorable conditions. Now there was reason to believe that her arrival would take her father completely by surprise.</p><p>Ever since that night the dream had awakened him, Thomas Dancy hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about Ginny. He realized this had more to do with Azucena than Ginny, since his common-law wife was due to deliver their third child any day.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to love Azucena, hadn\u2019t meant to start this second family. But along with his other faults, he was weak. Too weak to resist a second chance at love\u2014and life. He usually didn\u2019t give in to these occasional bouts of remorse and self-loathing; he was too realistic for that. But occasionally, like now, thoughts of his former life wouldn\u2019t leave him alone.</p><p>He sat at his desk, his classroom empty, and stared at the test papers he should be grading. Instead, his mind was on Ginny and the daughter he didn\u2019t know. Guilt weighed heavily on him for breaking the vows he\u2019d spoken in love. He\u2019d always intended to remain faithful to Ginny. In the early years, after he\u2019d fled to Mexico, she\u2019d met him at prearranged destinations, in Mexico City or Veracruz. He lived for those few brief days together. Then Raine had started school and Ginny\u2019s visits became less and less frequent until finally they stopped. Still, he\u2019d spoken vows of love and fidelity. Vows he\u2019d written himself.</p><p>He was burdened by more than guilt and regret. He worried about Azucena and this baby yet to be born. He was fifty now, and he\u2019d been with her for only the past eight years. Sometimes he believed he had a right to take whatever happiness he could, the happiness Azucena offered him; other times he prayed Ginny would never know of his weakness for this woman so much younger than himself.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted more children, but Azucena was stubborn and she\u2019d yearned for a baby. She had a loving generous heart, and he couldn\u2019t deny her, not when she\u2019d done so much for him. Soon there would be three children. He wondered if this third child would be a son like the first two.</p><p>He loved his children, doted on them and, according to Azucena, spoiled them. Because of Antonio and Hector, he realized how much he\u2019d missed with his daughter. Raine was an adult now, but in his mind she remained a child. She\u2019d been so young when he left! Ginny had brought him photographs during those infrequent visits; the last one was a school picture of Raine, gap-toothed, pigtailed, eight years old.</p><p>A knock sounded on his door. \u201cI apologize for disturbing you,\u201d one of the older students said in Spanish on entering his classroom. \u201cA man has asked to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he give his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Keller.\u201d</p><p>Thomas grinned despite himself. \u201cTell him I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d He had little in common with the former mercenary, but it was always good to spend time with another American. Jack didn\u2019t visit all that often, but he invariably brought news of home and the world. On the negative side, he tended to have a foul mouth and a quick eye for a pretty face, but both of these faults were easily forgiven. Jack was a good friend to a man who had few.</p><p>Thomas shoved the test papers into his leather case and headed for the school office. Jack lounged in a broken-down desk chair, flipping the pages of a year-old magazine. He looked terrible. He needed a haircut, but Azucena would probably see to that. His sun-streaked brown hair brushed his shoulders. Apparently he hadn\u2019t shaved in two or three days, either. His jeans were cut off at mid-calf, the ends frayed, and he wore tennis shoes without socks.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d Thomas greeted him with enthusiasm and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, Thomas.\u201d Jack tossed aside the magazine and vaulted to his feet. He gripped Thomas\u2019s hand for a firm shake, then slapped him on the back in a gesture of fondness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beginning to look like an old sea dog,\u201d Thomas said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you don\u2019t look so bad yourself. Are you a proud papa yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny day now.\u201d It worried Thomas that there were no medical facilities close to El Mirador, not that Azucena would agree to have this baby anywhere but in their own home with a midwife. Yet he couldn\u2019t help being concerned, despite the ease of the two previous deliveries.</p><p>\u201cGot time for a beer?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Thomas would send word to Azucena via a student. She would want Jack to come to the house for dinner. Not only did she like Jack a great deal, it was a matter of pride to her that she feed their guests like visiting royalty. She\u2019d have Thomas\u2019s head if he didn\u2019t bring Jack home with him.</p><p>He left instructions with Alfonso, then he and Jack strolled over to the waterfront cantina. No sooner had they sat down at a table and tasted their beer than Alfonso was back, breathless from running.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or Dancy!\u201d he cried. \u201cSe\u00f1or Dancy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Thomas\u2019s first thought was of Azucena.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman at the school asking for you,\u201d Alfonso blurted.</p><p>\u201cA woman?\u201d Thomas ignored Jack\u2019s raised eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. She says her name is Lorraine Dancy. She says she\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s nerves wouldn\u2019t allow her to wait quietly for her father. She couldn\u2019t sit still, and as she paced the school hallway, her heels clicked against the hard stone floor. A framed document on the wall, written in both Spanish and English, stated that the school was financially supported by a group of Texas churches. It listed the headmaster\u2019s name, plus the three teachers. And it explained that the children\u2019s uniforms were sewn by the Women\u2019s Missionary Society. She read the information twice, then paced some more. Lorraine had arrived in El Mirador half an hour ago\u2014it was nearly six now. She\u2019d known her chances of catching Thomas Dancy at the school this late in the afternoon weren\u2019t good. Jason had wanted her to check into the lone hotel with him, but she\u2019d decided to look for her father first.</p><p>As it turned out, the school building was open, and when she mentioned her father\u2019s name to a young man in a school uniform, he\u2019d nodded vigorously and even managed to ask her a few questions in English. He\u2019d suggested she wait inside while he went to get her father.</p><p>For a moment Lorraine had felt light-headed with relief\u2014at least her father was there. Then the real anxiety had begun, the jittery nervous fear. The almost sickening excitement.</p><p>At the sound of footsteps behind her, Lorraine turned. Thomas Dancy stood in the doorway, framed in bright sunlight.</p><p>\u201cRaine,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThomas Dancy?\u201d she asked hesitantly, then, \u201cDad?\u201d He\u2019d called her Raine in his letter, too, but her mother had always insisted her name not be shortened.</p><p>The look in his eyes was answer enough. Deep blue eyes, the same color as hers. He came slowly toward her and she could see that he was indeed the man in her mother\u2019s photograph. He gazed at her for a full minute, an awed expression on his face. Then he smiled, and his eyes shone with an intensity that hinted at tears.</p><p>\u201cRaine,\u201d he said again. \u201cIf only I\u2019d known...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get my letter?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI phoned, too.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t know I was coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...but I thank God you did.\u201d</p><p>They stood a few feet from each other, and he continued to stare at her. \u201cHow like your mother you are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo beautiful...\u201d Thomas raised his hand as if to touch her face, then apparently changed his mind and let his arm fall. The love in his eyes was unmistakable.</p><p>At the mention of her mother, Lorraine felt her own eyes fill with tears.</p><p>\u201cRaine, what is it?\u201d He stopped short of taking her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cMom was killed April first,\u201d she told him shakily.</p><p>His eyes widened with shock and then slowly, as though his legs would no longer support him, he staggered toward a chair. \u201cKilled? How? Dear God in heaven, tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was on her way home from work. It\u2019d been raining that day and no one knows exactly why, but her tires lost traction and her brakes locked\u2014and she skidded into oncoming traffic. She was hit by a huge semi... There was nothing he could do to stop. Nothing anyone could do.\u201d</p><p>Her father closed his eyes. \u201cDid she suffer?\u201d he asked, his voice so low it was an effort to understand him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. The investigating officer told me death was instantaneous.\u201d</p><p>Thomas nodded, his face wet with tears that ran unrestrained down his cheeks. \u201cApril first, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, reached into a pocket for his handkerchief and wiped away the tears. \u201cI woke up that night.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cMy Ginny is dead,\u201d he said as if he needed to hear himself say the words to believe they were true.</p> <p>Lorraine sat down in the chair beside his. \u201cMom told me you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We...we thought it best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Everything Lorraine had endured today would be worth it if he could answer this single question.</p><p>Thomas inhaled a deep breath and turned to face her. He took both her hands, clasping them between his own. It was then that he noticed the ring.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mom\u2019s. I put it on the day of the funeral.\u201d She told him a little about her engagement to Gary and then waited, needing answers before she continued.</p> <p>His thumb tenderly caressed the wedding band. \u201cI\u2019ll love you always,\u201d he whispered\u2014the words engraved inside the ring. His eyes gazed into hers. \u201cI loved your mother and you with all my heart, Lorraine. First and foremost, I need you to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you leave us?\u201d she cried. Now that she was with him, she wanted to know the truth with an urgency that left her trembling. For more than twenty years her mother had lived under false pretenses, and Lorraine had to find out why. She couldn\u2019t imagine what would drive her parents to do something so drastic. Honesty had been the very basis of her mother\u2019s character. At least that was what she\u2019d thought....</p><p>\u201cMom loved you, too...all that time. She wouldn\u2019t talk about you, especially once I got older. Whenever she did, she\u2019d start to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I know.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled from Lorraine\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe told me you\u2019d died of leukemia.\u201d</p><p>The merest hint of a smile touched his mouth, raising one corner. \u201cWe concocted that story together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re alive!\u201d She needed the truth, and quickly, while she was strong enough to bear it. \u201cPlease\u2014tell me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt began in Vietnam,\u201d he said, his voice falling to a whisper. \u201cIn many ways, the man I was meant to be died there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were a decorated hero! Mom said the thing she regretted most about the fire was that your medals were lost and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thomas\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cShe told you that?\u201d His expression was sober. Regretful. \u201cI was far from a hero, Lorraine. I deserted halfway through my tour of duty. I couldn\u2019t take the killing any longer, the death....\u201d</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t want to believe what she was hearing. It couldn\u2019t be true. Any of it. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI returned to the States and joined a militant antiwar group. They helped me hide out. From the moment I turned my back on the army, I made it my mission, my goal in life, to keep other young men from dying pointlessly on foreign soil. I wanted to save them from watching their friends blown to bits for reasons that had nothing to do with us or our country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you could come back now\u2014even if you were a deserter. There was an amnesty, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d All her life she\u2019d viewed her father as a hero. This lie her parents had lived made no sense, and she found Thomas\u2019s story confusing.</p><p>\u201cI did much more than desert.\u201d He broke eye contact and lowered his head to stare at their clasped hands. \u201cAs I said earlier, I joined a militant antiwar group. A number of us decided to blow up the ROTC building at the University of Kentucky. We didn\u2019t mean for anyone to get hurt.... The security guard wasn\u2019t supposed to be anywhere close to the building.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe died in the explosion?\u201d</p><p>Her father nodded. \u201cTwo of our group were picked up almost immediately when they tried to cross the Canadian border. Jos\u00e9 and I knew it was only a matter of time before we\u2019d be arrested, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJos\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJos\u00e9 Delgado, a friend, a good one at the time. The two of us made our way into Mexico before an arrest warrant could be issued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJos\u00e9? We bummed around the country for a while, then he found another cause. We argued and split up\u2014I haven\u2019t seen him in years. The last I heard he was part of a guerrilla group somewhere in Central America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut couldn\u2019t you come back now? That was thirty years ago!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thomas said with a sadness that couldn\u2019t be disguised. \u201cThere\u2019s no statute of limitations on murder. The minute I cross the border, I\u2019ll be arrested for murder and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Raine, I want you to know I was involved with the group, but I was against the bombing. I never believed violence was the way to get our message across. But I didn\u2019t have the courage to stand up to the others. That was my greatest sin and one I\u2019ve paid for dearly in the years since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the two who were arrested?\u201d</p><p>Again her father lowered his gaze. \u201cRick and Dan? Rick committed suicide in prison, and Ginny told me Dan was paroled after serving six years of a twelve-year sentence.\u201d</p><p>Questions crowded Lorraine\u2019s mind, and she asked the most pressing ones first. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Mom join you here? Surely after five or ten years she could have done so without anyone suspecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was what we planned in the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mother moved to Louisville and she visited me every six months or so. We were able to keep in touch through a mutual friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElaine Wilson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Elaine?\u201d She\u2019d died when Lorraine was nine.</p><p>\u201cEverything fell apart after Elaine died,\u201d her father said. \u201cGinny would write that she was coming, but each time she\u2019d find some excuse to postpone it. Eventually her visits stopped entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut couldn\u2019t we have moved to Mexico? Then the three of us would\u2019ve been together.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGinny was afraid that if she left the country for more than a few days, she wouldn\u2019t be able to return. She worried about her parents. She worried about you, too. Your mother loved you beyond everything, and she wanted you to have the best education and all the advantages America has to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...she told me you were dead.\u201d Lorraine didn\u2019t know if she could forgive either of them for the lie.</p><p>\u201cYou were a child and far too young to carry the weight of our secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m an adult now. I have been for years. There was no reason to continue hiding the truth from me,\u201d she insisted. No reason Virginia couldn\u2019t have told her and allowed her to form her own judgments, make her own decisions.</p><p>\u201cAny blame falls on me, Raine,\u201d he said. He raised his hand to her face, touching her cheek. \u201cI was the one who screwed up. I was the one who got involved in a bombing that claimed an innocent man\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I needed you,\u201d Lorraine said, fighting back tears.</p><p>\u201cI needed you, too,\u201d he said, and gathered her in his arms. They clung to each other for a long time.</p><p>When he released her, Lorraine sat back and tried to collect herself.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted,\u201d he said. \u201cHungry, too, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach growled, reminding her that, except for a few pieces of melon in M\u00e9rida, her last meal had been on the airplane. Yogurt, a banana and some type of forgettable roll. Her father was right; she was both tired and hungry.</p><p>He took charge of her suitcase and led her out of the school. While they walked the short distance to his house, Thomas told her how he\u2019d spent his life here in Mexico. Until nine years ago, he\u2019d worked at various odd jobs around the country, never staying in any one place for long. Then the opportunity had come to teach science and math at this private school, a job he thoroughly enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to admit I didn\u2019t find my calling in life until I was over forty.\u201d</p><p>Already Lorraine could see how easy it would be to love this man. He might have been militant in his youth, but despite the tragic results of his actions, he\u2019d joined the antiwar effort for compassionate reasons. He\u2019d repented his mistakes and was obviously still a good man, but one who\u2019d achieved self-knowledge.</p><p>Lorraine was grateful to have found him.</p><p>It had been a shock when Lorraine showed up in El Mirador, but one of the happiest of Thomas\u2019s life. His daughter was everything he\u2019d hoped she\u2019d be. Intelligent, beautiful, caring. And so much like her mother.</p><p>His first look at Lorraine had stopped him cold. She resembled Ginny in almost every way. In fact, it was like stepping back and seeing Ginny at nineteen.</p><p>The news that his wife was dead was a hard blow, and he\u2019d need time to assimilate it. Time and privacy to mourn. He\u2019d told Raine the truth\u2014he had loved her mother. Yes, she\u2019d hurt him; yes, she\u2019d disillusioned him, but he\u2019d forgiven her. He couldn\u2019t blame her for the tragic turn his life had taken. He just wished things had been different for both of them. Too late now for wishing, though.</p><p>His home was a humble one and Thomas hoped Lorraine would understand that the village was poor. The school couldn\u2019t afford to pay him a large salary.</p><p>Antonio and Hector were playing in the front yard. Under other circumstances, his sons would have raced toward him, but they were shy boys and unaccustomed to seeing him with strangers. They stopped and stared, Antonio clutching the soccer ball to his chest, as Thomas opened the door for Lorraine.</p><p>Azucena was in the kitchen preparing dinner. The scent of garlic drifted through the house. Thomas set Lorraine\u2019s suitcase in the living room and tried to find a way to explain that this very pregnant woman was his common-law wife. Lorraine would probably be surprised, perhaps disapproving, but Azucena was his wife in every sense except the legal. Now that he was free to marry her, he would do so.</p><p>Azucena stepped into the room, her smile automatic until she saw Lorraine. Her welcome faded as she glanced at him, her eyes filled with questions. Azucena spoke little English and showed no desire to learn. Because she made no effort herself, their sons knew only a few English words.</p><p>\u201cThis is my daughter,\u201d he said in Spanish. Her eyes widened, and Thomas could see that she was flustered. He\u2019d told her about his family, about Raine, and realized that she felt threatened. He wanted to reassure her but wasn\u2019t sure how.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack Keller?\u201d Azucena asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cBack on his boat, I suppose. I left him when I learned my daughter was at the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about your daughter\u2019s visit?\u201d Her beautiful dark eyes were accusing.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He longed to take Azucena in his arms and apologize, but didn\u2019t dare. \u201cHer mother died last month, and she only recently found out I was alive.\u201d</p><p>Azucena nodded, her expression sympathetic. \u201cIntroduce me as your housekeeper,\u201d she advised with gentle wisdom. \u201cYour daughter has had more than enough shocks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to her again. It\u2019s better if she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell her together,\u201d Azucena said. \u201cLater. She\u2019s traveled a long way and must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then agreed with a short nod.</p><p>\u201cAsk her to sit down, and I\u2019ll serve you both dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you and the boys?\u201d It didn\u2019t seem right not to have them at the table with him. As he\u2019d told Azucena, he didn\u2019t like the idea of lying to Raine, but he could see that his daughter was physically tired and emotionally distraught. He didn\u2019t want to burden her with still another difficult truth. But he also feared her anger. He couldn\u2019t bear to lose her when he\u2019d only just found her again. Although it went against his better judgment, he agreed with Azucena that they would delay telling Raine about their relationship.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll eat later,\u201d Azucena said.</p><p>Thomas noticed Raine listening to the flow of words between them. Her eyes revealed her lack of comprehension. \u201cThis woman is someone special?\u201d she asked, eyeing Azucena closely.</p><p>\u201cMy housekeeper,\u201d he said, silently adding and so much more.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s meticulous,\u201d Raine said, glancing around the sparse but lovingly decorated home. Thomas tried to see the house through her eyes and knew it must be far less than she was used to, but he made no apologies. He\u2019d earned his living by honest means.</p> <p>\u201cDinner\u2019s ready if you\u2019d like to eat now. Azucena\u2019s a wonderful cook. She\u2019s made a dish called camar\u00f3nes con ajo, which is shrimp with garlic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells delicious. Please thank her for me,\u201d Lorraine said.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Thomas showed his daughter to the bathroom, where she could wash up.</p><p>She returned a few minutes later. The table was set with steaming ceramic bowls filled with rice, tomatoes and the delectable-smelling shrimp.</p><p>Lorraine took a seat. \u201cWhen is...your housekeeper\u2019s baby due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny day now,\u201d he answered as he passed her the rice, hoping to avoid further questions for the moment.</p> <p>\u201cThose were her children outside?\u201d</p><p>Thomas nodded.</p><p>\u201cHer name is lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means lily.\u201d</p><p>The irony of the situation didn\u2019t escape him. At one time Azucena had, in fact, been his housekeeper. The school had hired her on his behalf, and for six months he\u2019d hardly been aware of her. His house was kept spotless and his meals cooked every night. Beyond that, he was absorbed by the demands of teaching and enjoying his newfound profession. He\u2019d never intended to take Azucena to his bed. He was married, although no one in El Mirador knew about his American wife. Nor did he wish to indulge in behavior that would be viewed with disfavor by the church-supported school.</p><p>To date, the headmaster had never mentioned Thomas\u2019s living arrangements. He\u2019d eaten meals in this house, so he had to know what was going on. Nevertheless he always referred to Azucena as Thomas\u2019s housekeeper. And for those first six months that was exactly what she was. Thomas hadn\u2019t made so much as an untoward gesture, and in the end, Azucena, whose name was regarded as a symbol of purity and perfection, had been the one to seduce him.</p><p>The meal was excellent. Azucena had chosen his favorite. He could see that Raine was enjoying it, too.</p><p>\u201cShe really is a wonderful cook,\u201d Raine said as Azucena carried a plate of hot tortillas to the table.</p> <p>It was difficult for Thomas to disguise his fondness for his common-law wife. He knew Lorraine had seen the smile he\u2019d given Azucena and might have commented, but their meal was interrupted by a loud demanding knock on the door. Both women looked at Thomas.</p><p>He set his napkin aside and hurried across the room, unsure what to expect. The knock was not that of a friend. He knew trouble when he heard it.</p><p>Two uniformed policemen stood on the other side of the threshold. He\u2019d rarely seen armed police in this town; not only that, he didn\u2019t recognize either man, which was unusual in itself. He knew almost everyone in El Mirador, if not by name then by sight.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Thomas asked, taking care to pronounce each word distinctly and with authority.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for Lorraine Dancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Raine said from behind him. \u201cI heard my name.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, refusing to break eye contact with the two officers. \u201cWhy are you looking for my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to ask her a few questions,\u201d said the taller and more muscular of the two.</p><p>\u201cQuestions about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason Applebee,\u201d the second policeman informed him. \u201cWe need to know what her relationship is to this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Raine had joined him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anyone by the name of Jason Applebee?\u201d he asked in English.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s an American I met in M\u00e9rida. He helped me buy my bus ticket. Is everything all right? Nothing\u2019s happened to him, has it?\u201d</p><p>Thomas asked the two police officers those very questions. Raine had said nothing previously about meeting this other man, but Thomas could see that she cared about his welfare.</p><p>They answered, and he turned back to Lorraine. \u201cThey\u2019re holding him at the police station. They won\u2019t tell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She covered her mouth with her hand. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ve got to help him.\u201d</p><p>Thomas had been in Mexico long enough to know how difficult situations with the police could get. If for no other reason than Raine\u2019s endorsement of her new friend, he felt obliged to do what he could to help the guy.</p><p>\u201cThey want you to go to the station with them,\u201d Thomas explained next.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Raine frowned uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is just a misunderstanding and everything will be cleared up in no time.\u201d</p><p>Thomas wished he could believe that. But one thing he knew: he would do everything within his power to protect his daughter.</p><p>The minute Lorraine entered the small building, Jason leaped to his feet, relief at seeing her evident on his face. \u201cLorraine!\u201d he cried as if she were the answer to his prayers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jason looked at the two officers standing near the door; they gazed back at him impassively.</p><p>With three policemen and Jason, plus Lorraine and Thomas, the station was crowded. For the first time Lorraine realized that only one of the men who\u2019d come to the house had accompanied them here. She hadn\u2019t a clue where the second man had gone. Not that it particularly concerned her.</p><p>\u201cThis is my wife,\u201d Jason announced in English.</p><p>Lorraine barely managed to swallow her denial.</p><p>Her father glared at her, eyes narrowed. Both policemen immediately glanced at the ring finger on her left hand.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d the older man asked. He was tall and distinguished-looking with a crop of thick white hair.</p><p>Everyone present seemed to await confirmation. Jason\u2019s expression begged her to go along with him. She forced a smile and nodded.</p><p>The room erupted into shouts and denials from the officer who\u2019d escorted Lorraine and her father to the station. She didn\u2019t know what anyone was saying, but it didn\u2019t take long for her father to become involved in the heated conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about?\u201d Lorraine asked Jason under her breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, looking as confused as she felt. \u201cBut from what I can make out, they think I\u2019ve got some Mayan artifact, which is ridiculous.\u201d He appeared frightened, baffled and apologetic. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to drag you into this,\u201d he confessed in a low voice, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you say I was your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to tell them something so I could convince them to contact you. I told them you were visiting your father, so you hadn\u2019t registered at the hotel yet.\u201d He paused, lowering his eyes. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me place a call or have an attorney present. I didn\u2019t know what to do or what\u2019s going on. I helped you and I was hoping you could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told him, although she hated lying. Still, she supposed there were times it was necessary; now seemed to be one such occasion.</p><p>The argument continued between the police and Lorraine\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cI still wish you\u2019d told them the truth,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to tell them I was recently on a dig?\u201d He stared at her with wide-eyed disbelief. \u201cLorraine, that\u2019s crazy! The minute they learn that, they\u2019ll be convinced I actually have the thing.\u201d</p><p>The white-haired officer walked over to the other side of the room. Jason\u2019s backpack was open on a table and his clothes and personal effects littered the top. His bag had been thoroughly searched.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Lorraine stepped closer to her father. \u201cHave you found anything out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSergeant Lopez is of the opinion that your...husband is guilty of stealing a national treasure. They think Jason stole the Kukulcan Star.\u201d He went on to explain that the Star was an artifact associated with the god Kukulcan. It actually consisted of two separate parts, designed to fit together. One half of the Star had been discovered in the 1930s and kept in a Mexico City museum. That piece had gone missing a few days after the second half of the Star was found on a new archaeological dig. But it disappeared under mysterious circumstances before its authenticity could be verified. Even worse, one man\u2014a guard at the museum\u2014was hospitalized and not expected to live. Another man, an archaeologist named Raventos, hadn\u2019t been seen since the first theft. There was evidence of foul play. It was assumed that the same person was responsible for all these crimes. \u201cAnd the police suspect Jason of being the culprit,\u201d Thomas said, concluding his explanation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Jason shouted. \u201cI swear that isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately for your friend,\u201d Thomas said to Lorraine, \u201cLieutenant Jacinto is inclined to believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jason whispered, sagging against his chair. \u201cThey\u2019ve searched everything I have. They tore my backpack inside out.\u201d</p><p>Her father faced Jason and met his look squarely. \u201cIf you\u2019ve taken this artifact, it would be best to own up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Jason said fervently. \u201cI swear I don\u2019t know what these men are talking about. I\u2019m just a part-time university instructor.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine noticed that he conveniently forgot to mention that the subject he taught was archaeology or that he\u2019d just been on a dig. Not that she blamed him\u2014well, not entirely. She understood the reason he\u2019d given her: just mentioning his background would make him instantly suspect in police eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey said they were looking for a long-haired blond American male with round glasses and a bad cut on his right hand,\u201d Thomas said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason shrugged. His own hair was dark and clipped short and he didn\u2019t wear glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you. It isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have made it to El Mirador without his help,\u201d Lorraine told her father.</p><p>Thomas leveled his gaze on Jason. \u201cLike I said, lucky for you Lieutenant Jacinto believes you.\u201d</p><p>Jason sighed with relief.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been able to convince them to let you go back to your hotel room for the night, but they might want to question you again in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll do anything I can to clear my name,\u201d Jason said eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here if you need me,\u201d Thomas added.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. I appreciate your help more than I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason won\u2019t disappoint you,\u201d Lorraine said with confidence. \u201cHe\u2019ll do whatever he\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, for tonight you\u2019re free to go back to the hotel,\u201d Thomas reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>Jason, Lorraine and her father left the police station together. The police had repacked his bag and returned it. Her father insisted on walking Jason to his hotel and stopped to talk to the proprietor, an old man who greeted Thomas warmly.</p><p>Although Lorraine couldn\u2019t understand what was being said, the gist of the conversation was obvious. The man in the hotel was to keep an eye on Jason.</p><p>Thomas didn\u2019t refer to her role in this fiasco until they were almost back at the house. \u201cWhy\u2019d you lie about being Jason\u2019s wife?\u201d he asked her point-blank.</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d She knew she\u2019d displeased him, but that couldn\u2019t be avoided. \u201cI certainly hadn\u2019t planned on doing it,\u201d she qualified. \u201cBut when he said I was his wife...\u201d Lorraine gave a helpless shrug. \u201cAnyway, I know Jason\u2019s innocent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re that sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, positive,\u201d she replied without further thought. \u201cYes,\u201d she said again for emphasis.</p><p>Her father was about to say something else, then stopped abruptly. \u201cAntonio,\u201d he called as a youngster ran toward him with an older boy she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Antonio had been one of the children playing in the yard at the house, she recalled. Something was clearly wrong, because the boy burst into a torrent of Spanish almost as if he couldn\u2019t get the words out fast enough.</p><p>Her father listened and his body language confirmed her guess. He turned, gripping her arms tightly. \u201cWe have to get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me out?\u201d Lorraine was nearly too stunned to speak.</p><p>\u201cOne of the policemen searched your suitcase while we were at the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not legal!\u201d she cried in outrage.</p> <p>\u201cRaine,\u201d he said, shaking her hard. \u201cThey found the artifact.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Jack sat on board Scotch on Water watching the sun sink into a friendly pink sky. This was his favorite time of day. Soon the moon would rise over the water, its reflection silver-bright. He propped his feet on the side of the boat and held a bottle of his favorite Mexican beer. A clear sky, a beer in his hand and his mind free of worries. Life didn\u2019t get any better than this.</p><p>With nothing more than the sunset to distract him, Jack let his thoughts wander back to his friend Thomas Dancy. When Thomas had learned of his daughter\u2019s visit, he\u2019d raced back to the school, promising he\u2019d see Jack later. Jack hadn\u2019t even known Dancy had a daughter. Her visit sure wasn\u2019t expected if Dancy\u2019s reaction was anything to go by. He hadn\u2019t heard from his friend since, but he would; Dancy was a man of his word. Jack had delayed having dinner, preferring to let Azucena spoil him with one of her specialties. Man, could she cook! His mouth watered just thinking about what she could do with a fresh fish, a couple of tomatoes, peppers and a few spices. Her tortillas hot from the grill were the best he\u2019d ever tasted. If she was feeling up to it, he\u2019d ask her for a haircut, too. He should shave before dinner, he mused, rubbing his hand down his face. The stubble scraped his palm.</p><p>He\u2019d enjoyed seeing Thomas again, even if their visit was cut short. He\u2019d forgotten how much he liked Dancy\u2019s company. Jack had laughed more in the half hour he\u2019d spent with Thomas than he had in weeks. He\u2019d make a point of sticking around until the kid was born. He wanted to be sure he saw lots of Antonio and Hector, too. Those two were pure fun. It didn\u2019t hurt that they worshiped him, either.</p><p>His evening plans might have fallen through, but the afternoon hadn\u2019t been wasted. He\u2019d filled the boat\u2019s 480-gallon fuel tanks with diesel and paid for his supplies. They\u2019d be loaded on board first thing in the morning. Given the option of heading toward Florida or Belize, he\u2019d decided to return to the Central American country and would set his course southward as soon as the mood struck him.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>The urgency of the voice caught him off guard. He dropped his feet and stood, tensing with sudden wariness. Then he leaned over the boat\u2019s side, peering toward the dock.</p><p>Thomas ran along the waterfront, tugging a blonde in a white pantsuit by the hand. Jack noticed that the woman was having trouble keeping up. Briefly he wondered if she was Dancy\u2019s daughter. Her purse swung wildly at her side and threatened to slip off her shoulder. Both were breathless and appeared to be arguing. As they drew closer, Jack was able to make out their words.</p><p>\u201cAntonio\u2019s your son, isn\u2019t he?\u201d She turned to Thomas and Jack could hear the anger in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to talk about that now,\u201d Thomas said.</p><p>\u201cHe called you Papa. How many other children do you have? How many wives?\u201d Then, as if she should have realized it earlier, she added, \u201cAzucena\u2019s your...lover, isn\u2019t she? Why, she can\u2019t be more than three or four years older than me!\u201d Shock and outrage sounded in each word. She lapsed into silence as they approached Jack\u2019s slip.</p><p>Thomas\u2019s face was tight with frustration. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask a favor,\u201d he said, looking up at Jack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d Jack said, not waiting to hear what it was. Few people in this world warranted that kind of response, but Jack liked and trusted Thomas Dancy.</p><p>\u201cRaine, this is Jack Keller.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded in her direction, choosing to disregard the fact that they\u2019d been arguing. \u201cPleasure to meet you, Raine.\u201d</p><p>She barely glanced at him. \u201cI prefer to be called Lorraine,\u201d she said with all the warmth of a rattlesnake.</p><p>La-di-da. \u201cLorraine,\u201d he corrected, and resisted rolling his eyes.</p><p>Thomas didn\u2019t waste words. \u201cI need you to get her back to the States without the authorities here finding out.\u201d</p><p>Jack read the panic in his friend\u2019s voice and eyes. \u201cIn other words, you don\u2019t want me to take her through customs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d And then Thomas said, \u201cYou need to leave now. Right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Jack asked, ignoring the woman.</p><p>\u201cBig trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d Lorraine insisted. \u201cOnce I\u2019m able to explain the situation, I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to discuss it,\u201d Dancy said, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I should be doing now is running,\u201d she countered. \u201cTaking off like this makes me look guilty. I\u2019d rather face the authorities than\u2014\u201d she paused and cast Jack a scornful look \u201c\u2014be stuck with him.\u201d</p><p>Apparently Jack didn\u2019t meet her dress code. Truth be known, he wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about being stuck with her, either.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you back to the States,\u201d Thomas said forcefully. \u201cIf the police arrest you, I won\u2019t be able to help. They\u2019ll be here any minute. Now go! For the love of God, go!\u201d</p><p>Police? Arrested? Her? Jack couldn\u2019t imagine what she\u2019d done to fall into such disfavor with the authorities, but whatever it was had to be major.</p><p>\u201cTake her!\u201d Thomas practically propelled her in Jack\u2019s direction. \u201cGet her out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy suitcase...my clothes! I can\u2019t just leave like this! Besides, there are things you and I need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police have your suitcase! Anyway, do you think they\u2019ll let you keep it when Sergeant Lopez hauls you off to jail? Do you?\u201d Thomas\u2019s composure slipped as his voice rose in fear and anger. \u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to see the inside of a Mexican jail. Now go! Hurry. Get the hell out of here.\u201d He was shouting, gesturing frantically for Jack to take her. Thomas untied the rope from the dock and tossed it onto the deck.</p><p>\u201cThe American Embassy will help me,\u201d Lorraine said as she reluctantly climbed on board. Scotch on Water rocked slightly with her entry. \u201cWhen I explain that I know nothing about the artifact,\u201d she went on, \u201cthey\u2019ll square everything with the Mexican government.\u201d</p><p>Even without knowing her circumstances, Jack could see the woman lived in a fantasy world. Once she was in the hands of the Mexican authorities, there was little anyone could do to help her. The willingness\u2014and ability\u2014of the American Embassy to assist her was a matter best left to speculation. Thomas knew this as well as Jack did.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014just go,\u201d Thomas pleaded.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>The boat\u2019s engine fired to life with a roar. A burst of exhaust fumes polluted the air.</p><p>\u201cBut I only just arrived!\u201d she shouted. The high-pitched plea in her voice could be heard over the noise of the engine. \u201cI\u2014there\u2019s things I need to know before I leave... This isn\u2019t right. None of this.\u201d</p><p>Jack heard her distress but felt no real sympathy.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I want, either,\u201d Thomas said. Slowly, as if it ripped his heart out, he stepped away from the slip. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to reach you,\u201d he promised. \u201cYou have precious cargo, my friend,\u201d he told Jack, his eyes filled with pain. \u201cGet her safely back to the States for me.\u201d</p><p>The situation was urgent; that much was obvious. Without waiting any longer, Jack climbed to the flybridge. Thomas remained at the far end of the dock and watched them pull out.</p><p>Looking over his shoulder, Jack noticed that Lorraine stood at the rear of the cabin cruiser. He pushed the lever forward, easing the craft out of the protected waters of the marina. Lorraine leaned against the gunwale, arms crossed. Even from the back, Jack could tell how furious she was. She might be tempted to leap overboard and swim back to land, but he wouldn\u2019t recommend it.</p><p>Not long afterward, the empty feeling in the pit of his stomach reminded Jack that he hadn\u2019t eaten yet. Furthermore, there was almost no food on board. The supplies he\u2019d ordered and paid for were back in El Mirador on the storekeeper\u2019s porch. Not only was he out his supplies, but he was stuck with a woman who was sure to irritate him every time she opened her mouth.</p><p>No, this certainly wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d thought his evening would go. No, sir. Not at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lorraine stayed on the open deck of the boat and watched the lights of El Mirador gradually disappear. She stood there for some time, trying to make sense of what had happened in the past hour. It seemed that only minutes ago she\u2019d been enjoying a wonderful meal with her father, becoming acquainted with the man she\u2019d believed forever lost to her. Her face reddened as she recalled the way she\u2019d complimented his \u201chousekeeper.\u201d</p><p>This business with the Kukulcan Star was a complete shock\u2014and made her feel even more idiotic. It was entirely clear now that Jason Applebee\u2014if that was his real name\u2014had used her to corroborate his story. He\u2019d tricked her into lying on his behalf, knowing that the authorities were looking for a man traveling alone. No wonder he\u2019d wanted her to tell the police they were married. She groaned at her own stupidity. She\u2019d believed in his innocence right to the bitter end\u2014when she\u2019d learned that the artifact had been found in her luggage. That certainly didn\u2019t say much for her ability to judge character. As for his appearance, he could easily have cut and dyed his hair. And as for placing the artifact inside her suitcase, he could have done that when she\u2019d climbed on the bus and he\u2019d loaded their bags onto the roof.</p><p>How convenient for Jason that he\u2019d come across such a naive trusting American. If there was anything she should\u2019ve learned from the past month, it was not to trust appearances. Now, because of him and her own naivet\u00e9, she was on a boat with this...this overgrown whatever he was. Jack Keller looked like an unkempt surfer who\u2019d spent too much time in the sun. Apparently he lived on his boat. His hair was bleached blond, his body tanned to a bronze hue. Even if she\u2019d just reminded herself that there was no use in relying on appearances, she couldn\u2019t help it with this guy. He seemed so shiftless and irresponsible. Her father must\u2019ve been desperate to have brought her to such a misfit.</p><p>They\u2019d been at sea for more than an hour before either spoke.</p> <p>\u201cFind me something to eat, would you?\u201d Jack called from the flybridge.</p><p>His tone of voice rankled\u2014he sounded as if he expected her to be at his beck and call. She thought about setting him straight but stifled her irritation. He was, after all, doing her and her father a favor.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like me to look?\u201d she called back.</p><p>\u201cTry the galley,\u201d he said, as though she should have figured that out for herself.</p><p>The boat pitched and heaved with the swells as Lorraine made her way belowdecks, which was no easy task because the steps were incredibly steep. Once below, she was in the saddest, smallest excuse for a kitchen she could ever have imagined. She took a moment to glance around and found a toilet and shower, crammed into an impossibly tiny space. The only other room, if it could be considered that, was obviously where Jack slept. There was a narrow bunk, littered with clothes. Books lined the walls and he\u2019d hung several firearms there, next to the light. Never having been around anyone who owned a gun, Lorraine had no idea what kind or caliber these were, but they didn\u2019t resemble any she\u2019d seen in the movies.</p> <p>Returning to the galley, she discovered a wrinkled orange in the tiny refrigerator, along with four or five beers. She pushed those aside\u2014with a fleeting recollection of Katharine Hepburn in The African Queen methodically dumping out Humphrey Bogart\u2019s booze. Further investigation netted her a dried-out tortilla and an open can of sardines, the smell of which disgusted her.</p><p>With no other choice, she peeled the orange. By the time she\u2019d finished that small task, her stomach was queasy.</p><p>\u201cI...seem to be getting seasick,\u201d she said when she brought him the orange. \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you vomit be sure you do it with your head over the side. If you get sick on this boat, you clean it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that charming advice,\u201d she muttered as she walked carefully back to the main deck. The ocean wasn\u2019t calm anymore, the way it\u2019d been when they set out, and it tossed the boat viciously. Scotch on Water\u2014ridiculous name for a boat\u2014surged up and down with the waves, and with every bounce her stomach heaved. Determined not to throw up, Lorraine sat in the only chair on the deck, pressing her arms against her stomach. That didn\u2019t seem to be helping. She was shaking with chills and sweating, both at the same time.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before she vaulted out of the chair and dashed to the side of the boat. What little she\u2019d eaten at her father\u2019s before the police arrived was soon gone. Still retching, she closed her eyes. Finally it seemed to be over. She straightened and moaned loudly, no longer caring if Jack heard her or not. She was too sick to maintain any pretenses.</p> <p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Worse.\u201d She swore the man sounded amused. She would ignore him, she decided, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and lie down, but I don\u2019t suggest you do it belowdecks.\u201d</p><p>She had no intention of sleeping in that horrible bed and there didn\u2019t seem to be anyplace else. If she hadn\u2019t felt so deathly ill, she might have pointed that out.</p><p>Jack disappeared and came back a couple of minutes later with a blanket and pillow. He threw them to her in the chair.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she managed to say, rolling her head from side to side, more miserable than she could ever remember being.</p><p>He hunkered down beside her, but in Lorraine\u2019s opinion didn\u2019t look too sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take to reach the States?\u201d she asked in a weak voice.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer immediately. \u201cLonger than either of us is going to like,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Lorraine already knew he was right.</p><p>When Jason returned to the hotel\u2014Dancys in tow\u2014he\u2019d recognized that time was of the essence. Thomas and Lorraine had eventually left after interminable cautions and goodbyes, and now he was back in his room, repacking the few things he\u2019d taken out of his bag. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before the authorities discovered his lie, and when they did, no amount of smooth talk was going to stop them from arresting him. He needed to make his move, and soon.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected the police to be this tight on his tail. The bandage on his hand must have alerted the clerk at the bus depot. His mistake, he realized, was assuming the bus stations hadn\u2019t been alerted. His photograph couldn\u2019t possibly have circulated yet\u2014could it? In any event, he\u2019d changed his appearance as best he could. Cut and dyed his hair, discarded his glasses in favor of colored contacts he\u2019d brought with him from home, changed his clothing. But he could do nothing about the deep cut on his hand. That must be what had given him away.</p><p>He\u2019d linked up with Lorraine to confuse the authorities, yet no sooner had he checked into the hotel than the cops arrived. He\u2019d barely had time to sign the register and go up to his room, such as it was.</p><p>He stepped quietly into the hallway to study the exits and saw that the proprietor had taken Dancy\u2019s words to heart and fully intended to keep a close eye on him. Dancy wasn\u2019t nearly as big a fool as his daughter.</p><p>Back in his room, Jason stuffed a few scattered things into his pack, including a switchblade he\u2019d hidden under the pillow. The police either hadn\u2019t found the knife or weren\u2019t concerned about it. When he was done, he glanced out the small window that overlooked the street. A police car was just pulling up in front of the hotel. With no time to lose, he threw on his jacket and grabbed the backpack, then slipped quietly out the door.</p><p>Jason met up with the proprietor on the back stairwell. Their conversation was brief. The old man\u2019s mistake was thinking he could stop him. The struggle to silence him cost Jason precious minutes. He would\u2019ve liked to avoid another death, but this one couldn\u2019t be helped. If anyone was to blame, it was Dancy.</p><p>By the time Jason reached the rear exit of the hotel, he could hear police coming up the stairs. That was close. Much too close.</p><p>Now he needed to find Lorraine. During the bus ride, he\u2019d done his damnedest to talk her into checking into the hotel; however, he couldn\u2019t show his cards by being too demanding. But before he left her that afternoon, he\u2019d learned where Dancy lived.</p><p>He hid until night had completely fallen and then found his way down a series of back streets to the schoolmaster\u2019s house on the edge of town. Fortunately El Mirador was laid out in a simple grid pattern, and the moon was bright. He\u2019d tracked people under more adverse conditions\u2014quite recently, as a matter of fact. Lorraine shouldn\u2019t be hard to find.</p><p>She was the key. Once he had what he wanted from her, he\u2019d just disappear again.</p><p>A dog barked as he crept down the dirt road. Fearing discovery, he ducked around the darker side of a small adobe house.</p><p>Then, in a wonderful turn of luck, Jason watched as Thomas Dancy hurried toward the houses shouting for someone named Azucena.</p><p>A pregnant woman rushed out of a house directly across the street and fell into Dancy\u2019s arms, sobbing.</p><p>The two were hugging each other as if they\u2019d spent the past year apart. Jason\u2019s patience wore thin until he was able to make out the woman\u2019s words. So the police had already been to the house and found the artifact. Damn.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d the woman asked in Spanish.</p><p>Jason was interested in learning that, as well.</p><p>\u201cWith Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave her to Jack Keller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice did I have?\u201d Dancy asked. \u201cI had to get her out of here before the police arrested her.\u201d</p><p>Again Jason had to credit the man with some intelligence, unlike his daughter who was as gullible as they came. Dancy was right to send her away. The police would\u2019ve made mincemeat out of her. He smiled, remembering how easily she\u2019d believed his stories\u2014and how willingly she\u2019d told him all about herself. He almost hated dragging her into this, but there was nothing he could do about that now.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s a good friend,\u201d Dancy said. He drew the woman as close as her swollen belly would allow and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI trust him to see that your daughter is safely returned to your country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMexico is my country now,\u201d Dancy said, but even from a distance Jason could hear the sadness in his voice. \u201cAnd soon you will be my wife.\u201d</p><p>The woman lifted her head to look up at Dancy. Jason couldn\u2019t see her expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free to marry you,\u201d Dancy explained.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to stand before the priest to be your wife. In my heart, I am already your wife. My body shelters your child. In this house your sons sleep. I have everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Dancy said, sliding his arm around her waist and leading her back into the house.</p><p>Jack Keller, Jason repeated silently. Now that he had the name, he had everything he needed, too.</p><p>Lorraine awoke with the sun shining in her eyes. Her body rebelled from having spent the night on a deck chair. Her throat felt dry and irritated from being sick. Her neck was stiff, too. But the physical discomforts were minor compared to the ache in her heart. The events of the previous day ran through her mind, and she started to feel dizzy as she thought about everything that had happened. Twenty-four hours ago, she\u2019d kissed Gary goodbye at the airport. And then the flight, the bus trip, meeting her father...and Jason\u2019s betrayal. The police. Jack\u2019s boat... A single day felt like a lifetime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d gone to sleep without washing her face and brushing her teeth for perhaps the first time in her life. Her hair was uncombed and her stomach empty. What she\u2019d eaten the night before had ended up feeding the fish.</p><p>A sound startled her and she glanced up to see Jack standing on deck, hands on his hips as he squinted out at the bright blue water. He didn\u2019t look any better in daylight than he had at dusk. If anything, he seemed even more unkempt and unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she ventured.</p><p>He glared at her and didn\u2019t return the greeting. Apparently he wasn\u2019t a morning person.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like me to put on a pot of coffee?\u201d she asked. Despite his grudging manner, she wanted him to know she was grateful for his help. And she was more than willing to do her share.</p><p>\u201cCook up some eggs while you\u2019re at it,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>She hesitated, not understanding the malice in his voice. \u201cAll right. How would you like them cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer the yolks runny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She wasn\u2019t entirely sure how she\u2019d manage, but she\u2019d learn that soon enough. \u201cIf you\u2019ll kindly tell me where the coffee and the eggs are, I\u2019ll see to it right away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere the coffee and the eggs are?\u201d Jack repeated, speaking with exaggerated slowness. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen them the night before when she\u2019d brought him the orange. Perhaps there was another fridge somewhere, or a cooler.</p><p>\u201cMy supplies are back in El Mirador.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d It took a while for the implication to register in Lorraine\u2019s mind. \u201cYou mean to say we don\u2019t have any food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>She was ten times hungrier now than before she knew this. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she asked in growing alarm.</p> <p>\u201cFish. Sardines make good bait.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>It seemed silly under the circumstances, but he had asked. \u201cI have trouble watching anything die, even a fish.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as if he considered that uproariously funny. \u201cThen do without.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>The woman was utterly useless. If he hadn\u2019t known that before, Jack would\u2019ve ascertained it in about two seconds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fish,\u201d Lorraine finally said after a lengthy silence, \u201cbut I refuse to...clean any.\u201d She turned her back on him. Disapproval radiated off her like sonar waves. Her nose was so high in the air, he thought with amusement, it was a wonder some bird didn\u2019t land on it.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a problem with pulling your own weight?\u201d he asked, not that he was looking for an argument. He was more interested in seeing how far he could push her.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019ll pull my own weight.\u201d</p><p>It was too early in the morning to argue. Besides, he was hungry. He missed his morning coffee and was in no mood to deal with an unexpected passenger, especially one who\u2019d inconvenienced him as much as this woman had. Not only that, she didn\u2019t seem to recognize that he was doing her a favor by saving her stupid ass from jail.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what you plan to do about our predicament,\u201d she said next.</p><p>Well, excuse me. All he needed now was for Her Highness to start issuing commands.</p><p>\u201cI already told you.\u201d With his back to her, he worked at rigging up the first fishing pole. He secured the bait\u2014the sardine was nothing he\u2019d seriously consider eating himself\u2014and locked the rod into place. Once he\u2019d finished that, he set up the second pole. With two lines in the water, he doubled his chances of scoring breakfast. He hadn\u2019t so much as caught a fish and already Miss Pull-her-own-weight was letting it be known that she wasn\u2019t about to dirty her delicate fingers.</p><p>\u201cSight of blood makes you squeamish, does it?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d she said in a huff.</p><p>He arched one eyebrow and finished with the second rod.</p><p>\u201cI find the idea of fishing barbaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have breakfast or, as I said earlier, you\u2019re free to do without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Unlike him, she\u2019d enjoyed a decent dinner\u2014the dinner he should\u2019ve had over at Thomas\u2019s place. Whether or not she ate breakfast was her choice. Jack couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>\u201cUm, I realize how that must sound,\u201d she said, apparently reconsidering. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the offer....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jack said as he moved forward, \u201cyou go ahead and do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d He started the engines and the boat took off at a slow easy troll.</p><p>Lorraine looked as if she was about to be sick again. Her face went from healthy pink to ashen, followed almost immediately by a faint tinge of green.</p><p>Jack resisted asking her how she was feeling. That seemed too cruel, even for him. One look said it all.</p><p>Her Highness staggered back to the chair and collapsed into it.</p><p>Luck was with him, and in less than ten minutes he\u2019d snagged his first fish. A red snapper, which made for excellent eating.</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t move from her throne the entire time it took him to reel in breakfast. Nor did she show any signs of interest when he took his catch below, gutted, filleted and fried it up in a skillet. The scent of the fish frying made his mouth water. It didn\u2019t come any fresher than this. He could have eaten in the galley, and often did. Not now. With a good deal of ceremony, he dragged another chair onto the deck and placed it beside Lorraine\u2019s. Then he carried up his plate, along with a cold beer, and settled down. She glanced once in his direction, and Jack recognized the look. Hunger. After insisting that she didn\u2019t like fishing, her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to give in and enjoy a fine meal\u2014even if he did say so himself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be a pest...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a pest. You appear to have a real talent for it.\u201d</p><p>That shut her up for a few minutes, as he\u2019d suspected it would.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about the lack of supplies?\u201d she asked after a while.</p><p>Jack could tell from the forced evenness of her voice that she was having trouble controlling her temper. He figured she probably didn\u2019t lose it often; a fine Southern belle like Lorraine had good manners drilled into her the way boot camp had taught him the basics of soldiering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer your question if you answer mine,\u201d he said, savoring the last bite of fish and washing it down with a swallow of beer. There was plenty left in the galley, but he didn\u2019t mention that. If she wanted breakfast she\u2019d have to ask for it.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said with obvious reluctance.</p><p>The boat bobbed gently, and she\u2019d regained some of her color. A good sign, he supposed. Until she found her sea legs she\u2019d be miserable. Jack wasn\u2019t sure which he preferred. Sick as a dog, she still managed to be a nuisance. He hated to think how much she\u2019d annoy him when she was a hundred percent herself.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to ask me something?\u201d She sounded impatient.</p><p>He weighed his thoughts. Teasing her was definitely entertaining, but he felt a little confused about this unaccountable need to learn what he could about her. It must be on account of Thomas; he simply wanted to know what kind of woman his friend had for a daughter. \u201cI realize this isn\u2019t any of my business,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid curiosity has gotten the better of me.\u201d He chuckled dryly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your husband like? Is he as much of a prude as you are?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to the wedding ring on her left hand as though she was surprised to see it there. Forgotten Mr. Whoever-he-was already?</p><p>\u201cI imagine the two of you are quite the pair,\u201d he went on. \u201cDo you ever jump each other\u2019s bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, get so hot for each other you can\u2019t wait to get your clothes off. That\u2019s when sex is best, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide as if she couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. \u201cI find you both vulgar and offensive.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. It was far too much fun baiting this woman. \u201cYou don\u2019t like me any better than I like you. That\u2019s perfectly fine by me. But you can\u2019t blame a guy for being curious about the type of man who\u2019d marry someone as highfalutin as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you and your stuffed-shirt husband make love every Wednesday and Sunday nights, regular as clockwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? You do it in the dark, too. And when you\u2019re done you make polite little sounds, give each other a peck on the cheek, then roll over and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re so interested in my love life?\u201d she asked. She was pretending to be bored but not doing a very good job of it. He watched as color seeped up her neckline and into her cheeks.</p><p>He ignored the question.</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in the love life of every woman you meet,\u201d she asked, still faking disinterest, \u201cor is it just me?\u201d</p><p>Jack snickered as if to suggest someone like her would be the last woman on earth to tempt him. \u201cJust wondering,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a survey or anything.\u201d However, much as he hated to admit it, she had a point. He didn\u2019t normally provoke women. There was just something about her....</p><p>It was the clothes she wore, he decided. The conservative pantsuit. No one wore white out here. Not that it looked so white anymore. And it didn\u2019t help matters that it fit her like a glove. She\u2019d removed the jacket and the short pink top hugged her waist and allowed him to speculate about the soft swell of her breasts beneath. He shook his head. The woman had no sense; if he\u2019d had nefarious designs on her\u2014which he certainly didn\u2019t\u2014she\u2019d be in trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve asked your question, Mr. Keller, stupid as it was, and now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free.\u201d He gestured toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already started drinking. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get to ask me a question, sweetheart, not preach a sermon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She cast him a look of pure disgust. \u201cWhat exactly do you intend to do about the lack of supplies?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at the sheer foolishness of her question. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to worry about, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, she ignored his teasing. \u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>The answer seemed obvious. \u201cBuy more, of course.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had never disliked anyone so fiercely in her whole life. Jack Keller was rude, insensitive and vulgar. It was beyond comprehension that her father had freely handed her over to this...barbarian. Reluctantly she had to conclude that her situation must be far more dangerous than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>The morning had seemed interminable. The sun beat down with an intensity that robbed her of strength. All wit had abandoned her. Jack seemed to take great pleasure in ridiculing her and calling her ridiculous names like Your Highness. He spouted insults, and when he wasn\u2019t mocking her, he called her Raine. The only person who\u2019d ever called her that was her father. When Jack said it, he made it sound, somehow, as though he was speaking to a disobedient child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The one positive aspect of the morning was that she\u2019d finally adjusted to the boat\u2019s movement on the water. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was the lack of anything in her stomach or if she\u2019d found what he referred to as her sea legs. Whichever, she was grateful. She\u2019d never spent any time on a boat before and had no idea what else to expect.</p><p>Gazing out at the horizon, Lorraine suddenly saw land\u2014an outcropping of lush green hills far in the distance. That excited her so much she climbed awkwardly out of her chair and shuffled toward the rear of the boat.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMexico.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat much I know,\u201d she returned, trying not to sound sarcastic. At this point, it was difficult. She sighed, loudly and expressively. \u201cAre we buying supplies here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite hide her relief. It was clear to her, if not Jack, that they couldn\u2019t continue this voyage without obtaining some food.</p><p>As they headed toward land, Lorraine noticed a number of high-rise luxury hotels in the distance. \u201cWhat city is that?\u201d she asked when curiosity overcame her unwillingness to ask him any further questions.</p><p>\u201cCampeche,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t elaborate.</p> <p>Lorraine remembered reading about the town in the information she\u2019d gathered when she was researching the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. If she recalled correctly, the city was one of the fastest-growing tourist spots in the region. There were a number of Mayan ruins close by.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to Campeche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t?\u201d She frowned in disappointment. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p> <p>In her opinion, they\u2019d probably be safer in a large city where they could get lost in anonymous crowds. Not that he\u2019d given her any say in the matter, nor did he seem at all interested in her opinions. \u201cWell, if not Campeche, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Ruta Maya,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means route of the Maya. It\u2019s a small village down the coast from Campeche. Tradition says the village was on the main artery for Mayan traders a thousand years ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve docked there in the past,\u201d Jack added, \u201cand I can buy supplies with a minimum of fuss. That way we can be in and out of port quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do,\u201d Jack said, narrowing his gaze. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk you being seen. With that suit of yours and that blond hair, you\u2019d stick out like a red flag to a herd of bulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d she demanded. \u201cJump overboard and hold my breath until you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me any ideas.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had to clamp her jaws shut to keep from saying something she was sure to regret later. No one had ever infuriated her faster than this shiftless, worthless, good-for-nothing bum. She wanted as little to do with him as possible and actually felt grateful that he assumed she was married. She could only guess how much more obnoxious he would\u2019ve been if he\u2019d figured she was up for grabs. Wearing her mother\u2019s wedding band had turned out to be a fortunate thing.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to stay out of sight while I\u2019m in town.\u201d</p><p>The implication didn\u2019t hit her right away. Then, \u201cYou want me to go down there\u2014belowdecks?\u201d It would be stifling holed up in that dreadful little place.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said. Then, as though he understood her objection, he told her, \u201cI\u2019ll be as fast as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d She supposed she could endure anything provided she had some idea of the time involved. Fifteen minutes? Twenty? Already she could feel the suffocating heat crowding in around her.</p><p>\u201cIf everything goes smoothly, I should be back in about forty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty minutes!\u201d she exploded. Just how long could it take to purchase a few necessities?</p><p>\u201cPossibly a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had to bite her tongue. He was doing this on purpose, she knew he was, to punish her for their predicament. The more she objected, the more time he\u2019d take. She wouldn\u2019t put it past him.</p><p>He slowed the boat long before they reached the village. \u201cGo on below,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Lorraine closed her mouth rather than protest further. It would be pointless to mention that they were well out of sight of the village and no one was likely to see her. Any argument would only be grounds for trouble with Jack.</p><p>Her steps were mutinous as she climbed the few steps into the cabin and slammed the door. The heat hit her like a furnace blast, and sweat immediately dampened her brow.</p><p>Jack pounded down the steps and opened the door. A sweet cooling breeze whistled through. \u201cListen and listen good,\u201d he said in a clear, calm voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to close these doors once I\u2019ve docked. I don\u2019t want you to come out until I tell you it\u2019s safe to do so. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, still sounding calm.</p><p>Five minutes later he cut the engine. She heard footsteps on the dock and then felt the boat bounce against the tire bumper. A rush of Spanish followed between Jack and someone on the pier. It appeared to be a pleasant exchange. The boat rocked slightly when Jack jumped onto the dock.</p><p>With the insufferable heat Lorraine barely had the strength to remain upright. The table and benches were filled with papers and an assortment of clothes, which she folded and placed in the drawers. Not that her goal was to be helpful. She simply needed space to stretch out. Books littered the compact area. Bored, Lorraine glanced at a few titles and shook her head. A few sailing manuals. Techniques of war. Weapons updates. Military histories. Almost every piece of reading material had something to do with soldiering and death. For all she knew, he could be a trained killer. Talk about jumping from the frying pan into the fire! And down here, in this intolerable heat, it felt as though that was exactly what she\u2019d done.</p><p>Lorraine couldn\u2019t help wondering if her father knew about Jack\u2019s preoccupation with war and death. If he did, would he have asked Jack to get her out of the country? Lorraine doubted it.</p><p>Forty minutes passed. Forty of the longest minutes of her life. She wet a cloth and dabbed her face and wrists. Ten minutes later, she unbuttoned her blouse and fanned herself with a copy of Soldier of Fortune magazine. Jack had been gone for fifty minutes now. Every once in a while she\u2019d hear voices; her hopes would soar but then the sound would fade away. Water slapped against the side of the boat, which rocked gently in the protected waters of the marina.</p><p>At one o\u2019clock she heard the faint strains of music drifting down from what must have been a waterfront cantina. The emptiness in her stomach refused to be ignored. All she could think about was how hot and miserable she was and how hungry. Visions of salty tortilla chips and fresh salsa tormented her. Served with a tart salt-rimmed margarita... Or was that more Tex-Mex than Mexican? She wasn\u2019t sure. But they\u2019d certainly have something at this cantina. Maybe a shrimp-and-garlic dish like the one her father\u2019s...wife had made. No, she wouldn\u2019t think about them. She conjured up the memory of chicken fajitas, instead, with lots of onions and peppers....</p><p>The music grew louder. It didn\u2019t require much imagination to picture Jack sitting inside the cantina, taking his own sweet time over a big lunch, drinking a cold beer. He probably had a friendly se\u00f1orita on his lap, as well. The image was so real, so believable, she convinced herself of its truth.</p><p>Forty minutes he\u2019d said, and he\u2019d been gone longer than an hour. Lorraine couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. Not only did she intensely dislike Jack Keller, there was no reason she should trust him. Given what she\u2019d learned about her father and Azucena, how could she trust any of these people? Once again, she pushed all thoughts of her father from her mind. She didn\u2019t want to think about him, didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that Gary had been right and she\u2019d made the biggest mistake of her life in seeking out this stranger.</p><p>She\u2019d lost control of the situation by letting others make the decisions. Time to rectify that. She hadn\u2019t had anything to do with that stupid artifact, and once she explained what had happened, the authorities would believe her. They had to. Anyway, she\u2019d rather take her chances with the police than die a slow death at the hands of Jack Keller. And she couldn\u2019t tolerate this heat another minute.</p><p>Being a conscientious person, she found a pen and paper and left Jack a note.</p><p>I appreciate your help, but would prefer to have the American Consulate speak to the authorities on my behalf.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Lorraine</p><p>She propped the paper on the table with the saltshaker and reached for her purse. Then she hesitated. Most of her traveler\u2019s checks were back in her suitcase in El Mirador and she had only a small amount of cash. She couldn\u2019t very well ask a vendor in this dinky town to accept a credit card.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to discover where Jack kept his cash\u2014although she did feel guilty about rummaging through his things. This was just a small loan, she told herself. Either she\u2019d repay him herself or her father would. She peeled off a few bills and shoved them inside her purse.</p><p>Once more she hesitated, then removed her watch and set it in his drawer. Its value far exceeded the cash she\u2019d borrowed, she reasoned. She left quickly before she could change her mind.</p><p>When she opened the double doors leading to the deck, Lorraine gulped in deep breaths of the fresh cool air. Cautiously she stuck her head out and looked around.</p><p>The village was small, smaller even than El Mirador. A row of ramshackle shops lined the waterfront, but La Ruta Maya didn\u2019t seem to consist of much else. The first thing she needed to do was find someone to drive her into Campeche. Surely in a city of that size she\u2019d be able to connect with the American Embassy. Then she\u2019d tell them her story, explain how Jason Applebee had hidden the artifact in her suitcase, and the American government would clear her name and get her safely home.</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t blame her father for interceding on her behalf, but his solution had been shortsighted. Once her name was cleared, she\u2019d be free to return to El Mirador in the near future and demand some answers from her father. Then again, perhaps it would be better just to go home and forget all this.</p><p>She knew, as she climbed off Jack\u2019s boat, that she was taking a risk, but that couldn\u2019t be helped. The truth was, he\u2019d be just as glad to get rid of her. This seemed the best solution all around.</p><p>Within a few minutes of leaving the dock area, Lorraine noticed that several children had started to follow her. Not wanting to attract attention, she opened her purse, thinking to give them each a new peso and send them on their way. Her ploy didn\u2019t work. As soon as she reached for her coin purse, she was surrounded by children of every age. They pressed in around her, crowding her, all eager for a handout.</p><p>An older man barked at the children in an authoritative voice and they scattered. Lorraine thanked him with a smile and continued down the street, stopping only long enough to buy some fruit in the village marketplace. She gobbled down the fresh papaya, then purchased a tortilla filled with vegetables and meat. The meat didn\u2019t have a familiar taste, but she decided she didn\u2019t want to know exactly what she was eating. She understood turtle was popular fare in this area\u2014not a thought that appealed to her. However, at this point she was too hungry to care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With her helpful Spanish phrase book, she asked a grandmotherly woman about finding a driver who would take her to Campeche. The woman avoided eye contact and shook her head. Lorraine asked a vendor next, but he was far more interested in selling his wares than answering her questions. He held up a number of things\u2014baskets and pottery\u2014he hoped to persuade her to buy and explained two or three times in fractured English that he would give her a special rate because she was his first customer of the day. She finally extricated herself from him, then asked a third person, a young barefoot woman, who pointed Lorraine in the direction of the cantina.</p><p>On second thought, perhaps it would make more sense to contact the American Embassy by phone and not worry about hiring someone to drive her.</p><p>Lorraine flipped through the pages of her Spanish dictionary until she found the word for telephone. She felt embarrassed by how little she remembered of her high-school language class. \u201cTel\u00e9fono?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The barefoot woman grinned and nodded enthusiastically, then pointed toward the cantina again.</p> <p>Lorraine grumbled under her breath, glancing at the very place she\u2019d planned not to enter. She supposed she didn\u2019t have anything to lose. If Jack did happen to be inside, which she strongly suspected he was, she\u2019d simply explain what she\u2019d said in her note.</p><p>When she peered inside the cantina, she found\u2014to her relief and surprise\u2014that Jack Keller was nowhere to be seen. The place was stark, devoid of any decoration. It had a rough plank floor, a long wooden bar and a number of crude tables and chairs.</p><p>Four or five underdressed women glared at her when she walked in. Lorraine smiled at them, certain they could see that they had nothing to fear from her. She had no intention of cutting in on their business.</p><p>A greasy-looking man looked up from a table, where he sat with a bottle of tequila and a shot glass. He was dark and ugly, and a scar ran down one side of his face. He eyed her with the avid interest of a tomcat spying a mouse. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable sensation, but she ignored him and approached the bartender, whose frown seemed to suggest she should get out while she could.</p><p>Lorraine forced a smile. With her dictionary in hand, she asked about the phone. He shook his head. There was one attached to the wall, but apparently it was out of order. No funciona, a handwritten sign informed her. Again going through the dictionary, she painstakingly asked about hiring a driver to take her to Campeche.</p> <p>\u201cI take you to Campeche,\u201d the greasy-looking man at the table offered in heavily accented English, his voice slurred with suggestion. His chair made a scraping sound as he stood and carried the bottle and shot glass over to the bar.</p><p>Every eye in the place was on the two of them.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Lorraine said politely. She continued to look at the bartender.</p><p>\u201cYou want a driver?\u201d the man persisted. \u201cI get you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to hire a car, thank you.\u201d She returned her attention to the bartender.</p><p>Her unpleasant companion slammed the bottle down on the bar. \u201cWe have fun on the road, no?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lorraine said, refusing to look at him. He smelled evil. She\u2019d never thought such a thing was possible, but this man was the epitome of the word. The stench about him was nothing compared to the blankness in his eyes, as if he had no feelings, no sympathy, no conscience. The way he stared at her made her skin crawl.</p><p>The bartender, who\u2019d said little to this point, spoke to the man in a placating manner. Although she couldn\u2019t understand much of what was said, it seemed fairly obvious this man was feared. The bartender then appeared to suggest something involving one or more of the other women, judging by the way he motioned toward them. One thing Lorraine did pick up from the exchange was the man\u2019s name. Carlos.</p><p>Carlos\u2019s reaction to the bartender\u2019s suggestion was a blast of foul-sounding words that had the bartender fleeing to the other end of the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou come with me,\u201d Carlos said, and reached for her. \u201cWe have fun on the road to Campeche, you and me.\u201d He grinned at her as if to say she might as well enjoy it because she had no choice.</p><p>Lorraine managed to avoid his grasp. \u201cI most certainly will not.\u201d</p><p>He lunged for her a second time, but once more she was able to avoid his groping hands. Clearly Carlos was drunker than he\u2019d seemed, which was in her favor. Although he looked to be a mean drunk.</p><p>\u201cKindly keep your hands to yourself!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Carlos\u2019s response was to grab a fistful of her hair and yank hard.</p> <p>Lorraine let out a cry of shock and pain, whirled around and slapped him as hard as she could across the face. \u201cKeep your filthy hands off me!\u201d The action had been purely instinctive. She didn\u2019t know what kind of monster this man was, but she wasn\u2019t going to let him or anyone else manhandle her.</p><p>A collective gasp went through the cantina. Even Carlos was too stunned to react. Then he slapped her, hard enough to send her staggering backward. Her jaw felt as if it\u2019d been dislocated, and the pain brought stinging tears to her eyes.</p><p>He laughed, and it was the cruelest sound she\u2019d ever heard. She saw pure undiluted hate in his eyes. Holding her hand over her cheek, she took three small steps back, recognizing beyond doubt that she\u2019d crossed a dangerous line and was about to suffer the consequences.</p><p>She wanted to say something, a joke, an apology, anything to defuse the situation, but her mouth had gone dry. She could hardly force out a word.</p><p>She\u2019d made one mistake after another, but this was the most desperate yet. Two minutes ago she\u2019d walked into the cantina with a simple request and now she was staring into the eyes of a man who wanted to kill her\u2014and worse. She felt a sudden urge to yell \u201cTime out!\u201d so she could sit down and analyze what had gone wrong...and figure out how to rescue herself.</p><p>Hearing footsteps behind her, she whirled around. Her relief at seeing Jack was enough to make her knees weak.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d she whispered, closing her eyes. The one man she\u2019d been trying to elude was now going to be her salvation.</p><p>The tension between Jack and Carlos could be felt by everyone in the room. Lorraine practically ran toward Jack.</p><p>\u201cYou know this woman?\u201d Carlos asked, glaring at them through narrowed, menacing eyes.</p><p>Jack took one look at Lorraine and shrugged. \u201cNever saw her before in my life.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Generally speaking, Jack was an easygoing guy. It took a lot to rile him. But Lorraine managed to do it without so much as opening her mouth. He\u2019d returned to the boat with a case of beer balanced on his shoulder and a plate of hot food for her. The way he figured, she\u2019d been fourteen or fifteen hours without anything to eat, and a generous helping of Angelina\u2019s special chicken frijoles and rice was sure to sweeten her disposition. It had certainly improved his own.</p><p>Nothing could have shocked him more than finding her gone. By the time he read her note, he was so angry his ears burned. Jack didn\u2019t often let anyone or anything reduce him to this state. In his previous work, anger wasn\u2019t an emotion he could afford. When it happened, which was rare, he didn\u2019t plow his fist through a wall. If anything he remained stoic. His acquaintances knew well that the calmer he was, the angrier.</p><p>He could have pulled out of port then and there with a clear conscience\u2014but he hadn\u2019t. Thomas was his friend\u2014but there was a limit to what he could take. After spending a few minutes cooling down, he left his supplies piled on the dock, where the shopkeeper had delivered them, and went in search of the most irritating, infuriating, ungrateful woman he\u2019d ever met. When he found her in the cantina, he couldn\u2019t deny a certain satisfaction at discovering that she\u2019d gotten herself into real trouble.</p><p>Now he intended to see how she planned to get herself out of it. Rescuing damsels in distress was an outdated business at best, and Jack had long since decided a contemporary woman was capable of taking care of herself. If Thomas Dancy\u2019s daughter needed help, she\u2019d have to ask for it. On second thought, she\u2019d have to ask real pretty for him to get involved. One thing was certain: he was going to make her sweat it out before he stepped in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pretend you don\u2019t know me?\u201d Lorraine shouted. She thrust out her arms in supplication or in anger, he wasn\u2019t sure which. A look of astonished disbelief crossed her face.</p><p>Jack sauntered up to the bar, where he ordered a glass of tequila and a lime. After the day he\u2019d had, he needed a high-potency drink.</p><p>\u201cHe knows me.\u201d Lorraine stretched out her arm and waggled her index finger at Jack. \u201cHe might claim otherwise, but he knows me. We\u2019re traveling together.\u201d</p><p>Jack tossed back his tequila and sucked greedily on the lime.</p><p>\u201cExactly what kind of man are you?\u201d she raged, disgust written on every feature.</p><p>\u201cA thirsty one,\u201d Jack answered with a slow, lazy grin. Then, as if to prove his point, he downed a second shot and smiled at her through gritted teeth as the alcohol burned the back of his throat. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, your friend over there is welcome to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Carlos. If you were any kind of a man, you\u2019d see I\u2019m in trouble here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Did his heart good to see it, too.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He raised his glass and saluted Carlos. Lorraine knew how to pick \u2019em. Old Carlos looked like he\u2019d just as soon slit a guy\u2019s throat as sit down and have a drink with him.</p><p>Apparently Carlos didn\u2019t know what to make of the exchange between him and Lorraine. He glanced from one to the other, his head jerking back and forth in an effort to follow the conversation.</p><p>One of the prostitutes minced across the cantina toward Jack. The best-looking one of the lot, Jack was pleased to note. He collected a second glass and met her at a table.</p><p>Her smile radiated easy sex. Her eagerness for his company was a pleasant change after what he\u2019d been forced to endure with Miss High-and-Mighty. Jack pulled out a chair and sat down. Grinning, the woman sat on his lap and poured them each a drink, making sure her lush breasts grazed his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rat, Jack Keller,\u201d Lorraine yelled. Carlos half rose from his chair, obviously startled by her vehemence.</p><p>Jack yawned as though bored. \u201cSticks and stones, Raine, sticks and stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going t-to take up with that woman when you can see I\u2019ve got a problem here.\u201d</p><p>Well, yeah, she did, Jack thought. Carlos was keeping a close eye on her. He seemed more than ready to leap up and grab her if she tried to make a run for it.</p><p>\u201cHey, you got yourself into this mess,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be real interesting to watch you get yourself out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lower than low.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed and nuzzled the throat of the woman on his lap. While she might be nice-enough looking, she unfortunately smelled like cheap perfume and stale smoke. Not that he\u2019d let Lorraine know. As far as Her Highness was concerned, the other woman was a breath of fresh air. And oh, so tempting...</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Lorraine said, sounding far less certain now. \u201cIf you want me to apologize, then I will. I shouldn\u2019t have left the boat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was what he\u2019d been waiting for from the first. Jack abruptly set the woman aside and vaulted to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re damn right you shouldn\u2019t have. I asked a small thing of you. One small thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was so hot down there\u2014and you took much longer than you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much to expect you to follow directions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought...I hoped...\u201d</p> <p>They scowled at each other. Jack\u2019s expression was as angry as he could make it. His voice was raised, and while he didn\u2019t want to attract a lot of unnecessary attention, he hoped to extract her from this predicament and save his own hide in the process. From the cutthroat looks Carlos gave him, it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shout at me,\u201d Lorraine said, giving a fine impression of royalty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll shout at you if I please, and right now it pleases me a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if you\u2019d had the decency\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Carlos boomed, and banged his fist on the bar. The sound echoed through the room like a gunshot.</p> <p>Lorraine gasped and pressed her hand over her heart. For several frightening seconds the entire cantina went silent. Then, before he could react, she whirled around and faced Carlos. \u201cCan\u2019t you see we\u2019re having an important discussion here? When I\u2019m finished with Jack Keller, I\u2019ll take you on. Until then, wait your turn.\u201d</p><p>Carlos\u2019s mouth fell open, and he wore a look of complete and utter confusion.</p><p>\u201cDecency?\u201d Jack shouted, doing his best to distract Carlos from Lorraine. \u201cIf you want to talk about decency, I\u2019ve got plenty to say. Let\u2019s have this out right here and now.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine stared at him as if he\u2019d gone mad. She wasn\u2019t far off, since his little performance was a good imitation of a lunatic\u2019s ravings. Waving his arms, still shouting, he edged her toward the door. With the two of them trading insults he\u2019d be able to confuse Carlos long enough\u2014he hoped\u2014to place himself between them. And give her a way out.</p><p>Once she was close to the door, he yelled a few more insulting remarks, using the same tone of voice, hoping she was smart enough to understand what he was doing. \u201cRun,\u201d he ordered when she stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cRun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet the hell out of here!\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then turned on her heel. Okay, so it wasn\u2019t a brilliant plan, but it was the best he could do on short notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jack thought he heard her ask. Answering wasn\u2019t a concern just then. Carlos was.</p><p>The other man dashed after Lorraine, and seeing there wasn\u2019t anything he could do but stop him, Jack stepped into his path. It was a long while since he\u2019d been involved in hand-to-hand combat. This time, however, the odds left much to be desired.</p><p>Carlos had a knife and he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Lorraine was panting and her thigh muscles were quivering from the run to the waterfront. She raced to the boat, the dock rocking precariously with the sudden movement. Not sure what to do next, she hurried belowdecks and collapsed on the U-shaped bench that constituted the eating area. She could hear her pulse pounding in her ears.</p><p>This episode had been a disaster entirely of her own making. She was to blame for everything\u2014the danger to herself and to Jack, as well. When he got back, she\u2019d bet her last dollar he wouldn\u2019t be gracious about it, either. Not that she didn\u2019t deserve every comment he could possibly make. She\u2019d done something incredibly stupid, and she didn\u2019t have a single excuse. What could she say\u2014it was too hot and she\u2019d grown tired of waiting? At the moment, that sounded pretty lame.</p><p>Her pulse still hadn\u2019t returned to normal when she decided she couldn\u2019t remain down here. Not without knowing what had happened to Jack. She had to find a way to help him; after all, he\u2019d put himself at risk trying to help her. It\u2019d taken her far longer than it should have to figure out what he intended, back at the cantina, what he wanted her to do. All she hoped was that he knew how to protect himself.</p> <p>He did, she thought, reassured, as she went up to the deck. The evidence was all over the boat. Everything he read was about warfare, self-defense and fighting.</p><p>But her confidence in Jack\u2019s abilities waned as time passed. She\u2019d assumed he\u2019d be close behind her. Two, three minutes. Not so. A good ten minutes had already gone by.</p><p>Her relief at seeing him approach was enormous. He wasn\u2019t running, but he didn\u2019t seem to be taking a leisurely stroll, either. Even from the deck she could see that blood soaked his sleeve and ran in rivulets down his arm and onto his hand. One side of his face was swollen, too.</p><p>\u201cJack...Jack.\u201d Lorraine felt sick with regret, knowing he\u2019d received these injuries because of her.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d arrived at the dock, Jack broke into a trot, making it pitch precariously. When he reached Scotch on Water, he untied the rope and jumped onto the deck. Moments later the engines revved to life, churning up the water.</p><p>A flurry of Spanish came at them as Carlos and three other men appeared on the waterfront.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t bother to translate. Even with her limited knowledge of Spanish, Lorraine caught their drift, and it wasn\u2019t anything she cared to repeat.</p><p>Jack put the boat in gear, and they roared off with enough force to sink smaller boats in their wake.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t cleared the marina when Lorraine heard an odd cracking sound, as if one of the engines had backfired. She glanced over her shoulder, but before anything could register, Jack shoved her to the deck and fell heavily on top of her. The shock of his actions left her stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked when she\u2019d recovered her breath.</p><p>\u201cThat, Your Highness, was your buddy taking potshots at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShots? You mean with a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the weapon of choice for your average thug these days.\u201d Jack climbed off her, then helped her to her feet.</p><p>Once they were safely in open water, Jack cut the engines to a more comfortable speed. He stood with his hands on the wheel, staring straight ahead.</p><p>Lorraine knew the time had come to apologize, abjectly and in full. Unfortunately her tongue refused to cooperate. It shouldn\u2019t be this difficult. But Jack had the infuriating self-satisfied look of a man who knew he was right and was waiting for her to admit it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she said, instead.</p><p>He pressed the back of his hand to the corner of his mouth, then glanced at the slash on his upper arm. He arched his eyebrows as if surprised at how deep the injury was. Gingerly he tested the area and winced as his fingers probed it.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of that,\u201d Lorraine volunteered. She was about to head belowdecks for the first-aid kit she\u2019d noticed earlier.</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Jack snarled.</p><p>\u201cNo! It needs attention. I\u2019m a nurse and I should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tempting though it was, she had no intention of wasting time arguing with him. Without waiting for his approval, she went belowdecks and grabbed the kit.</p><p>He stayed at the helm and grudgingly let her tend to the wound. Lorraine thought it probably should\u2019ve had stitches, but fortunately the first-aid kit contained a number of butterfly bandages, which served almost as well. Other than a grunt now and again, Jack didn\u2019t speak while she bandaged the cut.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your face?\u201d she asked when she\u2019d finished with his arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he growled.</p><p>An ugly bruise had started to form on his chin. Examining it, Lorraine swallowed her pride. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond right away, then looked at her briefly. \u201cI see you have your watch back.\u201d</p><p>So he knew.</p><p>She\u2019d retrieved her wristwatch when she\u2019d gone below to get the first-aid kit.</p><p>\u201cDid you put the money back, too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wasn\u2019t proud of what she\u2019d done. Her face burned with embarrassment.</p><p>It had been a stupid idea\u2014another stupid idea\u2014and she sincerely regretted it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try anything like that again. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She didn\u2019t know if he was referring to her taking the money or leaving the boat. Probably both.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re getting to be a little too expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put the money back,\u201d she insisted with ill grace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the money you borrowed,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cThe supplies. This is the second time this has happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019d seen the case of beer on the table belowdecks and assumed everything else had already been loaded onto the boat.</p><p>\u201cThey got left behind on the dock.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and groaned, vaguely remembering the boxes stacked alongside the boat. \u201cBut the beer...there\u2019s a case down below. You mean to say the only thing that got on board was the beer?\u201d</p><p>Late that afternoon, Jack docked in a freshwater inlet for the night. Rio Usumacinta emptied into this cove, which was a small, sheltered one. Although he was fairly confident Carlos hadn\u2019t tried to follow them, he wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>As the sun sank in the west, Jack sat with his feet propped up, sipping from a bottle of his favorite cerveza. A smile touched his lips at the memory of Lorraine\u2019s reaction when she realized that the only thing he\u2019d managed to bring on board was the beer. The look on her face had been priceless. That expression of frustrated outrage had almost been worth the problems she\u2019d caused. Almost.</p><p>He closed his eyes, enjoying the sense of calm at the end of a day that had taken one unexpected turn after another. As far as his passenger went, he didn\u2019t like her, couldn\u2019t trust her and considered her a royal pain in the ass. Nevertheless he had to hand it to her; the woman had pluck. It wasn\u2019t everyone who could stand up to a powerful drug lord like Carlos Caracol.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t immediately figured out who Carlos was, but once he did, he realized what a lucky escape they\u2019d had. The name was one he knew well. It astonished Jack that Carlos hadn\u2019t landed behind bars before now\u2014or with a bullet in his back. He had a small band of followers and connections to a much bigger drug pipeline bringing in cocaine from other parts of Mexico and Central America. A few months ago Jack had talked to two government agents working in cooperation with the United States. Carlos\u2019s name had come up then. He was believed to be responsible for the death of a Mexican official, but nothing could be proved. The man was a known killer, but smart enough\u2014and corrupt enough\u2014to stay out of prison. He certainly wasn\u2019t the kind of enemy Jack wanted. What Carlos Caracol had been doing in a cantina in La Ruta Maya Jack couldn\u2019t begin to guess.</p><p>Remembering how Lorraine had whirled on the man and primly informed him he\u2019d have to wait his turn had been one of life\u2019s more amusing moments. Jack couldn\u2019t suppress a chuckle. He would never have left her to deal with Carlos on her own, however appealing the prospect. But it\u2019d given him a few minutes of pleasure letting her think he just might.</p><p>He\u2019d spent several years in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico now, lived a life that was the envy of his friends. Plenty of money at his disposal and not a care in the world. Yet he\u2019d felt more aware of life these past two days with Lorraine than at any time since he\u2019d inherited Scotch on Water. This annoying, priggish, straitlaced woman. Who would\u2019ve guessed? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something else troubled him. She was beginning to look good. Too good.</p><p>The sound of a gentle splash startled him. He opened his eyes and sat upright. Lorraine had taken the plunge, literally, and was swimming around in her bra and panties like a porpoise, enjoying the water. She dove under, giving him an excellent view of her nicely rounded derriere. Her legs weren\u2019t bad, either. Shapely and trim. That led him to consider other parts of her body he had no business thinking about.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s married,\u201d he muttered loudly enough to give himself a wake-up call. A fling with Lorraine was a fling with disaster, and he wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. No way was he that big a fool.</p><p>Getting too involved with any woman was a mistake, as he\u2019d already learned, but getting involved with someone else\u2019s wife... He shook his head. At least Marcie hadn\u2019t been married when he\u2019d fallen in love with her.</p> <p>\u201cHaving a good time?\u201d Jack stood and leaned against the gunwale, watching her frolic in the water.</p><p>Lorraine jerked around, her hair a froth of shampoo. She treaded water and looked up at him, blinking rapidly when the shampoo dripped into her right eye. \u201cI thought...you were asleep. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind if I used your shampoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d He crossed his ankles and assumed a more comfortable stance.</p><p>\u201cSince you were asleep and...and since we\u2019re anchored in freshwater here, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to wash my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d He covered his mouth and yawned. Still, he didn\u2019t move away, not when he could see how uncomfortable she was with him staring at her. After all, he deserved some reward for all the trouble she\u2019d caused. Embarrassing her was an entertaining activity. He wasn\u2019t going to complain about the view, either.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave woman,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBrave?\u201d She rubbed her eye, which had to be smarting by now.</p><p>\u201cMaybe fearless is a better description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFearless? If you\u2019re talking about what happened this afternoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t do this to her, but what the heck. \u201cI\u2019m talking about swimming in piranha-infested waters.\u201d</p><p>A look of sheer terror came over Lorraine. He\u2019d never seen anyone move so fast!</p> <p>Jack couldn\u2019t help it; he burst out laughing.</p><p>Thomas paced the small area outside the bedroom. Each time Azucena moaned, he had to stop himself from bursting through the bedroom door. She\u2019d been in labor for twenty hours now, far longer than with either Antonio or Hector. According to the midwife, this baby was breech and the labor had proved to be far more intense. The birth would be complicated.</p><p>Exhausted himself, Thomas could only imagine how Azucena felt. He loved her and was grateful to her for giving him back his life. For years he\u2019d gone listlessly from one insignificant job to the next, convinced that eventually something would happen to change his circumstances. For years he\u2019d believed that, somehow, Ginny and Raine would join him in Mexico. In his dream-world, he\u2019d believed that it was only a matter of time before all would be forgiven and the charges against him dropped. Then he\u2019d moved to El Mirador, been offered not just a job, but one he loved, one that meant something. He\u2019d met Azucena then, too, and his life had been blessed from that day forward.</p><p>He\u2019d loved Ginny, grieved at the news of her death, but Azucena was his future. He\u2019d married her the day before, as soon as he could arrange it. She was his wife, the mother of his sons. The thought that he might lose her now overwhelmed him.</p><p>Fear seized his lungs and he could hardly breathe. Death was said to come in threes. His legs grew so unsteady they could barely support him. He sat and buried his face in his hands.</p><p>First Ginny. Then Ernesto\u2019s body had been found at the hotel, his throat slit. The investigation had left Thomas deeply shaken. The more he learned about Jason Applebee, the more outraged he became. To a large extent, Thomas blamed himself for Ernesto\u2019s death, since he was the one who\u2019d asked the hotel proprietor to keep an eye on the American.</p><p>First Ginny, then Ernesto, and he prayed to God the third death wouldn\u2019t be Azucena.</p><p>\u201cPapa.\u201d Antonio climbed onto his lap and wrapped his small arms tightly around Thomas\u2019s neck. Thomas understood his son\u2019s need to hold on for all he was worth. In a way he was doing the same thing. He was worried sick about Azucena, and Raine was never far from his mind, either.</p> <p>He trusted Jack to see his daughter safely out of the country, but there could be unforeseen problems ahead. Jason Applebee was no novice when it came to using and abusing others. He was probably furious at having lost the stolen artifact, and furious, he\u2019d be even more dangerous. News had come by way of the radio that the half of the Kukulcan Star discovered in Raine\u2019s suitcase had been returned to the museum in Mexico City. If Jason\u2014</p><p>Azucena\u2019s scream shattered the silence and the blood drained from Thomas\u2019s face. In that moment he would have sold his soul for a doctor and a decent medical facility.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Antonio clung even harder to his father.</p><p>Thomas slid both arms around the boy and closed his eyes in silent prayer.</p><p>When she screamed again, Thomas put Antonio gently down and jumped to his feet. He threw open the bedroom door. The midwife, standing at the foot of the bed, glanced disapprovingly over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot now. Leave us. This is no place for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cThomas?\u201d</p><p>Azucena sounded so weak. \u201cShould I get the priest?\u201d he asked. Dear God, he thought again, I can\u2019t lose her. \u201cTell me! For the love of God, tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Panic set in, and he didn\u2019t wait for an answer but raced from the house, certain he was about to lose both his wife and unborn child. He didn\u2019t stop running until he reached the church. He dashed through the front doors to find the parish priest kneeling at the altar in prayer.</p><p>\u201cFather, Father,\u201d Thomas gasped, sprinting down the center aisle.</p><p>Father Garcia was well over seventy and incapable of moving quickly. Now that he had the priest\u2019s attention, Thomas wasn\u2019t sure what to tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Father Garcia asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cAzucena,\u201d he said between deep breaths. \u201cThe baby\u2019s breech.\u201d He covered his face with both hands, terrified of the future without her, and slumped to his knees at the altar.</p><p>The priest accompanied him back to the house. When Thomas opened the front door, the first thing he heard was an infant\u2019s wail. The overpowering relief that followed brought tears to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAzucena,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cAzucena.\u201d Uncaring what the midwife thought, he rushed into the bedroom to find the older woman attending to the infant. Azucena lifted her head from the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWe have a third son,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Thomas grabbed her hand and kissed it. Father Garcia walked slowly into the room, and seeing mother and child alive, he crossed himself and looked toward heaven.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d Azucena murmured so quietly he could barely hear. She wiped the tears from his face and pressed her palm to his face.</p><p>Thomas turned to look at the midwife. \u201cIs she...will she be all right?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded. \u201cYou have a fine healthy son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Thomas said, fighting back the emotion. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Jack threw back his head and howled with laughter at the sight of Lorraine thrashing through the water in her eagerness to reach the boat. His amusement increased as she sputtered at him, her head full of shampoo with bubbles dripping onto her face.</p><p>The last laugh, however, was all hers.</p><p>Madder than a mean-tempered wasp, she agilely heaved herself out of the water and into the boat. Her wet underwear left precious little to the imagination. Jack\u2019s humor quickly faded, and his throat went dry. He\u2019d been too long without a woman, he decided, if Lorraine was affecting him like this.</p><p>With a wedding band on her finger, she was strictly off-limits. He wasn\u2019t interested in an affair, however brief. His love life had been robust for a number of years, with only one hard-and-fast rule.</p><p>No married women.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>Jack was a good-looking guy and he knew it. Girls had started flocking to him from the time he was in junior high. There\u2019d never been a shortage of single women, and frankly, he wasn\u2019t interested in creating unnecessary enemies. Like husbands. In addition, this was the daughter of a friend. A good friend, who trusted him to get her safely back to the United States.</p><p>One look at Lorraine\u2019s full breasts and the shapely curve of her hips glistening in the light from the setting sun, and the hard-and-fast rule was becoming merely a guideline. He couldn\u2019t make himself turn away. Damn, she was beautiful. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t noticed earlier. Anyone could see that, prissy attitude aside, she was gorgeous. But Jack had forced himself not to respond...until now. He\u2019d done a convincing job of pretending he wasn\u2019t aware of her, hiding the attraction behind a barrage of insults. The questions about her love life had been an ill-advised attempt to remind himself that she was off-limits.</p><p>Then it hit him. Hard. He wanted her. Without any trouble whatsoever, he could envision her in his arms...and his bed. It was so easy to imagine her smiling up at him....</p><p>A cold sweat broke out on his brow. He rubbed his eyes to dispel the image of Lorraine in his bed while he struggled to breathe evenly. He instructed himself to remember the nameless woman in Belize and Catherina Efrain, a woman he\u2019d had a brief fling with a year or two earlier. He\u2019d met her when she was on vacation in Campeche and was later surprised to learn she worked for the Mexican government. Thinking about Catherina helped\u2014but not enough.</p><p>Being stuck with Lorraine in the close confines of the boat wasn\u2019t going to make things any more tolerable. Jack had to forcefully\u2014and repeatedly\u2014remind himself of something that, until now, had been instinctive.</p><p>Lorraine was hands-off.</p><p>Squinting and muttering, she swept her shampoo-coated hair away from her face and glared in his direction. The effect was somewhat undermined by the rapid blinking of one eye. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any piranhas here, are there?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She stretched out her arm, groping for a towel. Apparently she\u2019d brought it from belowdecks before she entered the water.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d he returned, his voice rough. Whatever wit he\u2019d once possessed had vanished while he struggled to disguise the effect she\u2019d had on him.</p><p>\u201cOh-h-h,\u201d she groaned, stumbling blindly around.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t figure out what she was doing. It took all his self-control not to stare openmouthed while she paraded half-nude in front of him. He finally realized she was searching for a bucket. Now that she\u2019d found one, she leaned over the gunwale, presenting him with yet another blood-stirring view....</p><p>Jack slammed his eyes shut while she lowered the bucket over the side, then opened them just in time to watch her pour the water directly over her head. Lather and suds cascaded down her body.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d she shrieked. She reached for the towel, burying her face in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEcstatic.\u201d</p><p>Furious, she whirled around and in her rush stubbed her toe. She gasped in pain, then grabbed her foot, hopping madly around on the other. \u201cDarn, darn, darn!\u201d she cried between small intermittent groans.</p><p>\u201cDarn?\u201d Jack couldn\u2019t believe his ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with darn?\u201d She scowled at him as if he\u2019d purposely dropped an anvil on her precious foot.</p> <p>\u201cYou stubbed your toe, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, biting down on her lower lip. She leaned against the side of the boat and carefully examined her big toe for damage.</p><p>\u201cDarn\u2019s the best you can do?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes questioning. \u201cDo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your strongest swearword?\u201d</p> <p>She frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m gonna have to give you lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to teach me anything,\u201d she said furiously.</p><p>\u201cDarn?\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he found this so hilarious. Probably because he needed something to take his mind off how incredibly sexy she looked. She continued to frown at him. The longer she frowned, the more amused he became.</p><p>His laugh began as a small sarcastic chuckle.</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s eyes narrowed with outrage. \u201cYou\u2019re extremely rude, do you know that?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed harder. \u201cDarn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, you\u2019re impossible.\u201d She wrapped the towel around her waist and walked away from him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a good teacher,\u201d he called after her. \u201cWe\u2019ll start off with the basic four-letter words, then work our way up to the more complicated phrases. By the time you\u2019re back in the States, I\u2019ll have you saying things that would make a longshoreman blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you enjoy making fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d Still grinning, he wiped the mirth from his face. His reaction was way out of proportion, but it was either laugh or risk kissing her\u2014which was the one thing he couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Lorraine paused and glanced at him over her shoulder, then sadly shook her head and disappeared belowdecks.</p><p>Jack heard her rummaging around. Thinking he\u2019d made a narrow escape, he settled down in his chair and congratulated himself on his restraint.</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t understand Jack Keller. Furthermore, she had no intention of trying. As far as she was concerned, he was a Neanderthal. She waited until her underwear was almost dry before she put her linen suit back on. Then she ran a comb through her tangled hair, wincing as she encountered one snarl after another. The man was impossible. Impossible! He\u2019d purposely terrified her with that comment about piranhas. Like an idiot, she\u2019d believed him.</p> <p>Apparently just scaring her wasn\u2019t enough. He\u2019d taken great delight in ridiculing her, as well. And then offering to teach her to swear! Her mother had claimed swearing was the sign of a poor vocabulary; Lorraine herself considered it in bad taste.</p><p>The way he\u2019d laughed made her clench her hands and yank the comb hard, bringing tears to her eyes. Just when she was beginning to have kind thoughts about him, too. Still, she had to admit she didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened if he hadn\u2019t intervened with that horrible man. He\u2019d helped her even knowing she\u2019d taken his money.</p><p>Jack, being Jack, had made sure she knew that he knew what she\u2019d done. But he hadn\u2019t gone on and on about it. She almost wished he had; it would make hating him easier.</p><p>One moment she was feeling warm and generous toward him, the next she felt outraged by his obnoxious behavior. The man was puzzling, and her reactions to him equally so. She hated him, despised him, and yet she\u2019d deliberately flaunted herself in front of him, making sure he got a good look at her body. Her skin went hot, then cold, as she owned up to the truth of what she\u2019d done. She\u2019d actually wanted him to kiss her. Touch her. She disapproved of flirting with a man this way, and it really wasn\u2019t like her. While she wasn\u2019t married as he believed, she was engaged and she owed her loyalty to her fianc\u00e9. Lorraine didn\u2019t understand her own behavior any more than she understood Jack\u2019s. Perhaps it had something to do with what had happened back at the cantina. He\u2019d saved her in a situation that might have been life or death. A shiver ran down her spine whenever she thought about it.</p><p>Had she been able to find a means of making herself comfortable, Lorraine would have remained below. Spending any additional time in Jack\u2019s company was too risky, in too many ways. But once she\u2019d gathered her courage, she climbed back to the main deck to discover Jack poring over sea charts by the light of a gas lantern.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we headed next?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPucuro.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine glanced down at the table, hoping to find the place Jack had mentioned.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pointing his finger at the notation on the map. \u201cWe need supplies. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Seeing that he\u2019d already purchased supplies twice, this probably wasn\u2019t a good time to complain that he never consulted her regarding their plans. If it hadn\u2019t been for his rather unappetizing leftover fish and the plate of food he\u2019d brought on board in La Ruta Maya, they\u2019d be starving by now.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave at first light and reach Pucuro around noon tomorrow. I need your word of honor that you\u2019ll do exactly as I say when we get there. I want you to stay out of sight this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Lorraine. I can\u2019t have you sneaking off again. Not in Pucuro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already gave you my word. What more do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to spell it out.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as if he distrusted her, which offended Lorraine\u2014but then again, she\u2019d given him ample cause. Speaking slowly and clearly, she said, \u201cI promise I will stay belowdecks. I will not come up until you tell me the coast is clear.\u201d Literally, she thought. For the first time in her life, that expression described the actual truth.</p><p>\u201cPucuro isn\u2019t like La Ruta Maya. I\u2019ve been there once before and...\u201d He paused, leaving the remainder unsaid.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she urged, wanting him to continue. She needed to know what they were getting themselves into.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous there. Pucuro is the last place I\u2019d normally take a woman,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have any choice. We need to stop somewhere, and soon.\u201d He sounded none too pleased by that fact.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take you to get what we need?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour, tops,\u201d he replied, then tagged on a question of his own. \u201cHave you ever fired a weapon?\u201d</p><p>Her breathing went shallow at the thought. \u201cYou mean...a gun? No, never.\u201d</p><p>His response was an irritated sigh.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get mad about it. I\u2019ve never even held a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was afraid of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to learn, either.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes were cold and serious. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might make light of a great many things, but I don\u2019t joke about guns.\u201d</p><p>He hurried belowdecks, returning a moment later with a small gun. \u201cThis is an automatic Glock .22. You might need to defend yourself when we\u2019re in Pucuro. I want to step off this boat knowing that if anything goes wrong, you can take care of yourself. Understand? When we finish with that, I\u2019ll show you how to run the boat on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cFirst, I don\u2019t need a gun to defend myself, and second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need the gun.\u201d His voice left no room for argument.</p><p>\u201cJack, this is ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to learn how to fire this weapon, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, looking down at it distastefully.</p><p>Under protest, she listened as he explained the inner workings of the gun. When he\u2019d done that, he demonstrated how to load the thing. Then he expected her to do it herself.</p><p>Lorraine finally complied, but not happily. He ignored her complaints, making her repeat the procedure until he was satisfied that she\u2019d learned what he wanted her to know.</p><p>\u201cNext I want you to fire it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d The idea of actually shooting was repugnant to her. Besides, she didn\u2019t even have a target to aim for.</p><p>\u201cRaine, this isn\u2019t open for discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she muttered. She stepped back and waited for him to reveal the finer techniques of handling a gun.</p><p>\u201cHold it,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI already did.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and, sighing heavily, she reached for the weapon.</p><p>\u201cI want you to get the feel of it,\u201d he explained. \u201cBalance it in your hands, get accustomed to the weight of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that earlier.\u201d She hadn\u2019t, not really. She wasn\u2019t usually so disagreeable, but Jack seemed to bring out the worst in her. The fact that he was standing this close bothered her, too. Her heart beat a loud thudding tattoo; she was sure he could hear it. And she was so hot. Even with her hair piled on top of her head, sweat trickled down the back of her neck. Jack was sweating, too. His skin glistened with it in the moonlight. She found him far more provocative than she wanted. Now that he\u2019d shaved she recognized that he was far too attractive for his own good\u2014or hers.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to fire?\u201d he snapped, cutting off her musings.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right, if it\u2019ll make you happy.\u201d She stretched out both arms and took aim at the dark ocean.</p><p>Jack moved directly behind her. His arms came around hers and his hands supported her wrists. Lorraine drew in a deep breath at the way her body reacted. For one mad second she actually forgot about the gun in her hand. Instead, she felt the warmth of his body against hers, his taut muscles and solid strength. She had to struggle to pay attention to what he was saying. He seemed to be losing patience with her, because his directions became clipped and short.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cpull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine gently squeezed.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d he said close to her ear. Too close.</p><p>She shut her eyes and squeezed the trigger again.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes open,\u201d he barked.</p><p>She opened them at precisely the moment the automatic fired. Lorraine reeled with the unexpected force of the discharge. She might have toppled if not for Jack, who stopped her fall. His hands caught her sides, shockingly close to her breasts\u2014and lingered far longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cI...I did it,\u201d she announced breathlessly. She cleared her throat and spoke again. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to fire it once more just to be sure you\u2019re comfortable with it?\u201d Jack didn\u2019t sound like himself, either.</p><p>\u201cNo...I\u2019ve got the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re positive?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine nodded and had the inexplicable feeling that she\u2019d had more than one lucky escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was almost noon the next day when they approached Pucuro. Jack ordered Lorraine belowdecks long before they reached the harbor. He didn\u2019t want to take the slightest chance of anyone\u2019s seeing her. He hadn\u2019t come right out and said it, but Pucuro was full of cutthroats and thieves. However, it was either stop here or waste another day searching for some other little out-of-the-way port.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Lorraine stood on the steps below, the wind tousling her hair. Jack was hard-pressed to remember any woman looking more beautiful than she did right then.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He made himself sound short-tempered.</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible...for you to pick me up a few clothes while you\u2019re in town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny particular color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYellow\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She disappeared, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Jack maneuvered the boat toward the docks, which were old and ramshackle. A number of small boats were tied up there. He noticed a couple of disreputable-looking young men who studied him as though trying to estimate how easy it would be to take him on. Jack met their stares until both glanced away. An edgy feeling came over him as they hurriedly left.</p> <p>With no one in the vicinity to hear, Jack knocked lightly on the bulkhead and told Lorraine, \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quick, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I shouldn\u2019t be more than thirty minutes.\u201d He was well aware how uncomfortable it was for her belowdecks. Soon it would be stifling.</p><p>He was about to leave, then decided to give her one last warning. \u201cYou need to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Just go, okay?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. The feeling was back, and experience had taught him not to ignore his gut. Unfortunately he had to go into town; there were few other alternatives. It\u2019d been many hours since they\u2019d eaten and they couldn\u2019t go much longer without supplies.</p> <p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Lorraine\u2019s loud whisper came up from below.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. Just sit tight.\u201d He didn\u2019t like leaving her, but he had no choice. \u201cOne final reminder. Don\u2019t fire the gun unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Understand?\u201d The last thing he needed was her using it as a signal to remind him to pick up coffee.</p><p>When he\u2019d jumped onto the wharf, Jack had to watch where he stepped. The wood had rotted in quite a few places. As quickly as he could, he headed in the direction of the town\u2019s only store. Supplies were outrageously priced, but for once Jack wasn\u2019t going to quibble. He wanted in and out of Pucuro, no questions asked.</p><p>It went without saying that he wasn\u2019t fond of the town. His first and only visit to Pucuro, a number of years ago, had nearly gotten him killed. He\u2019d been part of Deliverance Company, and Murphy had sent him on a fact-finding mission. Fool that he was, Jack had gotten the information he needed, then lingered in the cantina. That had been his first mistake.</p><p>He\u2019d decided to stay for a glass of beer when he noticed a woman across the room. The look she gave him wasn\u2019t unfamiliar. She was interested and frankly, after several months of celibacy, so was he. Cain had insisted that when his men were on a mission, they keep their pants zipped. Only Cain wasn\u2019t in charge anymore, Murphy was. Jack had made a classic mistake. He\u2019d gone home with the pretty se\u00f1orita.</p><p>Not until it was too late did he realize he\u2019d walked into a trap.</p><p>Jack shook his head, hoping to rid himself of the memory, although he carried the scars of that mistake on his body. By the time Deliverance Company found him, he was half-dead. The half that was still alive wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>Now he kept his eyes focused straight ahead, talked to no one and hurried down the dirt road to the store. He finished buying his supplies in record time and paid an exorbitant amount to make sure they were immediately loaded onto the boat. That done, he walked into town to visit the open-air market. Instead of purchasing clothes that were expressly female, he bought a couple of shirts and a pair of cotton pants. He had to guess at size.</p> <p>Jack was beginning to feel downright smug. Perhaps Lorraine was right and he was overreacting. The entire venture had taken all of fifteen minutes. He was walking back to the waterfront when a youngster of seven or eight raced to his side.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d he said, looking up at Jack with wide brown eyes. \u201cYour lady friend sent me to find you.\u201d He spoke in Spanish.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack was going to kill Lorraine with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cShe needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to need me, all right,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll take you to her.\u201d The boy slipped his hand in Jack\u2019s. \u201cThis way,\u201d he said, steering Jack down a narrow lane.</p><p>One request\u2014stay put. That was all he\u2019d asked of her. The woman couldn\u2019t follow the simplest instruction. By the time he got through with her, she\u2019d\u2014 His thoughts came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>The sensation he\u2019d experienced earlier\u2014the bad feeling\u2014returned. Except that it was far stronger than before.</p><p>Slowly, with care, Jack turned around.</p><p>Carlos stood at the far end of the street. \u201cHello, amigo. We meet again.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>The heat belowdecks was intolerable, but Lorraine was determined to prove to Jack that she was capable of following instructions. Under no circumstances was she to leave the boat; he\u2019d made her promise. Not that he had anything to worry about. Lorraine had learned her lesson in La Ruta Maya.</p><p>Despite the heat and discomfort, she would prove to him once and for all that she was a woman of her word.</p><p>The waiting was as unbearable as the suffocating heat. The first hour was the worst, holed up in this tomb with only her thoughts to occupy her\u2014and those were of little comfort. Her mother had lived a lie and her father... Lorraine didn\u2019t know what to think. She felt angry every time she recalled how he\u2019d passed off the Mayan woman as his housekeeper. When she wasn\u2019t brooding about her parents and the mistakes they\u2019d made, her thoughts took a natural path to Gary. Their relationship had undergone a change in the weeks since her mother\u2019s funeral. Gary sensed it, too.</p><p>Lorraine loved him, planned to marry him, but after her mother died, all she\u2019d wanted was to be alone. Gary had yearned to comfort her; he\u2019d wanted her to need him. She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Then there was this awful attraction she felt for Jack. Of all the things tormenting her right now, that was perhaps the worst. Her face burned with humiliation as she remembered flaunting herself in front of him. Not since high school had she worked that hard to get a member of the opposite sex to notice her.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. The waiting seemed to go on forever and she felt listless and weak. Jack had promised he\u2019d be quick. Thirty minutes. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d said?</p><p>Then it occurred to her that something had happened to him. He\u2019d been gone well over an hour at this point, despite his insistence that Pucuro wasn\u2019t a port where he was inclined to linger. She imagined all the horrible possibilities\u2014he\u2019d been attacked, accidentally injured, arrested\u2014until she was convinced something had gone dreadfully wrong.</p><p>Then it occurred to her that maybe Jack wasn\u2019t coming back at all. He didn\u2019t like her. He\u2019d let her know it, too. Nor had he restrained himself from telling her, at every conceivable opportunity, that he considered her a pain in the butt.</p><p>Even now, she remembered his look of disdain when her father had brought her down to the waterfront. His attitude hadn\u2019t changed much.</p><p>No, she mused, reasoning away the fear. Jack might want to abandon her, but he wouldn\u2019t leave his boat. He\u2019d be back. Unless\u2014her imagination kicked in again\u2014unless he\u2019d run into trouble.</p><p>The panic rose in the back of her throat, nearly choking off her breath. If something had gone wrong, he might need her help. Not knowing what to do, she paced his cramped living quarters, more convinced with every passing minute that she needed to take some sort of action on his behalf.</p><p>Her hand was on the door, ready to pull it open, when she came up with yet another possibility. This might be a test to prove that she could be trusted. It\u2019d be just like him to force her to demonstrate her dependability. For all she knew, he could be sitting on the wharf this very minute, waiting to see how long she\u2019d keep her promise.</p><p>Well, if he wanted proof, she\u2019d darn well give it to him.</p><p>Determined not to act on her instincts, she sat back down. Hell could freeze over before she\u2019d leave this boat.</p><p>Her determination lasted all of ten minutes.</p><p>Fears followed doubts, and with the doubts came questions. How long should she wait for Jack to return? What if she passed out in the heat? What if he was injured and had no way of letting her know? Maybe he was in jail. Or the morgue. The inventory of less-than-comforting possibilities began to mount again.</p><p>Just when Lorraine was sure she\u2019d go mad, she heard voices. Faint at first, then louder and more distinct. Listening carefully, she realized there were two, possibly three men, speaking in Spanish. They were on the dock right next to the boat. A minute later the boat tilted and there was the sound of footsteps on the boat itself.</p><p>Could Jack be with them?</p><p>She was about to call up and ask, then remembered that Jack had specifically told her to stay belowdecks until he personally came for her. Then and only then was she to show herself.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell exactly how many people were on the boat\u2014two men or three. It was difficult to distinguish voices. Two seemed to do most of the talking, but she thought she\u2019d heard three separate sets of footsteps. The two who did the talking were having some kind of argument.</p><p>The door leading belowdecks rattled. Lorraine froze and thanked God she\u2019d had the sense to lock it earlier.</p><p>The argument escalated. The men argued back and forth, but as far as she could tell nothing had been decided.</p><p>She continued to listen and to wait. There was movement above; the boat swayed repeatedly as the men climbed on and off. She heard boxes or containers set down heavily\u2014they must be carrying the supplies on board. One question remained, though: Where had Jack gone?</p><p>Then there was silence, but she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d left the boat. Her breathing grew shallow as she listened intently. After a while, she heard bottles being opened. They\u2019d probably found Jack\u2019s stash of beer and were helping themselves.</p><p>The boat pitched sharply to one side as the men clambered off and trudged down the dock. Their loud boisterous voices slowly faded.</p><p>Lorraine wasn\u2019t sure which was worse\u2014not knowing what had happened to Jack or the waiting. Feeling weak and disoriented, she laid her head down on the table and closed her eyes.</p><p>She might have drifted off to sleep, but she didn\u2019t think so. The next thing she heard was footsteps. A single pair this time.</p><p>Jack.</p><p>She bolted upright as relief rushed through her. Everything was fine. He was back. Almost immediately her exhilaration turned to anger. Keeping her waiting like this had been a rotten thing to do. He\u2019d done it on purpose, too; she just knew it. He was punishing her for what had happened in La Ruta Maya.</p><p>Well, she had every intention of letting him know exactly what she thought of that. By the time she finished with him, he\u2019d be more than happy to get rid of her\u2014but no happier than she was to get rid of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Opening the door, she paused long enough to draw a breath of fresh cool air into her starving lungs, then climbed out. She marched purposely onto the deck. She could hear the sound of the boat\u2019s twin engines purring contentedly in the background. That Neanderthal was about to pull out of port without letting her know he\u2019d come back! Why should she be surprised? This was typical of everything else he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cIt took you long enough,\u201d she raged\u2014then nearly swallowed her tongue in shock.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Jack who\u2019d come on board, but Carlos.</p><p>Lorraine gasped and remembered too late that she\u2019d left the gun belowdecks.</p> <p>Gary Franklin was worried. He hadn\u2019t heard from Lorraine since she\u2019d gone on this crazy trip to Mexico. To his way of thinking, there was something strange about the entire business. She\u2019d been so desperate to find out everything she could about her father she\u2019d refused to listen to him, refused to be reasonable.</p><p>At one time Lorraine would have heeded his advice, but everything had changed when her mother died. Now he sometimes felt he didn\u2019t know her at all. He tried to be patient, although it was increasingly difficult. After her mother\u2019s death she\u2019d withdrawn completely into herself, blocking out the world\u2014and that included him. Frankly it had hurt; he\u2019d wanted to comfort her, to hold her in his arms and help her through her grief. But she wouldn\u2019t allow it. He\u2019d finally realized it wasn\u2019t anything personal. Lorraine might not have wanted him, but she hadn\u2019t wanted anyone else, either.</p><p>Virginia\u2019s death had devastated her, of course; it had been a shock to him, too. He\u2019d heard all the mother-in-law jokes and laughed with the rest, but Virginia wasn\u2019t like that. Wouldn\u2019t have been like that, he corrected himself. She was gone now. The wedding was still set for late autumn, and he figured the sooner they were married, the better.</p><p>Lorraine needed him more than ever, and he loved her. At thirty-six, he\u2019d waited longer than most men he knew before deciding to make the leap into matrimony. He\u2019d been looking for the right woman; at least that was what he\u2019d told his parents. It wasn\u2019t a lie, but it wasn\u2019t the full truth.</p><p>Unlike his peers, he hadn\u2019t felt any urge to settle down. To put it like that made him sound immature, which wasn\u2019t the case, either. He happened to enjoy his freedom. But he felt it was time he got married, and he and Lorraine were compatible in the ways that mattered. They liked the same things, believed in the same causes. Both were sensible and not easily swayed by popular opinion. He liked an orderly world; so did she.</p> <p>Gary leaned back in his office chair and clasped his hands behind his head. Lorraine had given him the phone number where she could be reached, with the understanding that she preferred to contact him and not the other way around.</p><p>This was one of the traits that irked Gary about his fianc\u00e9e. She could be uncompromising. Occasionally she seemed a little too quick to form an opinion and cling to it. While he admired her straightforward manner, there were times he wished she\u2019d been more willing to bend. Still, he had faith in her common sense. Despite his uneasiness, he supposed she\u2019d manage all right, even in some out-of-the-way Mexican village.</p><p>His phone pealed, and Gary reached for the receiver. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGary, it\u2019s Marjorie Ellis.\u201d The woman hesitated as if she expected a reaction.</p><p>Gary didn\u2019t give her one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the road right now, but I\u2019ve got a couple of questions for you, if you have the time.\u201d</p> <p>Marjorie was new on the job and needed some guidance. A whole lot of guidance, if the truth be known. Their company, Med-X, sold medical supplies and equipment to hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, nursing homes and the like. Gary had been in the field for ten years and had recently accepted a management position.</p><p>Marjorie, who\u2019d been hired as his replacement, lacked almost every skill he considered crucial to the job. She was disorganized. She wasn\u2019t punctual. Her computer skills were inadequate, and he had to explain things three and four times before she grasped them. What redeemed Marjorie Ellis was the fact that Med-X clients loved her. That was surprising, but he couldn\u2019t argue with success. Two months on the job, and she\u2019d outsold every other trainee in the company. Now that was impressive.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need to know?\u201d Gary asked, keeping his tone friendly and helpful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d probably be best if I came into the office and we talked about it. That is, if you have the time,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Time was something Gary had plenty of, now that Lorraine was away. \u201cNot a problem.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this afternoon at four convenient?\u201d</p><p>He flipped noisily through the pages of his appointment calendar, doing his best to make sure she heard it. He already knew the slot was open. No use letting Marjorie think he wasn\u2019t a busy man, though. \u201cDoes four-thirty work for you?\u201d</p><p>Gary heard the rustle of papers in the background and suspected she\u2019d dropped a file. \u201cSure,\u201d Marjorie said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Her voice was faint. Gary could picture her with the cell phone tucked under her chin while she bent to retrieve the spilled paperwork. Typical.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d As he replaced the receiver, Gary realized how true that was. Marjorie was a ditz with plenty of...well, ditzy moments, but she was also likable and had a delightful easy laugh.</p><p>Without Lorraine, he was actually lonely. He missed her and somehow doubted she missed him with the same intensity. An hour in Marjorie\u2019s company\u2014even if he had to explain the same computer program half a dozen times\u2014would at least be a distraction.</p><p>Carlos intended to kill her. Lorraine knew it the minute she saw him. She looked wildly around, hoping someone would see her plight and help\u2014or send for the police. There was no one, and even if there\u2019d been people nearby, she wasn\u2019t sure they would have risked becoming involved.</p><p>Slowly, as if he enjoyed the anticipation, Carlos advanced toward her. For every step he took, she retreated one until her back was against the bulkhead. His breath made her want to gag, but she refused to show her terror, refused to flinch.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded with false bravado.</p><p>\u201cI come to teach you a lesson.\u201d His smile vanished, and using both hands, Carlos ripped apart her blouse, sending the buttons flying.</p><p>Lorraine gasped at the unexpectedness of his action and attempted to knee him but missed. Her knee wasn\u2019t her only means of defense, however, and recovering quickly, she clawed her long nails down his face, leaving bloody streaks.</p><p>Carlos backhanded her with enough force to split her lip. Blood filled her mouth and she spit at him. He might rape and kill her, but she wouldn\u2019t make it easy.</p><p>A shout came from the dock and she caught a glimpse of Jack. Jack. Thank God. It hadn\u2019t registered at first, but if Carlos had reached her, he must have either killed or injured Jack.</p><p>At the sound of Jack\u2019s voice, Carlos glanced over his shoulder and cursed loudly. He grabbed for a gun tucked in his belt behind his back and would have fired if Lorraine hadn\u2019t acted immediately. Using the full weight of her body, she threw herself against his side.</p><p>The gun fired, then flew out of Carlos\u2019s hand, landing on the deck. The bullet went wide, and Jack leaped aboard Scotch on Water, rocking the boat fiercely.</p><p>Without hesitation, the two men dove at each other like wild beasts tearing into a fresh kill. Lorraine nearly tripped over the boxes of supplies as she scrambled to get out of the way. Arms and legs flailed and barely escaped hitting her. She danced a complete circle around the men, looking for a chance to assist Jack.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, she jumped on Carlos\u2019s back and wrapped her arms around his neck as tightly as she could in an amateurish endeavor to strangle him. He tossed her off almost effortlessly. She hit the side of her head when she landed, and for a moment saw stars.</p><p>Stunned, she sat and waited for her vision to clear, then struggled to her feet. Refusing to stand by and do nothing, she reached for the bucket. If she could clobber Carlos over the head with it, or better yet put it on his head, she might actually be able to help. Unfortunately he wouldn\u2019t hold still and she ended up chasing him around the deck, pail in hand, ready to act once the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>Jack proved an able-bodied combatant, but Carlos outweighed him by forty or fifty pounds. He, too, seemed to be an expert at hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>\u201cThe gun!\u201d Jack shouted at Lorraine. \u201cGet the gun.\u201d</p><p>Of course. That made perfect sense and would be a great deal more help to him than chasing after Carlos with a yellow rubber bucket. Adrenaline pumping, she hurried below for the Glock .22 he\u2019d given her.</p><p>As she disappeared she heard Jack curse. Frantic, she grabbed the weapon from its hiding place and checked to make sure it was loaded. Then, her hands trembling so badly she could hardly manage it, she released the safety and climbed back to the main deck.</p><p>It didn\u2019t dawn on her until a shot rang out that Jack hadn\u2019t been referring to the gun belowdecks but the one she\u2019d knocked away from Carlos. The one that had just been fired.</p><p>The sound was like an explosion that echoed in her ears long afterward. She prayed with all her might that it was Carlos who\u2019d been hit. Not Jack, please, not Jack.</p><p>But God hadn\u2019t heard her desperate plea. When she reappeared on deck, she found Jack lying in a pool of blood. He stared sightlessly up at the sky, unmoving.</p><p>Jack, who\u2019d put himself in harm\u2019s way to protect her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed. She didn\u2019t hesitate as she leveled the weapon she held at Carlos. \u201cYou dirty son of a bitch,\u201d she sobbed, thinking Jack would be proud of her. Because she\u2019d advanced beyond darn.</p><p>Blindly she fired the gun. Once, twice. Again and then again. The first bullet knocked the weapon out of his hand. He roared in anger and sprang back. The second shot grazed his shoulder. The next two went wide.</p><p>Lorraine paused and aimed more carefully, figuring that if she\u2019d hit him once she could do it again.</p><p>Her calm determination must have frightened him. With a cry of outrage, Carlos jumped overboard. Lorraine would have shot him in the water if not for the men racing toward the waterfront, shouting and waving guns. A bullet bored into the wood next to her head as two men pointed their weapons at her from the wharf.</p><p>Acting purely on instinct, she reached for the boat\u2019s throttle and shoved it forward. The powerful engines heaved and roared, but didn\u2019t budge. Groaning with frustration and fear, she pushed them into full power as Jack had showed her earlier. Again nothing happened. Then, all at once, the boat surged forward with such force she was nearly hurled overboard. Her grip on the wheel was what saved her.</p><p>Something didn\u2019t feel right, but she didn\u2019t have time to discern what it was until they were safely at sea. As they headed out, she looked back and realized what had happened.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t untied Scotch on Water. Behind her, she towed the entire dock and every other boat in town.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Rather than deal immediately with the problem of the attached dock, Lorraine set the course of Scotch on Water toward open sea. Leaving the helm, she ran over to Jack. His blood slicked the deck. Falling on her knees, she searched frantically for a pulse. Relief and gratitude surged through her at the strong steady beat she could feel against her fingertips. He was alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered as tears stung her eyes. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Her medical training had been extensive, but she\u2019d never had to deal with a gunshot wound. She trembled, mentally reviewing emergency procedures.</p><p>The bullet had entered Jack\u2019s shoulder, and when she tore aside his shirt, she saw that the wound still bled profusely. She also realized he was close to going into shock. Getting to her feet, she went below and grabbed a pillow, blankets, clean towels.</p><p>She settled the pillow beneath his shoulders, wrapped him snugly from stomach to feet in the blankets, then pressed a towel to the wound, holding it firmly in place. Once the bleeding had slowed, she was able to examine the wound more carefully. Fortunately the bullet hadn\u2019t struck his chest, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about his lungs. Nor had it severed an artery.</p> <p>One step at a time, she reminded herself. One tiny step at a time. You can do this. You can do this. She repeated the words like a mantra, hoping they\u2019d bolster her confidence. The last thing Jack needed now was for her to panic.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she sobbed, brushing the unruly hair from his forehead. She blamed herself; if she\u2019d gotten the right gun, none of this would\u2019ve happened. She could have saved Jack. Instead, he might die and it would be all her fault.</p><p>She refused to dwell on her own fears and regrets. What she had to concentrate on now was helping Jack, following the right procedures...not failing him again. Blessedly he was unconscious; at least now she could do whatever was necessary. She forced herself to think. Closing her eyes, she sat back on her heels and continued to stroke his face while she considered her options. She decided to start by probing the wound to determine exactly where the bullet was and how deep it lay. She hated to use something as crude as a filleting knife, but what else was there? That was when she remembered the compact sewing kit she carried in her purse.</p><p>She lingered for a moment, not wanting to leave him, then hurried belowdecks.</p><p>After setting a pan of water on the stove to boil, she dumped the contents of her purse on the mattress. Her wallet, passport, a pen and her cosmetic bag tumbled out, together with the miniature sewing kit. She yanked it open and extracted the small scissors. What she really needed was tweezers.</p> <p>She had a pair, she remembered, experiencing a sense of exhilaration. Her cosmetic bag. She kept one there, or had in years past. She pulled open the zippered bag and emptied it onto the bed. A wrapped tampon, her compact, lipstick and blush bounced on the mattress and scattered among her other things. When she shook the bag, her eyebrow pencil, lip liner and something round and gold followed, along with the tweezers.</p><p>She took the tweezers and the small scissors, and put them both in the pan of boiling water, leaving them there for several minutes to sterilize. While she waited, she rummaged through the cupboards, certain she\u2019d seen a bottle of scotch in an earlier search.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried in triumph when she found it.</p><p>Tucking it under one arm, she carried the pan of boiling water in both hands and returned to Jack.</p><p>Feeling relatively confident that no one was chasing them\u2014it seemed unlikely, since she\u2019d towed every boat in town\u2014Lorraine shut off the engines. She stared in dismay at the bobbing dock and the string of boats. Actually, her lack of forethought had been a godsend. She\u2019d inadvertently deprived their pursuers of any way to follow them. She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as she leaned over the side and untied Scotch on Water, leaving the dock and its attached boats to drift away of their own accord.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, she readied Jack as much as possible and prepared herself for the coming ordeal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check to see where the bullet is,\u201d she told him, then explained that it might be necessary to leave it inside if she couldn\u2019t remove it easily. Again she touched his face. For whatever reason, touching him comforted her and calmed her frazzled nerves. Her mouth was dry and her throat thick with fear.</p><p>As gently as possible, she lifted the blood-soaked towel from his left shoulder and poured a liberal dose of alcohol on the wound. Then, feeling she needed a bit of fortification herself, she took a deep swig. The scotch burned through her, but the jolt was exactly what she needed. She secured the top and set the bottle aside.</p><p>Inhaling a shaky breath, she studied Jack\u2019s pale expressionless face. She tried to imagine what he\u2019d say if he could speak to her. No doubt there\u2019d be a few curses, an insult or two\u2014and gruff reassurance. Biting her lower lip, Lorraine prayed for guidance and a sure hand.</p><p>The hot tweezers scalded her skin, but she forced herself to grip them tightly, afraid they might slip. She dug carefully into the open wound. Blood gushed from his shoulder the instant she did. She dabbed it away with a folded towel. As she wiped the injury clean, she noted once more how raw and red the torn flesh looked. If he lived through this\u2014and he would!\u2014Jack was going to have an ugly scar.</p><p>The tweezers scraped against the bullet, and just as she\u2019d feared, it was buried deep in the flesh. Blood flowed more rapidly from the wound as soon as she pulled the tweezers away. Sweat beaded her brow. It soon became apparent that any attempt to extract the bullet would do more harm than good. He\u2019d already lost a lot of blood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, Jack. I\u2019m going to leave the bullet and pack the wound with a tampon because that\u2019s the best I have in the way of medical supplies. I\u2019m not going to let you die. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly Jack moaned and rolled his head to one side. It seemed that, even unconscious, the man was going to argue with her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t get PMS.\u201d Her laugh was mildly hysterical. He\u2019d never know what she\u2019d done, and that was just as well or she wouldn\u2019t hear the end of it. From now on, she\u2019d need to boil gauze and pack the wound with it until healing had begun.</p> <p>She discarded the tweezers and scissors, returned belowdecks and retrieved the tampon. By the time she\u2019d finished bandaging him, knotting the gauze as tightly as she could, reaction had set in and her hands trembled fiercely. She stroked his brow and pushed back his hair. His skin no longer seemed as clammy, she thought, assessing his condition in as detached a manner as she could. His respiration was better, too, not as shallow.</p><p>It was then that the first drop of rain hit. Intent as she was on her task, Lorraine hadn\u2019t noticed the darkening sky. The wind had picked up, as well. Moving Jack belowdecks would be impossible.</p><p>A second drop hit her and then more. Many, many more.</p><p>She had no choice but to wait out the storm here on deck and shelter Jack as best she could.</p><p>Jack was in hell. At least, he assumed that was where he was. He felt as if he were on fire, then realized the pain was more localized. His shoulder seemed to be responsible for the greatest part of his discomfort.</p><p>His mouth was parched, and all he could think about was a drink of cool, refreshing water. No, he had to be in hell\u2014otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be this thirsty.</p><p>As if he\u2019d spoken the request aloud, he felt something cool against his lips. But only a drop. God must have intended to torture him by granting a hint of relief. Just enough to remind him of the intensity of his thirst...</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d a feminine voice whispered.</p><p>Marcie? Here? Now? That was all he needed to convince him he was indeed being punished. Everything he wanted was offered, then withheld. He\u2019d ventured into the lake of fire. His heart ached at the sound of her voice, so soft and loving.</p><p>He felt his head being gently lifted. A glass of water was pressed to his lips. As soon as he recognized what it was, he drank greedily, gratefully. Heaven, he decided. He\u2019d been routed toward a more angelic resting place\u2014although he couldn\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d done to warrant such exalted treatment. But, hey, who was he to question an executive decision, especially one that leaned in his favor?</p><p>Content now, Jack fell into a deep and peaceful sleep.</p><p>In his dream he was visiting a Mexican village. He glanced around at the sun-baked adobe houses, the small church, the cantina. So far, so good.</p><p>Then Marcie appeared. Sweet Marcie, the plumber\u2019s wife. Marcie and her children. Marcie and Clifford, her husband.</p><p>Jack watched her and admired what a terrific mother she was to her twins. Every once in a while, she looked in his direction and smiled. She couldn\u2019t see him, though; he knew that. Because Jack stood apart, gazing in. He felt a deep sadness. The kind of sadness that left him in no doubt of his own failings and imperfections.</p><p>Watching the dream-Marcie with her family, observing their love and happiness, was like seeing how his own life might have gone had he been a different sort of person. Had he made other choices through the years.</p><p>Caught up in his regrets, Jack didn\u2019t realize another man had joined the small party. He blinked, certain there must be some mistake. The man was Carlos. Jack called out a taunting remark, but the dream-Carlos couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Then Carlos grabbed Marcie by the shoulder and shoved her against the wall. Jack bolted upright. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Knowing it wouldn\u2019t do any good to yell since no one seemed able to hear him, Jack waited for Clifford to step in. But Clifford was nowhere to be seen. The children had disappeared, too.</p><p>Turning his attention back to Marcie, he watched helplessly as Carlos shoved her again. Sure as anything, Carlos was going to rape her. Jack had to stop him. There wasn\u2019t time to let her find her own way out of the scrape. There wasn\u2019t time. Dammit, he\u2019d told her to stay out of sight, warned her again and again.</p><p>Fists clenched, Jack entered the fray. The other man\u2019s head snapped back with the first punch. Jack was beginning to think he\u2019d outmaneuvered him when a gun appeared in Carlos\u2019s hand. Only, it wasn\u2019t Jack he pointed the pistol at but Marcie.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d With a cry of outrage, Jack leaped in front of the other man and took the bullet. He felt its impact, the searing pain and the instant knowledge that he\u2019d really done it this time. After all those lucky escapes, eluding death, it seemed his luck had run out. He was too late. This time he would die.</p><p>Ah...now he understood. It was all plain to him now. His death, giving up his life so someone he loved might live, was what had secured him a place in heaven. The throbbing pain in his shoulder didn\u2019t seem nearly as intense anymore. He\u2019d saved Marcie....</p><p>\u201cJack, oh, Jack, you\u2019re burning up with fever.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, expecting to find Marcie gazing down at him. Instead, it was Lorraine. He blinked, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d said the words aloud until she answered.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Oh, Jack, I don\u2019t have a clue where we are. We\u2019re just drifting\u2014the engines are off. I haven\u2019t seen land in two days.... But at least it\u2019s not raining right now.\u201d</p><p>Despite his determination to keep his eyes open, they slowly closed. He yearned to tell her not to worry, everything would work out, but the ability to speak had been taken away. He could rest easy now. Marcie was back with her husband and children, and Lorraine was safe, too. Safe from Carlos and safe from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The torrential rain beat down on them with a vengeance. Sitting on the deck beside Jack, Lorraine held a vinyl slicker over their heads until the muscles in her upper arms cramped in protest. The slicker offered little protection, but at least it kept the rain off Jack\u2019s face.</p><p>The storm had raged on and off for two days. Every time the downpour slackened, she thought it was over\u2014and then it would start again. Lorraine had never experienced such misery. She didn\u2019t know which was worse, the weather or their predicament. Without land in sight, she had no idea where they were or how to find out. If Jack died, Lorraine didn\u2019t know what her own fate would be.</p><p>She wanted Jack to live\u2014and for a whole lot more than his navigational skills. She owed him so much, more than it was possible to repay. Every time she thought about his being shot, saving her from Carlos, her chest tightened with emotion.</p><p>She was afraid he\u2019d die.</p> <p>She was afraid she\u2019d killed Carlos. And afraid she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She was afraid she\u2019d gotten them so lost even Jack would never find the way back and they\u2019d die at sea. If someone did manage to rescue her, she feared no one would believe in her innocence and she\u2019d spend years rotting in a Mexican prison.</p><p>Throughout the storm, Lorraine was constantly at Jack\u2019s side, refusing to leave him as they drifted aimlessly out to sea.</p><p>For a few hours she entertained herself by trying to remember the plots of her favorite classic movies, scene by scene. Brief Encounter. It Happened One Night. The Bishop\u2019s Wife. Sabrina. And of course The African Queen. Movies she and her mother had loved.</p><p>She thought about her mother, too, and tried to hate her, then discovered she couldn\u2019t. She went over what she knew of her parents\u2019 marriage again and again until it made a crazy kind of sense. Her parents had loved each other, but unchangeable circumstances had led to their separation. From what her father had told her, he\u2019d been in touch through the years, yet after a while Virginia had stopped responding. Stopped visiting. Lorraine remembered her mother taking what she said were business trips. Lorraine had stayed with Aunt Elaine for as long as a week. These trips seemed to make her mother sad, she recalled. She herself had been so young.</p> <p>At some point in her childhood, her mother must have made a conscious decision not to move to Mexico. Since she was a devout Catholic, divorce was not an option for her. She must have made peace with herself and her past, and for whatever reason eased herself out of Thomas\u2019s life.</p><p>None of this explained why she\u2019d never told Lorraine the truth. And now Lorraine would never know, could only speculate.</p><p>Thoughts of her mother were complicated enough, but what she felt toward her father was completely confusing. All those years her mother had remained faithful. But Thomas hadn\u2019t. For all Lorraine knew, he could have fathered dozens of children. She didn\u2019t want to think about him, didn\u2019t want to dwell on his infidelities. Didn\u2019t want...</p><p>Lorraine wasn\u2019t sure when she fell asleep. Next thing she knew, it was morning and the sun shone down like a blessing from heaven. She opened her eyes and blinked at the brightness\u2014and noticed that Jack\u2019s eyes were open, too. For a long time they simply looked at each other, as if taking in the fact that they were both alive. The urge to touch his face the way she had earlier was almost overpowering. She longed to put her arms around him, hold him close. She wanted to tell him how desperately afraid she\u2019d been that he\u2019d die and how she couldn\u2019t have borne the guilt of it. She wanted to tell him that beneath his disreputable exterior, he was a good man. What higher praise was there than that? A man who was honorable and good. A man she was beginning to love. But she told him none of these things.</p><p>Instead, she whispered, \u201cGood morning,\u201d in an unsteady voice as she struggled to conceal her relief and the accompanying rush of emotion. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what you\u2019d expect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p><p>His grin was brief. \u201cThat bad. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She ached in places she hadn\u2019t known it was possible to ache. But then, she wasn\u2019t accustomed to sleeping in an upright position.</p><p>\u201cThe gunshot,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad enough.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t lie to him. \u201cBut not nearly as critical as it could have been. The bullet\u2019s still there. Removing it would\u2019ve done too much damage. You\u2019d lost a lot of blood as it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bullet\u2019s still there?\u201d He arched his brows. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m going to set off airport metal detectors?\u201d He gave her an infectious grin.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to find out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held hers. Then he reached up and pressed his hand to her cheek. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered. The gesture was one of tenderness and unspeakable warmth. Her hand joined his and she blinked back tears, wishing she knew how to tell him that she admired his courage and his honor. That she was grateful he\u2019d taken it upon himself to help her when it would have been just as easy to refuse. She closed her eyes, wanting to savor this moment, hold on to it forever. Her pulse steadied. Reality returned.</p> <p>During the worst of his fever, he\u2019d called for another woman, someone he obviously loved and cared for deeply. A woman who was\u2014or had been\u2014an important part of his life.</p><p>She considered asking about Marcie. And she considered correcting the impression that she was a married woman. But for his sake, as well as her own, it was better to let him believe she had a husband back in Louisville.</p><p>The feelings between them were too intense. And the situation was far too difficult. This relationship had no hope of any future, and rather than allow it to follow a path that would only bring them pain, she regretfully removed her hand from Jack\u2019s. He seemed to realize what was happening and lowered his arm to his side.</p><p>\u201cI shot Carlos,\u201d she told him, thinking that would cheer him up.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but not from lack of trying. I got off six shots,\u201d she added proudly.</p><p>He grinned at that.</p><p>\u201cBest I can figure, though, I only grazed his upper arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019s in more pain than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get us away from Pucuro?\u201d</p><p>She turned away. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a story for another day,\u201d she said firmly. Suddenly tears blurred her eyes again, no matter how hard she tried to blink them away. \u201cLet me see about making you more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d She sniffled and wiped her cheeks with one hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d he said, ignoring her protest.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen these are tears of...of joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy?\u201d His question was accompanied by a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to live, Jack. You\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Carlos Caracol cursed and gritted his teeth as Camelia cleaned the blood from his upper arm. \u201cStop,\u201d he commanded. He jerked with the pain. He\u2019d gone three days without medical care, and infection had set in. The throbbing in his arm was bad enough to bring him to Camelia, a woman he knew he could trust.</p><p>\u201cI said stop,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to lose that arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me finish,\u201d she said with perfect calm.</p><p>This was what he liked most about Camelia\u2014he didn\u2019t intimidate her. He\u2019d known the first time he met her that this was a woman worthy of his attention, and he\u2019d been right. It was of little concern to him that she was married\u2014and it didn\u2019t seem to bother her, either. Her youngest son, a three-year-old, looked a lot like him. Carlos didn\u2019t want any family responsibilities, but it pleased him to know he\u2019d fathered a child with her.</p><p>Squirming on the chair in her kitchen, he submitted his arm to her again. He closed his eyes and concentrated on the tantalizing scent of meat and spices simmering on the stove. It\u2019d been the better part of a week since he\u2019d enjoyed a decent meal. Longer since he\u2019d enjoyed the pleasure a woman could give.</p><p>He grimaced as Camelia dabbed some sort of stinging liquid on his arm. The throbbing was worse than ever. But the pain Carlos felt was more than just physical sensation. That American bitch had done it to him again. Whenever he found her, her male friend wasn\u2019t far behind. Those two were becoming a nuisance, but what they didn\u2019t realize was that no one made a fool of Carlos Caracol and lived to tell about it.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d Camelia said, her voice sharp.</p><p>His eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tense. Relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me something to take away the pain.\u201d He eased his free hand under her blouse and reached for her breast.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d she said, and slapped his wrist.</p><p>Carlos frowned. To hear her talk anyone would think she was married to him. \u201cDo you have a headache?\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>Her saucy grin was enough to assure him that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cWith you? Never.\u201d</p><p>His mood lifted. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, after your arm is clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve eaten.\u201d</p><p>She continued to dab at the wound. He swore she used straight whiskey. Every place she touched him, his skin burned.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me who did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan or woman?\u201d</p><p>Carlos hesitated before answering. \u201cWoman.\u201d</p><p>Camelia\u2019s reaction told him he should have lied. She broke into a hearty laugh and shook her head. \u201cI always thought a woman would be the end of you, except I thought it would be me. Did you want her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled, deciding to lie. He did want the bitch, but only to show her what it was like to be with a real man. And to punish her.</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d</p><p>The problem with Camelia was that she knew him too well. He grabbed a thick swatch of her hair, twisted it around his fist and yanked hard.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cThat American is going to regret the day she ever laid eyes on me.\u201d Each word was distinctly pronounced.</p><p>He was gratified to see that Camelia got his message. \u201cI pity her,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He grinned, his ego bolstered by her words. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure that when she dies, she\u2019s grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jack demanded as Lorraine spoon-fed him broth.</p><p>\u201cSoup.\u201d Jack wasn\u2019t a good patient, but she\u2019d expected that. He was impatient with the time it took to regain his strength. His complaints were constant. He hated being incapacitated. Hated relying on her help. Hated being weak.</p><p>\u201cPretty sorry excuse for soup if you ask me,\u201d he muttered, opening his mouth for another spoonful.</p><p>\u201cYou appear to be eating it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She grinned, and to her surprise he did, too. Their eyes met, and neither seemed willing to look away. It had been like this from the moment he\u2019d regained consciousness. This awareness, this appreciation. Countless hours she\u2019d remained at his side, nursing him, lending him her will, her strength...her heart. He didn\u2019t need her determination to survive; his own was strong enough. But her heart\u2014that he kept, and although they never mentioned the growing awareness between them, they both knew it was there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack\u2019s eyes roamed her face, and Lorraine started to tremble at the warmth in his gaze. She made herself return to the task of feeding him, but her hands shook too badly and she had to stop for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I have real food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she promised. Without antibiotics to help combat infection, his body required more time to heal. He needed a great deal of sleep, too, and it frustrated him that he only seemed able to stay awake an hour or so before drifting off again.</p><p>Time lagged for her while he slept. In the past few days she\u2019d read every piece of printed material on board. Twice. She\u2019d laundered all his clothes and appropriated a couple of shirts and a pair of drawstring cotton shorts for herself. She\u2019d cleaned, scrubbed and reorganized the entire living quarters. It was apparent from certain things she\u2019d found while cleaning\u2014small gifts, cards she shouldn\u2019t have read but did\u2014that Jack maintained a number of ongoing relationships with women around the Caribbean. This confirmed the decision she\u2019d already made: It would be best to let him continue believing she was married. Besides, she couldn\u2019t come up with an easy way to tell him there really wasn\u2019t a husband. He\u2019d assumed it\u2014she let him\u2014and now she preferred to leave things as they were. And Gary...well, she\u2019d agreed to marry him. She loved Gary, she truly did. She had no business contemplating for even two seconds any kind of liaison with another man. She\u2019d taken to wearing Gary\u2019s engagement necklace outside her shirt. Jack\u2019s shirt.</p> <p>Jack would\u2019ve been more comfortable belowdecks in his own bed, but he\u2019d rejected that idea, choosing to soak in the sunshine and fresh salt air. Lorraine made a bed for him on a chair that partially reclined, and he spent his time there.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to untie Scotch on Water from the dock!\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>Lorraine knew it had been a mistake to tell Jack how she\u2019d managed to escape from Pucuro. He\u2019d teased her about it more than once. Those were the only times his face showed signs of color. He\u2019d lost a lot of blood and was still deathly pale and very weak. She supposed she ought to be grateful that Jack seemed to find the tale of their escape so amusing.</p><p>He finished the soup, and Lorraine watched as he fought to keep his eyes open. \u201cSleep, Jack,\u201d she urged, ready to retire for the night herself. She slept belowdecks in his bed.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk,\u201d he insisted, and clung to her wrist to keep her from leaving.</p> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go for a few minutes, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just rest my eyes for a little while and then we can...\u201d</p><p>Whatever he was about to say was lost as he fell asleep. She didn\u2019t know what he wanted to talk about, and in some ways was grateful he\u2019d been too weak. Her fear was that he\u2019d bring up something better left unsaid.</p><p>The subject of her assumed marriage was like a lit fuse thrust between them. At times Lorraine wished she\u2019d set him straight on the first occasion he\u2019d mentioned her \u201chusband.\u201d But then she\u2019d remember Gary, or something would happen to remind her how far removed Jack\u2019s world was from hers. There could be no future for them.</p> <p>She should leave now, she realized, and go down below. Still, she stayed at his side, watching the moon\u2019s reflection on the water. She might simply be rationalizing her feelings, but really, it was logical that under these circumstances, she\u2019d be attracted to Jack. He\u2019d saved her life and she\u2019d saved his. Such a bond between two people couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>They\u2019d created a genuine friendship during these past days. Or so Lorraine believed, anyway. They\u2019d talked about many things, and he\u2019d given her glimpses of his life before Scotch on Water. It didn\u2019t surprise her to learn he\u2019d been a mercenary. He\u2019d worked with a group of men who\u2019d called themselves Deliverance Company. Apparently he\u2019d had deep friendships with these men.</p><p>Lorraine did her share of talking, too. She told him about her childhood, growing up without a father, and about her mother. But describing her life with Virginia made her sad, and she quickly changed the subject to her favorite movie plots. He hadn\u2019t seen many movies in the past few years, and she delighted in recalling the ones she treasured and watched again and again. She\u2019d thought about some of them recently, so retelling The African Queen and Casablanca was\u2014admittedly\u2014a chance to show off. His reactions were everything she could have asked for. These movie sessions were the most fun she\u2019d had since before her mother died. She particularly enjoyed narrating the plot of Romancing the Stone, which he\u2019d never seen. It wasn\u2019t hard, somehow, to imagine the two of them in the lead roles....</p><p>There were more personal stories, too. That very afternoon, in fact, she\u2019d asked him about his scars. He explained his injuries from the years he served with Deliverance Company and then wanted to know if she had any. Only one, she\u2019d told him, from a broken arm that had required surgery. She\u2019d been horsing around with friends, demonstrating her skill sliding down a staircase railing. Unfortunately she\u2019d toppled and tumbled down a whole flight, landing on her right arm. That experience had taught her a certain caution.</p><p>Lorraine waited, watching him sleep. His breathing evened out and she started to ease away from his side and slip belowdecks. To her surprise his grip on her wrist tightened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he whispered, but his eyes remained closed.</p><p>The night, with moonlight glowing on the water, was almost unearthly in its beauty. \u201cLie with me awhile,\u201d he urged. He slid over to give her space.</p><p>Resting her head against his good shoulder, she lay beside him. Jack placed his right arm around her and she draped hers across his middle.</p> <p>This quiet intimacy between them was exquisite. Without speaking of it, they both seemed to recognize that this was time set apart. Even when she was certain Jack had fallen into a deep sleep, she didn\u2019t leave. She hadn\u2019t been this content in days. Weeks. She\u2019d found a haven in this stranger\u2019s arms.</p><p>Except that he wasn\u2019t a stranger anymore....</p><p>Lorraine awoke and the world was dark. The boat pitched aimlessly about the gulf, going wherever the currents took her. Stars glittered in the inky sky\u2014more stars than she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She\u2019d lain there for some time, soaking in the beauty and peace of these moments, before she realized Jack was awake, too. His arm was around her and her head was tucked beneath his chin, which he rubbed softly against her hair. It was the kind of thing a lover would do. Tilting her head back, Lorraine looked at Jack. Their eyes met, and the way he stared at her filled her with longing. She wanted him to kiss her.</p><p>He wanted it, too. She saw it in his eyes, in the avid way he studied her mouth. She swallowed, almost groaning with the need to feel his lips on hers. His hand, which lay gently against her ribs, rose slowly until it reached her breast.... He paused. Held his breath. So did Lorraine.</p><p>Neither pretended that touch hadn\u2019t happened. Neither looked coyly away. He did nothing to disguise his own body\u2019s reaction. He wanted her, and her heart rejoiced.</p><p>He lowered his head as if to kiss her, but stopped himself just before their mouths touched.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your husband,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Lorraine wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. If she told him the truth now, she feared the temptation would be more than either of them could resist. He\u2019d kiss her and she\u2019d welcome his touch. Before long, they\u2019d be lovers and that would be a mistake she couldn\u2019t afford. There was too much she didn\u2019t know about Jack. Too much she didn\u2019t want to know. He had a wild and dangerous side, like the heroes in her favorite movies. A relationship with Jack could never last. She\u2019d end up being just another of his women. Nor would she betray Gary....</p><p>\u201cWhat...do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cGary. Gary Franklin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept your maiden name? Dancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDoes he call you Lorraine or Raine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorraine.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to discuss Gary. Her fianc\u00e9 seemed very distant from these weeks with Jack. Out here in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico everything about her life in Louisville, including Gary, seemed unreal.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a manager for a medical-supply company.\u201d She recognized what Jack was doing. He was trying to create a sense of Gary as a man, as a real person and not merely a name, in an effort to stem the potency of their attraction. It wasn\u2019t working. Had she offered him her lips just then, he would have kissed her. It was what they both wanted, their hunger so strong it seemed to pulse between them.</p><p>\u201cDoes he love you?\u201d</p><p>She had trouble forming the word, and it came out sounding scratchy, uncertain. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough?\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been easy for Gary to stand aside and let her search for her father on her own. He\u2019d wanted to travel with her, but she\u2019d discouraged that. As it turned out, she wished he had come, then none of this would have happened.</p><p>\u201cDoes he love you enough, Lorraine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, and her voice broke.</p><p>Jack eased his hand away from her, slowly, as if he knew he\u2019d never touch her again.</p><p>Lorraine worried her lower lip. There was no going back now. Continuing the lie had sealed their future.</p><p>Lorraine refused to make the same mistakes her mother had. In a way, it was that simple. When the time came, she\u2019d return to Louisville and go through with the wedding. She\u2019d have Gary\u2019s children and live a good honest life. It was what she wanted. What she needed. Her mother would have approved.</p><p>Jack awoke to find Lorraine no longer at his side. It was just as well, he acknowledged, but he couldn\u2019t quite make his heart believe it.</p><p>Ever since Marcie, Jack had avoided emotional entanglements. There were a couple of women he saw on an occasional basis, but both were the type who neither wanted nor expected any kind of commitment. Jack was content with his life. He didn\u2019t know why he found it necessary to keep reminding himself of that. Until recently he hadn\u2019t even liked Lorraine. He\u2019d considered her prissy, stubborn and self-righteous. Furthermore, she was married.</p><p>Lorraine hadn\u2019t changed. And she was still married. The difference was in how he viewed her. In the days since they\u2019d left El Mirador, he\u2019d come to know her and realize she was caring, generous, amusing, brave, beautiful\u2014with each day the list grew longer. But she was the same person she\u2019d always been.</p><p>The physical differences were more noticeable. Her fancy linen jacket had been replaced by one of his shirts, the ends tied at her waist, revealing tantalizing glimpses of midriff. The linen pants were gone, too. Instead, she wore a pair of his shorts and walked barefoot. Half the time it was all he could do to keep from staring at her legs.</p><p>Her hair, once so perfect with every strand in place, was gathered into a ponytail. Over the past few days she\u2019d acquired a rich golden tan. Rarely had he seen any woman more physically appealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While he\u2019d been drifting in and out of consciousness, she\u2019d stayed continually by his side. Jack couldn\u2019t remember any time he\u2019d awakened and not found her there. Her smile was gentle, her words encouraging, her touch tender. The truth was, in all his life, Jack had never had anyone care this much about him.</p><p>And sometime during the past few days, he\u2019d fallen in love with her. In love with a woman already married to another man.</p><p>In a different situation, he would have made his escape. Fled temptation. Gotten the hell out of her life before he screwed it up. But now there was no place to run. They were trapped on this boat together.</p><p>One option was to make her hate him, freeze her out, be cruel. Say or do something that would keep her at arm\u2019s length. But Jack discovered he couldn\u2019t. He was half-inclined to credit his lack of resolve to his weakened condition, but that was a lie and he knew it. He was in love with Lorraine, and loving her prevented him from saying or doing anything that would bring her pain. That included what he wanted most, which was to touch her the way a lover would. Kiss her, make love to her, cherish her.</p> <p>He cursed his weakness the night before, when he\u2019d touched her breast. He\u2019d wanted to do a lot more and was fully aware that she would have let him. He also knew that in time she\u2019d come to regret it. When she returned to her husband, he vowed she\u2019d go undefiled, without remorse, free of guilt.</p><p>What made his love for Lorraine beautiful, Jack reflected, was its purity. His relationship with Marcie and every other woman in his life had its existence primarily in the physical.</p><p>Not so with Lorraine. Their relationship had a physical dimension, but more than that, it had an emotional depth, even a spiritual one. He was a man who\u2019d lived his life on the edge, emotionally distant; now he found himself in unfamiliar territory.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Lorraine greeted him as she stepped onto the deck with breakfast. It was ten days after the shooting. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d The first thing he noticed was that she didn\u2019t sound quite like herself. He couldn\u2019t stop looking at her. Sunlight surrounded her, giving her an angelic appearance. He wondered wryly if God planned to teach him a lesson and had sent Lorraine to torment him with all the might-have-beens.</p> <p>Carrying the tray, she stepped out of the sunlight. Jack\u2019s eyes narrowed when he saw her face. Something wasn\u2019t right. She wasn\u2019t good at hiding her emotions. It was one of the traits he liked so much about her.</p><p>\u201cRaine.\u201d He always called her that when he wanted a reaction.</p><p>She either ignored it or didn\u2019t hear him. \u201cI brought your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He favored the direct approach.</p><p>She frowned at him as if she wondered how he knew.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he ordered. He moved over, making space for her on the chair.</p> <p>He read her hesitation. Then with a deep sigh, she sat down next to him. \u201cRemember I told you I first tried to remove the bullet with tweezers?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell...the tweezers were in my makeup case. I was in a hurry and I dumped out my purse on the mattress. I remember seeing something odd then, but didn\u2019t take time to examine it. And afterward I just scooped everything up and put it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA...gold object. I didn\u2019t know what it was or how it got into my bag, but it didn\u2019t seem important at the time. I\u2019m constantly putting things in my purse for one reason or another. I thought it might be a broken earring or a pin I\u2019d forgotten. I didn\u2019t think twice about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine reached for his hand and squeezed his fingers hard. \u201cI...can\u2019t tell you for sure what it is, but I can guess. And I have a strong suspicion about how it got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJason Applebee. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s another artifact. Another of those star things.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been over a week now, and no one had seen or heard anything of Jack Keller, Lorraine Dancy or Scotch on Water. Jason had run the risk of capture and worse in his efforts to locate the woman\u2014or more importantly, her purse. He was afraid she\u2019d discovered the Mayan artifact he\u2019d hidden inside the small zippered bag. If she hadn\u2019t already found it, then it was only a matter of time.</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t put both pieces in her luggage. That would have been disastrous. To lose one half of the Kukulcan Star was bad enough, but both would be unthinkable. Intolerable. Too many people had already died. Mostly by his hand. Jason had put himself at risk time after time and refused to be thwarted now.</p><p>This penchant for killing had come as a surprise. Jason hadn\u2019t realized he had any appetite for it. He\u2019d prefer to avoid it, of course, but he\u2019d learned that when it was a question of getting what he wanted murder came easy. Easier than he would\u2019ve dreamed possible.</p><p>From the time he was a kid, archaeology had fascinated him, especially anything concerning the Maya. He\u2019d studied it exhaustively, obsessively. As a teenager he\u2019d come to identify with the Mayan god Kukulcan. Unlike him, though, Jason hadn\u2019t taken a vow of celibacy. Hey, why should he deprive himself of sexual pleasure? Frankly he couldn\u2019t see any reason not to indulge. In the end Kukulcan had broken his own vow and was overwhelmed by guilt. He\u2019d set out on a snakeskin raft and sailed toward the east. According to myth, the raft had then burst into flames that consumed him. His heart rose heavenward and eventually merged with the sun. One day, it was said, Kukulcan would come back, and Jason had found the key to his promised return. He\u2019d stolen the archaeological find of the century.</p><p>He felt his anger rise as he remembered that he\u2019d already lost half the Star; he\u2019d learned from the press and the radio that it had been returned to the museum\u2014which meant it was more crucial than ever that he get the other half back.</p><p>But that half was in the possession of a woman, an imbecile who didn\u2019t have a clue what she held in her hands.</p><p>Jason had called upon every resource available to him, to no avail. It was as if Scotch on Water had disappeared off the face of the earth, as if Lorraine and Jack Keller had vanished. Perhaps they\u2019d been engulfed in flames themselves and drifted toward the sun. But they would resurface one day, and when they did, Jason would be waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cLet me see it,\u201d Jack said. He resisted the urge to touch Lorraine, to reassure her. He noticed that a strand of hair, so neatly tucked behind her ear, had escaped, and finding the impulse too strong, he replaced it.</p><p>Her eyes met his and she reached up to clasp his hand. Their fingers entwined and she leaned forward and braced her forehead against his good shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s got you so worried?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour friend isn\u2019t going to find us. Hell, I don\u2019t even know exactly where we are.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s only response was a tremulous sigh.</p><p>\u201cGet the artifact for me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll take a look and tell you what I know.\u201d Living in Mexico, Jack had learned a fair amount about Mayan mythology and culture.</p><p>Lorraine left him and returned a couple of minutes later. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, and handed him a three-pointed gold object about the size of a silver dollar.</p><p>Jack turned it over in his hand and felt his excitement growing as he began to understand the significance of what he held. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something first. Did you see the artifact the police found in your luggage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone tell you anything about it?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine paused. \u201cJason was talking to me at the time, and everyone else was speaking Spanish. But I do remember them referring to a Mayan god.\u201d She paused, as if going over the conversation, then shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t recall the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it by any chance Kukulcan? Or Quetzalcoatl?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThat might have been it\u2014the first one. Why?\u201d She stared at the gold piece in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIf this is what I think it is, you\u2019re holding the lost half of the Kukulcan Star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA star,\u201d she repeated. She turned it over. \u201cI see where it could be a star\u2014I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach half has three corresponding points,\u201d he explained, taking it from her palm, \u201cand the two halves link together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was Quetzalcoatl?\u201d she asked, the name stumbling awkwardly over her tongue. \u201cThe other one you mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn most of Mexico he\u2019s known as Kukulcan, and he\u2019s half man, half myth. There\u2019s a lot of conflicting information about the Plumed Serpent, as he\u2019s also called. And it seems there were two Mayan leaders who took the name Kukulcan, as well, and were looked on as gods. In any event, the Mayans believed this deity, the original one, descended from heaven and presented their society with the concepts of love and patience. He was said to have united them into a confederation of tribes.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately this state of utopia didn\u2019t last long. He was tricked into breaking his vow of celibacy. Filled with guilt and regret, he set sail, promising one day to return. Only he promised to come back as the Morning Star, the symbol of regeneration and hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the Morning Star, then? Why is it in two connecting parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t say, but if what I understand is correct, it solves the mystery of his supposed return. See these symbols?\u201d He reverently handed her the artifact. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they mean, but I do know that when the halves are linked, the secret is supposed to be completely revealed. I don\u2019t think the pieces ever have been linked. One half of the Star has been kept in a museum, since it was found in the 1930s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness!\u201d Lorraine murmured, covering her mouth. \u201cWhen I arrived in M\u00e9rida, I waited forever before I was able to clear customs. Someone said all the available agents were checking everyone departing the country, looking for a stolen museum piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf of the Kukulcan Star,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is the other half?\u201d Lorraine asked.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be, if they found one in your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce locked together and read,\u201d Jack went on, \u201cthese two pieces will open up all kinds of new discoveries into the culture of the ancient Maya.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cIncredible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine frowned, her fingers folded protectively over the half-star.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. He lifted her chin until their eyes met. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, don\u2019t you know what that means?\u201d There was no disguising her fear. \u201cJason will do anything to get this back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Jack wouldn\u2019t mislead her. But Jason wasn\u2019t their only worry. He knew any number of men and women who would kill for a mere glance at the missing half of the Kukulcan Star. \u201cWe have the advantage, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ve actually got it in our possession\u2014and we\u2019re going to hand it over to the Mexican government.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut, Jack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019ll clear you of any wrongdoing.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Thomas Dancy was close to panic. He\u2019d been absolutely sure Raine would be safely back in the States by now. He\u2019d learned otherwise that afternoon after receiving a phone call from a man named Gary Franklin, who identified himself as Raine\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Something had gone wrong; he was convinced of it. But there was nothing he could do until he heard from Jack. Franklin had been full of questions and was justifiably concerned. The conversation troubled Thomas, but he couldn\u2019t put his finger on exactly what bothered him.</p> <p>Now, as he walked home after a day of teaching, his steps were slow and heavy. His distress over Raine\u2019s seeming disappearance had sapped any strength he had left. His two oldest sons played outside in the yard, happily racing their toy trucks around hills of dirt. When they saw Thomas, they gave a shout of joy and ran toward him.</p><p>He caught Antonio in his arms and lifted him high above his head. The boy squealed with delight. Hector waited impatiently for his turn, but Thomas lacked the energy to lift him, too. Instead, he held his son against him and bent to kiss his brow.</p><p>Inside the house Azucena was nursing the baby. Alberto suckled vigorously, his tiny fists clenched tight. Thomas gazed on both of them with love. He kissed first mother, then child.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Azucena asked, studying him.</p><p>Thomas lowered himself into the chair beside her and sighed deeply. \u201cA man phoned today looking for Raine. He said he was her fianc\u00e9. He\u2019s worried. She\u2019d promised to contact him and hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t home yet?\u201d Azucena\u2019s surprise was evident.</p><p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d Depressed and more than a little worried, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way you can get in touch with Jack?\u201d</p><p>Thomas had already given the matter considerable thought. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his friends from Deliverance Company? They might know something.\u201d</p><p>Thomas mulled that over.</p> <p>\u201cYou did all you could to help her,\u201d she reassured him in that gentle way of hers. \u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands now. Tomorrow I\u2019ll go to church to light a candle and pray for your daughter and Jack.\u201d</p><p>Azucena could say her prayers and light her votive candles, but Thomas put no trust in religion. He\u2019d turned his back on God in a Vietnam rice paddy; for him it was too late. All he could do for Jack and Raine was worry.</p><p>Later, it seemed to him inevitable that the dream would return that night. Thomas awoke bolt upright in bed, screaming.</p><p>\u201cThomas. Thomas.\u201d Azucena slipped her arms around him. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, my love, only a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d His voice still shook. \u201cThis was so...real.\u201d He clung to her and buried his face in her neck. Eyes closed, he savored her loving hands caressing his back.</p><p>\u201cTell me what it is,\u201d she urged. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He could barely say the words. \u201cSomeone\u2019s about to die. I can feel it. I\u2019ve felt it for a long time. First Ginny. Then Ernesto. Death comes in threes. It happened that way in Vietnam. I remember we lost two men within a day and we were all afraid we\u2019d be next. Instead, it was my friend David....\u201d He paused. \u201cAll that time, I was so scared it would be me. I didn\u2019t want to die. All I wanted was to go home to my wife and daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war\u2019s over. You have nothing to fear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Raine,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSomething\u2019s going to happen to Raine. I can feel it, Azucena. In here.\u201d He carried her hand to his heart and pressed her palm there. \u201cDear God in heaven, I may already have lost her and I don\u2019t even know her yet.\u201d He covered his face with his hands and wept helplessly as his wife murmured consolation and whispered prayers.</p><p>Jack could hardly stand up without keeling over, but he insisted on starting the engines. No amount of arguing would persuade him otherwise.</p><p>As Lorraine had discovered, Jack Keller was by far the most stubborn man she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>With the wind beating against her face, she carried a cup of coffee to the flybridge. He sat there, intently studying the charts and comparing them to the readings on the boat\u2019s navigational equipment.</p><p>He smiled his appreciation when she gave him the mug. \u201cBest I can figure, we\u2019re two days from land.\u201d He looked back at the chart and made a line with his finger. \u201cSee? We\u2019re about here, and we\u2019re heading straight through the Bay of Campeche to Alvarado. Then...\u201d He glanced up. \u201cHey, what\u2019s that worried look about?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t know. She realized she should be happy, overjoyed. In a few days, three at the most, the artifact would be handed over to the authorities. Once that was done, Jack\u2019s friend in the government would help clear Lorraine\u2019s name. Before she knew it, she\u2019d be back in Louisville with Gary.</p><p>\u201cLorraine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>He slowed the engines. With the utmost tenderness, Jack touched the side of her face and looked deeply into her eyes. His touch stirred her, as it never failed to do, and she lowered her lashes. Since the night they\u2019d lain together, they\u2019d avoided touching, both afraid it would lead to more. A caress. A kiss. It was as if an invisible line had been drawn, and they\u2019d both agreed never to cross it.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, trusting him as she\u2019d never trusted anyone.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to arrest you, either.\u201d</p><p>Rather than explain the truth, she let him think she was worried about meeting the authorities. But her fears had little to do with that...and everything to do with Jack.</p><p>All the promises she\u2019d made to herself\u2014to avoid her mother\u2019s mistakes, to return to her simple well-planned life\u2014didn\u2019t seem to mean much anymore. Gary and her life in Louisville were a world away. And she had to force herself to remember she was engaged to marry him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t leave Jack, she couldn\u2019t. The thought was intolerable. Maybe they could be together. Make it work. They were opposites in every way and their lives were completely different, but maybe... As soon as the idea occurred to her, she knew it wasn\u2019t possible. It hadn\u2019t worked for her parents, and it wouldn\u2019t for her and Jack.</p><p>Then another idea sprang, fully formed, into her mind. A plan. She\u2019d return to Louisville and give it a month or two, test her feelings, make sure that being with Jack was the right thing to do. She owed Gary that much\u2014to return home and explain. He loved her and she\u2019d loved him. When she felt certain that being with Jack was what she wanted, she\u2019d go back to Mexico and find Jack. If he felt the same way, they could go on from there. Then and only then would she tell him the truth about Gary. He might be angry with her\u2014she wouldn\u2019t blame him if he was\u2014but he\u2019d get over it soon enough.</p><p>\u201cLorraine?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cLorraine, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He tilted her face upward and looked closely into her eyes.</p><p>She managed to smile. \u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But he didn\u2019t seem convinced.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to steer for a while?\u201d she asked, knowing he\u2019d never admit he was tired, although she could see he looked pale and shaky. She tried to make the offer sound casual.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, but his reluctance was obvious. He set the course and turned the helm over to her.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from suggesting he lie down and rest, knowing the mere notion might offend his stubborn pride.</p><p>But Jack lay down, anyway, which told her how exhausted he must be. He climbed down the ladder leading to the flybridge and nearly fell into his chair on the deck. Two minutes later he was asleep.</p><p>With nothing but open sea around her, Lorraine had plenty of opportunity to study Jack. Some color had returned to his face now. She suspected he\u2019d been near collapse.</p><p>Jack\u2019s estimate of how long it would take to reach land was accurate. On the evening of the second day, they neared the town of Alvarado. Their supplies of fuel and freshwater were low; they couldn\u2019t have stayed out at sea much longer. Lights sparkled on the harbor waters, and the port had a welcoming festive appearance. Jack eased Scotch on Water into a wide berth, and Lorraine heard him chuckling to himself as he secured the boat to the dock. She could guess all too well why he was laughing\u2014because of what\u2019d happened the last time he\u2019d tied up to a dock. It wasn\u2019t something she planned to mention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d he announced as he came belowdecks.</p><p>Lorraine sat at the table with her arms crossed. She shook her head in disgust. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will admit it\u2019s brave of me considering previous experience.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine struggled not to smile. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be cracking jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be twenty minutes. Half an hour at the most,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you told me before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorraine, all I\u2019m going to do is make a couple of phone calls. I\u2019ll talk to Dr. Efrain and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear, Jack, if you\u2019re not back in twenty minutes, I\u2019ll come looking for you!\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d His voice was steely. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for you, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake...\u201d He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cAll right, I guarantee I\u2019ll be back within thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>And he was.</p><p>She\u2019d glanced frequently at her watch while she waited. Exactly twenty-eight minutes later he returned to the slip. The boat rocked as he climbed on board. Painful experience had taught her to remain belowdecks until she knew with certainty that it was Jack. Smiling jubilantly, he hurried down the steps to join her.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s set,\u201d he told her. \u201cA plane\u2019ll fly us into Mexico City first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving here?\u201d</p><p>He placed a cloth bundle on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cCatherina is seeing to everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Efrain is Catherina?\u201d He\u2019d mentioned his \u201cfriend\u201d Dr. Efrain a number of times, but hadn\u2019t said a first name. A coldness seeped into her blood. In the process of cleaning, she\u2019d found envelopes addressed to Jack in a woman\u2019s flowing hand. The return address had read simply Catherina. Some friend!</p><p>They\u2019d been lovers. Lorraine knew it as surely as if he\u2019d shouted the words. Anger burned through her. Anger and jealousy. She had no right to feel either of those emotions. None. Still...it hurt. She felt as though he\u2019d cheated on her, been unfaithful. What nonsense, and yet she couldn\u2019t help it. Lorraine turned away, not wanting him to see her reaction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhile I was in town, I picked up a few clothes for you.

Long enough for Lorraine to regret her outburst.</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say anything about Marcie?\u201d The question was soft, close to her ear. He stood directly behind her and she squeezed her eyes shut to keep from turning into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was her during the fever.\u201d She\u2019d never asked him about Marcie. Nor had he asked her about Gary after that one night. Whoever Marcie was, Lorraine knew she\u2019d been special.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered coldly.</p> <p>\u201cCatherina\u2019s...an old lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d She reached for the bundle of clothes and hugged it against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cLorraine, it\u2019s not the way it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain anything to me. Your love life is none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t and it\u2019s not\u2014but I want to tell you. I loved Marcie, really loved her, but she married someone else. I came down to Mexico to forget. Not long afterward, I met Catherina.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine felt like covering her ears. She didn\u2019t want to hear about his past lovers, not when she loved him.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a fling...stupid, really. By mutual agreement we parted two weeks later.\u201d His tone was matter-of-fact, dispassionate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my concern. I\u2019m sorry... I should never have said anything.\u201d Averting her eyes, she concentrated on unfolding the clothes and found she was pleased with his choices. He\u2019d bought her a bright yellow peasant blouse with a scooped neckline and a matching yellow and turquoise skirt.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be more comfortable meeting Catherina in a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said again. He\u2019d even remembered shoes, a pair of rope and canvas espadrilles.</p><p>\u201cI talked to your father, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she said, thankful he hadn\u2019t expected her to speak to Thomas.</p><p>It was ending; she could feel it already. In a couple of days she\u2019d be on her way back to Louisville. Soon their time together would be little more than a memory to Jack. This was all happening too fast.</p><p>\u201cMy name will be cleared?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Apparently when the first half of the Kukulcan Star was found and returned, they recognized that it was unlikely you\u2019d been involved, considering when\u2014and how\u2014it was heisted. Applebee used you. And seeing that you now have the second half and you\u2019re surrendering it to the authorities, all is forgiven.\u201d</p><p>Once again she reminded herself that she had reason to be grateful this whole experience was coming to an end.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been drifting at sea all this time we would\u2019ve heard the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently the Kukulcan Star was discovered at an archaeological site. One of the Mayan temples near M\u00e9rida. The archaeologist who found it was murdered before he could hand it over to the Department of Antiquities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days before you got to Mexico. And the museum theft occurred the night before. A guard was critically injured in that robbery. But they didn\u2019t find the archaeologist\u2019s body until last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me who the suspect is,\u201d Lorraine murmured. She already knew the police were interested in Jason. And he\u2019d told her himself that he\u2019d been on a recent dig. He\u2019d told her some complicated lie, too, about rescuing another worker to explain his injured hand. Another lie she\u2019d been naive enough to believe... He\u2019d managed to obtain both halves of the Kukulcan Star\u2014and then he\u2019d passed them off to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jason?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith half of Mexico on his tail, my guess is he\u2019s long gone.\u201d</p><p>Long gone, Lorraine mused. Like she would be herself. \u201cBy this time tomorrow I\u2019ll be free to return to the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>Jack went quiet, as if he, too, had suddenly realized the implications of all that was about to take place.</p><p>\u201cWithin a month you\u2019ll have trouble remembering my name,\u201d she said, attempting a joke. One that fell decidedly flat. She turned her back to him and busied herself pouring coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d All at once he was behind her, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll remember every single moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will.\u201d She tried to sound light, funny, but her words were more like a whimper.</p><p>He increased the pressure on her shoulders. \u201cI won\u2019t forget. I swear it.\u201d His voice was husky with emotion.</p><p>Lorraine closed her eyes and leaned back against his chest. \u201cI...I\u2019m not going to forget, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>They stood together like that for a long time. Minutes? She wasn\u2019t sure. Long enough, in any event, to feel his love, its certainty, and yearn to share hers.</p><p>Lorraine didn\u2019t dare speak. She knew the instant she opened her mouth she\u2019d reveal the truth. But she couldn\u2019t do that yet, couldn\u2019t tell him. Later it would all come out. Later she\u2019d explain everything. But not now. Not when so many situations were still unresolved. Gary, her father, her problems with the Mexican police.... She needed a clear head. Distance. Time. She had to be very certain before she gave this man her heart. Because when she did, it would be forever.</p><p>Frustration was making him crazy. Jason sat in the corner of a dimly lit cantina in Campeche and nursed a glass of whiskey. He\u2019d followed every lead, tracked down every rumor about a blonde American woman traveling with Jack Keller, and each time he\u2019d run into a dead end.</p><p>None of his bribes had paid off, either. He\u2019d put the word out on the street, notified every contact and offered a large reward. Nothing. It really was as if they\u2019d disappeared off the face of the earth.</p><p>His only hope was that she hadn\u2019t found the artifact, and that if she had, she\u2019d been smart enough not to hand it over to the Mexican government. His jaw tensed as he thought of the Star being out of his reach again.</p><p>Once he retrieved the half in Lorraine Dancy\u2019s possession, he\u2019d have to make another attempt to steal the original piece from the museum. They\u2019d no doubt increased security, making his task that much harder. He would triumph, though; that was fated. Meant to be. When he got both pieces back, he\u2019d read the Star for the first time. No one else. Him. His entire life had been building up to this moment. When he\u2019d learned the god\u2019s secrets, he\u2019d declare himself Kukulcan III. The living promise fulfilled at the beginning of a new millennium.</p><p>Under his leadership, the Maya would recover their former glory, and pilgrims from around the world would flock to his temples once again. Excitement blasted through him at the thought. Oh, yes, it was going to happen! He was so close....</p><p>Music swirled around him, and a couple of whores eyed his table, encouraging an invitation. In other circumstances, Jason would have been interested. But not now.</p><p>\u201cSe\u00f1or?\u201d A buxom woman strolled toward him. Jason had noticed her earlier. She placed her hands on the edge of his table and leaned forward, giving him a glimpse of her wares.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for company,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering.\u201d</p><p>Jason glanced up from his drink. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re trying to find an American woman traveling by boat. She\u2019s with a man by the name of Jack Keller.\u201d</p><p>She had his full attention now. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA...friend of mine had a run-in with them recently.\u201d</p><p>Well, well. This could be promising. \u201cHow recently?\u201d he asked without emotion. Enthusiasm would cost him more than he was willing to pay a whore.</p><p>\u201cAsk him yourself,\u201d she suggested, nodding toward the bar.</p><p>A lone man sat at the end, his arm in a sling. He was big compared to the other men around him. Ugly and mean-looking, to boot. In the States Jason would have taken him for a biker. Certainly he was the kind of man you crossed the street to avoid.</p><p>Jason peeled off a few pesos and stuffed them inside the woman\u2019s blouse. \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me again later if you like.\u201d She arched her brows, letting him know what she meant.</p><p>\u201cSounds good, sweetheart,\u201d Jason lied. There were younger, better-looking hookers around. He might even see if he could find himself a blonde. He\u2019d been attracted to Lorraine Dancy; it was a shame things didn\u2019t work out between them.</p><p>Whiskey bottle in hand, Jason walked over to the bar and claimed the empty stool next to the man with the sling. Tattoos covered his naked arms.</p><p>\u201cI understand you ran across a couple of friends of mine,\u201d Jason said in a conversational tone.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m looking for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d the other man said. \u201cPray you locate your friends first, se\u00f1or, because they\u2019ll both be dead if I find them before you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jason murmured. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of reasons.\u201d He slammed the bottle down on the bar.</p><p>\u201cCarlos.\u201d The older whore strolled to his side and slipped an arm around his waist. \u201cYou promised not to cause problems.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cThe American woman shot him,\u201d she told Jason.</p><p>\u201cThe woman will die for it,\u201d Carlos snarled.</p><p>Lorraine Dancy had more guts than Jason had credited her with. He refilled Carlos\u2019s glass from his own bottle. \u201cI don\u2019t have any fondness for the bitch myself.\u201d</p><p>Carlos studied him carefully, his look an open challenge. \u201cAnd Keller?\u201d</p><p>Jason shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s disposable, too. Perhaps we could help each other, after all.\u201d</p><p>Carlos raised his glass in a silent toast. \u201cPerhaps we can.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Catherina Efrain was a flawless beauty, perhaps thirty years of age. The much older Director of Antiquities, Dr. Marcos Molino, had joined her. Lorraine sat in the large government office in Mexico City with Jack beside her and tried not to stare at the other woman with her classic features and elegantly styled hair. Tried to push away all thoughts of Jack and this lovely Mexican woman.</p><p>\u201cWhen I received Jack\u2019s phone call yesterday afternoon, I immediately talked the matter over with Dr. Molino and arranged for your flight to Mexico City,\u201d Catherina was saying. \u201cOur government is very pleased and excited that you have given us this artifact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your help.\u201d Lorraine noted that Dr. Molino was content to let Catherina do most of the talking. His English wasn\u2019t particularly good, while hers was nearly perfect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur government is most grateful to you, Ms. Dancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved that I\u2019ve been cleared of all charges.\u201d It was a heavy weight off her shoulders. Whether or not they believed her innocent was no longer a factor. The Mexican government had what it wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear. Everything\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer plane ticket,\u201d Jack prompted.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, I almost forgot.\u201d Catherina reached for an envelope on her desk. Dr. Molino nodded and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve booked you a flight out of Mexico City first thing in the morning. First-class, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but that isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019m more than happy just to know the Kukulcan Star is where it belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jack was looking at Catherina.</p><p>Catherina\u2019s eyes met his. \u201cI\u2019ve also made arrangements for you to spend the night at one of the city\u2019s finest hotels. A suite has been reserved in your name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d Lorraine pressed her palm to her heart. \u201cThank you. But that\u2019s far and above\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou returned one of this country\u2019s rarest treasures. You deserve a bit of star treatment. No pun intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken the liberty of ordering a limousine to drive you to the airport tomorrow. The driver will escort you directly to your gate.\u201d She hesitated, then turned to Jack. \u201cWas there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the armed guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be guarded?\u201d Lorraine looked from Catherina to Jack and back to Dr. Molino. Once again the older gentleman smiled and nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to take any unnecessary risks at this point,\u201d Jack told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have protection for the remainder of your stay in my country,\u201d Catherina assured Lorraine.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jack said approvingly.</p><p>Catherina sighed and leaned forward. \u201cNow for a bit of unpleasantness. I\u2019m afraid news about the discovery of the second half of the Kukulcan Star has been leaked to the newspapers. It hasn\u2019t appeared in print yet, but...\u201d</p><p>Jack muttered a four-letter word and added in a louder voice, \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch news is of significant interest to the people of my country. I apologize, but I\u2019m afraid that holding back the story for more than twenty-four hours is impossible now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe,\u201d Lorraine said. \u201cActually, the sooner it\u2019s published, the better.\u201d It would no longer be worth Jason\u2019s while to come after them, since the artifact had already been handed over to the authorities. And if he hadn\u2019t learned that yet, he would within a day.</p><p>Jack caught her gaze and they smiled at each other.</p> <p>Catherina looked pointedly at Lorraine\u2019s wedding band, then glanced at their faces. She seemed to adequately size up the situation. \u201cSo, you two have had quite an adventure.\u201d</p><p>Neither commented.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be no mention of Lorraine\u2019s name in the news?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d the other woman promised.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jack nodded and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cNor the hotel,\u201d Catherina said as she stood and extended her hand to Lorraine. \u201cAgain, my country and my government are most grateful for your assistance. We regret the misunderstanding that occurred earlier and pray that you\u2019ll accept our sincere apologies.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Molino stood, too, and they exchanged handshakes all around.</p><p>Lorraine was overwhelmed by the Mexican government\u2019s generosity. The first-class air ticket was wonderful, but what she was really going to enjoy was that hotel suite. The first thing she intended to do was take a long hot shower. Then she was ordering a steak from room service, plus a glass of wine and the biggest dessert on the menu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Catherina promised, and Lorraine wasn\u2019t sure if she was talking to her or to Jack. She could only assume Catherina meant Jack.</p><p>The three of them left the administrative building together. \u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s over with,\u201d Lorraine said, heaving a deep sigh. All night her dreams had been filled with potential disasters. So much had happened already that she couldn\u2019t help thinking something else would go wrong.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Catherina summoned the cab that waited for them outside the building.</p><p>Lorraine climbed into the backseat, waving goodbye to Catherina. \u201cWhere to now?\u201d she asked, almost giddy with happiness.</p><p>Her relief died at Jack\u2019s sudden change of attitude. He sat as far away from her as possible. \u201cI\u2019ll ride with you to the hotel.\u201d The crispness of his tone told her this was the end. Deep in her heart she\u2019d known that. She could guess what Jack would do once they arrived. He\u2019d see her to her room, make sure the guard was in place and then, with a brief farewell, he\u2019d take his leave.</p><p>Neither of them said a single word during the entire cab ride.</p><p>Jack waited while she filled out the necessary paperwork at the front desk of the luxury hotel.</p><p>\u201cI hope you enjoy your stay with us, Ms. Dancy. Oh, and there\u2019s a message for you.\u201d The desk clerk gave her a sheet of paper. She glanced at it and saw her father\u2019s name, then slipped the note in her pocket. She\u2019d deal with this later.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, the words flat and lifeless. All at once she felt incredibly tired. Clutching the key to her room, she rejoined Jack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go up with you to confirm that the guard\u2019s where he\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Jack said stiffly.</p><p>They were alone in the elevator. Emotion seemed to thicken the air until Lorraine found it difficult to breathe. It really was over. In a few minutes Jack would say goodbye.</p><p>Suddenly Lorraine knew she couldn\u2019t let it happen, couldn\u2019t let him walk out of her life. Not without telling him how much she loved him.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>The elevator doors glided open on the fifth floor and Jack stepped out in front of her, his stance protective. The hallway was empty. Not until they approached the suite door did the man in uniform reveal himself.</p><p>Jack and the guard exchanged a few friendly words in Spanish. Jack hesitated a moment, then took the room key from her hand and unlocked the door. Apparently he preferred to speak to her alone.</p><p>Once inside, Lorraine waited. She knew what was coming, knew what he planned to say. They faced each other, but he seemed incapable of saying it. Silently she pleaded with him to kiss her. Just once.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, he lifted one hand and touched her cheek. She closed her eyes and heard the unevenness of his breath\u2014or perhaps it was her own.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStay here with me. Tonight, just tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaine, don\u2019t. This is hard enough.\u201d Even as he spoke he reached for her, hauling her roughly into his arms.</p><p>With a glad cry she parted her lips as he fiercely possessed her mouth. He pinned her against the door, the kiss raw and urgent. Lorraine clutched his shirt, needing to anchor herself. But their kiss wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy either of them.</p><p>Again and again he kissed her until all reason vanished. Then, abruptly, when she least expected it, he stopped and pulled away. He studied her face\u2014as if to gauge her feelings.</p><p>Lorraine boldly met his look and smiled. There was no turning back for them now and she knew it. So did Jack.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you again, Mr. Franklin,\u201d Marjorie Ellis mumbled, her expression embarrassed.</p><p>Gary stepped into her office and sat down at her desk in front of the computer. He\u2019d explained the basics of this program no fewer than five times and she still didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cI realize I\u2019ve been nothing but a bother to you since I took over this position,\u201d she went on, clenching her hands tensely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d he said, trying not to sound exasperated. Then he smiled. She might be a technophobe and totally disorganized, but she made up for that with a multitude of other talents. Her order numbers were phenomenal. For the past two months she\u2019d helped break the all-time sales records for his division. The truth of the matter was, Gary felt thrilled to have her on his team. She made him and the entire division look good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to repay you for all your help,\u201d she said as she stood behind the chair, watching him correct the problem.</p><p>Hitting a couple of keys, he cleared her screen.</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d she cried, leaning closer to the computer.</p><p>She wore a light rose scent that was actually quite lovely. He wasn\u2019t fond of women\u2019s perfumes, but this fragrance seemed to fit her perfectly, without overpowering the senses.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, reaching for a notebook. He wrote out the sequence of commands. \u201cIf this ever happens again, you\u2019ll know exactly what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thank you so much, Mr. Franklin.\u201d</p><p>It seemed silly for her to call him Mr. Franklin. None of the other associates did. \u201cCall me Gary.\u201d</p><p>A smile lit up her eyes. \u201cI was serious about wanting to repay you for your patience. I mean, if you\u2019d think it\u2019d be appropriate....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that. You\u2019re one of the kindest, most thoughtful men I\u2019ve ever met. LouAnn told me your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s been out of town and I was thinking maybe you\u2019d be interested in joining my son and me for dinner this evening.\u201d</p><p>Gary hated to admit how lonely he\u2019d been with Lorraine gone. It disturbed him that he hadn\u2019t heard from her yet\u2014but he wasn\u2019t phoning and checking up on her. No sir. Not after the way she\u2019d reacted to his earlier concern. Still, he did, all too often, have to set aside niggling worries about her. Where was she? Was she all right? But the rest of the time he was convinced that she was just being stubborn, asserting her independence and her need for privacy.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, accepting Marjorie\u2019s invitation before he could change his mind.</p><p>\u201cMy son\u2019s nine, and I\u2019ll have to warn you, he\u2019s really gung-ho about baseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like baseball myself,\u201d Gary told her. That was putting it mildly. He knew every major-league statistic for the past ten seasons.</p><p>\u201cAt the mere mention of baseball, Brice is likely to talk your ear off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t mind in the least.\u201d Gary had never been particularly interested in babies, but he happened to get along well with kids. Especially ones who liked baseball. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted to join you and your son for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you can come,\u201d Marjorie said happily. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you can come.\u201d She made it sound, somehow, as if he was doing her a favor. Not a bad feeling, he mused. Not bad at all.</p><p>His days were full here at the office, and he\u2019d been dating Lorraine for the better part of a year. Generally they spent time together every day. With her in Mexico, a giant hole had opened up in his life. He\u2019d tried to keep busy, but had run out of after-work projects within a week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs six-thirty all right?\u201d Marjorie asked, cutting into his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Gary returned to his office. He sat down at his desk and pulled out the phone number Lorraine had given him. Once again he toyed with the idea of calling this place in Mexico, leaving a message inquiring about her. And yet he didn\u2019t want his future father-in-law to think he was the type who overreacted. Thus far, he\u2019d resisted calling, but he wondered again if he should make some effort to reach Lorraine.</p> <p>He released a long-drawn-out sigh and decided he\u2019d give it a few more days.</p><p>That evening Gary arrived for dinner at Marjorie Ellis\u2019s place at precisely six-thirty. Grateful for the invitation, he\u2019d brought a small bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine.</p><p>Marjorie met him at the door, wearing black leggings and a long gray top. It was the first time he\u2019d seen her outside of work. Dressed this casually, she took him by surprise; he hadn\u2019t realized quite how attractive she was.</p><p>She held open the screen door and he stepped inside. Her house looked a lot like her office\u2014definitely lived-in, unmistakably personal. Despite the clutter of books, plants and artsy objects, he was impressed with the sense of welcome it exuded. \u201cI hope you like lasagna,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLove it.\u201d His favorite. She couldn\u2019t have chosen a better meal.</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>A lanky boy in a baseball cap ambled into the room, wearing a glove on his right hand.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Brice,\u201d Gary said. \u201cYour mom says you like baseball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Mr. Franklin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Gary said. \u201cSo what position do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortstop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI played shortstop in college.\u201d Gary liked the kid already.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Brice\u2019s eyes widened in admiration. \u201cSo did my dad, but he died.\u201d</p><p>Gary remembered hearing that Marjorie was a widow. Her husband had drowned in a boating accident three years earlier, but he couldn\u2019t recall who\u2019d told him that. Marjorie had done a terrific job with the boy, that was easy to see.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to throw you a few balls?\u201d Gary asked.</p><p>The boy beamed. \u201cCan we, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just put the lasagna in the oven so you have plenty of time,\u201d Marjorie said.</p><p>Her expression told Gary it wasn\u2019t necessary, that he didn\u2019t need to entertain her son; what she didn\u2019t realize was that he actually enjoyed this sort of thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you when dinner\u2019s on the table,\u201d she said as Gary headed out the door with Brice.</p> <p>Gary and the boy spent nearly an hour playing catch and talking sports before Marjorie called them in for dinner. In addition to lasagna, she served a garlicky Caesar salad, another of his favorites, and crusty French bread.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the best meals I\u2019ve had in months,\u201d Gary said with genuine enthusiasm.</p><p>To his surprise, Marjorie blushed, which struck him as quite endearing.</p><p>Brice went upstairs as soon as the table was cleared. Gary realized it was time he made his excuses, but found himself looking for a reason to linger.</p><p>Impulsively he tied an apron around his waist and insisted on helping with the dishes. \u201cMy mother always said those who cook shouldn\u2019t have to wash dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Marjorie protested. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d He plugged the sink, and before she could argue any further, filled it with hot, sudsy water.</p><p>\u201cGary...\u201d</p><p>She started to protest again, only this time he plopped a handful of bubbles onto the end of her nose. Her eyes grew huge with shock. Gary couldn\u2019t seem to stop laughing. Nor could he stop himself from kissing her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t intended it. But for one crazy second, he forgot about Lorraine, forgot he was going to be married in October. Forgot everything but the warm, wonderful woman in his arms.</p><p>He eased his mouth from hers, certain she\u2019d be upset. She had every right to be upset.</p><p>Marjorie stared at him, her lips moist from his kiss. Then she blinked a couple of times, looking bemused...and utterly charming.</p><p>\u201cShould I apologize?\u201d It was probably the most asinine thing he could have asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pretend it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he suggested. He dropped his hands from her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and managed a weak smile. \u201cAlthough I would like to say one thing.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted her to, but nodded, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a good kisser, Mr. Franklin.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Marjorie had done it again. He\u2019d acted on impulse, stepped out of character. She should chastise him, yell at him, throw him out on his ear. Instead, he left her home whistling, feeling better than he had in weeks.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t know what had happened to break his resolve. He\u2019d had every intention of saying his farewells and walking away. But when the moment came, he discovered he couldn\u2019t do it. His plan had been to see Lorraine safely to the suite, say a few words and be on his way. Even as he ran through all the familiar arguments about why they shouldn\u2019t make love, he was kissing her.</p><p>Acting purely on instinct, Jack continued the deep slow kisses. He knew very well that these few hours would have to sustain him through all the lonely years ahead.</p><p>She whimpered.</p><p>Moaning, he dragged his mouth from hers. He\u2019d dreamed of this endlessly, ever since the night she\u2019d lain in his arms. They gazed at each other and his breath rasped through his lips. He traced his index finger along her mouth, swollen now with his kisses.</p><p>She smiled sweetly and he was lost. He buried his face in her neck. Her head fell back and she slumped against the door, her fingers thrust deep in his hair.</p><p>Jack\u2019s first thought as they entered the bedroom was that they shouldn\u2019t be doing this. If he loved Lorraine, he wouldn\u2019t allow it to continue.</p><p>\u201cLorraine, no.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, her eyes wide and full of despair.</p><p>He broke away from her and sat on the edge of the bed. His body throbbed with the need to accept what she was offering. He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of turning away from her now. But he had to. This was the only way he had of letting Lorraine know how much he loved her. If he loved her any less, he\u2019d be on this bed with her. Any more, and it would kill him.</p><p>\u201cPlease...don\u2019t do this,\u201d she choked out. \u201cStay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d endured so much, been so strong. She\u2019d fought off Carlos\u2019s attack, engineered a risky escape, nursed him through the effects of a gunshot wound. But she looked fragile just then, as if his refusal was the one thing she couldn\u2019t endure. Didn\u2019t she know? Didn\u2019t she realize? Walking out of this bedroom now was the only way he had of proving his love.</p><p>He moved away, heaving a deep sigh in an effort to regain his composure. When he turned around, he noticed that Lorraine had used the time to straighten her clothes. She stood at the foot of the bed and watched him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to leave now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, close to tears.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>He hardened his heart. \u201cJust like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged with resignation. Jack knew firsthand how brave she could be. He loved that about her. He loved everything about her.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he whispered. He\u2019d taken one step when she hurled herself into his arms.</p><p>He knew he should leave while he had the strength. Instead, he closed his eyes and hugged her to him, savoring these final moments together, loving her so much it felt as if his heart would die without her.</p><p>She held him tightly and hid her face in his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go,\u201d she cried, clinging. \u201cNot like this. I need to tell you about Gary and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d His voice was harsh. This was exactly what he didn\u2019t want to happen. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cBut you need to know!\u201d Her arms tightened with the urgency of her emotions.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gripped her upper arms. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She went still. She looked down and her hair fell forward, blocking her face from his view. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end,\u201d she promised in a broken whisper.</p><p>It had to be. Jack wouldn\u2019t allow it to be anything but the end. She had a husband who loved and cherished her, and Jack wouldn\u2019t allow either of them to betray that trust.</p><p>He released her. Then he turned and walked out of the room, his pace fast as he closed the suite door and headed for the elevator.</p><p>He was half a block from the hotel when Lorraine came running after him. \u201cJack, wait!\u201d</p><p>He pretended not to hear her. The streets were chaotic, thronged with traffic. Cars honked, people yelled, buses spilled heavy exhaust fumes into the air.</p><p>\u201cJack! Please.\u201d Her frantic cry followed him.</p><p>Jack walked faster.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t over,\u201d she shouted. \u201cAll I need is time. I\u2019ll be back. As early as next week. I\u2019m coming back. Listen to me, I\u2019ll be back. Please listen.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn around, just walked away as fast as he could.</p><p>Lorraine stood in the middle of the congested sidewalk and watched Jack disappear into the crowd. Her heart told her to run after him and make him listen to the truth, make him understand.</p><p>He loved her. He had to, or he would\u2019ve taken her to bed. She couldn\u2019t have made her feelings or her desire for him any plainer. Physically she was frustrated. Emotionally, she was in mourning\u2014and in awe. His actions told her more about the kind of man he was than anything else he could have done.</p><p>Jack was right to go. Out of fairness to Gary, she had to let him.</p><p>She needed a few minutes to regain her composure before she reentered the hotel lobby.</p><p>A shower first and then bed. Feeling drained, exhausted to the bone, she stepped into the elevator.</p><p>On the ride to the top floor, she reviewed a list of things she had to do. By this time Gary must be worried sick. She\u2019d phone right away. She\u2019d return her father\u2019s call later, she thought, pulling the message slip from her pocket. There was nothing on it but his name and the time of his call\u2014this morning, at 9:45. But Jack would\u2014 She stopped, refusing to let her mind dwell on Jack. This was merely a short interlude apart. In a few days, she promised herself, she\u2019d be back.</p><p>She rubbed her eyes tiredly as she inserted the key into the security lock. Pausing, she glanced over her shoulder, surprised to note that the guard was nowhere in sight. So much for the promised protection.</p><p>The door clicked open and she walked inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you got here.\u201d</p><p>Jason Applebee sat in the living area eating grapes from a beautiful fruit basket.</p><p>The key fell out of Lorraine\u2019s hand and landed silently on the luxurious carpet.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I helped myself. A very nice gift from your friend Catherina, by the way. You weren\u2019t going to eat all this fruit yourself, were you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her question and shook his head. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re smarter than that, Lorraine. Why do you think I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>The shock of seeing Jason Applebee in her hotel suite left Lorraine stunned. It took her a long moment to recover.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know where I was?\u201d she asked with unreal calm. That was probably one of the less important questions, but the first to surface in her confused mind. \u201cWhat about...\u201d She swallowed her inquiry about the armed guard rather than alert him to the fact that there was one on the premises. She sincerely hoped the guard had gone for a sandwich\u2014and that he\u2019d return any minute. Jason had killed at least once and she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d hesitate to do so again.</p><p>\u201cYour father was quite informative,\u201d Jason told her before popping another juicy grape into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMy father would never speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s grin mocked her. \u201cHe would if he thought he was speaking to Gary Franklin, your dear fianc\u00e9 who\u2019s so terribly worried because he hasn\u2019t heard from you.\u201d He mimicked a Southern accent. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several lovely chats. He told me all about Jack Keller taking you to Mexico City. He even gave me the name of the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him you were Gary?\u201d The idea of him pretending to be her fianc\u00e9 infuriated her. But she directed the brunt of her anger at herself. How she regretted that chatty bus ride from M\u00e9rida to El Mirador. What a fool she\u2019d been to spill out the details of her personal life!</p> <p>\u201cActually I thought I was quite clever,\u201d Jason said smugly. \u201cYour father bought right in to that cornpone Southern bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get my room number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d He glanced around and gave a low whistle. \u201cPretty expensive digs you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you out of here,\u201d she demanded, putting on a brave front. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough damage as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Jason said, and sprang to his feet. \u201cJust give me what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s heart sank. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get both pieces of the Kukulcan Star in the first place?\u201d She had to find a way to distract him. The phones were out of reach; he\u2019d grab her before she could get to one. Her only hope was to make a run for the door and pray the guard had returned. There was a chance, a small one, if she kept her wits about her.</p><p>\u201cYou know about the Kukulcan Star?\u201d That appeared to surprise him.</p><p>\u201cI have my ways, too.\u201d</p><p>He nodded approvingly. \u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019d like to know,\u201d she said, pretending to be curious. A man as self-absorbed as Jason would delight in bragging about what he\u2019d done. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly have managed this on your own,\u201d she murmured. She wondered if she was overdoing it.</p><p>Apparently not. \u201cAh, but I did. Suffice it to say I\u2019d been studying Professor Raventos\u2019s books for years. When I wrote, he was impressed by my knowledge of the Maya and my appreciation of Kukulcan. The two of us struck up a friendship and he invited me along on the dig. He trusted me.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had trusted him, too.</p> <p>Jason shrugged. \u201cUnfortunately, after he found the Star, my esteemed colleague became...redundant.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine shuddered, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cSome people assume it\u2019s luck, being in the right place at the right time. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s careful planning. However, even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry. Sometimes another person interferes....\u201d He advanced menacingly toward her. \u201cGive it to me, Lorraine.\u201d</p><p>She backed slowly toward the door, arms behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed for it before. I\u2019d hate to hurt you, but if I have to, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re smart. Why would you murder people? Why would you rob a country of its heritage? Is it greed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d he asked, shaking his head. \u201cYou really don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Explain it to me. Murder, Jason? Murder?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again. \u201cActually, the first time was the hardest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jason.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his hand. \u201cGive me my Star. It\u2019s mine, and when I have it I\u2019ll reveal myself to my people. Glory will return to the Maya.\u201d</p><p>He was crazy. He had to be.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, I can\u2019t.\u201d She was close to making her move.</p><p>Jason released an exasperated sigh. \u201cI was afraid you were going to say that. Lorraine, you\u2019re a disappointment to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am? You\u2019re the one who tricked me into lying for you.\u201d She had to keep him talking. \u201cYou planted both artifacts on me. You knew I hadn\u2019t seen my father since I was a child, and yet you purposely destroyed our visit. You\u2019re despicable. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, there are worse things. Like what\u2019s going to happen to you if you don\u2019t give me back my Star.\u201d He shook his head again, his expression sorrowful. \u201cIt would be a pity. I\u2019ve grown quite fond of you. In other circumstances we might have been very good...friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cTrust me, Lorraine, you want me to have the Star. The alternative isn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d She laughed incredulously. And then she ran out the door, slamming it in her wake. The first thing she noticed was that the guard was still gone. With no time to lose, she didn\u2019t even consider waiting for the elevator. Instead, she sprinted for the stairway. At the top of the stairs she caught sight of the guard\u2019s lifeless body. His throat had been slit.</p><p>Lorraine gasped at the sight. Fear and horror propelled her into action. She had to do something drastic or soon she\u2019d be as dead as that guard.</p><p>Jason was directly behind her, but she had an advantage. Back in high school she\u2019d learned how to slide down a stairway railing. It was quite a balancing act\u2014and it was how she\u2019d broken her arm. She hadn\u2019t tried it since then, but now... What other choice did she have? She eluded Jason long enough to hop onto the metal railing. The difficulty was in maintaining her balance. Perched sideways, with her arms held straight out, she slid down the first railing.</p><p>Jason was quick; the sound of his feet bounding down the stairs echoed in the narrow stairwell. He could shoot her, she realized, but she was of no value to him dead. He wanted the Star; what he didn\u2019t know was that she no longer had it.</p><p>The instant she started down, she screamed for help at the top of her lungs. Unfortunately she\u2019d lost her travel dictionary and didn\u2019t know how to say it in Spanish. Not that it seemed to matter. No one heard.</p><p>She was a full staircase ahead of Jason when he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t make me do something I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>For all the racket she made, anyone might have thought she was being murdered right then and there. Still no one came. She didn\u2019t want to believe that Jason would actually kill her, but after seeing the guard, she had no doubt he\u2019d do it. He was insane. Completely and dangerously insane.</p><p>Lorraine stopped thinking after that, concentrating, instead, on her escape. Balance, slide, run across the landing to the next set of stairs. She did it three times, four. And never did she see or hear even a single person. Except Jason, who pounded remorselessly after her.</p><p>The stairwell came out by the pool. The area was filled with beautiful, tanned men and women lounging with grease-slicked bodies in reclining chairs, sipping tropical drinks and listening to a mariachi band.</p><p>Lorraine burst onto the scene, took a second to assess the situation and raced in the direction of the hotel lobby. She was shocked that Jason was so close behind her.</p><p>She had to hand it to him, he was quite the athlete. And quite the actor. He laughed and called after her in Spanish, words she couldn\u2019t understand. Most people weren\u2019t listening or paying attention, though, focused, instead, on the band.</p><p>Jason caught up with her between the pool and the entrance to the hotel. With almost no effort he threw her, kicking and screaming, over his shoulder and carried her off. His strength astonished her. He handled her as if she weighed next to nothing.</p><p>She pummeled his back with her fists like a madwoman. \u201cHelp!\u201d she screamed, frantic to have someone, anyone, notice what was happening. \u201cI need help! He\u2019s going to murder me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ran up my credit cards, I would, too,\u201d a man, obviously half-drunk, yelled back.</p><p>\u201cThis is no joke,\u201d she screamed.</p><p>\u201cIt never is,\u201d the same man shouted.</p><p>All Lorraine\u2019s struggles did was tire her. After a while she gave up, convinced it was useless.</p><p>\u201cThe time for fun and games is over. Where\u2019s the Kukulcan Star?\u201d Jason demanded once more through gritted teeth. His hands tightened painfully around her legs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, who does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Department of Antiquities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorraine, you don\u2019t know how this disappoints me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does. Are you going to kill me the way you did that guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He continued walking toward the street. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I like you too much for that.\u201d He set her feet back on the pavement. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve already promised your friend here the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>When he put her down, she whirled around to see Carlos. The man\u2019s smile was as ugly as his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, did I forget to tell you I\u2019d run into a friend of yours?\u201d Jason asked ever so sweetly.</p><p>He was going to drown his sorrows in a bottle of good tequila, Jack decided. But once he sat down at the sidewalk restaurant, the desire to get drunk left him. He ordered a beer, instead.</p><p>He recalled the last time he\u2019d been in a cantina. La Ruta Maya. That was where Lorraine had left the boat and gotten herself into a mess of trouble. He\u2019d been lucky to find her when he did. Relieved, too\u2014not that he\u2019d let her know it.</p><p>Then he thought about Pucuro, that nasty little town with its nasty little dock. Or rather, without it. He laughed outright at the image; he was only sorry he\u2019d missed the actual experience. Several people turned in his direction, openly curious about what he found so amusing.</p><p>His last bottle of finely aged scotch had been used for medicinal purposes, more specifically to cleanse his shoulder wound. Lorraine had painstakingly nursed him back to health. He remembered their many conversations, about their lives, about movies, and the night they\u2019d lain together and stared at the reflection of the moon in the water.</p><p>What Lorraine had taught him during their time together was his own capacity to make himself vulnerable to someone. He\u2019d told her more about his background and soldiering experiences than he\u2019d ever told anyone.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t lie to himself about the pain he felt. It was as agonizing as anything physical. Walking away from her had been the most difficult, dangerous thing he\u2019d ever done. Dangerous because he wasn\u2019t sure he could become again the man he used to be. Without Lorraine and without his old beliefs, his old attitudes\u2014where did that leave him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held up his glass and stared into the amber liquid, suddenly craving oblivion. All he could think about was Lorraine. Sitting in a sidewalk bar this close to her hotel made his thoughts inevitable.</p><p>Finishing his beer, he decided to catch a cab to his own hotel when he strolled by a telephone. Two steps past it, he stopped, turned and went back.</p><p>He dialed the operator and put the call on his credit card, then waited for the connection to Boothill, Texas, to go through.</p><p>His best friend\u2019s wife answered on the third ring. \u201cJack, is that you?\u201d Letty shouted.</p> <p>The connection wasn\u2019t the best. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Is Murphy around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s vaccinating calves, but listen, I\u2019m glad you phoned. Someone by the name of Thomas Dancy called for you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas?\u201d he asked in surprise. \u201cI spoke to him last night.\u201d But, in retrospect, he realized that he hadn\u2019t given Thomas a number, a place to reach him. He\u2019d only mentioned the name of Lorraine\u2019s hotel, not where he himself was staying. And Thomas would\u2019ve been able to track down Murphy easily enough; on more than one occasion, Jack had mentioned Murphy and the cattle ranch he owned in the Texas hill country.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about you escorting his daughter out of Mexico?\u201d An infant wailed in the background. Their third in four years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you coming for a visit? Murphy would love to see you. So would I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d Jack admitted. One thing was certain: he had to leave Mexico for a while. Get away from the memories and the pain. Reestablish his emotional equilibrium. \u201cGive the kids each a kiss from me,\u201d Jack said, forcing himself to sound as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cHold on just a minute,\u201d Letty said. \u201cI\u2019ve got more news for you.\u201d</p><p>Jack heard a clank as she set the telephone aside. Almost immediately the baby\u2019s cries ceased. News? The last time Letty had something to tell him it was about the third addition to their family.</p><p>\u201cAre you still there?\u201d Letty asked when she got back on the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said. He thought of joking that it was costing him five bucks a minute for her to burp the baby, but in reality he wouldn\u2019t have cared if it was ten times that amount. Letty and Murphy were as close as Jack had to a real family, and right now he needed them. Needed to know that couples in love could find happiness in this world.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Letty said, \u201cgetting back to that call from your friend Nancy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancy,\u201d Jack corrected.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you know who I mean. He was quite concerned about his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anyone named Gary... Darn, I can\u2019t think of the last name. Anyway, he\u2019s connected to this Dancy\u2019s daughter, but I don\u2019t think he told me how. Not that it matters.\u201d</p><p>Jack stiffened. \u201cI know who you mean. What about him?\u201d</p><p>Her voice seemed to be fading, and then it grew loud again. \u201cDancy said he\u2019d been getting phone calls from this Gary guy, and then today someone entirely different contacted him and claimed to be the same person. Your friend seemed concerned about it.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s hand tightened on the receiver. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much more to tell you. Dancy left a message at the hotel you mentioned, but you weren\u2019t registered and his daughter hadn\u2019t checked in yet. He didn\u2019t have any way of getting in touch with you, and he seemed pretty upset about all this. He told the first guy everything he knew about the two of you in Mexico City. Now he\u2019s worried, and rightly so, it seems.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s mind raced. It could only be one person.</p><p>Jason Applebee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he said in a rush.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll visit soon. I promise.\u201d He replaced the receiver, then stood there thinking about what he\u2019d just learned.</p><p>This adventure wasn\u2019t over yet.</p><p>Gary knew the minute he drove onto the freeway that he was going to Marjorie\u2019s house, even though his ostensible destination was the mall. He had the perfect excuse to stop by\u2014a signed Ken Griffey, Jr., rookie card that Brice had been dying to see.</p><p>He intended to say something along the lines of dropping over because he was in the neighborhood. A stretch and certainly not very original, but he didn\u2019t care. He had to know.</p><p>Since their kiss, he hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her. She dominated his every waking thought, and while they\u2019d agreed to put the whole thing behind them, it hadn\u2019t happened. As a result, their working relationship was strained. Their coworkers would soon guess, and Gary felt it was time to clear the air.</p><p>Saturday morning had found him restless and at odds. His original intention had been to do a little shopping...but then, why had he taken the baseball card with him? He didn\u2019t know who he was trying to fool. He enjoyed shopping about as much as he enjoyed paying taxes.</p><p>When he headed toward the freeway entrance, he admitted that seeing Marjorie was what he\u2019d planned to do all along. Granted, his method lacked finesse. Stopping by unannounced and uninvited wasn\u2019t the most brilliant idea he\u2019d ever come up with. On the other hand, maybe she approved of spontaneity.</p><p>He parked on the street, walked up to the front porch and rang the doorbell.</p><p>Marjorie came to the door. He could tell she was surprised to see him. \u201cGary...hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He resisted the urge to say he\u2019d made a mistake and hightail it back to his car. \u201cIs Brice here?\u201d He sounded like a kid, he thought irritably. \u201cI have that baseball card I told him about and I thought he\u2019d like to see it.\u201d</p><p>She opened the screen door to let him in. \u201cThe signed Ken Griffey, Jr., card? I heard him talking about it to his friends.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d done it again\u2014put him at ease. It seemed to be a specialty of hers.</p><p>\u201cBrice has baseball practice on Saturday mornings.\u201d</p><p>Gary supposed he should have thought of that since Brice had mentioned it. But then it wasn\u2019t really Brice he\u2019d come to visit. He knew he was staring at Marjorie and he couldn\u2019t stop. Even in a faded pair of jeans and a sleeveless top she was beautiful. For the first time he noticed she had on a pair of yellow rubber gloves. One hand held a can of cleansing powder, the other a sponge.</p><p>\u201cI was just about to take a break and have a cup of coffee,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you care to join me?\u201d</p><p>Gary nodded enthusiastically and followed her into the kitchen. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should thank you for dragging me away from it,\u201d she told him, peeling off the rubber gloves. \u201cIt\u2019s my least favorite thing to do.\u201d</p><p>He moved a stack of newspapers from one of the kitchen chairs and sat down. She poured them each a mug, then sat across from him. She frowned, staring into her coffee as if she\u2019d discovered something floating there.</p><p>He took a deep breath; it was time to speak honestly. \u201cShowing Brice the baseball card was only an excuse,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced away from him.</p><p>\u201cI know we agreed to forget about the kiss...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think we should,\u201d she said, still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be any more honest than that.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Her voice was so soft he had to strain to make out the words. \u201cBut you\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He didn\u2019t need Marjorie to remind him. But he hadn\u2019t heard a word from Lorraine, and when he\u2019d finally broken down and called her father early this morning, the conversation had left him more confused than ever. Her father seemed to think Gary had phoned the night before. He hadn\u2019t, and said so. Then Thomas Dancy had gotten excited and insisted he had to get off the phone.</p><p>\u201cGary, it isn\u2019t a good idea for you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come...and yet I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lasagna\u2019s good, Gary, but not that good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and the tension between them diminished. He reached across the table and took hold of her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Pulling free, she walked over to the sink, facing the window.</p><p>\u201cMarjorie?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged\u2014to someone else. I like you, Gary, more than I should, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like me?\u201d His heart reacted with a surge of joy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d hoped, but that wasn\u2019t the same thing.</p><p>She closed her eyes and shook her head.</p><p>Gary used that moment to his advantage. He got up from the table and went over to her. He was tired of all this talk, all this craziness. The incredible kiss they\u2019d shared earlier had been a fluke, or so he\u2019d convinced himself. Nothing had ever been that good before. Not with Lorraine, not with any woman. He had to kiss Marjorie again, had to see if it was possible to repeat this feeling.</p><p>\u201cGary?\u201d Her eyes widened as he pulled her into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cOnce more,\u201d was all he said, and then he lowered his mouth to hers. She groaned in welcome and that was all it took. Soon they were kissing with an urgency and need normally reserved for the bedroom.</p><p>Leaning against the sink, Marjorie clutched his shirt with both hands, as though she needed help to hold herself upright. By the time they broke apart, she was making soft whimpering sounds and his knees were weak. They stared at each other.</p><p>Marjorie\u2019s lips were swollen from the explosion of sensuality between them. Because he felt the need to touch her, Gary traced his finger down the side of her face and along her mouth. He didn\u2019t know whether he was doing it to apologize or to entreat her for another kiss.</p><p>She looked at him and smiled. Slowly, sweetly. It was his undoing. This time, however, the kiss was as gentle as the previous one had been uncontrolled. To his shock, it was no less sensual...and perhaps even more so.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Marjorie broke off the kiss and leaned her forehead against his chest.</p><p>He longed to argue with her but didn\u2019t have the breath. If the kissing was this fabulous, he thought, still dazed, what would their lovemaking be like? She must be wondering, too.</p><p>Her hand stopped him when he moved to unfasten her blouse. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her, questioning. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She seemed surer this time as she straightened her blouse. \u201cI think you should go now.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, certain he\u2019d misunderstood. But when she hurried to the front door and held it open for him, there wasn\u2019t any doubt.</p><p>\u201cMarjorie?\u201d</p><p>She looked close to tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, Gary, more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d Leaving was the last thing on his mind.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t... We\u2019re incapable of communicating any longer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I see it.\u201d They\u2019d been doing a pretty good job a couple of minutes earlier.</p><p>\u201cPlease go.\u201d She unlatched the screen door.</p><p>He had no choice but to walk out. Standing on the other side of the threshold, he tried to reason with her one final time.</p><p>\u201cMy letter of resignation will be on your desk Monday morning,\u201d she whispered, her eyes bright with unshed tears.</p> <p>She closed the door.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>The murderous look in Carlos\u2019s eyes told Lorraine the pleasure he anticipated in killing her. She knew with certainty that he intended to torture and rape her first.</p><p>Jason had shoved her into the backseat of a car and bound her hands, almost before she realized what he was doing. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Jason shrugged indifferently. \u201cYou brought it on yourself when you handed over my Star. Come on, you had to know I\u2019d be looking for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Kukulcan Star didn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but it does. The person it didn\u2019t belong to is you, but despite that you gave it away. You had no right.\u201d</p><p>Carlos jumped into the front seat and started the car, revving the engine loudly. The two men exchanged a few gruff words in Spanish before Jason reluctantly shoved back the seat and got into the front next to Carlos. No sooner had he slammed the door than the vehicle sped off, accelerating wildly. Lorraine was thrown from one side to the other as the car barreled around corners.</p><p>Traffic was horrendous. The hotel was situated on the outskirts of the city, closer to the airport. Tossed around as she was, all Lorraine could see were the tops of high-rise buildings, many with bright neon names and logos.</p><p>Once, when she did manage to sit up and look out the car window, she thought she might have seen Jack. Her heart instantly soared with hope, which faded almost as quickly. What she\u2019d seen, she decided, was a man in a shirt similar to the one Jack had been wearing. The faint hope that he\u2019d come to her rescue died a sudden death. It wasn\u2019t going to happen. He\u2019d said his goodbyes and had no way of knowing the trouble she was in. If she survived this ordeal, it would be by her own wits. Ruthlessly hurled around the backseat of a fast-moving vehicle, hands bound, she had few if any options. But that didn\u2019t prevent her from formulating her escape.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a way to negotiate myself out of this?\u201d she asked Jason, thinking she\u2019d appeal to his sense of decency, if he had one. That was highly questionable, of course, but anything seemed worth a try. They\u2019d been on the road about thirty minutes. \u201cI don\u2019t have any argument with Carlos,\u201d she began.</p> <p>\u201cYou embarrassed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose. Tell him how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>Jason relayed her message, to which Carlos responded with a hearty laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing Carlos wants at this point is revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he taking me?\u201d She could see that they\u2019d left the city proper and were now driving through a sort of shantytown, desperately poor, that went on for miles. At least an hour passed before they reached a two-lane highway that was freshly paved and seemed to lead directly toward the jungle.</p><p>Surely Jason had some idea what Carlos intended. She asked him.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Jason said, as if it was of little concern to him.</p><p>\u201cI...know who has the Star.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo late, Lorraine,\u201d Jason continued, sounding bored. \u201cThe time for deal-making is long past.\u201d His gaze darkened as he glared at her. \u201cYou gave away my Star. It was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, please.\u201d</p><p>Carlos pulled off the main road onto a dirt one. A plume of dust followed them. They hadn\u2019t gone more than a couple of hundred feet when he slammed on the brakes. The sudden stop propelled Lorraine forward until her face struck the seat in front of her. Pain exploded in her face, and her nose started spurting blood.</p><p>Jason yelled at Carlos\u2014obviously something about his lack of driving skills\u2014and Carlos yelled back. Lorraine couldn\u2019t understand most of it, although bastardo was a word she had no difficulty recognizing.</p><p>Blood dripped profusely from her nose. Carlos climbed out of the car and shoved back the driver\u2019s seat, then caught her by her arm and jerked her roughly out. With no way to maintain her balance, she stumbled, falling onto the ground. This clearly angered Carlos; he reached for her a second time and backhanded her across the face. The pain stunned her, and it wasn\u2019t until her mouth filled with fresh blood that she realized her recently healed lip had split open again.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jason shouted. He bent down and helped her up.</p><p>Lorraine pressed her tongue to the corner of her mouth. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, her eyes imploring him. A bloody nose and split lip were minor injuries compared to what they planned for her; she was sure of that much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you get it back,\u201d she said next. \u201cThe Star...\u201d By now she was trembling with fear. Her only hope of surviving this ordeal lay with Jason.</p><p>Carlos pushed Jason aside and came at her again. Dammit! Lorraine thought. She wasn\u2019t going to let him use her as a punching bag! She bounded to her feet with a dexterity she hadn\u2019t known she possessed and ran at him with her shoulder lowered, the way she\u2019d seen linebackers charge on a football field. He hadn\u2019t expected her to defend herself and was caught off guard.</p><p>Carlos stumbled backward. He scrambled up again, fists swinging. Lorraine ducked in the nick of time, then kicked him in the groin. Hard. As hard as she could.</p><p>Leaning against the car, Jason roared with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re a little hellion, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t waste time answering. Nor did she give Carlos, who\u2019d doubled over, more than a passing glance. This was the perfect time to make a run for it. If she got back to the road, she might find someone driving by, someone who could help her. Having her hands tied was a definite hindrance, but she still managed to run.</p><p>Jason\u2019s laughter echoed from behind her. At least he wasn\u2019t chasing her. For that she was grateful.</p><p>Carlos shouted something at him and then she heard the distinct sound of a weapon fired. She glanced over her shoulder and gave a spontaneous cry of horror and shock.</p><p>Carlos had shot Jason in the head. Blood had sprayed across the hood of the vehicle and he\u2019d slumped to the ground in a sitting position, his eyes open and staring in her direction.</p><p>The next bullet whizzed past her ear.</p><p>Lorraine screamed in terror and veered off the dirt road and into the jungle. Thrashing through the undergrowth, she blundered forward, not stopping, not thinking, running for her life. One wrong step and it would all be over.</p><p>She had to hurry. Had to find a way to think clearly, to outsmart this maniac and save herself. She knew that if he shot and killed her on the run, she wouldn\u2019t face the torment of rape, wouldn\u2019t have to endure his sadistic revenge.</p><p>But she wanted to live. That instinct overpowered everything else. She refused to give up, refused to let Carlos win, refused to die.</p><p>Splinters flew from a nearby tree as a second bullet narrowly missed her. Adrenaline surged through her and she ran faster than she\u2019d thought possible, struggling to maintain her balance as she crashed through the tangled undergrowth and jumped over exposed roots.</p><p>The paved road was within sight, not that it would help her now. She had to stay hidden as much as possible. If Carlos wanted to use her for target practice, she wouldn\u2019t make it easy for him by racing down an open highway.</p><p>The moment her feet hit the smooth pavement, she felt as if she were flying. She cut across the highway at an angle and into the jungle on the other side without a pause. She heard a car approach behind her and prayed it would distract Carlos long enough to keep him from noticing where she\u2019d entered the trees.</p><p>In another minute Lorraine knew she\u2019d made a mistake. She hadn\u2019t gone more than twenty or thirty yards when she saw the cliff. Breathing painfully, her heart pounding, she stared down at the rocks jutting out of the river below. A jump or fall would kill her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d she wept frantically. She backed away from the ledge and started running parallel to the cliff, heading into the brilliant sunlight with the hope that if it blinded her, it would blind Carlos, too.</p><p>She raced ahead, squinting, breathless, fighting panic and fear. Her left eye had started to swell and she could barely see out of it.</p><p>Perhaps that explained why she didn\u2019t see Carlos until it was too late. He stood with the handgun pointed directly at her, his shoulders heaving with exertion.</p><p>Lorraine stopped abruptly. She couldn\u2019t breathe until she leaned forward, arms lifted awkwardly behind her, hauling in deep drafts of air. What surprised her was how calm she felt. Emotionless. Maybe he\u2019d already killed her and she just hadn\u2019t figured it out.</p><p>Then Carlos smiled, that smug smile she\u2019d seen far too often, and Lorraine realized she was very much alive. But his look of triumph told her she wouldn\u2019t be for long.</p><p>Marjorie Ellis walked back into her kitchen and sank onto a chair. She\u2019d been serious when she told Gary she intended to hand in her letter of resignation first thing Monday morning. She didn\u2019t want to leave her job, not when she was beginning to establish a new career, form new friendships, make more money. She was proud of her growing success in the corporate world.</p><p>But what else could she do?</p><p>She covered her face with her hands as she tried to analyze why everything had gone so wrong.</p><p>This attraction to Gary Franklin had started early on, she admitted, almost from the day she\u2019d been hired. After Mark\u2019s death, she\u2019d continued working at the bank, but she related well to people, and several of her friends had suggested she try sales. It\u2019d taken her a year to find the courage to give up the security of her nine-to-five job. Then she\u2019d had a couple of negative interviews before landing the job with Med-X. She\u2019d fit in right away; in fact, she\u2019d succeeded beyond her expectations. Everyone had been kind and helpful, offering helpful advice and frequent reassurance.</p><p>Especially Gary Franklin.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d liked him immediately. In those early weeks he\u2019d been stiff and just a little pompous, but she\u2019d soon discovered that was all a front. She\u2019d worked hard to get him to smile that first time and felt like she\u2019d made a million-dollar sale when he did. His smiles seemed to come more easily and more often after that.</p><p>Only recently had she found out he was engaged. It\u2019d shocked her, and discouraged her, too. He\u2019d never spoken of his fianc\u00e9e. Not one word. She supposed he was the type of man who left his personal life outside the office.</p><p>Then she\u2019d learned that his fianc\u00e9e was vacationing out of the country. In Mexico, according to office rumors. It made no sense to Marjorie. The woman Gary had chosen to marry was taking an extended vacation only a few months before her wedding. An extended solo vacation.</p><p>Her mistake, Marjorie acknowledged, had been inviting Gary to dinner and introducing him to Brice. The two of them had hit it off instantly. And it wasn\u2019t just Brice who was crazy about Gary. She\u2019d set herself up for heartache and had done it knowing there was no other possible outcome. Still, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she sent him away, Gary had looked lost and at loose ends, a feeling she understood all too well. She\u2019d loved her husband, grieved for him\u2014and now she was so terribly lonely. Since Gary was lonely, too, it\u2019d seemed like a simple act of kindness to ask him over for dinner. A way of reciprocating after all his help. Deep inside, she\u2019d known her invitation was more than a courtesy, more than a gesture of friendliness or compassion. He was engaged; she should avoid any social involvement. But she craved his companionship, his presence. She\u2019d debated the wisdom of it all morning, then thrown caution to the wind and put the burden of refusal on his shoulders. The quickness of his acceptance had calmed her worries. If he didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with having dinner at her house, she didn\u2019t have to be concerned, either.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have been more surprised when he kissed her that night. And in all honesty she couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. She reminded herself that it was wrong to feel like this. And what about Brice? Had she set him up for heartache, too? He and Gary had talked baseball all through dinner, and Brice had talked about Gary constantly ever since. It was Gary this and Gary that. Nor had it hurt any that Gary had spent an hour playing catch with her son. It was almost as if he\u2019d come to her house to visit Brice\u2014not that Marjorie minded in the least.</p><p>\u201cI think we should marry him,\u201d her son had announced when she tucked him into bed that night.</p><p>\u201cBrice, I barely know the man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen invite him back.\u201d</p><p>How easy this courtship and marriage business was to a nine-year-old boy. \u201cHe\u2019s already engaged.\u201d</p><p>Brice\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou mean he\u2019s gonna marry someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta do something, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny suggestions?\u201d she asked facetiously.</p><p>He frowned and shook his head. \u201cCook for him again. He really liked your lasagna.\u201d</p><p>Even now, Marjorie couldn\u2019t prevent a smile as she recalled his comment. It sounded like the corny old-fashioned advice her grandmother used to dispense.</p><p>\u201cMom! Mom!\u201d Brice burst through the door from baseball practice. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>Marjorie glanced at the clock, surprised that practice was already over. No, it was eleven-thirty, later than she\u2019d realized. \u201cIn here,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she agreed, forcing herself to smile.</p><p>\u201cI saw Gary out front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGary Franklin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was sitting in his car and he looked pretty miserable. Did the two of you have a fight or something?\u201d</p><p>Marjorie wasn\u2019t sure how to answer that. \u201cUm, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to come inside, but he said he couldn\u2019t. I was hoping he\u2019d have time to play catch with me, but he said he had to get home. Then you know what he did? Can you guess?\u201d Brice\u2019s eyes blazed with excitement. \u201cHe gave me his Ken Griffey, Jr., signed rookie card. Gave it to me, Mom.\u201d Her son held up the card as if he was holding a map for buried treasure. \u201cIs that the coolest thing that\u2019s happened to me in my entire life or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave you the card?\u201d Marjorie wanted to make certain she hadn\u2019t misunderstood him.</p><p>\u201cFor free,\u201d Brice assured her.</p> <p>\u201cDid...did he say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just that he wanted me to have it.\u201d Brice grew quiet then. After a moment he said, \u201cI still think we should marry him. I loved Dad and everything, and I miss him a lot, but I think he\u2019d like Gary, too.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie had felt the same thing herself.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Brice asked, looking up at her. \u201cMarry him, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Luckily the phone rang before she had a chance to respond. Brice charged across the room as if answering the phone before it rang a second time was a matter of dire consequence.</p><p>He listened for a moment, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d He handed her the portable receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, wishing she\u2019d asked Brice to take a number so she could return the call. She wasn\u2019t in the mood for a chatty conversation with one of her friends from the bank or, worse, a spiel from a telephone solicitor.</p><p>Her disinterested greeting was met with a moment of silence. She was about to check the phone\u2019s batteries when she heard, \u201cIt\u2019s Gary.\u201d</p><p>Now it was her turn to lapse into silence.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said. She could hear traffic sounds; he was obviously calling from his car. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to quit Med-X. If you refuse to work with me anymore, I\u2019ll understand. You can report to a different supervisor. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll request a transfer on Monday morning. You won\u2019t have to see me again.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie felt an immediate sense of loss. She wanted to see Gary, considered him her ally and friend. Her intense attraction to him had nothing to do with that. The thought of working at Med-X and not being able to go to him with her problems devastated her. No one else was as patient, as understanding. Not only that, she\u2019d taken over the territory he\u2019d covered before his promotion. She\u2019d found his advice invaluable in dealing with his former clients. Half her success was actually due to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, Gary,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Being a perceptive child, Brice left the room.</p><p>\u201cCould we talk?\u201d Gary asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Marjorie couldn\u2019t see that it would do any good. She\u2019d only want him to kiss her again and didn\u2019t know if she could disguise her feelings, especially outside the office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Gary said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t you, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have kissed you.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie closed her eyes. \u201cIt was what I wanted.\u201d What she\u2019d dreamed about for weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a good idea for us to talk except at work,\u201d she felt compelled to say. \u201cIt\u2019s better for us both if we nip this in the bud and not see each other again. I\u2019ll draft my letter of resignation over the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about quitting Med-X?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I request a transfer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The temptation to stay was strong, but she couldn\u2019t let him uproot his life because of her. He\u2019d been with the company far longer than she had. Her leaving was the fairer alternative. Briefly she considered asking for a transfer herself, but knew she\u2019d still see him at the quarterly sales conferences and at other company events. Anyway, she couldn\u2019t tear her son away from his school, his friends, his familiar surroundings.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess there\u2019s nothing I can do, is there? If you think of something, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gary...\u201d She felt like crying.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d he asked once more.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. She turned off the phone.</p><p>Jack had witnessed terror in his life, seen it on the faces of others, even been the cause of it. But nothing from his past could have prepared him for what he felt when he saw Lorraine race across the highway with her hands bound.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d learned that Jason Applebee had tricked Thomas into giving him information about Lorraine, Jack had tried to reach her at the hotel. When there was no answer in her room, he hurried back. By pure luck he caught sight of her in the rear seat of a black car. Two men in front. Even a fleeting glance told him the driver was Carlos. The other had to be Jason. In a moment of craziness, Jack found a man with a vehicle and paid him an outrageous amount of money for the use of it.</p><p>Still, he was too far behind Carlos and Jason to catch more than a glimpse of the car as they sped through the streets and past the shantytowns that bordered the city. Somewhere along the way he lost sight of the car and drove around frantically, searching with no success. Then he\u2019d taken the jungle road, and that was when he happened upon Lorraine. Carlos wasn\u2019t far behind. Jack saw him run into the trees at a different angle.</p><p>He slammed on the brakes and leaped out of the vehicle, racing after Carlos. He had no weapon. No gun. Not even a knife. But his intuition told him any delay would mean Lorraine\u2019s death. If his lack of weapons meant he died defending her, then so be it.</p><p>The jungle was impossibly thick, and Carlos was nowhere to be seen. Jack soon found what Lorraine must have discovered. A few yards into the dense vegetation, was the edge of a cliff. The river twisted around the jagged rocks below. Jack had never been fond of heights and stepped cautiously back.</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s scream propelled him into action and he fought his way toward her.</p><p>Carlos had her on the ground. Despite her struggles, he\u2019d managed to rip off her blouse and in the process beaten her nearly senseless. Her face was bloody, her eyes swollen shut, and still she fought him, still she struggled.</p><p>Jack had never loved her more or admired her courage as much. With a cry that came from deep within his throat, he launched himself at Carlos.</p><p>Swinging around as he crouched over Lorraine, Carlos pointed a gun directly at him. To Jack\u2019s astonishment, Lorraine heaved herself up from the ground and slammed her head into Carlos\u2019s arm. The gun flew out of his hand and into the trees.</p><p>The reprieve was all Jack needed. He charged the other man, throwing him off Lorraine, but the force of the attack stole his breath. The wound in his shoulder had only partially healed, and his stamina and strength were much lower than normal.</p><p>What Jack lacked in brute strength, he compensated for with skill and finesse, punching Carlos repeatedly on his injured arm.</p><p>The man grunted with pain and returned the favor, barreling his ham-size fist into Jack\u2019s bandaged shoulder.</p><p>Pain spiraled down Jack\u2019s arm and he fell to his knees in agony. For an instant the world went black as he dealt with the crippling pain.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Lorraine shouted at Jack\u2019s tormented cry. With a shout of outrage, she flung herself at Carlos, shoving him off balance.</p><p>Carlos staggered, then whirled around, ramming her into a tree. She slumped, unconscious, against its base. Her action\u2014her courage\u2014gave Jack time to let the stars dissolve from his eyes.</p><p>As soon as he could, he entered the fray again, going after Carlos with a vengeance. Carlos didn\u2019t wait for Jack, but raged after him, knocking him off his feet. He had the superior strength, but Jack was fighting for Lorraine\u2019s life as well as his own.</p><p>They broke apart and circled each other. Jack\u2019s eyes held the other man\u2019s, letting him know that this would be a fight to the end. Either he died or Carlos died. There could be no compromise.</p><p>In his weakened condition, Jack knew Carlos had the advantage. His strength would only hold out for so long. He\u2019d lose, and when he did, the bastard would kill Lorraine.</p><p>Carlos lunged for him first, and they ventured dangerously close to the cliff\u2019s edge. Jack heard the rush of the water below. One wrong move and he\u2019d fall to a certain death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw that Lorraine had regained consciousness and had started to scrabble frantically, kicking through the underbrush for the gun.</p><p>With his back to the cliff, Jack couldn\u2019t gauge how close he was to the edge. It was then that he knew what he had to do. There was no other way to save Lorraine. No other way to stop Carlos.</p><p>Already he could feel his strength leaving him. Carlos had the momentum, the stamina...the hatred.</p><p>Jack acted quickly\u2014out of need and determination. Out of love. He reached for Carlos and with his last reservoir of strength propelled them both toward the ledge.</p> <p>Carlos threw out his arms in a desperate effort to save himself, but it was too late. Both men teetered there for a moment and then they went over.</p><p>The last thing Jack heard as he tumbled over the cliff\u2019s edge was Lorraine\u2019s horrified scream.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>The Mexican Department of Rescue worked feverishly for the next few hours. Several emergency technicians had been lowered carefully down the side of the cliff and they were now examining the bodies.</p><p>No one could have survived a fall like that. Lorraine had known it the moment she saw the two men sprawled on the shore below. Carlos had struck the rocks and his body lay there, twisted and broken. Jack\u2014her heart stopped beating every time she glanced over the edge\u2014lay on the riverbank, faceup. Lorraine fell to her knees, her pain too much to bear.</p> <p>After she\u2019d seen Jack and Carlos go over the cliff, she\u2019d run into the middle of the highway, nearly getting hit by a fast-moving car. Thankfully, the young couple spoke enough English to understand that there\u2019d been a terrible accident. They were the ones who\u2019d contacted the authorities.</p><p>\u201cMiss, miss, we need you to answer questions.\u201d The policeman, whose name tag identified him as Officer de Oro, hunkered down where she knelt. His voice was gentle, concerned. She didn\u2019t mean to ignore him, but his English was difficult to understand. \u201cCan you talk now? Please,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are many questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know if he\u2019s alive. I love him.\u201d Her voice cracked and she refused to move away from the cliff edge, refused to stop gazing down at Jack. Illogically she thought that her love would somehow help him if he\u2019d managed to survive.</p><p>\u201cNo one could live after such a fall.\u201d</p><p>She knew it without his saying so and merely shook her head. Officer de Oro\u2019s words underscored her worst fears.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>Lorraine didn\u2019t know where she could possibly start. \u201cI want my father,\u201d she whispered brokenly, and gave him Thomas\u2019s name. \u201cI need my father. Could I call him, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll arrange that later,\u201d the policeman said. \u201cWho is the dead man on the other side of the road?\u201d he asked urgently. \u201cCan you tell us that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason Applebee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerican?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s the man who stole the Kukulcan Star.\u201d Her answer generated an immediate response. Officer de Oro leaped up and called over another policeman. They spoke in hushed tones before the second man hurried to the radio in the patrol car.</p><p>\u201cHe no longer has the Star,\u201d Lorraine said in a weak voice.</p><p>\u201cWho does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Department of Antiquities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I gave it to them this morning.\u201d Was it only this morning?</p><p>\u201cDo you have the name of the person you gave it to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Marcus Molino.\u201d</p><p>He left her to speak to the second officer again. She noticed that the activity far below had increased, and now a member of the rescue squad raced over to speak to the policemen. He was in radio contact with the people working below. Lorraine desperately wanted to understand what was happening.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, turning to Officer de Oro when he hurried back to her side. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man on the rocks is dead.\u201d</p><p>Carlos was dead, but she felt no sense of exhilaration. She hardly even felt relief. Instead, she experienced a deep sadness\u2014because she realized the next news she heard would be of Jack\u2019s death.</p><p>He\u2019d died for her. He\u2019d given up his life to save her. He loved her. Neither of them had spoken the words; neither had found the courage to actually say them. But Jack had loved her. And she loved him, more than she\u2019d ever known she was capable of loving.</p><p>What was she going to do? How could she resume her life without him? Right now, it didn\u2019t seem possible.</p><p>The man with the radio spoke to the other police officer again. A flurry of activity followed, with ropes and stretchers being assembled and instructions shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked, hope filling her heart. She struggled to her feet. \u201cTell me, tell me.\u201d She gripped the police officer by the arm and wouldn\u2019t let go until he told her.</p><p>\u201cThe second man is alive.\u201d</p><p>She nearly passed out with relief.</p><p>\u201cBut barely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we must get him to the hospital! As soon as possible. Please, please hurry.\u201d</p><p>Jack was alive. There was a chance. It bubbled up inside her, this surge of sudden unexpected promise. It was all she could do not to hug the man who\u2019d delivered the news.</p><p>The ambulance was already there. The man from the rescue squad tried to steer her away from the cliff to have her injuries treated, but she wouldn\u2019t leave. Not until she heard the final word on Jack.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d She wept openly at the news. \u201cAlive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss, miss, now you see the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until Jack is brought up from the cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, miss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer all your questions later,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>She kept her gaze trained on Jack, who was being brought up the face of the cliff by perhaps half a dozen men below, as many above, all working together. It astonished her that such a difficult rescue could even be accomplished. She was careful to stay out of everyone\u2019s way. The task seemed to take hours of coordinated effort; in actuality it was less than forty minutes.</p><p>As soon as the men carrying Jack reached the top, he was hurried into the waiting ambulance. The rescue team, their faces red with exertion, stepped back from the vehicle.</p><p>Before anyone could protest, Lorraine climbed into the back of the ambulance with the medical technician.</p><p>Once inside, Lorraine got her first look at Jack. As a nurse practitioner she\u2019d worked with accident victims before, but this was the worst she\u2019d ever seen. She was appalled by the extent of his injuries. It was a miracle he wasn\u2019t dead. She felt for the pulse in his neck, which was almost too faint to register. His internal injuries had to be massive, and he\u2019d obviously broken a number of bones. Most likely he\u2019d received a spinal injury.</p><p>The medical technician worked frantically, getting Jack hooked up to an IV and combating the effects of shock. Lorraine simply watched, holding Jack\u2019s limp hand. Watched and prayed.</p><p>The siren began to wail as they started down the highway.</p><p>The next two days were a blur in Lorraine\u2019s mind. Jack was taken almost immediately into surgery. His injuries proved as extensive as she\u2019d feared, with plenty of room for complications and problems. She refused to leave his bedside, even when her father appeared.</p><p>As soon as Thomas Dancy took one look at her, she could see he was badly shaken. Both her eyes had been blackened, her nose broken, and the gash in the back of her head had needed fifteen stitches. Funny how she hadn\u2019t felt a thing, not one second of pain, from the moment Jack went over the cliff.</p><p>Every ounce of energy she had she gave to Jack. All her strength, her will, everything she had to give. He had to stay alive.</p><p>\u201cRaine?\u201d Her father stood by the hospital bed where Jack remained unconscious, attached to various monitors.</p><p>She fell into his arms, desperately needing his support. \u201cI love him so much.\u201d She understood now that she\u2019d never really been in love. What she and Gary had was more friendship than passion. They were friends and companions, fond of each other but not in love. In many ways Gary had been her mother\u2019s choice rather than her own.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d Thomas asked.</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d Others assumed she was fragile, that her state of mind had been compromised by her ordeal. Perhaps they were right; she was no longer a good judge of such things. Not that it mattered. What was important was being with Jack. She thought of nothing and no one else.</p><p>\u201cRaine,\u201d her father urged. \u201cCome to the hotel. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI never told him,\u201d she said, glancing away from Jack to briefly meet her father\u2019s eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, too?\u201d her father asked in a hesitant voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she whispered, knowing she could never explain in words the special relationship they\u2019d shared. She\u2019d never doubted or questioned Jack\u2019s love, just as he\u2019d never doubted hers for him. It was something neither of them could or would say. For Jack, love was an emotion he couldn\u2019t afford to express to a woman he assumed was married. As for herself, she\u2019d gambled, certain she\u2019d have time enough to tell him the truth.</p><p>If he died now, they both lost.</p><p>Her father sat with her. After the first barrage of concerned questions, he\u2019d asked no more, and she appreciated that. It was as if he understood she had to see this to the end. Whatever that end might be.</p><p>The hospital was quiet. Night settled around her as she stayed at Jack\u2019s bedside, alone now. She held his hand in hers and pressed her lips to the inside of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019re out of here,\u201d she told him, \u201cwe\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t allowed to finish. His heart monitor started to blare, a piercing alarm that shattered the night and brought hospital staff running. A glance at the electronic readout showed one long straight line. Cardiac arrest.</p><p>Gary Franklin had decided he would refuse Marjorie\u2019s letter of resignation. This wasn\u2019t a personal decision, he convinced himself, but one he\u2019d made out of concern for the company. After months of training, Med-X had invested a lot of money in Marjorie Ellis, and it would be a detriment to the organization if she left now.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d suspected, he found her letter on his desk Monday morning. Knowing exactly what he intended to do, Gary grabbed it and walked briskly to her office.</p><p>Marjorie looked up in surprise when he entered and closed the door. \u201cI can\u2019t accept this,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d He gave her the company line, explaining that Med-X would lose a substantial sum of money if she resigned.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll train my replacement before I go,\u201d she offered.</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force me to continue working here.\u201d</p><p>She had a point. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d consider it a personal favor if you didn\u2019t leave the company in a bind. Also, you\u2019re working out beautifully here and we\u2019d hate to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie sagged in her chair. He noted that she\u2019d already loaded half the contents of her drawers into a cardboard box. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll reconsider.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI can\u2019t...I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, okay, but...\u201d He couldn\u2019t find a diplomatic way of telling her how important it was to him that she remain at Med-X. Nothing to do with the company. He wanted her on the job for purely selfish reasons.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so critical for you to leave?\u201d At first he\u2019d assumed it was because of his...advances, he supposed the term was. But he\u2019d analyzed each time they\u2019d kissed, plus a few remarks she\u2019d made, and realized she\u2019d wanted him to kiss her. She\u2019d enjoyed their kisses as much as he had.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Her head came up and she stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged to another woman. I won\u2019t be your last fling. I\u2019m not interested in an affair, Gary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn affair?\u201d He nearly choked on the words. Not once had it entered his mind that she\u2019d believe he was suggesting such a thing.</p><p>\u201cWell, what else am I supposed to think?\u201d she asked defensively. \u201cThat\u2019s where we were headed.\u201d</p><p>Gary couldn\u2019t deny the electricity between them or the truth of what she said. They had been headed directly for the bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, hardly aware he\u2019d spoken aloud.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt this woman who\u2019s promised to be your wife....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLorraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, I won\u2019t be part of something illicit. Some furtive noon-hour affair.\u201d</p><p>That felt like a slap in the face. \u201cI didn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t...\u201d He was too flustered to continue.</p><p>\u201cYes, you would. We both would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, thinking fast. \u201cBut now that we\u2019re aware of the pitfalls, we\u2019ll be careful. Before you walk away from a good job, why don\u2019t you take a couple of days, give this some real thought.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to be considering his words.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to let our emotions get carried away, but you\u2019re important to this company.\u201d And to me. But he didn\u2019t say it aloud.</p><p>Frowning, Marjorie bit her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A load had been lifted from his shoulders. He returned her letter of resignation and hurried back to his office.</p><p>A number of business concerns demanded his attention, but he left them, his mind awhirl. Everything Marjorie had said was true. He was engaged. The thought of kissing another woman shouldn\u2019t have entered his mind. But he had kissed Marjorie, and he\u2019d enjoyed it more than anything.</p><p>Sure, he missed Lorraine. Quite a bit in the beginning, but she\u2019d been away for such a long time he didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. Even her father couldn\u2019t give him a definite answer about when she\u2019d be back.</p><p>One thing was certain\u2014he couldn\u2019t marry her. Not now.</p><p>It seemed like a simple decision, and he didn\u2019t understand why it\u2019d taken him so long to reach it. If he truly loved Lorraine, he wouldn\u2019t be this attracted to Marjorie.</p><p>He jumped up from his chair and marched down the hallway to her office. When he saw she was talking on the phone, he felt intense disappointment. As soon as he could, he\u2019d tell her....</p> <p>Soon after that, he had a lunch meeting with a major distributor and then he spent the afternoon preparing a report for the company\u2019s CEO. Marjorie had gone out on some local calls. Before he knew it, the day was over.</p><p>Not until he was in his car did he think about stopping at her house. He probably shouldn\u2019t, but the thought of seeing her again was a temptation too great to resist.</p><p>Brice came running over the minute Gary parked in front of the house.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doin\u2019, kiddo?\u201d Gary asked, and playfully jerked the bill of the boy\u2019s baseball cap down over his forehead.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Are you coming to see my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is she around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>Worried that she might not appreciate his entering the house unannounced, Gary asked, \u201cWould you mind telling her I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She\u2019ll be glad.\u201d The boy dashed up the steps and through the door; half a minute later Marjorie appeared. Gary could tell by the way she hesitated when she saw him that she felt flustered.</p><p>\u201cHello, Gary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarjorie.\u201d She remained on the top porch step, arms folded protectively.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take much of your time,\u201d he said, standing a safe distance away on the lawn. \u201cI came to a decision today, and I want you to know what it is, since it definitely concerns you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcerns me how? What kind of decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you pointed out, I\u2019m engaged. But I\u2019ve learned something\u2014I don\u2019t want to be engaged anymore. Lorraine and I... I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s terrific. Great. We dated for quite a while, and I more or less decided it was time to get married. She felt the same way. That\u2019s why it happened. But I\u2019m breaking off the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she back from Mexico or wherever she went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d thought about that, too. If she was in Louisville, he\u2019d talk to her that very day.</p><p>\u201cSo she doesn\u2019t know?\u201d Marjorie pressed.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be too disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Marjorie demanded with such outrage, Gary retreated a step in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThere was no passion between us. No...sparks.\u201d He hadn\u2019t realized that until he\u2019d kissed Marjorie. The sizzle between them was strong enough to shoot sparks into tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cSparks.\u201d She arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fickle man, Marjorie. I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reveal any emotion. \u201cAre you breaking the engagement because of me?\u201d</p><p>Gary wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. The best policy was the truth, so he met her look squarely, unwilling to discount the intensity of what he felt for her. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been waiting all my life for you. I won\u2019t let you slip through my fingers now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gary.\u201d She was actually crying.</p><p>\u201cInvite him to dinner, Mom.\u201d Brice stood at the screen door.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I should be leaving.\u201d Gary headed back to his car.</p><p>\u201cGary.\u201d</p><p>He turned around.</p><p>She was wiping her eyes with one sleeve. \u201cWould you like to stay for dinner?\u201d</p><p>More than she\u2019d ever know. \u201cWould you like me to?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and nodded, then held out her hand to him.</p><p>Gary didn\u2019t need a second invitation.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t know where he was. He opened his eyes and bright lights blinded him. He wondered if he was dead, then decided he was in too much pain for that. Pain was a good sign. It meant he was alive.</p><p>A nurse stood at his bedside, along with an elderly physician.</p><p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d Jack asked in Spanish.</p><p>The older man turned to him and smiled when he realized Jack was conscious. \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to return to the land of the living, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Jack remembered was the convincing knowledge that he was about to die and take Carlos with him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel, Mr. Keller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I fell off a cliff.\u201d</p><p>The physician grinned.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the other guy?\u201d He hoped to hell Carlos was dead. \u201cMr. Applebee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, both Mr. Applebee and Mr. Caracol were pronounced dead at the scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos Caracol?\u201d Jack wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Jason\u2019s death was news to him, but there hadn\u2019t exactly been time to ask Lorraine questions.</p><p>\u201cYou and your wife are the only two to survive.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t correct the assumption, but turned his head away, not wanting to think about Lorraine.</p><p>\u201cYour wife has been at your bedside from the moment you were brought into the hospital,\u201d the nurse told him. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Jack\u2019s memory was foggy, but he knew Lorraine had taken one hell of a beating. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with her father having lunch,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cAgainst her wishes, I might add. As for her injuries, she\u2019s much better. Or she will be as soon as I tell her you\u2019re conscious.\u201d</p><p>Jack closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou gave us quite a scare recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d Jack\u2019s eyes fluttered open again.</p><p>\u201cYou went into cardiac arrest a couple of days ago. It\u2019s been touch-and-go ever since. You have a strong will to live, Mr. Keller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his wife,\u201d the nurse corrected. \u201cShe said she refused to let you die.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. That sounded like Lorraine, all right.</p><p>\u201cFor days she\u2019s been sitting at your bedside, talking about your future together. She said she wants your child.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s grin faded. Apparently Lorraine had decided to file for divorce. She was going to do it, going to ruin her life for him. He could see it happening already. She\u2019d return to Louisville and rip apart two lives. Jack couldn\u2019t let her throw away her marriage because of him.</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d he said from between gritted teeth. He hardly had the strength to talk. He clutched the man\u2019s coat sleeve in an effort to convey the urgency of his request.</p><p>\u201cDo you need something for the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your wife,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Mr. Keller. Whatever is wrong, we can take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Jack doubted that. \u201cThe woman out there isn\u2019t my wife.\u201d</p><p>He watched as they stared at him in stunned disbelief.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wearing a wedding band,\u201d the nurse said, as if to disqualify his statement.</p><p>\u201cShe loves you,\u201d the physician said, frowning. \u201cShe\u2019s been unwilling to leave you this entire time. The only way we were able to get her out of the room now was because of her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ring was given to her by another man.\u201d</p><p>Both the nurse and the doctor continued to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you go out there and tell Lorraine I\u2019m alive, you\u2019ll be responsible for breaking up a marriage, for destroying a family.\u201d His hand tightened on the physician\u2019s sleeve. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s gaze connected with his.</p><p>\u201cI love her, too,\u201d Jack whispered. He could feel the darkness closing in.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Keller, that isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her I died or...or I\u2019ll ruin her life.\u201d He had trouble saying the words. They stumbled off the end of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou love her that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Keller\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it...please.\u201d He wasn\u2019t a man who begged or pleaded, but he was reduced to it now. \u201cShe has a husband. A good man who loves her...who knows nothing about me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The physician took a long time deciding, then, as if he found it acutely difficult, finally agreed with a nod.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jack whispered. He could rest now. Could shut his eyes and sink into the beckoning oblivion.</p><p>He heard the soft crush of footsteps as the physician walked out of the room.</p><p>Jack lost track of time. It could have been five minutes, possibly ten; he didn\u2019t know. The next thing he heard was Lorraine\u2019s agonized scream.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no! Please, no!\u201d</p><p>Hearing her wrenched his heart. The sound of her sobs followed. Plaintive, pitiful, filled with an agony that touched all who heard them.</p><p>Jack closed his eyes and wished he could close off his hearing, as well.</p><p>From this point forward, he was dead to Lorraine and she was dead to him.</p><p>Seventeen</p> <p>Six months passed before Lorraine was able to sleep through the night. Each time she awoke, an intense sadness settled over her\u2014worse even than the harsh grief she\u2019d felt at the unexpectedness of her mother\u2019s death. Often she lay in bed, grateful for the darkness, for the silence, and clutched the memories of Jack to her heart.</p><p>Finally she understood the poet\u2019s claim that it was better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. In years past she\u2019d scoffed at those very words, considered them foolish. No more. Even though she would have escaped this pain if she\u2019d never met Jack, she knew she\u2019d gladly go through it all again. Those weeks with him were the most precious of her life. She treasured each and every day.</p><p>It hurt, this pain that was sharper than anything she\u2019d ever known, and still she was grateful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d Gary told her when they met for lunch early in the month of November.</p><p>She could only agree.</p><p>\u201cYou seem more...resilient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalking about people who\u2019ve changed,\u201d she said, turning the tables on him, \u201cI hardly recognize you anymore.\u201d They sat in a Thai restaurant, one they\u2019d frequented while dating.</p><p>Gary had the good grace to blush. \u201cI credit it all to love.\u201d</p><p>Had she never known Jack, Gary\u2019s words would have offended her, but oddly enough she understood. Jack\u2019s love had changed her, too.</p><p>Her former fianc\u00e9 had married Marjorie Ellis within a month of Lorraine\u2019s return. At the time she\u2019d been in too much pain to really care. Only later did she experience a bitterness mingled with regret and relief. She was happy for Gary and Marjorie, but it hurt that she\u2019d tried to be thoughtful of him and he hadn\u2019t afforded her the same consideration.</p><p>In time she got over those feelings and found herself pleased that her friend had fallen in love. She\u2019d always enjoyed Gary\u2019s company. But she knew she\u2019d never truly loved him. Not the way she\u2019d loved Jack. Her fondness for Gary couldn\u2019t compare to the intensity of what she felt for the man who\u2019d given his life to save hers.</p><p>Gary set aside his menu. Lorraine wondered why he bothered to look. For as long as she could remember, he\u2019d ordered the same dish every time they ate at the Thai Garden.</p><p>\u201cMarjorie should be here any minute,\u201d he said. His eyes brightened as he said his wife\u2019s name.</p><p>Lorraine had met Marjorie on a number of occasions and liked her a great deal. She approved of the changes that loving Marjorie had brought about in Gary. He was more relaxed and spontaneous, more sensitive to others. It was obvious that they were meant to be a couple.</p> <p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Marjorie said as she rushed toward the table. Slipping off her shoes, she stepped up to the padded cushions and lowered herself beside Gary in the private booth. \u201cThe doctor was behind schedule and\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly as if she\u2019d said something she shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>It took Lorraine a moment to discern her meaning. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant!\u201d she said, eyeing the two of them.</p><p>Gary and Marjorie both seemed to freeze, awaiting her reaction.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely wonderful!\u201d Lorraine was genuinely delighted. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you.\u201d She reached across the table and squeezed Marjorie\u2019s hand. \u201cHow far along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months,\u201d Marjorie said. Gary, who\u2019d never demonstrated a burning desire for parenthood, simply beamed.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to wait, seeing that Brice is already nine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to wait, period.\u201d Marjorie smiled as she flattened her hand over her stomach. \u201cThe baby was a surprise, but not an unwelcome one.\u201d</p><p>Now Lorraine understood why Gary had invited her to lunch. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a great father,\u201d she said, and meant it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little nervous about a baby, but Brice said if he could put up with dirty diapers and fussy infants, then so could I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGary\u2019s great with Brice,\u201d Marjorie told her.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s because he finally has someone his own age to play with,\u201d Lorraine teased. The two women laughed, and so did Gary. Actually, Lorraine figured, it wasn\u2019t far from the truth. Gary was crazy about baseball, and apparently so was Brice. Lorraine had recently stopped by the house on a Sunday afternoon and discovered Gary and Brice glued to the television, watching the World Series. They\u2019d given each other high fives and hooted noisily until Marjorie and Lorraine were forced to adjourn to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think that Brice is mature for his age,\u201d Gary muttered.</p><p>The waitress came for their order. She glanced at Gary and Lorraine several times as if to say something wasn\u2019t right. It was a look they often received when Marjorie joined them. Since they\u2019d dated for so long, people naturally seemed to consider them a couple.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing for Thanksgiving?\u201d Marjorie asked.</p><p>Was it that time of year already? Lorraine could hardly believe it. For months now she\u2019d been dragging herself through each day, praying for the strength to endure, the courage to continue alone. That was the key word. Alone.</p><p>She was grateful now that her mother\u2019s house hadn\u2019t sold. Soon after her return from Mexico, she\u2019d moved in, needing the comfort of familiar things around her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like it if you could join us for dinner on Thanksgiving,\u201d Marjorie said.</p><p>Lorraine heard the invitation, but didn\u2019t respond until she noticed that Marjorie and Gary were waiting for her answer. Both regarded her with concern. Suddenly she realized the invitation had been prompted by guilt as much as affection. It wasn\u2019t necessary; neither of them needed to feel guilty on her account. If Gary hadn\u2019t beaten her to it, she would have broken off the engagement herself.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Lorraine said.</p><p>\u201cWill you be visiting your father?\u201d Gary asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her quick response concealed neither her anger nor her pain. She didn\u2019t want to think about Thomas Dancy and in fact had refused to deal with the emotions that beset her every time his name was mentioned.</p><p>He should have told Lorraine the truth about Azucena, but instead, had left her to discover it on her own. That was, perhaps, what hurt the most. Thomas had failed her the same way he\u2019d failed her mother. All those years, Virginia had loved him, idolized him, been faithful to him. Not once had she looked at another man. Not once had she been disloyal to his memory.</p><p>When Jack was first taken to the hospital, she\u2019d turned to her father for emotional support, but she regretted that now. He\u2019d tried to comfort her when the doctor came to tell her Jack had died, but she was beyond solace.</p><p>As soon as it could be arranged, she\u2019d returned to Louisville, where she belonged. Her father had written her a number of times since, but she hadn\u2019t answered his letters. Wouldn\u2019t have known what to say if she had. Thomas Dancy had made a new life for himself, had another wife, other children. She was part of the painful past, tied to a dead marriage and a woman he\u2019d betrayed. It would be better for everyone if she stayed out of his world\u2014and kept him out of hers.</p><p>\u201cLorraine? We were talking about Thanksgiving?\u201d Gary\u2019s voice cut into her musings.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to talk about what happened in Mexico yet?\u201d The question came from Marjorie, asked with kindness and compassion. Without Lorraine\u2019s ever having spoken about it, Marjorie knew she\u2019d endured some horrible trauma.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said brokenly, \u201cnot yet.\u201d And perhaps not ever. Lorraine hadn\u2019t shared her memories of Jack. Not with Gary and Marjorie or her friends at work.</p><p>Gary was right. She was different, and always would be for having loved and lost Jack. Really, what could she tell them? How could she explain that she\u2019d died that day in the jungle outside Mexico City? How could she explain that she only went through the motions of living now? That she struggled to make sense out of life and death, struggled to gain acceptance and peace in a world that seemed devoid of both?</p><p>Jack endured six hideous months. The pain was physical, the suffering emotional. Twice now he\u2019d fallen in love, and both times it had been a disaster. Each day he lay in his hospital bed, the pain so bad it was impossible to sleep. But he welcomed the physical agony. It diverted his attention from thoughts of Lorraine.</p><p>His back, he learned, had been broken. That came as no surprise. Nor did the five other broken bones, plus internal injuries. The doctors hadn\u2019t made any promises about walking again. Most seemed surprised he\u2019d survived, but no one more so than Jack. He would have shaken hands with death any number of times. Been glad to give up the fight. Even now he cursed God for playing such a cruel trick. If he\u2019d wanted a reward for the noble gesture of sending Lorraine back to her husband, this wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>The second week of November, Jack stood on his own for the first time since he\u2019d entered the hospital. Stood, not walked. Sweat broke out across his brow at the amount of energy required to maintain an upright position.</p><p>Someone clapped loudly behind him.</p><p>Jack dared not glance over his shoulder for fear of losing his balance, precarious at best.</p><p>\u201cGood going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy?\u201d Jack couldn\u2019t believe his ears. His knees gave out on him, and he fell back into his wheelchair. His strength deserted him; otherwise he would have whirled the chair around and cursed out his friend. He wasn\u2019t in the mood for company, and he didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s sympathy.</p><p>Murphy\u2019s long strides devoured the distance between them. \u201cYou\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>Jack turned purposefully away. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else? I came to see you.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t meet Murphy\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen you made a wasted trip.\u201d</p><p>His friend walked a circle around him, shaking his head. \u201cA fine mess you\u2019ve gotten yourself into this time.\u201d</p><p>Jack ignored the comment. He knew Letty and Murphy had been phoning weekly for updates on his condition, talking to Dr. Berilo and the hospital staff. Jack hadn\u2019t wanted to talk to them himself and hoped they\u2019d get the message. Apparently they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDoc says you can leave the hospital soon,\u201d Murphy said, facing Jack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jack preferred not to think about the future. His one and only decision had been to sell Scotch on Water. He couldn\u2019t go back to the cabin cruiser. Every night he\u2019d be haunted by the memory of Lorraine and their time together.</p><p>\u201cAre you returning to the boat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSold it,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cYou sold Scotch on Water?\u201d Murphy didn\u2019t seem to believe it. \u201cBut you loved that boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat time of my life has passed.\u201d It was all he intended to say on the subject. Murphy would never know the real reason.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it would\u2019ve been better to wait and make such a drastic decision later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it!\u201d he barked.</p><p>Murphy sat down in a nearby chair.</p> <p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d Jack asked sarcastically. \u201cTo check up on the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Letty sent me. Said I was to bring you home.\u201d</p><p>Jack snorted. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, good buddy, you don\u2019t know my wife the way I do. That woman is stubborn. When she told me to bring you back, I knew I\u2019d better do it.\u201d</p><p>Arguing was a waste of energy, but he wasn\u2019t going to involve Murphy and Letty in his troubles. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of myself,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Murphy gave no indication he\u2019d heard. \u201cLetty had me working on the old foreman\u2019s house. She\u2019s cleaned and repainted the place and ordered a hospital bed and whatever else Dr. Berilo suggested. She also had me widen the doorways to accommodate your wheelchair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI plan to walk again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Murphy said swiftly. \u201cThis is just until you\u2019re able to get around on your own. I\u2019m telling you, Jack, you don\u2019t know my wife. That woman\u2019s unstoppable once she sets her mind on something. I don\u2019t dare come back without you.\u201d</p><p>Well, Letty would just have to be disappointed, Jack thought.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing. Letty and Francine have been talking up a storm. Last I heard, Francine\u2019s hired a physical therapist who\u2019s flying out to work with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a fact?\u201d Jack asked with a heavy dose of sarcasm. He appreciated all the trouble Letty and Francine, the wife of another ex-mercenary friend, had gone to, but he\u2019d rather stay in Mexico.</p><p>\u201cI tried to explain to Letty that you\u2019d prefer your own company. I tried, Jack, I really did, but she said you need family now and we\u2019re the only family you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a charity case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should say not!\u201d Murphy snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re paying for that physical therapist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLetty doesn\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too. With three children under the age of four, she\u2019s got plenty to do without worrying about you, but she\u2019s convinced you\u2019ll recuperate faster at the ranch with us than anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Again Jack reserved his strength rather than argue. Murphy could say what he wanted, but Jack had no intention of allowing his longtime friends to play nursemaid to him.</p><p>Three days later, however, Jack was loaded onto a medically equipped private plane and made the long trip from Mexico City to Boothill, Texas. He wasn\u2019t pleased to have Murphy step in and take charge of his life. But at this point Jack\u2019s options were few.</p><p>He needed physical rehabilitation, plus people to assist him. And time. Lots of that. But it\u2019d take more than time for him to heal. He\u2019d never be the same again, emotionally or physically, and he knew it.</p><p>The flight to the ranch exhausted him, and staying awake long enough to get himself settled in the foreman\u2019s house was about all he could manage.</p><p>Just as Murphy had said, the structure, which was some distance from the main house, had been set up as a miniature hospital, complete with a bed, wheelchair, walker and more. He fell into a deep sleep the minute he pulled the covers over himself.</p><p>His dreams were full of Lorraine. Of her lying in his arms, talking about movies while he tried not to kiss her. Of the two of them sleeping, arms and legs entwined, on the deck, gazing up at the moon. He could hear the sound of her laughter. It rang in his ears like a forgotten melody. He felt the softness of her skin against his. It seemed so real.</p><p>His eyes fluttered open and he saw a figure sitting in the dark, rocking back and forth in a high-backed wooden chair.</p><p>\u201cLorraine?\u201d he whispered. It had to be her. Must be her. Heaven help him, he didn\u2019t have the will to send her away a second time. How had she found him? Who\u2019d told her?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Letty,\u201d Murphy\u2019s wife said.</p><p>The disappointment was almost too painful to bear.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He yearned to tell her he\u2019d done enough of that in the past six months. If there was any justice in the world, he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Jack\u2019s musings were interrupted by the sound of someone else coming into the room.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe woke up briefly. He seemed to think I was someone named Lorraine, but he\u2019s asleep now.\u201d</p><p>Jack would\u2019ve loved to shock them both by bolting upright, but he hadn\u2019t the strength. It demanded more than he could muster even to open his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you about her?\u201d Letty asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a word. He\u2019ll say something when he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Letty seemed to consider her husband\u2019s statement. \u201cHe\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Berilo said as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean emotionally,\u201d Letty explained. \u201cHe loved Marcie and regrouped after they split up. He\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>Little did she know, Jack thought. Technically Letty was right; he had loved Marcie. But what he felt for Lorraine was far stronger. He\u2019d willingly surrendered a large part of himself, his heart, his very being\u2014his life\u2014when he\u2019d asked Dr. Berilo to tell Lorraine he was dead.</p><p>It had been a noble thing to do, or so Jack had believed. What he hadn\u2019t realized at the time was how close to the truth that lie actually was. Without Lorraine, he found little purpose in life. Without her he was empty. He\u2019d been willing to die so she could live. Now he had a more difficult task to accomplish.</p><p>He had to learn to live without her.</p><p>\u201cHe must love her the way I love you,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>In that moment Jack understood why he considered Murphy his family. Murphy knew him like no one else.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Letty whispered.</p><p>They were right, both of them. Jack loved Lorraine with that same intensity. Enough to send her away. Enough to make his own life hell because she was no longer part of it and never would be again.</p><p>Thomas Dancy dismissed his last class, but remained in the classroom as he often did these days. He sat at his desk and studied his schedule, although his thoughts weren\u2019t on his work.</p><p>His American friend was dead, and Lorraine seemed to blame him. It was the only reason Thomas could conceive of for the fact that she completely ignored his letters.</p><p>Almost six months earlier he\u2019d received a hysterical phone call from her about Jack. He\u2019d immediately left the school and joined her at the hospital in Mexico City. Along with Raine, he\u2019d kept vigil at Jack\u2019s bedside while his friend hovered near death. For countless hours, he\u2019d talked to the hospital staff in an effort to glean what information he could. It was from the nurses that he came to understand the gravity of the situation. In his own way he\u2019d attempted to prepare Raine for the worst.</p><p>When the inevitable happened, his daughter had wept as he\u2019d never heard a woman weep. In her grief she\u2019d collapsed against him. Her agony clawed at his heart, and Thomas recognized anew how much he loved his daughter. Her pain was even worse for him than the loss of his friend.</p><p>He was the one who led her out of the hospital, who spoke to the doctor and, with his help, made the burial arrangements. He\u2019d had only a glimpse of the body through the door of Jack\u2019s room; it was all he could stand. Later that day, he\u2019d tried to bring Lorraine home with him. She\u2019d politely declined, which had confused him. Now, like her mother, she wouldn\u2019t answer his letters, and as each day passed without word, she broke his heart.</p><p>This was crueler than Ginny\u2019s abandonment. He\u2019d accepted his wife\u2019s decision, but had pleaded with her when Raine turned twenty-one to tell their daughter the truth, allow her to make her own judgments.</p><p>Raine had done that, it seemed, and rejected him. Rejected his love.</p><p>This grief was the most painful yet.</p><p>\u201cThomas?\u201d</p><p>Azucena stood at his classroom door. She was by herself, which was rare, and his fears were immediate.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right? The children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d she assured him as she walked into the room. \u201cThey\u2019re with Consuela.\u201d Her cousin.</p><p>Azucena\u2019s beauty was unassuming, and at first glance few would find her pretty. He\u2019d been guilty of that himself. For years he\u2019d used her body as an escape from a hell of his own making. He\u2019d loved Ginny, pretended in the dark of night that it was his wife\u2019s body he sank into, his wife who cried out in joy as she received him. But it had been Azucena who slept next to him, Azucena who comforted him when the dream came, who woke up with him in the morning. Azucena who gave him a second chance at life and bore him three wonderful sons.</p><p>Azucena who was his wife now.</p><p>She was by far the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever known, and his heart swelled with love at the sight of her. He started to get up, but she stopped him.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she instructed.</p><p>\u201cStay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to write a letter for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to write your letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn English.\u201d</p><p>His curiosity was keen now. \u201cTo whom?\u201d</p><p>Azucena\u2019s gentle smile reached out to him. \u201cYour daughter.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could have surprised him more. He wanted to tell her it would do no good. He\u2019d poured out his heart to Raine, pleaded with her to respond\u2014and she\u2019d refused, with no explanation and apparently no regret. Her silence baffled him. Hurt him.</p><p>He took out a fresh sheet of paper and a pen while Azucena removed a folded paper from her pocket. \u201cPlease translate this into English for me,\u201d she said, and handed him the letter.</p><p>Thomas read it over and frowned. He read it a second time, then slowly set it aside. He loved Azucena, but she was a simple woman with little education or knowledge of the world. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you love me, you will do this.\u201d</p><p>It was unusual for her to ask anything of him. Thomas felt he had no choice. Besides, what did he have to lose? Lorraine hadn\u2019t responded to his letters, and he sincerely doubted she\u2019d respond to Azucena\u2019s heartfelt message, either.</p><p>November 21</p><p>Dear Lorraine Dancy,</p><p>If I could put my arms around you and comfort you, I would. Your grief must be very great. You\u2019ve lost your mother and Jack, and now choose not to answer your father\u2019s letters. I can only assume that you are disappointed in the man your father has become. As his wife, I feel I must come to his defense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Your father is a good man. He loves you and he deeply loved your mother. Many times it was her name he whispered in our bed. I pretended not to notice. Only when he learned that I carried his child did he tell me about his daughter. He spoke of you with such tenderness that my fears vanished. You see, until then I didn\u2019t know how your father would react to my pregnancy. At that moment I realized he would love our child, too, even though he didn\u2019t love the mother. At least not then. He does now, very much, and we have three sons. Your brothers.</p><p>Thomas is afraid that you blame him for Jack\u2019s death, and that is the reason you haven\u2019t answered his letters. I think there is another reason. I think you have ignored his pleas because of me. In many ways I understand. My skin is darker than yours, and I don\u2019t speak your language. Nor am I beautiful like your mother was. Perhaps my greatest fault is that I love your father.</p><p>But, Lorraine Dancy, you love him, too. I know this. You would not have traveled to another country to see him if not for love. At the death of your mother, you sought out your father. You needed him then, but I wonder if you realize how much you need him now. When Jack was in the hospital, it was your father you asked to see. Your father who rushed to your side, who held you as you wept, who cried with you. You need your father, and he needs you.</p><p>You love Thomas. I love Thomas, and in return he loves us both.</p> <p>We are your family and you are ours. Please. I beg you not to shut him out of your life. For your sake and for his.</p><p>Azucena Dancy</p><p>Thomas read the letter twice to make the translation as accurate as possible. When he finished, he took Azucena\u2019s hand and kissed her palm.</p><p>\u201cI thank God for you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She slipped her arm around his shoulders and pressed his face against her soft belly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come home now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Thomas nodded. Many afternoons he lingered at the school, not wishing to darken the home with his bleak mood or trouble his family with his sense of failure and loss.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said.</p><p>Together they walked past the tiny post office and mailed the letter. But after all these months of silence from Raine, Thomas didn\u2019t hold out much hope she\u2019d answer.</p><p>He turned to Azucena that night and made love to her for the first time in weeks. Afterward he held her close, grateful for her presence in his life. Mentally he released his daughter, set her free. He couldn\u2019t use her rejection as an excuse to punish himself any longer. He had a new family now, and Raine was welcome to join him and Azucena or make her own life without them. The choice was hers.</p><p>To his surprise, a letter arrived from Raine a week before Christmas.</p> <p>Eighteen</p><p>It was Azucena\u2019s letter that persuaded Lorraine to confront her feelings about her father. She suspected Christmas had something to do with it, too. All around her, people were celebrating the festive season with their families. Lorraine had no family. And the only man she\u2019d ever truly loved was dead.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t stayed in Mexico for the funeral and deeply regretted that now. But at the time it had been more than she could bear. Perhaps she\u2019d feel a greater sense of closure\u2014as everyone called it these days\u2014if she\u2019d stayed in Mexico City. She hadn\u2019t even wanted to see the body; that wasn\u2019t Jack, that lifeless shell, bandaged and hooked up to monitors and IVs.</p><p>And she hadn\u2019t been able to tolerate the thought of being with her father, knowing how he\u2019d misled her. She\u2019d only wanted to leave Mexico.</p><p>Never had she felt more like an orphan. She missed her mother dreadfully, and the small traditions they\u2019d observed over the years didn\u2019t feel right when she performed them by herself.</p><p>She did manage to dredge up the enthusiasm to buy a Christmas tree. But it sat undecorated for nearly a week before she started to trim it.</p><p>Halfway through the project, she realized her heart wasn\u2019t in it. She paused, sat down at her computer and without forethought, started writing to her father and Azucena.</p><p>December 14</p> <p>Dear Dad and Azucena,</p><p>Standing alone in front of the Christmas tree convinced me to write. That and Azucena\u2019s letter.</p><p>She\u2019s right, I do need you. I wish I didn\u2019t. I lived without you nearly all my life, so it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to go on pretending you really are dead, the way Mom told me. But I find that impossible.</p><p>You made a new life for yourself, started another family. After being alone for more than six months now, I\u2019m beginning to appreciate what it must have been like for you without Mom and me. At one time, I believed that you\u2019d betrayed your marriage vows to Mother, but I don\u2019t feel that way anymore.</p><p>Azucena, thank you for opening my eyes. Thank you for having the courage to write me and defend my father. He is a good man.</p><p>Dad. I don\u2019t blame you for Jack\u2019s death. How could I? If anything I\u2019m thankful, so very thankful, that you brought me to him that fateful evening. In fact, loving Jack has helped me understand why Mom did the things she did.</p><p>From the day I found your letter and realized you were alive, I\u2019ve been agonizing over one question. What made Mom lie to me? Why did she tell me you were dead? Especially since her love for you was so unmistakable. I saw it in her eyes any time she mentioned your name. Your wedding photo was on her bedside table, so it was the last thing she saw at night and the first thing every morning.</p><p>Now I think I understand a little better. Mom was the kind of woman who only loves once. She never divorced you or remarried because she gave her heart completely and totally to you. Why she lied to me, I can\u2019t say, but I have no doubt of her absolute devotion to you. I understand because it was that way with Jack and me. Now, here\u2019s the shocking part of our relationship. I disliked him on sight and he felt much the same about me. Because I wore Mom\u2019s wedding band, he assumed I was married, and I let him think it. Many times since, I\u2019ve regretted not telling him the truth. There just didn\u2019t seem an easy way to do it and when I tried he wouldn\u2019t listen. I thought there\u2019d be plenty of opportunities to explain after I\u2019d squared things with Gary.</p><p>You see, Dad, Jack and I weren\u2019t lovers, and yet we shared an intimacy I could never hope to find with anyone else. He is the only man I\u2019ve ever truly loved. Mom and I are alike in that way. So, Dad, I don\u2019t blame you for what happened with Jack. Like I said, I\u2019m grateful to you for bringing him into my life.</p><p>Again, Azucena, thank you for your letter.</p><p>Merry Christmas and much love to you all.</p><p>Raine</p><p>January 2</p><p>Dear Raine,</p><p>I can\u2019t tell you how happy Azucena and I were to get your letter. It was the best Christmas present I\u2019ve ever received. Our time together last spring was far too short, and there was much to tell you, much to explain.</p><p>Perhaps I can answer some of your questions now and help you understand what happened between your mother and me. I loved Ginny, still do, and know deep in my heart that she continued to love me. Our love for each other was never in doubt. But as I said the night I saw you, she stayed in the United States because she wanted what was best for you. So did I. You were always our first consideration. Your mother wanted a high quality of education and health care for you. Nor did she want to take you away from your grandparents who adored you. I was the one foolish enough to ruin my life, and I didn\u2019t want you or your mother to pay the penalty for my sins.</p><p>As I also explained, from the midseventies until you were about nine, your mother visited me on several occasions while you stayed with the woman you called Aunt Elaine. Ginny\u2019s visits were short and it was agony for her to leave. Many times I pleaded with her to agree that I should return to the States and accept my due. No prison sentence could be worse than the hell of being away from the two of you. Each time she persuaded me to remain in my adopted country. I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do what I knew was right. Now it\u2019s too late. Azucena and our three sons need me.</p><p>When you were five, your mother and I decided to tell you I was dead. It was a decision we made together. You were at the age when you started asking probing questions about your father. The circumstances of my leaving were too complex and difficult for a child to understand. Nonetheless, I always worried that someone might make the connection between the two of you and me, a man considered a traitor and worse. I worried that if people did know you were my wife and daughter, they would scorn you\u2014and I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of that. It seems I worried for nothing, for which I am profoundly thankful.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t realize at the time we told you about my \u201cdeath\u201d was that your mother would come to believe the lie herself. I can\u2019t explain it in any other way. I think it was easier for her to let me go if she could convince herself I really was dead. As the next few years passed, her visits stopped and she only rarely answered my letters. For a period of time I drifted from town to town, more a prisoner than if I\u2019d been locked behind bars. Only when I accepted a teaching position here in El Mirador and met Azucena did I have a chance to start a second life. Don\u2019t blame me for this weakness, Raine.</p><p>About your loving Jack. I will always be grateful for his friendship and I miss him dearly. He was an honorable man and a hero. He gave his life for you and without knowing it, he saved me, too. Often it was his visits that kept me sane at a time when the world seemed beyond my control. He was a true friend. It makes me proud that my only daughter would give her heart to such a man.</p><p>You will heal, Raine. The terrible pain you suffer now will ease. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll forget Jack, or love him less. With effort you can learn to love again. I know.</p><p>Your loving father</p><p>For four months Lorraine and her father exchanged letters. Email was out of the question, since at this point neither Thomas nor the school had a computer. Every night Lorraine eagerly checked her mail and sent off lengthy letters of her own. For the first time in her life, she came to know her father and to appreciate his wit and intelligence. He wrote often of his sons, Antonio, Hector and baby Alberto. The two oldest boys sometimes enclosed pictures they\u2019d created for their big sister. Lorraine posted them on her refrigerator and smiled whenever they caught her eye.</p><p>Thomas encouraged her to visit again, to give Mexico another chance. Someday she would, she promised. As the weeks and months passed, she found herself thinking about the possibility. Then, on the anniversary of her mother\u2019s death, Alberto became seriously ill. Lorraine knew what she had to do\u2014but she needed to talk it over with her mother first.</p><p>Taking a large bouquet of spring flowers, Lorraine visited the cemetery in early May. She arranged the tulips and daffodils about the gravesite, then stood next to Virginia Dancy\u2019s engraved marble marker.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she whispered, staring down at the perfectly manicured lawn. This was her first visit since shortly before Christmas. Her throat felt thick, and tears gathered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was angry with you for a while,\u201d she said, her voice hoarse. \u201cBut I understand now why you did the things you did.\u201d She was silent as she thought about that for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the same person I was a year ago.\u201d Lorraine knew she was wiser now. More mature. More tolerant, braver, a better person. Thanks to her love for Jack, of course, but also her growing relationship with Thomas and Azucena. She\u2019d changed in other ways, too. Outer ways. For one thing, the style of her hair. She\u2019d had it cut to a more practical length. She felt Jack would have approved of that. Bit by bit her casual wardrobe changed from tailored slacks and silk blouses to cotton shorts and T-shirts. Already she\u2019d reaped a small harvest from the garden she\u2019d planted and that winter had taken up knitting. Gary and Marjorie\u2019s newborn daughter was the recipient of her first project, a beautiful\u2014even if she did say so herself\u2014yellow baby blanket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve grown up,\u201d she added softly. \u201cDad and I write now\u2014a couple of letters a week. His wife is a lovely, gentle woman, and his three sons are beautiful. I know you\u2019d want him to be happy\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you this. He is. Happy for the first time in ages. He\u2019s got a wonderful family and he\u2019s made peace with his past. He still believes the war was wrong, but he deeply regrets his involvement with the bombing.\u201d</p><p>She waited a few minutes and then brought up the subject she\u2019d come here to talk to her mother about. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to put the house on the market,\u201d she said. \u201cI waited because...well, because it helped me deal with losing you and Jack. I might have continued to live here if Alberto hadn\u2019t come down with strep throat last month. El Mirador doesn\u2019t have a medical clinic, and Dad ended up taking Azucena and the baby into M\u00e9rida to see a doctor. By the time they got there, Alberto\u2019s temperature was 106 and he had scarlet fever. He nearly died. The town needs a medical clinic and a trained medical professional. Do you realize what I\u2019m saying, Mom? What I want to do?</p><p>\u201cAlberto should have been on antibiotics much earlier, and he would have been if El Mirador had a clinic. Dad and I\u2019ve written to each other about this several times now. I\u2019m going to take the money from my inheritance and the sale of the house and use it to build a clinic in El Mirador. So many people want to help. Gary got Med-X to donate supplies, and even Group Wellness wants to contribute. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to name the clinic after someone you never met, someone I\u2019ve told you about. His name was Jack Keller.</p><p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t have liked him,\u201d she said, and smiled sadly. \u201cIn the beginning I didn\u2019t, either, but I came to love him and in time you would have, too.\u201d</p> <p>Peace settled over her. An inner peace that told her she\u2019d made the right decision. There was nothing more for her in Louisville. Her father, his wife and her three half brothers, all the family she had in the world, waited for her in a Mexican village on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. There she would build a lasting memorial to Jack. There she would make a new life for herself the way her father had all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cJack, Jack.\u201d The six-year-old boy raced across the yard, rimed with autumn frost, to join Jack at the fence. They stood together watching a number of llamas graze contentedly in the pasture.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Andy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The boy was the spitting image of Jack\u2019s friend and fellow mercenary, Tim Mallory. He leaped onto the bottom rung of the fence and folded his arms over the post. \u201cHey, you\u2019re walking without your cane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d His offhand response showed no hint of the massive effort and patience this accomplishment had required. Jack had lived in Texas with Murphy and Letty for nearly a year, using the time to recover his strength and learn to walk all over again. He\u2019d never intended to stay that long, but his physical therapy had been extensive.</p> <p>Recently Cain and his wife, Linette, had visited him from their cattle ranch in Montana and brought their two daughters with them. Cain\u2019s girls were relatively close in age to Murphy\u2019s boys, and the kids had gotten along famously. Cain had hoped for a Deliverance Company reunion, but Tim and Francine couldn\u2019t get away. Their llama ranch on Vashon Island up in Washington State was thriving, and Tim Mallory had a small but growing herd.</p><p>When he could travel comfortably, Jack went to visit Tim and Francine himself. He\u2019d originally planned to stay a couple of days, but found he enjoyed the view off Puget Sound. It reminded him of Mexico and the years he\u2019d spent aboard Scotch on Water and those all-too-brief weeks with Lorraine.</p><p>\u201cMom says one day no one\u2019ll know you used to walk with a cane,\u201d Andy said. He rested his chin on the top of his hands and heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s Bubba!\u201d the boy said next, pointing toward a llama at the far end of the pasture.</p><p>\u201cBubba?\u201d Jack asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cDad and him don\u2019t get along very well, but I know he gives Bubba some extra feed every day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ask him why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d</p><p>Andy shrugged. \u201cThat Bubba did him a favor once and he hasn\u2019t forgotten it.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew all about that favor. Six years ago, the very night Andrew Mallory was born, two hired assassins had paid a visit to Vashon Island. Their job had been to eliminate Tim and Francine. Unbelievably enough, the timely appearance of the big llama had been a lifesaving intervention.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did your mother say?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cAbout my walking, I mean.\u201d At one time Francine had been the best physical therapist on the West Coast. She\u2019d been in charge of his rehabilitation from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cShe said\u2014\u201d Andy paused and let out a slow breath \u201c\u2014it would take longer for your heart to get better. Did your heart get hurt when you fell off the cliff, Uncle Jack?\u201d He turned and regarded Jack quizzically.</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d Jack didn\u2019t want to talk about Lorraine and, in fact, hadn\u2019t. Not to Murphy or Tim or their wives. But that didn\u2019t mean she was ever far from his thoughts. Although it\u2019d been a year and a half, not a day passed that he didn\u2019t think of her.</p><p>Bits of memory came to him at the oddest times, often when he was least prepared to deal with them. He couldn\u2019t help wondering what had happened to her once she\u2019d returned to the States.</p><p>Was she happy? Had she told her husband about him? How had Gary Franklin reacted? Had she forgotten him and gone on to have the baby she\u2019d wanted so badly, badly enough to mention to Dr. Berilo\u2019s nurse? The thought of Lorraine with a child wrenched his heart. Only recently had he come to realize how much he wanted children himself. It was seeing his friends with their sons and daughters....</p><p>\u201cIs Andy talking your ear off?\u201d Tim joined him at the fence.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Jack enjoyed the boy\u2019s company and his energetic bursts of conversation.</p><p>\u201cSome pretty freakish weather going on around the country,\u201d Tim said, glancing up at the sky, which was a clear bright blue with clusters of high clouds.</p><p>\u201cLooks downright perfect to me,\u201d Jack murmured. In fact, he liked Washington and had given some consideration to purchasing a few acres here himself. Somewhere near the water. Early on, in a moment of pain, he\u2019d sold Scotch on Water. He\u2019d done it knowing he\u2019d never be able to sleep on the boat again and not think of Lorraine. Little did he realize then that he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep anywhere and not think of her.</p><p>\u201cThe weather here seems fine,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about what happened in Louisville, Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouisville?\u201d Lorraine and Gary lived in Louisville.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It required an effort to conceal his interest.</p><p>\u201cTornadoes in the area. They\u2019ve done a lot of damage to the city. The news is full of pictures.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHard to believe a storm could cause so much destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many people were killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive so far, but they\u2019re sure to discover more bodies in the next day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d Andy inserted.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one part of the city, either,\u201d Tim continued. \u201cFrom what the newscaster said, quite a few neighborhoods were affected. Crazy how one house\u2019ll be leveled to the ground, while the house across the street is untouched.\u201d</p><p>That night, Jack stayed up late and watched the news reports for himself. Afterward he couldn\u2019t sleep. Whenever he closed his eyes, Lorraine was there, and when he did manage to drop off, his dreams were filled with her. In one, he was searching but couldn\u2019t find her. Her voice grew weaker, more plaintive and urgent. Then he saw her, buried under a huge pile of rubble. No matter how hard he dug, how frantic his attempts, he couldn\u2019t reach her. He awoke in a cold sweat.</p><p>By the time dawn swept over the pasture and the nearby water, bringing the bright crisp sunshine of November, Jack had packed his bags and booked a flight out of Sea-Tac for Louisville.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Francine said as she poured him a cup of coffee.</p><p>Jack took his first restorative sip and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d Tim asked. He secured the straps of his coveralls and retrieved a mug from the kitchen shelf.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack said. He didn\u2019t elaborate. He caught husband and wife exchanging a look.</p><p>\u201cIs it important?\u201d Francine asked. She buttered toast and piled it on a platter.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her questions were a subtle way of telling him it might not be a good idea to take on too much just yet. After all this time, he was still as weak as one of Tim\u2019s newborn llamas. He was sick and tired of being sick and tired.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Tim pried. \u201cKentucky?\u201d</p><p>Jack was surprised he\u2019d been that readable. \u201cWhat if I am?\u201d</p><p>Tim and Francine sat next to each other, across the table from him. \u201cIs she there?\u201d Francine asked.</p><p>No one outside of Mexico knew about Lorraine\u2014and yet they all seemed to know. Jack couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><p>Both husband and wife waited for his response. \u201cI don\u2019t know where she is now, but I suspect it\u2019s Louisville,\u201d he said grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to find out,\u201d Tim announced with finality, as if this would be the romantic conclusion they\u2019d all been expecting.</p><p>While Jack hated to shatter their illusions, he thought he\u2019d better do so. \u201cI just want to make sure she\u2019s okay. That she doesn\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll talk to her, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Tim asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause then I\u2019d probably have to talk to her husband.\u201d</p><p>That shut the two of them up, Jack noticed. He should have set the record straight a lot sooner.</p><p>Jack flew out of Sea-Tac that morning and landed in Louisville four hours later. Luckily the airport hadn\u2019t sustained any damage. It took him forty-five minutes to secure a rental car and locate his hotel. Once he\u2019d checked into his room, he pulled open the nightstand drawer and found a Louisville telephone directory.</p><p>\u201cGary Franklin,\u201d he muttered as he opened the white pages to the Fs and ran his finger down the columns until he came to the listing. Only one G. Franklin. Lorraine had mentioned her husband\u2019s name just once, but it had stayed in Jack\u2019s mind. He\u2019d repeated it often, reminding himself that this was the man who loved her and waited for her at home.</p><p>Grabbing a pad and paper, Jack wrote down the address. He\u2019d been serious when he told Tim and Francine that he had no intention of speaking to Lorraine. None. But for his own peace of mind, he needed to know she was unhurt.</p><p>Exhausted from the long flight, Jack knew he would\u2019ve been well advised to wait until the following day before venturing into the city\u2019s neighborhoods. But he\u2019d never been a patient man, and the storm had heightened his anxiety. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He got the car keys and headed out. With a map of the city and the concierge\u2019s directions, he drove until he found the part of town where Lorraine lived. Then he saw a street sign that said Dogwood Lane.</p><p>Jack followed the house numbers until he came to the one he was looking for: 323. It appeared that the house, the entire neighborhood, had escaped the worst of the storm. He felt immediate relief. This was what he\u2019d come for; now he should drive directly past and be done with it.</p><p>Instead, he pulled over on the opposite side of the road and sat there with the engine idling.</p><p>The house was ordinary enough. One story, painted a pale shade of yellow. The structure itself was like thousands of others built shortly after the Second World War. The type that often sported a white picket fence...and a couple of kids playing out front.</p> <p>There was a convertible parked in the driveway, top down. He saw something yellow in the backseat. He strained to see what it was and remembered that yellow was Lorraine\u2019s favorite color.</p><p>A yellow baby blanket, tucked into an infant carrier.</p><p>Lorraine must have recently had a baby. A baby. Lorraine and Gary\u2019s. He closed his eyes and waited for the pain to subside into numbness. It was what he\u2019d wanted for her, what he\u2019d hoped would happen.</p><p>Swallowing tightly, Jack turned the key in the ignition. He had his answers, he told himself again. He\u2019d learned everything he needed to know. More than he\u2019d wanted to, actually. Now he could go back to his life without her ever realizing he\u2019d been there.</p><p>He\u2019d just eased the rental car back into the street when out of nowhere a baseball slammed into his windshield. The force of the impact shattered the glass.</p> <p>Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYou okay, mister?\u201d Two boys ran to the passenger window and peered inside at Jack.</p><p>\u201cI was until about two seconds ago,\u201d Jack said, somewhat dazed.</p><p>\u201cBrice?\u201d</p><p>The boy whirled around and looked over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who threw the ball,\u201d the second kid said. \u201cI\u2019m outta here.\u201d With that, Brice\u2019s pal took off running.</p> <p>Jack put the car in Park and climbed out to study the damage. A man approached from the same side of the street as Lorraine\u2019s house\u2014a businessman, if the dark suit he wore was any indication.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, directing the question to Brice.</p><p>The boy had difficulty meeting his father\u2019s eyes. \u201cTodd and I were just practicing and I decided to see how far I could throw with my left hand and...\u201d He paused, staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cThe baseball collided with my windshield,\u201d Jack completed for him. \u201cOther than the window, no harm\u2019s been done.\u201d He downplayed the damage. \u201cAccidents happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been one heck of a pitch,\u201d Brice\u2019s father said, examining the broken windshield on Jack\u2019s rental car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Brice said, his voice quavering.</p><p>The man placed his hands on Brice\u2019s shoulders and looked at Jack. \u201cNaturally we\u2019ll pay for all damages.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded, thinking it would probably be best to exchange information quickly, then leave. He didn\u2019t want to stick around in case Lorraine happened to come outside.</p> <p>\u201cWere you injured?\u201d the kid\u2019s dad asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. If you\u2019ll give me your insurance information, I\u2019ll take care of everything myself.\u201d</p><p>The man released his son\u2019s shoulders and gave him a reassuring pat on the back. \u201cGreat. And thanks for not yelling at the boy. It was an accident, but one that won\u2019t be repeated\u2014right, Brice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled at the obvious respect between father and son.</p><p>The father took out his wallet and removed his insurance card. \u201cGary Franklin,\u201d he said, and extended his hand.</p><p>Jack\u2019s head jerked up. Then, seeing the man\u2019s hand, he thrust his out and they shook. \u201cYou\u2019re Gary Franklin?\u201d he asked before he could stop himself. He wondered if he had the wrong man.</p><p>\u201cDo you know me?\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head.</p><p>Jack was spared any further need to explain when a woman approached with an infant held securely against her shoulder. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, looking sternly at her son. Her frown said she had a fair idea but wanted Brice to tell her himself.</p><p>\u201cMy baseball hit Mr.\u2014\u201d He paused, waiting for Jack to supply the name.</p><p>\u201cJack Keller,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t stop staring at the woman. The baby, too.</p><p>Judging by the intent expression on Gary\u2019s face, he must have noticed. \u201cThis is my wife, Marjorie,\u201d he said, and placed an arm lovingly around her shoulders. \u201cAnd our daughter, Alana.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s instantaneous surge of relief was difficult to explain. Even more difficult to understand. Clearly this wasn\u2019t the Gary Franklin who was married to Lorraine. The fact that this baby wasn\u2019t hers shouldn\u2019t be cause for a lighter heart. Jack had cut Lorraine free, sent her on her way to live a good life with the man she\u2019d loved enough to marry long before she\u2019d met him.</p><p>\u201cYou have a beautiful little girl,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHow old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight months,\u201d Marjorie answered. \u201cListen, there\u2019s no need to do all this in the middle of the street. Won\u2019t you come inside, Mr. Keller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Keller,\u201d Gary repeated his name slowly. \u201cI knew a man by that name. Unfortunately I never met him, but I heard enough about him to know I would\u2019ve liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough name,\u201d Jack said as they walked toward the house.</p><p>\u201cYou might say Jack Keller is a friend of a friend.\u201d Gary opened the screen door that led to the living room. The house was cluttered without looking messy. Evidence of the baby was everywhere. A rocking chair with a flannel sheet draped over the back. An infant swing situated next to the sofa. Toys scattered about. An empty baby bottle on the coffee table.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t intended to accept the family\u2019s invitation to come into their home. All he needed was the Franklins\u2019 insurance information. And yet... He felt oddly drawn to the young couple. Even though this Gary Franklin wasn\u2019t Lorraine\u2019s. Or maybe because of that.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see your name?\u201d Brice asked. At Jack\u2019s puzzled look, he moved toward the television set and lifted a photo from the cluster assembled there.</p><p>\u201cBrice,\u201d his mother said, stopping him, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Brice asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause that Jack Keller\u2019s...gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Brice set the framed snapshot back on the television.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Jack said, his curiosity aroused.</p><p>The boy reached for the photo and brought it over to him. But the picture wasn\u2019t what he expected. Far from it. It was so much of a shock, in fact, that he knew it would forever change the course of his life. The photograph wasn\u2019t of a man, as he\u2019d expected, but of a woman. Lorraine. Her beautiful face smiled back at him.</p><p>The sight was enough to wildly affect his heart rate. She stood in front of an adobe structure, a new building, between Antonio and Hector Dancy, her tanned arms around each boy. All three of them were grinning.</p><p>For an instant he almost didn\u2019t recognize her as the woman he\u2019d once known. She wore khaki shorts and a sleeveless blouse. Her hair was short. And her eyes...they reflected happiness and\u2014he could sense it\u2014pain. He wondered if she\u2019d walked through the same valley he had these past eighteen months. Had she found a shaky sense of peace, as he had? If so, he suspected it hadn\u2019t come easy.</p><p>Neither had his own.</p><p>All he\u2019d had to sustain him these long months had been his memories. He didn\u2019t have her picture, nor did he have the luxury of some memento from their time together. But none was necessary, or so he\u2019d believed. Then again...</p><p>Apparently he didn\u2019t know as much about her as he\u2019d thought.</p><p>When he managed to drag his eyes away from Lorraine and the boys, he received yet another shock. A wooden sign hung over the doorway. He had to squint to read it: The Jack Keller Memorial Health Clinic, in English and in Spanish.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Gary asked.</p><p>Jack lifted his gaze from the photo and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I feel,\u201d Jack didn\u2019t mind telling him. \u201cIt appears we have more to discuss than I realized.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine had lived in El Mirador six months now, and it felt as though she\u2019d been part of the community all her life. Her Spanish was still rudimentary, but she was working on it. Antonio and Hector took great pride in teaching her new words, and she, in turn, practiced English with them.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d announced her intention of building a medical clinic in Jack\u2019s memory, she had more offers of help from the people of El Mirador than she knew what to do with. The clinic, with living quarters for her, was constructed in record time.</p><p>The building itself was only the start. Her friends at Group Wellness back in Louisville had raised more than $25,000 for medicine, and Med-X had donated medical supplies, with a commitment for the following year, as well.</p><p>Lorraine\u2019s last hurdle before moving into Jack\u2019s clinic was her certification to practice medicine in Mexico. With her father\u2019s help\u2014he filled out the forms\u2014and assistance from a government grateful for her efforts in returning the Kukulcan Star, Lorraine was ready to open her doors to the public in less than two months.</p><p>The first day she\u2019d been shocked by the number of patients waiting outside the clinic. The line had stretched out the door and down the narrow walkway.</p><p>At the end of her first week Lorraine knew this was exactly the right thing to do. Before, everything in her life had felt pointless. Unnecessary. In El Mirador her medical skills were badly needed. Knowing she was helping others also helped her; she had learned to accept both her past and her future. Teaching here had done the same thing for her father.</p><p>For the first time since losing Jack, Lorraine slept through an entire night. A whole day sometimes passed without her thinking of him. And when he did drift into her mind, she wasn\u2019t overwhelmed by blinding grief. She sensed with certainty that he would have approved of her returning to El Mirador and doing this work.</p><p>Sometimes, especially at the end of a long day, she\u2019d sit back, put her feet up and wish he could somehow see her. How different she was from that self-righteous, prudish woman he\u2019d first met. She\u2019d changed so much since then, but she hadn\u2019t understood the full extent of her transformation until recently.</p><p>All her life, her mother had insisted that life was full of compensations. When one door shuts, another opens was how she used to put it. Lorraine hadn\u2019t given the matter much thought until she realized how much she\u2019d come to love her three half brothers.</p><p>Jack was lost, but her heart was full again. Antonio, Hector and Alberto returned her love in full measure. The older two usually stopped by to spend time with her late in the afternoons. More often than not, they dragged her home with them for dinner. Two or three nights a week, she joined her father and Azucena for meals. The more she came to know Thomas, the more she loved and respected him. Again and again she wished she\u2019d known him sooner, and she still struggled not to blame her mother for the long years of separation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her relationship with Azucena, too, had grown into one of affection and mutual assistance.</p><p>Alberto, her youngest half brother, had made a full recovery. The chubby toddler was her greatest joy. His round happy face lit up with delight when he saw her. He would dash cheerfully to her side, knowing she\u2019d lift him high in the air, and his infectious laughter would echo through the house.</p><p>In some ways it was as if these cherished little ones were Lorraine\u2019s own children. The family she would never have with Jack. He\u2019d shown her how much love her heart could hold, and now that love spilled over, embracing her young brothers.</p><p>In the stillness of late afternoon Lorraine sat at her desk and finished up the last of her paperwork. The door opened, and half expecting Antonio and Hector, she set her pen aside.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in the office,\u201d she called out in Spanish.</p><p>When no one answered, Lorraine got up and walked to the door. She kept regular hours, but didn\u2019t hesitate to see a patient after closing time. She stepped into the waiting area and saw a man framed in sunlight, standing just inside the clinic door. But this wasn\u2019t a man\u2014it was a ghost.</p><p>The ghost of Jack Keller.</p><p>One so real, so lifelike, it was all she could do to keep from running into his arms. Reaching for a chair, she clenched her fingers over the top to anchor herself. All the while she greedily drank in the sight of him.</p><p>Dear heaven, he seemed so real!</p> <p>Her heart pounded wildly. Fear coursed through her, although she believed this particular ghost would never hurt her. Her concern was for her sanity. She was afraid that somehow, some way, her mind had slipped. That loving Jack with such intensity had pushed her beyond reason.</p><p>Or perhaps she\u2019d been working too hard, she thought in those first shock-filled seconds. Spending too many hours at the clinic. Not taking enough time for herself.</p><p>Could Jack be real? Could he possibly be alive? Had God and the universe made some horrible mistake? Had Jack been sent back to her to make it right?</p><p>She yearned to say his name, to call out to him. To bring this dream to life. And yet she feared that if she spoke he might disappear.</p><p>Not yet. Please not yet. Let me have him for a few minutes more. But finally she couldn\u2019t bear not knowing any longer.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d His name trembled on her lips.</p> <p>His features relaxed and his eyes softened as he walked toward her. With exquisite tenderness he pressed his palm to her cheek. His hand felt warm and solid, and for an instant Lorraine thought she might faint.</p><p>Needing to hold on to him, she covered his hand with her own and urged his palm toward her lips, where she planted a single kiss.</p><p>\u201cOh, Raine.\u201d He caught her by the shoulders and his mouth swept down on hers as though waiting another moment was more than could be asked of him.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed of this so often, it was difficult to know if it could actually be happening. If this was a dream, she didn\u2019t intend on waking anytime soon.</p><p>She wound her arms around his neck and, leaning into him, kissed him back. Hunger and urgency, love and need. They blended until coherent thought escaped her. She and Jack strained against each other, mouths seeking, their passion fierce. She buried her fingers deep in his hair and held tight, almost as if that might prevent him from leaving her again.</p><p>\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she whispered, desperate for answers. \u201cTell me, please. Is this really happening?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his face from hers and closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s real, Raine, it\u2019s real. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>Sobbing, choking, hardly able to breathe, she clung to him, her hands digging into his shoulders. It wasn\u2019t possible. Dr. Berilo had told her Jack was dead. He\u2019d sat with her, comforted her. Jack\u2019s presence here, now, was beyond comprehension.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jack repeated between kisses. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry,\u201d he whispered again and again.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she pleaded, needing answers and yet fearing them, too. Still, her desire for the truth overcame her fears. \u201cTell me,\u201d she demanded. \u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>He found a chair, then sat her down and kneeled in front of her. He looked into her eyes for a long moment before cradling her face with his hands.</p><p>\u201cJack, please. Tell me!\u201d</p><p>An eternity came and went before he spoke. \u201cI thought you were married.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t explain why Dr. Berilo had told her Jack was dead.</p><p>\u201cYou loved me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>She felt lost in a fog, not understanding where she\u2019d taken the wrong turn, how this could have happened. Love should have brought them together, not driven them apart. Love was meant to be a bond.</p><p>\u201cAnd I loved you enough to convince Dr. Berilo to tell you I\u2019d died.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes to keep the room from spinning out of control.</p><p>\u201cI loved you enough to keep from ruining your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved,\u201d she said. \u201cPast tense?\u201d She didn\u2019t know who to blame\u2014herself for the initial lie or Jack for being so noble.</p><p>His answer was to draw her toward him for another kiss. \u201cPast, present, future and every tense in between. I had to prevent you from making the biggest mistake of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not married!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that at the time.\u201d</p><p>And it was her fault for not telling him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou wore a wedding band, so I assumed, reasonably enough, that you were married.\u201d</p><p>And when he\u2019d asked her for the name of her husband, she\u2019d given him Gary\u2019s. It hit her then, the gravity of what she\u2019d done. Because of her one small lie, they\u2019d wasted eighteen months of their lives. His own lie had robbed them, too, but Lorraine accepted full responsibility. The blame was hers.</p><p>The sobs began, welling up from deep within her. She wept as if she would never stop, as if regret and sorrow had overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he murmured, pulling her close.</p><p>She came into his arms and he wiped away her tears. She grew quiet, exhausted from crying, and then passion flared between them again, the way it had that day in Mexico City. By the time the kissing ended, neither could speak.</p><p>They held on to each other for a long time, until Jack finally said, \u201cAbout this business of having a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we can arrange it, that part will be true.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Lorraine read the text a second time, trying to clear her thoughts. Concentrating on her studies was difficult because she was so anxious for Jack\u2019s return. The wonderful news about the baby bubbled up inside her and spilled out in giggles every few minutes. She couldn\u2019t help it\u2014but she really did need to study for an important chemistry exam the following day.</p><p>True to his word, Jack had her at the altar less than a week after his arrival in El Mirador. Father Garcia had performed the ceremony. Thomas and Azucena stood up for them and the entire town of El Mirador had celebrated. Even now, nearly two years later, Lorraine had trouble taking it all in. Most of the people in the small waterfront village were very poor, but they had an abundance of love and generosity. Lorraine\u2019s wedding to Jack was the perfect opportunity for them to show her how much they appreciated the clinic.</p><p>Table upon table of food had been set up in the town square, and small homemade gifts were lovingly offered to her and Jack. The wedding celebration had gone late into the evening and Jack had been forced to steal her away, to the cheers and laughter of the entire town.</p><p>Their honeymoon was incredible. Lorraine\u2019s heart smiled each time she remembered what had proved to be the most marvelous week of her life. Jack had docked a newly purchased cabin cruiser near a small uninhabited island off the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, not far from El Mirador. They\u2019d spent their days swimming and snorkeling, exploring the colorful coral reef, and their nights...their nights had been spent exploring each other.</p><p>That she could actually be in Jack\u2019s arms and love him this completely\u2014it was a gift she\u2019d never expected to receive. In those early days their lovemaking had been frantic, as if they feared that being together couldn\u2019t last. He held her close afterward and they clung to each other. Almost always she\u2019d weep in his arms in sheer wonder and joy. Jack seemed to understand her need to cry following their lovemaking. She cried for all the long lonely months they\u2019d wasted. For the miracle of being together now.</p><p>In the weeks after their honeymoon they had long talks about the future. Increasingly Lorraine had become aware that what El Mirador and the surrounding villages needed was a fully qualified physician. Jack had encouraged her to reapply for medical school, to finish the education she\u2019d cut short.</p><p>It was Gary Franklin who\u2019d told her about a retiring general practitioner who was looking for volunteer work. He\u2019d been considering the Peace Corps. Lorraine wrote him and told him about the clinic\u2014now renamed The Virginia Dancy Medical Center\u2014and he\u2019d come down with his wife for a two-week visit. Lorraine knew the moment she met Dr. Samuel Wetmore that he\u2019d be a perfect choice to replace her while she earned her credentials. After taking a crash course in Spanish, he\u2019d traveled to El Mirador and worked with her until Lorraine received word that she\u2019d been accepted into her third year of medical school at the University of Kentucky.</p><p>She and Jack had been living in Lexington during that time, with frequent visits to El Mirador. Now her schooling was almost over\u2014and she was pregnant. The baby shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to either of them, but Lorraine had been stunned at the news. Her shock had soon turned into the purest joy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she could possibly concentrate when all she wanted to do was dance around the apartment.</p><p>Lorraine heard the door open and knew Jack was home at last.</p><p>He\u2019d barely made it over the threshold when she flew out of the study and hurled herself into his arms. Before he could ask, she had him pinned against the door and involved in a series of deep hungry kisses.</p><p>They were both breathing hard by the time she finished.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this greeting?\u201d he asked, cocking one eyebrow. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, mind you.\u201d</p><p>Lorraine kissed the underside of his jaw. \u201cBecause you\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd virile,\u201d she added, and started to unbutton his shirt. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd potent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s been said.\u201d He paused suddenly in the task of unbuttoning her blouse. His gaze met hers, and he frowned. \u201cExactly what do you mean by potent?\u201d</p><p>Lorraine led him into the bedroom. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him a chance to respond. Instead, she kissed him and undressed him at the same time. His own hands were busy removing her clothes.</p><p>Soon they were on the bed, their mouths greedily seeking and finding each other, their bodies on fire with need. She opened herself to him\u2014her heart, her future, all her being\u2014and sighed with immense satisfaction as he slowly linked their bodies. Although he\u2019d been brutally injured in the fall from the cliff, the muscles of his back and shoulders remained firm and hard. Her fingertips roamed his skin, and she traced his scars, each one a badge of courage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afterward Jack held her close and whispered into her ear, \u201cYou\u2019d better explain what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you still haven\u2019t guessed?\u201d She smiled at him mysteriously.</p><p>\u201cLorraine?\u201d He paused and swallowed hard. \u201cCould you be...is there any possibility you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Oh, Jack, isn\u2019t it fantastic?\u201d</p> <p>He went very still. Raising her head, she smiled up at him again, this time with unconcealed delight. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you hadn\u2019t guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t guessed.\u201d His voice sounded odd, raspy and shaken.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, I\u2019m so happy about it.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in the curve of her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d His kiss was filled with tenderness. \u201cWhat about finishing school, working at the clinic? We hadn\u2019t planned on a baby this soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the best things in life are unplanned.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed outright. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it all figured out,\u201d she told him, snuggling close to his side.</p><p>\u201cI want you to finish school.\u201d He pressed his hand against her flat stomach as if to welcome the child growing inside her.</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise. And I\u2019m looking forward to my residency\u2014and then working at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on that. When we move back to El Mirador, Azucena will watch the baby during the day. I know Dr. Wetmore will stay on another couple of years to run the clinic\u2014and you can start that boat-building company you\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d</p> <p>Jack chuckled. \u201cYou do have this all figured out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few other plans, but we don\u2019t need to discuss them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d He laughed and kissed the top of her head. \u201cI swear, marriage to you is about as much adventure as a man can take.\u201d</p><p>Coming from an ex-mercenary, that was quite a compliment.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>2011</p><p>\u201cHey, Raine, we\u2019ve got company,\u201d Jack said, walking into The Virginia Dancy Medical Center one afternoon in late January.</p><p>Lorraine, who generally went by Raine these days, sat at her desk, exhausted after a long day of seeing patients. It seemed that between the two of them, Dr. Sam Wetmore and Raine still couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand. A third doctor would soon be joining them, a Canadian who was a good friend of Sam\u2019s. Dr. Larson wanted to be of service following his own retirement and after briefly visiting the clinic, had volunteered.</p> <p>\u201cCompany?\u201d Lorraine repeated. \u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can feed four extra people at dinner, can\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour extra? Dinner?\u201d She must sound as if she was in a daze, Raine thought. It was always like that during the first few months of pregnancy. This third baby was a surprise. So for that matter was Jackie, their first. And Tommy, born two years after his sister. Raine was a little shocked that someone as organized and in control as she was could be so sloppy when it came to birth control. She hadn\u2019t told Jack about the pregnancy yet....</p><p>As it turned out, he wasn\u2019t very good at being an expectant father. He fretted and worried, convinced that every ache or pain she experienced meant she was in mortal danger. If she\u2019d ever doubted Jack Keller loved her, all she had to do was remember the two times she\u2019d gone into labor. Seeing her in that kind of pain had nearly killed him. Twice while delivering Jackie, Raine had heard Jack swear he was never going to make love to her again if this was the result. It went without saying that she was able to persuade him otherwise, although at the time he\u2019d sworn that their love life was over.</p><p>\u201cMurphy and Letty are here,\u201d her husband told her.</p><p>Raine nearly leaped up from the desk. \u201cNow? Today?\u201d</p><p>Even before Jack could respond, Letty entered the clinic. The two women immediately ran into each other\u2019s arms and hugged fiercely.</p><p>\u201cLetty, my goodness, look at you!\u201d It\u2019d been more than a year since she\u2019d last seen Murphy\u2019s wife. \u201cAre the kids with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke and Rose are at your dad\u2019s with Hector and Alberto.\u201d The four preteens were like Velcro whenever they got together. Luke was excellent with languages, the way his namesake, Letty\u2019s twin brother, had been. He\u2019d already started to learn Spanish. And although he\u2019d never had the opportunity to meet his uncle, Raine could tell from the pictures she\u2019d seen that there was a striking resemblance. Rose, their daughter, was a lot like Letty. Gentle, shyly charming, a true nurturer, the eleven-year-old possessed an incredible green thumb. She liked nothing better than gardening and had astonishing success with planting just about anything\u2014flowers, vegetables, herbs...</p><p>\u201cJackie and Tommy will be so excited to see them.\u201d Their children thought the sun rose and set on Letty and Murphy\u2019s two.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dr. Keller,\u201d Letty said, leading Raine out of the clinic, one arm around her friend\u2019s waist. \u201cGood news! You\u2019ll never guess who we talked into joining us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCain and Linette!\u201d</p><p>This was going to be a real, honest-to-goodness reunion of the Deliverance Company. Raine couldn\u2019t remember the last occasion when the three men were in the same place at the same time. Four years ago? Five? She needed to think about it. Okay...Tommy was three, so it would\u2019ve been four years ago.</p><p>\u201cMurphy told me Cain and Linette plan to arrive tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Raine wanted to shake her head in exasperation. If Jack knew about this beforehand and hadn\u2019t told her, she\u2019d let him know what she thought of that. Some secrets should be kept, but others\u2014like this one\u2014were best shared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to shoot Jack,\u201d Raine muttered. \u201cHe might have mentioned this a bit earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you already did shoot him,\u201d Letty teased.</p><p>\u201cTo be perfectly accurate, that wasn\u2019t me. Although there were a few times when we first met that I gladly would\u2019ve done it myself.\u201d</p><p>Letty wore a look that said she understood all too well. \u201cI know the feeling.\u201d They continued toward the house at a leisurely pace. \u201cI\u2019m not sure but I think I overheard Murphy tell Cain that Francine and Tim are hoping to come, too.\u201d</p><p>Raine had only met the other couple once. Francine and Tim had six children and lived on an island in Puget Sound, where they raised llamas. So for them, planning time away was difficult. A visit from them would be a rare and special treat. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jack asked, coming into the house with Murphy, hauling suitcases and backpacks.</p><p>\u201cFrancine and Tim might be joining us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jack looked to Murphy for confirmation.</p><p>Murphy laughed. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought Tim would end up with six kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you with two,\u201d Jack returned.</p><p>\u201cOr you with three,\u201d Raine inserted.</p><p>\u201cFunny one, Raine,\u201d Jack said, as he handed Murphy a cold beer. \u201cWe have two children and we agreed that\u2019s it. Our family\u2019s complete and\u2014\u201d Suddenly he paused. \u201cUnless you\u2019re telling me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d He set the beer on the counter and walked over to where she stood. Taking her by the shoulders, he studied her through narrowed eyes. \u201cRaine?\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him ever so sweetly.</p><p>\u201cRaine?\u201d he repeated. \u201cAre you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>All he seemed capable of doing was nodding. \u201cExpecting? Encinta? With child?\u201d she went on.</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cIt appears so,\u201d she said with a light shrug.</p><p>Jack sank into a chair and pushed the hair roughly away from his forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what causes the condition if you haven\u2019t figured it out,\u201d Murphy joked.</p><p>\u201cI know, too,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to keep my hands off my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s your trouble,\u201d Murphy said, completely deadpan. \u201cIt\u2019s not your hands that are the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA third baby,\u201d Jack murmured, ignoring the joke. \u201cThing is, I\u2019ve always been partial to round numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lend you one of mine,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling you and Raine are going to end up being another Francine and Tim.\u201d Murphy downed a swallow of his beer. \u201cIt just might take you a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced up at Raine and grinned sheepishly. \u201cYou did say I was a potent son of a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe those were exactly the words I used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but there are children outside with big ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve trained him well,\u201d Letty whispered. \u201cRose makes her father pay her a quarter every time he uses a swearword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already paid for her college education,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>Everyone laughed. Jack stood and slipped an arm around Raine\u2019s waist. \u201cI think I knew,\u201d he told her in a low voice. He kissed the side of her neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve been more tired than usual lately.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we\u2019ll have a third doctor. Getting you to slow down is nearly impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy about this baby, Jack. I hope you are, too.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held hers and she read the answer in their depths. No, life didn\u2019t always go as planned. Yes, it was often filled with surprises\u2014some big and some small\u2014but she didn\u2019t want to miss a single one of them, especially if Jack Keller was at her side. </p> </body></html>"]
