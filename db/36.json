Seriously. He\u2019s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. But he\u2019s got his reasons. His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn\u2019t understand why. What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn\u2019t work. His dad couldn\u2019t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn\u2019t keep up the impossible perfect fa\u00e7ade. So he slipped far, far from it. Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn\u2019t want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isn\u2019t there, then it isn\u2019t, right? Wrong. And it\u2019s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesn\u2019t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he\u2019s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe.
