When the magic is up, rogue mages cast their spells and monsters appear, while guns refuse to fire and cars fail to start. But then technology returns, and the magic recedes as unpredictably as it arose. Kate Daniels works for the Order of Knights of Merciful Aid, officially as a liaison with the mercenary guild. Unofficially, she cleans up the paranormal problems no one else wants to handle - especially if they involve Atlanta's shapeshifting community. When she's called in to investigate a fight at the Steel Horse, a bar on the border between the territories of the shapeshifters and the necromancers, Kate quickly discovers that there's a new player in town. One who's been around for thousands of years - and who rode to war at the side of Kate's father. This foe may be too much even for Kate and Curran, the Beast Lord, to handle. Because this time Kate will be taking on family.", "hash": "505bfc9f-e61c-4f94-b0d7-765b05cbbf65"}, {"title": "Magic Slays (Kate Daniels #5)", "author": "Ilona Andrews", "pgs": 25, "sum": "Storyline: \nMagic Slays (Kate Daniels #5) Plagued by a war between magic and technology, Atlanta has never been so deadly.
