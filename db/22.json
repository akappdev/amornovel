Unfortunately, his baseball coach isn\u2019t buying it. Cage has a free ride to the local junior college for baseball -- or he did, until he\u2019d gotten a DUI. Now, Cage has to decide: does he drop out and give up his dream of getting noticed by a college in the SEC, and possibly making it into the Major Leagues -- or does he give in to his coach\u2019s demands and spend his summer baling hay? Eva Brooks planned out her life step by step when she was eight years old. Not once over the years had she lost sight of her goals. Josh Beasley, her next door neighbor, had been the center of those goals. He\u2019d been her first boyfriend at seven, her first kiss at ten, her first date at fifteen, and her first tragedy at eighteen. The moment she\u2019d received the phone call from Josh\u2019s mother saying he\u2019d been killed along with four other soldiers just north of Baghdad, Eva\u2019s carefully planned life imploded in the worst way possible.
