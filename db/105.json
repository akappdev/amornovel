But her love life has been a little lacking lately. That's when fate steps in, and she crashes into a tall, dark and handsome man\u2014Teren Adams. He\u2019s single, successful, an extraordinary gentleman, but he\u2019s also secretive. And some of his secrets are more unusual than most people\u2019s. For instance, he\u2019s a \u201clittle bit\u201d vampire. He has fangs, incredible hearing, unbelievable speed, and, on occasion, he enjoys drinking a steaming cup of blood. But he\u2019s also very much alive. He has a heartbeat, loves steak as well as cappuccinos, and has no problems walking around during the day. Since Teren acts human the majority of the time, the pros far outweigh the cons in Emma\u2019s book. But when it becomes apparent that Teren\u2019s condition is much more serious than he first lets on, and that being in a relationship with him requires more sacrifices than most would be willing to make, will Emma stay? Is love enough to compensate for a life that will never be anywhere near normal?

The next thing I knew, the doorway to hell had opened and out stepped Daimons- soul-sucking vampires the likes of which I\u2019d never seen before. Led by the son of Apollo, they are out to end the curse that has banished them all to darkness.

She's sassy, sexy, and completely unwilling to take him seriously. (Not to mention that she's the twin sister of the wife of former Dark-Hunter Kyrian-Val's mortal enemy.)
