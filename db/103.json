But it's not as if Betsy's next few hundred years will be perfect. After all, her half sister, Laura, is the Antichrist. Laura's mother is Satan, and family gatherings will always be more than a little awkward. What's really bothering Betsy is that ever since she and Laura returned from visiting her mom in hell, Laura's been acting increasingly peculiar. Maybe it's Laura's new job offer': Satan's replacement down under. Unfortunately, the position comes at a damnable price: killing Betsy, her own flesh and blood. Over Betsy's dead body. And for that matter, Marc's, too, since he's not quite as buried as everyone thought. Now a war has been waged - one that's going to take a sibling rivalry to a whole new level and a dimension where only one sister can survive.", "hash": "e8fbed8b-4c92-495d-a8fb-d7428bd1a4b1"}, {"title": "Undead and Unsure (Undead #12)", "author": "MaryJanice Davidson", "pgs": 35, "sum": "Storyline: \nUndead and Unsure (Undead #12) It\u2019s no surprise to Betsy that her trip to Hell with her sister Laura landed them in hot water. Betsy isn\u2019t exactly sorry she killed the Devil but it\u2019s put Laura in a damnable position: assuming the role of Satan (she may not have the training but she looks great in red)\u2014and in charge of billions of souls as she moves up in the world. Or is that down? But Betsy herself is in an odd new position as well\u2014that of being a responsible monarch suddenly in charge of all things more earth-bound: like her vampire husband Sinclair who has gone from relieved to ecstatic to downright reckless now that he can tolerate sunlight. And if Sinclair isn\u2019t enough to contend with, Betsy\u2019s best friend Jessica is in her sixth (and hopefully last) trimester. Considering she\u2019s been pregnant for eighteen months, she\u2019s become a veritable encyclopedia of what not to expect when you\u2019re expecting. Oh, the horror\u2026 And speaking of growing pains, Betsy and Sinclair\u2019s adopted little BabyJon is finally starting to walk.
