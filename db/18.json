The prime suspect is a young ex-employee named Anson Butler, who disappeared right after the fire. So Seth and I are trying to sort out our lives.

In the meantime, life goes on for everyone else in Cedar Cove --- with marriages, births, reunions and even the occasional scandal. One of the most interesting pieces of news is that Cal, who works on Cliff Harding's ranch, is now rescuing wild mustangs from Wyoming.

I'm also worried because some jewelry was recently stolen from an old woman --- and Dave used to visit her a lot. You see, he's a pastor. And a good man. I can't believe he's guilty of anything, but why won't he tell me where he's been when he comes home so late? Reader, I'd love to hear what you think.

He was hoping to marry his onetime girlfriend, Faith Beckwith, who recently moved back to town. Well, the latest is that Faith ended the relationship last month, even though both of them are widowed and available. According to Troy, there were a few misunderstandings between them?some inadvertently caused, it seems, by his daughter, Megan. Troy's got plenty to keep him occupied, though?like the unidentified remains found in a cave outside town. And the break-ins at 204 Rosewood Lane, the house Faith just happens to be renting from Grace Harding?. All of that's a distraction from what's happening in my life. I'm going through chemo right now, and I'm so grateful for my husband, Jack, my family and my friends, who give me the strength and support I need to beat this. But beat it I will!
