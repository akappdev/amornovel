Long married, a mother and a teacher, she \"should\" be happy. But she feels there's something missing in her life. Not only that, she's balancing the demands of an aging mother and a temperamental twenty-year-old daughter. Her mother, Vivian, a recent widow, is having difficulty coping and living alone, so Susannah goes home to Colville, Washington. In returning to her parents' house, her girlhood friends and the garden she's always loved, she also returns to the past--and the choices she made back then.

To her dismay, he's suddenly begun placing weekly orders for flower arrangements! Susannah and Colette both join Lydia Goetz's new knitting class. Lydia's previous classes have forged lasting friendships, and this one is no exception. But Lydia and her sister, Margaret, have worries of their own. Margaret's daughter, Julia, has been the victim of a random carjacking, and the entire family is thrown into emotional chaos. Then there's Alix Townsend. Her wedding to Jordan Turner is only months away--but she's not sure she can go through with it. Her love for Jordan isn't in question; what she can't handle is the whole wedding extravaganza engineered by her mentor, Jacqueline, with the enthusiastic cooperation of her future mother-in-law. A reception at the country club and hundreds of guests she's never even met--it's just not Alix. Like everyone else in Lydia's knitting class, Alix knows there's a solution to every problem...and that another woman can usually help you find it!", "hash": "6746376d-6801-475f-8816-1b97d1285d70"}, {"title": "Twenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5)", "author": "Debbie Macomber", "pgs": 50, "sum": "Storyline: \nTwenty Wishes (Blossom Street #5) What do you want most in the world?

It's for people who want to quit something--or someone!--and start a new phase of their lives.First to join is Phoebe Rylander. She recently ended her engagement to a man who doesn't know the meaning of \"faithful, \" and she's trying to get over him. Then there's Alix Turner. She and her husband, Jordan, want a baby, which means she \"has\" to quit smoking. And Bryan Hutchinson joins the class because he needs a way to deal with the stress of running his family's business--not to mention the lawsuit brought against him by an unscrupulous lawyer. Life can be as complicated as a knitting pattern. Just ask Anne Marie Roche. She and her adopted daughter, Ellen, finally have the happiness they wished for. And then a stranger comes to her bookstore asking questions. Or ask Lydia herself.
